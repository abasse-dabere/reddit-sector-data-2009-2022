CryptoCurrency,"Solana, Cardano, Polkadot, Harmony, other chains will continue to pump until eth 2.0","***not financial advice*** 

Theres just no way they don‚Äôt. Even with gas fees being absolutely ridiculous, eth activity is still so high and many many people are discovering the network. 

Eth is being burned AT MASSIVE RATES eth is being locked in staking AT MASSIVE RATES. As more and more people find out about ethereum, DeFi, NFTs, other use cases, more experienced people in eth will get fed up and continue to temporarily buy NFTs on other chains. It‚Äôs a spillover effect. It doesn‚Äôt even necessarily have to effect ethereums price, people will always initially join the legacy chain IMO before aping into sol and Ada and doing DeFi there. You kinda need to dabble with eth first to find out wtf this whole space is all about. 


The longer activity on ETH stays like this, the more the spillover happens. Regardless of eth pumping or not, expect other blockchains to thrive as communities are built and networks effects surprise markets. After personally using Solana, Polkadot and Cardano networks for transactions, I can (obviously) say I would rather pay these types of fees. Many will migrate back to eth after 2.0 when sharding gets implementedz So when eth 2.0 happens there may be a crash for these ecosystems temporarily, but I don‚Äôt expect them to die out.

CryptoCurrency,"Scenario: You're a Moon Farmer and you're talking to your girlfriend's Southern Protestant father, who works for the IRS","You are having the time of your life with your girlfriend who loves you as much as you love her. You decided that, eventually, you're going to propose to her, but you want to be respectful and meet her parents to give them a good impression of yourself. You and your girlfriend then visit her parents' home and meet her father, wielding a hunting rifle, who immediately got a bad first impression of you upon seeing your ""HODL"" shirt with a faded Bitcoin logo on the background. You enter the house and see walls full of heads of trophy animals, indicating that he's a decorated hunter. He lets the both of you in, sits you next to him, and he then turns his attention to his daughter.

""What the sumbitch do?"" He asks, before looking at you like as of you pissed on the crucifix.

Even she couldn't explain what you do, so you clear your throat like an urban elitist and you start talking: ""Well, sir, I'm a Moon Farmer""

He looks at you confused ""Moon Farmer? When did NASA start sending farmers to the moon?""

""No sir, here's how it's really done. It's relatively easy work. All I do is post random articles and shitposts in this community website called Reddit, and if the users like what I post, they upvote it, and this adds to my karma. This, in turn, earns me a cryptocurrency called Moons. You know that they say: 'It ain't much, but it's honest work'""

He then cracks a smile, laughs, taps you on the shoulder, lowers his rifle, and says ""Son, that's some interesting information. I don't understand a humdinger what you do, but you're alright.""

After further conversations, you leave the house feeling good about yourself.

Next day, you're about to go pick up your girlfriend, but you encounter the Feds once you step outside the door. They arrest you for tax evasion and put you away.

Your girlfriend's dad, an IRS agent, is watching all that on TV, laughing his ass off while looking at all the Moons that he confiscated from you along with his paycheck with increased pay as a reward for putting you away.",cryptocurrency

For context, I am 19 and my significant other is 21, I have no credit built yet at all and same for my partner

Now for the backstory: I have been in a tricky living situation since may, due to my old apartments sewage backing up, among other problems like mold and flooding, and even being electrocuted by the against code oven. So 3 months in a less than ideal living arrangement and I've just becoming jaded everytime I check the internet for any vacant rentals to have my own space. This morning I saw one that was decently in my budget rentwise, 1,400$ √∑ 4 roomies = 350$ per person, which for better or for worse isnt a bad rate for a roughly 1000 sq ft 2 bedroom 2 bath. So, I sent a message just to see if it was still available, and to my surprise, I got a message back saying it was! Very rare occurence already, so I reply for a showing. Flash forward to 15 minutes after I get off work, I get a call to go view the apartment. The location is just right, the landlord was lax and understanding of my pet situation, and recently remodeled and updated. Its quite literally everything I have tried to speak into existence, manifest, everything. 

The kicker: I'm fucking broke y'all 

I paid this man 300$ dollars today to put a hold on the apartment; roughly 40$ leftover afterward. It was all I had on hand.

Now, I have to produce ROUGHLY 3600$ before Friday. This is where I ask for your advice. 
How do loans work? Personal loans? Should I go through a credit union or my bank I've been with since I was 5 years old? I quite literally need a miracle right now. I make around 1400 a month, s/o making around 2800 a month. Will I even be accepted for a loan? Does it count as equal housing if the loan is simply for a security deposit? What interest rate should I look for or avoid? 

Please any help is appreciated",finance
CryptoCurrency,A good and simple explanation/analogy to help understand how layer 2 solutions work,"You go to a popular cafe chain and order a cup of coffee. You pay with your Visa card. In that same hour or day, thousands of people may get a cup of coffee anywhere in the world from the same cafe chain. Settling each of these numerous microtransactions would clog the network within minutes. Therefore, Visa groups them into blocks or batches and settles them through the banking system in regular intervals, such as once a week or even once a month.

The banks then settle who owes what to whom through the so-called settlement layer, an interbanking system of obligations. Can you recall so-called Clearinghouses? That‚Äôs what they do. An example would be the United States of America‚Äôs Fedwire.

A similar analogy applies here. The Lightning network is a protocol that would serve as the transaction layer. Millions of smaller transactions would be bundled together and then settled at once on the settlement layer ‚Äì the Bitcoin network. Therefore, the Lightning network (LAYER 2) is Visa and the base (Bitcoin) layer is Fedwire (LAYER 1).",cryptocurrency

36. Cardano‚Äôs closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it‚Äôs EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We‚Äôll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano‚Äôs deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

Because of this they really aren't great options for day-to-day transactions. In light of that and the incredible interest rates on stable coins right now I was curious if there are any cards out there that deal in stablecoins. I'm no whale, but it would be awesome if whenever I took profits I could just send the USDC or whatever other stablecoin to a wallet that is connected to some kind of smart contract that automatically pays off my card balance every month while also earning a real interest rate.

CryptoCurrency,"While everyone loves staking, you still have to be careful and manage risk","I've been seeing lots of posts talking about staking recently, and it's definitely great for earning more crypto and interest. But remember to not put all your eggs into one basket. With rewards, there is always risk.

For example, I'm staking some ETH on Coinbase, I put some money into Blockfi and Celsius to earn interest, and I'm also using Compound to get some interest on my stablecoins.

But the value of everything that is in defi / staked is probably only about 10-15% of my total crypto holdings. Everything else is off-exchange on the blockchain, and only I have the keys. Remember, not your keys, not your coins. 

Why? Let's take a look:

**Blockfi** - centralized company. Sure they have the Winklevoss twins backing them, and they've raised a ton of money. But you're still entrusting them with your money to earn interest. They could go bankrupt at any time, and with that, your money is gone. You'd have to earn about 10+ years of interest with them just to make your principal back. Add in the fact that many states in the US currently have injunctions against Blockfi, and I think this is the riskiest out of the 4.

**Celsius** - same thing as Blockfi. Centralized company that you are entrusting with your coins. They can do a rugpull at any time and you'd be shit out of luck with your money. Slightly less risky than Blockfi. 

**Coinbase** - centralized company - same as the above two. The only difference is that Coinbase recently IPO-ed and is now a public company, so they won't (hopefully) go bankrupt any time soon. There is the added comfort that they are audited by a Big 4 accounting firm, and the founders have legal risk, especially being in the US. I don't think they'll run off with your money, but there have been financial scandals with public companies (think Enron and Worldcom from back in the early 2000s). However, I would rate Coinbase the lowest risk centralized option for staking / earning interest (even compared to Binance / Kraken). 

**Compound** - Defi - Personally I think Compound has the lowest risk out of these 4, since everything is done through the blockchain. The code has been audited and is open source, so there are unlikely any backdoors or malicious code to steal money. But Compound's interest rates are the lowest out of the 4. But as I mentioned, rewards are proportional to the risk. Compound, along with other open source Defi projects are the lowest risk for earning interest.

Finally, it's great to earn interest. It's a lot better than banks! But the good thing about banks is that your money is FDIC insured (up to $250K I believe). So if the bank goes under, you still get your money back. That's not the case with crypto. If Blockfi or Celsius go bankrupt, then say goodbye to your money.

Remember, there's no such thing as a free lunch. Yes there's lots of high interest rates floating around that you can earn, but there is also a proportional amount of risk. Be smart with your money. Be careful out there, good luck!",cryptocurrency

Seems like it would be trivial for an attacker to stand up a teams and reach out to users at random pretending to be IT.  Does anyone know if the same technologies applied to Outlook email protection are also applied to Teams? To my knowledge, I have not yet seen phishing awareness training that covers teams, and the possibility of being contacted by an external attacker directly either.

Am I missing something, or is this a **monumental** phishing attack surface?

personalfinance,is switching to part time a good idea for the long run?,"I am 22 yr old and I am currently working full time as a warehouse worker making $16.50 an hour and I do 80 hrs every 2 weeks which then I receive almost $1,000 paycheck bi weekly. I am taking one class from school right now which is in the mornings on Monday and Wednesday 8-10am and my work schedule is from Sundays to Thursdays 12pm to 8pm and I get Fridays and Saturdays off. My goal is to take more than one class next semester (possibly 3 courses) because I really want to take school seriously and get a degree. I don't fully know what degree I want to get I am still undecided but I am curious in either business or tech. My goal for next semester is to take at least 3 gen ed courses and work part time. Every month working full time I make around $2000 to $3000. In July I made $3000 which divides into 3 paychecks each containing $1,000. 

Here is a list of all my bills for every month that I pay:

rent- $500 I help my mother with rent every month we pay $1,500 and I need to be there for her because she can't survive on her own right now.

car insurance- $215 car insurance went up ever since I bought a used Honda civic 2016 coupe with 80k miles before that I was paying like $150 and I used to have a used 2005 chevy trailblazer.

car loan- $344 I pay almost every month with that and the interest rate I pay is like 9% and I have like 5 years left to complete my loan and My mom was telling me I should start paying my car loan through my bank which is a credit union and they said they would drop it to 3% but they would also raise my payment to almost $400 which I am not to keen about since I am trying to be frugal as possible.

gas-$130 My job is 30 minutes away so I drive about 11 miles to work and back so like 22 miles a day for 5 days which equals to 110 miles a week. my mpg is 31 and a full tank gives me like 330 miles and I pay more now on gas ever since they raised the gas prices here in LA I pay usually $45 almost every 1-2 weeks.

credit card- $35 I have a discover card that I got last year so I could build my credit score 

gym- $30 I go to la fitness because its the closest to my house and I love going to the gym so I don't want to get rid of that. I am very strict with my body and want to be healthy as possible

groceries- I haven't checked to see how much I spend on groceries but I don't think its a lot. I make my own meals for the week so everyday I eat chicken breast, rice, and broccoli because I am also on a diet so yea I am trying to be cheap as I can with food.

Total I pay every month: $1,254 with a full time job I am comfortable paying for that but I want to move to part time so I could take more classes and become a full time student and I know you could work full time and be a full time student but I heard its really hard and not worth it. Especially if they have a hard major like engineering or computer science. I did the math of how much I would make from a part time job and see if it would pay all my bills. 

If I were to work part time I would need to be making at least 15 an hour which is crucial to me because that would be able to at least pay most of my bills but I am not sure yet if it will because I never worked part time. and I also live in California which is not cheap here, I would also need to do 30 hours a week which is 6 hours a day and working only 5 days every week. 

60x15.00 an hour = $900 before taxes. after taxes they would probably take like $200 from my paycheck so I will be getting like $700. My coworker is part time and he told me he gets around $700 every 2 weeks. Oh and I forgot to mention is that the job where I am at right now would't let me switch to part time because they ""just don't allow it"" which was said by HR. Even though my coworker is part time and i don't understand why they give him part time and in fact one my leads is also part time and she is going to school which makes no sense. So therefore I will also be looking for a new job. I know you could work at your school but I go to a community college and the work study jobs there are not great because they only give you little hours which I cant do because I have bills to pay so I need to be making good hours like at least 30hrs.

I know this was long but I just wanted to be detailed as possible so I could get the help from the personal finance community, and if I were to give my own advice I would say is to try out part time and see if it sticks, if not and if its not supporting my financial means then I guess I will stick to full time but I want to know what you guys think and please let me know if any of you went to college and had to work during that time. What do you think? Do you think its possible to work part time and be a full time student with so many bills you have to pay?",finance
personalfinance,Having difficulty deciding on CC consolidation or continuing current payments.,"Quick run down. 

5 cards totalling ~$4500. APRs are 22, 22, 23, 24, 24. There isn't one card which is the bulk of the usage, they have been used somewhat equally for their various cash back options (one at the groceries, one for Amazon etc). 

For the past six months or so I've been paying $100 to each of them for $500 monthly. Looking at the offers page from Upstart (recommendation from Credit Karma) they offer me a $5000 consolidation loan with payments of $188.88 for 36 months. They display it as a 21.1% interest rate and with a $192 origination fee (these two combined are then also displayed as a 24.1% APR). 

Assuming most servicers of this type will offer vaguely similar amounts/rates, is this a positive or negative move? I am especially confused regarding the ""21% interest rate"" (which would be a lower rate than any of the cards) because they also list that 24% APR which would seem to be a worse rate than 3 of the cards. 

Essentially I'd like to reset the cards to zero. I have no other debts (vehicle owned clear, rent for housing, no student loans). I understand that for this process to be effective in general terms I need to scale back the usage of the cards overall, and am working out a budget to help that. My question is specifically to the value of this refinance/consolidation and if the consolidation would be a fiscally responsible and advantageous action, a ""side grade' not really changing much, or a poor decision?

Edit: There is a second option of 5 years listed for the same amount of $5000 but with a 20.21% ""interest rate"", $205 origination, and the combined APR is listed at 22.25%",finance

Here's a perspective we see frequently in crypto.  There are thousands of different tokens and coins.  All these tokens and coins will compete with each other.  Many will fail.  But out of the ashes will rise a few survivors.  Maybe just one survivor (as maxis would have it), or maybe there is space for several, but most will die off.  There's obviously some truth to this thinking, but I want to argue it's nonetheless the wrong way to think of crypto.  We'll call this way of thinking, the Racehorse.  Crypto is not about racehorses.

# Better, But Still Flawed:  Walled Gardens

Spend a little time actually using crypto (for DeFi, NFTs, etc.) and you start to internalize the difference between blockchains and tokens.  Ethereum *the blockchain* isn't just about Ether.  It's also about the thousands of different tokens and dapps that sit on top of the block chain.  Maybe you love the monetary policy of bitcoin (*e.g.*, 21 million total fixed supply), but that doesn't mean you love its blockchain for one reason or another.  So you can wrap your bitcoin and have it ""live"" on another blockchain (for example to generate yield).  

So maybe, you come to believe, the *real* competition between blockchains is about which ones have (or will have) the best ""ecosystem"".  Obviously, Ethereum is presently the frontrunner in terms of its ecosystem, but there are strong arguments to be made for the developing ecosystems of others, like Cardano, Solana, Polkadot, etc.  (Even the Bitcoin-maxis still argue their ecosystem will come.)  Who will ""win"" among the various ecosystems?  This is an improvement over our Racehorse Theory, but I would argue this ""walled garden"" way of thinking is still missing a critical point:  that no one will be building walls around these gardens.

# Still Better:  Network Effects and the Telephone

Quick reminder about what a network effect is:  Think of the world's first phone.  A totally useless device, since there's no second phone to call.  Build a second phone, and suddenly it's more useful: you now have a device to contact Alexander Graham Bell.  Make 5 billion more phones and you have a radically more useful device.  Crypto is a network-effect invention.

Back to our walled-gardens.  Obviously the more users, dapps, wallets, and participants *within* a smart contract platform the more valuable the platform.  But we don't have to stop there.  The platform *also* benefits from its interoperability with competing platforms.  The more bridges, and the better the bridges (*i.e.*, easier to use, lower fees, faster, more decentralized), the more value is added to *both* sides of the bridge.   Developers on *both sides* of the bridge, therefore, have a strong incentive to make those bridges.  Again, nobody wants a wall around their crypto-garden, they want bridges.

# Final Form:  Crypto Becomes One Big Crypto-Blob

So what's this look like in the future?  Will Ethereum kill off Cardano or the other way around?  Will Solana overtake them both?  The answer is likely no to all of this.  These aren't racehorses, they're networks.  Networks succeed by merging into one seamless blob.

Maybe I have Cardano sitting on an Ethereum wallet and I send it to your Solana wallet.  But I don't even know that your wallet is Solana and mine is Ethereum.  Smart contracts find the most efficient bridge all on their own.  The massive and growing need for computation power means any blockchain that provides computation is useful.  The efficiency of the bridges means software, taking advantage of the arbitrage opportunities, will smooth out the differences in cost-of-computation between the networks.  

For another historical analogy, think of the early internet.  There was a time when we debated whether Delphi, Compuserve, or AOL would be the ""winner,"" and we compared the services on their respective networks.  The answer was none of them:  the internet would evolve into a single blob, because any service that wasn't a part of the blob missed out on the network-effect value.

TL;DR - Evaluate the platforms based on their *bridges* to the other platforms, not based on any internal metric.  The winners will be those with the best bridges.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,With the new Australian surveillance bill should I store my crypto overseas?,"Many politicians have expressed wanting to ban it and with this new bill it seems they could take it from me without compensation as they can now access my devices without a warrant that is if I understand correctly, because this should I store my crypto in a different country to prevent this if another bill is pushed through in a matter of hours like this time? And if so how should I do that?

Not to mention with this part of the bill (taken from an Australian site national law review) couldn't they just delete data?

The new warrants provide the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission with the power to:

Modify or delete the data of suspected offenders (data disruption warrants);

Collect intelligence on criminal networks (network activity warrants), and

Take control of a suspected offenders‚Äô online account (account takeover warrants).


And in this small rant section what bullshit is this?
  
The complexity of online crime makes it increasingly necessary for law enforcement agencies to level the playing field, identify suspected criminal activity and intercept that activity before it is actioned. However, proportionate consideration of individual privacy rights has created a lively debate in the passage of the legislation thus far.

Thats sounds like an excuse to snoop and violate rights but not to surprising from our government.

Student loans: $42k all federal

personalfinance,"Declined ACA subsidy, no income, out of luck on taxes?","Good day to everyone. I filed an extension on my 2020 taxes because I'm trying to figure out the correct answer for my ACA-related issue. I'm hoping someone here could kindly help.

Back in late 2019, when I applied for an ACA plan, I had just lost my mother, for whom I had given up my life and spent over a year providing 24/7 care during her illness. My dad had gone through treatments and into remission for his cancer, and now with my mom gone, I'm taking care of my disabled-since-birth sibling. 

I knew the estate would take time to close, and I had no idea what 2020 would look like for me in terms of income. I probably gave a low estimation for income on my application, like $20,000, and I was offered a subsidy that would have covered a significant amount of my $416/mo (silver plan) premium. 

I declined the subsidy, because I hoped my year would go well income-wise, and I didn't want to owe money or possibly penalities on my annual tax filing. 

As we all know, 2020 was bananas and my two remaining family members, and closing the estate and property took up all of my time and I didn't make any money, except insignificant interest on savings and investments, which I had to drain for expenses. 

Now I'm reading one has to make at least 100% of the Federal Poverty Level to receive ACA help, so $12,000ish.

It seems if I had taken the subsidy, the govt would have just looked the other way and not asked for the amount back on my taxes. But since I decided to pay $416/mo, $5,000 for the year, I'm just out of luck. 

FYI I live in Georgia, one of the few states that did not expand Medicaid.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, September 1, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 1, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed in the first session of September, which is historically the worse month for equities. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) both eeked out a new intraday record high, closing 0.07% and 0.17% higher respectively. The Dow Jones (DIA) fell 0.10% while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, rose 0.67%. Market participants continue to digest comments from the Federal Reserve‚Äôs annual Jackson Hole Symposium and a key speech from Powell on Friday. Looking ahead, market participants wait for new, crucial economic data, namely the August Job Report, set to be released on Friday. 

Despite some choppiness near the middle of the month, the SPY closed out its seventh straight month of gains, rising nearly 3% during the month of August, bringing the performance of the index to a staggering 20% gain year-to-date. Despite the risk posed by potential inflationary pressures and the coronavirus Delta variant, market participants remain encouraged by the pace of the economic recovery, record corporate earnings, and a still accommodative Federal Reserve.

ADP, a leading human services and payroll management company, released their monthly private job report, which estimated that the US gained 374,000 jobs in August, far short of estimates of 600,000, though an improvement over 326,000 last month. Most of the new jobs came from leisure and hospitality, which added 201,000 positions in a somewhat hopeful sign that an industry beset by a labor shortage continues to recover. Education and health services combined to add 59,000, with employment dented by a surge in Delta variant cases. This sets a backdrop for the offical August Jobs Report, set to be released on Friday. Economists estimate 756,500 jobs will be added, which would represent a slowdown compared to the 943,000 jobs added in July.

Mark Zandi, Chief Economist at Moody‚Äôs Analytics, said of the report, ‚ÄúThe delta variant of COVID-19 appears to have dented the job market recovery. Job growth remains strong, but well off the pace of recent months. Job growth remains inextricably tied to the path of the pandemic.‚Äù

This time KYCNOT.ME is much more beautiful, is faster and more intelligent (automatic score system for excchanges and automated reviews of Terms of Service are some of the new features).

I hope that this site is useful for some people who are trying to stay off the KYC enforcement pages but still want to be able to use, trade and buy crypto.

Please read the About page: https://kycnot.me/about

Cryptocurrencies are meant to make a change on the way we pay and exchange goods. They are made to untie the dependency between the users (customers) and the centralized entities that are in control (law enforced) of our economy (e.g. Banks, FED, etc.).

KYC and AML exchanges are the most common nowadays, they act exactly like a bank when using their wallets (most newbies or ‚Äútraders‚Äù do so). You (usually) don't own any private key, so the funds aren't fully yours, they own your keys (if there are any keys that belong to you). They also require you to identify yourself in order to operate there (e.g. photo of your ID). All of this together goes against the most valuable benefits of cryptocurrencies.

With KYCNOT.ME I want to make it easier for people to find trustworthy ways to buy, exchange, trade and use cryptos without needing to identify themselves, and preserving the decentralized and self-governed essence of Cryptocurrencies.",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,Cryptosedition,"The advent and popularization of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have brought about new ways of thinking about wealth, money and personal liberty.

The nature of most cryptocurrencies includes decentralized control (no central 'bankers'), trustless and permissionless activities, uninhibited personal financial freedom, and location neutrality.

These factors combine to allow a new, large-scale, inter-country 'feature' of cryptocurrencies, which I call ***Cryptosedition***.

What is Cryptosedition?

*In a nutshell, it is when crypto bypasses existing geo-political boundaries and allows financial transactions by individuals beyond the normal control of their overlords.*

There are 2 types of countries in which cryptosedition is occuring:

1. **Countries with very high interest rates**. Examples include Venezuela (where the 2020 inflation rate was 6500%), Zimbabwe, Lebanon, Argentina, etc.  
These countries often have dysfunctional governments and rampant ongoing devaluations of their currency. Such countries attempt to ban the use of crypto, fearing that the flows of capital that crypto allows will further restrict the ability of the governments to levy taxes and control the financial activities of its citizens.  
The emergence of an alternative store-of-value mechanism that is unable to be easily traced and is invisible to the normal banking sector strikes at the very heart of a nation's sovereignty. The advent of [sound money](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/hyperbitcoinization/) changes everything.  
In these countries, individuals can defy the state by owning 'magic internet tokens' which can be transacted via a mobile phone wallet. The state then needs to worry about flight risk of wealthy individuals, illegal activities from drug lords and other destabilizing effects beyond their usual control mechanisms.  
By contrast, liberal countries with stable currencies see little to fear from crypto - preferring to consider it merely an investment opportunity akin to gold or the stock market.
2. **Countries with authoritarian governments.** Examples include China, Turkey, Russia (partly). These countries do not have weak or ineffective governments, but are ruled strongly. The push-back from the ruling parties in these countries against crypto stems less from purely monetary flow concerns, and more from an unwillingness to allow citizens control of their own finances. These countries (particularly China and Russia) are in a long-term geo-political battle with 'western' cultural concepts such as democracy, libertarian values, personal freedom and free-ranging capitalism. China's CCP has recently been cracking down on [wealthy individuals](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-02/chinas-war-on-everything-turns-towards-its-own-tycoons-verrender/100341464) and [popstars](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/30/china/china-entertainment-crackdown-mic-intl-hnk/index.html) in order to prevent any individual from challenging the supremacy of the State. In this context, it is little wonder that crypto (and the freedom that it allows) is seen as a major subversive threat. Unfortunately for China, the sedition genie is out of the bag already. Chinese people will continue to invest and use crypto, regardless of ever-increasing attempts at controlling the population and tracking their every purchase.

These are the deeper meanings of cryptosedition - the backdoor, secretive, small-scale use of crypto by repressed citizens to foster an emergent class of the proletariat who are not reliant on the State for banking and trading services. Once crypto scales up fully (I'm talking Bitcoin / [Lightning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network) and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/) mostly here), and microtransactions are cheap and easy, then the ability of an oppressive regime to control the secondary (black) market will wither away. This has been long predicted, and is now both imminent and inevitable.

personalfinance,Option to either 1) Refinance Mortgage OR 2) Cash Out Refi through Navy Federal Credit Union (looking for insight/advice/experiences),"Hi fellow Personal Finance redditors, 

My spouse and I purchased our house in fall 2019 ($590,000 in southern California) and took out a 30 year VA-backed loan at 3.375%. Also adding, no funding fee would be added (husband is a disabled vet). We are okay with the payment, but would love to pay off debt and focus more on retirement savings.

Our current monthly P&amp;I is $2,608.37, we pay no ""mortgage insurance"", and with escrow of $635.61, our total monthly payment is $3,362.87. 

My husband and I would like to refi at a better interest rate and was just told yesterday by a Navy Federal CU rep that we can refi at 2.375%. Although we are set on refinancing, we are also interested in the possibility of a cash-out refi. The ""cash-out"" would be used to pay off remaining student loan debt and credit card debt (together totaling approximately $32,000). Interest rates on the student loan and CC debt are much higher than the 2.375% we would be able to refi at. 

After crunching numbers over the phone, the Navy Fed CU rep indicated the following: 

OPTION 1: CASH-OUT REFI @ 2.375% (VA backed 30 year loan). 

Our new monthly P&amp;I (including closing costs wrapped into the 30 year payment term) = $2,386.33.  

Use the $32,000 cash to pay off remaining student loan and credit card. We would save on our P&amp;I monthly approx $222 per month. However, not sure what escrow amount would be. The incentive would be the total pay off of our student loan and credit card. And just focus on mortgage, savings and investment. 

&amp;#x200B;

OPTION 2 : REFI ONLY @ 2.375% (VA-backed 30 year loan). 

Our new monthly P&amp;I (including closing costs wrapped into the 30 year payment term) = $2,250.00. We would save on our P&amp;I monthly approx $358 per month. However, not sure what escrow amount would be. 

It seems to me that the better option is to cash-out refi.  But, what am I overlooking here? Looking for insight/guidance/experiences with cash-out refi and any pitfalls to look out for. Thanks in advance for any advice.",finance

BITCOIN? DOGECOIN? Here is what I've learned!

Bitcoin is decentralized, secure, scarce (21M cap), digital, easy to transfer and most importantly a hedge against inflation. Explains the recent adoption by the institutions. MicroStrategy, Square, PayPal, and most recently Tesla, all invested in Bitcoin and hold it as an asset on their balance sheet.

For years Governments have printed fiat and debasing their currencies. Recent global crisis has led all central banks to print more fiat and flooded the economy to support it. A necessary step to support the hurting families and small businesses. This wouldn‚Äôt be possible if we solely relied on Bitcoin as our global currency.

Bitcoin is here to stay and might thrive as an asset class similar to gold, a store of value. I don‚Äôt believe Bitcoin can serve as a currency, key reason being it‚Äôs not truly scalable. Currently a block is created every 10 mins, limiting the number of transactions that can be validated on the blockchain.

Another key challenge that I see with Bitcoin is the mining costs. Currently mining costs are $6k-8k per Bitcoin and expected to increase to $12k+ with the next halving. That is a significant cost, \~25% at the current price($50k). Sustainable with a decent gross margin for now but what happens as the halving continues and costs keeps doubling. Eventually there will be no more Bitcoin to be awarded. Bitcoin Blockchain must continue to crate blocks without any rewards and therefore miners will likely charge fees. This would lead to either high fees and/or longer transaction times. Seems like there is significant cost to maintaining the blockchain.

ON THE OTHER HAND, DOGECOIN!

Originally created as a joke, a dog meme, a parody to Bitcoin and other crypto. The alt-coin is a copy of Bitcoin source code with few key differences. Dogecoin blocks are created every 1 min vs. every 10 mins in the Bitcoin blockchain. Another key difference is there is no cap (not scarce), 10,000 Dogecoin are created every minute. That‚Äôs 14.4M Dogecoin per day and \~5.25B Dogecoin per year.

That‚Äôs a lot of Doge! It‚Äôs an inflationary coin compared to the deflationary Bitcoin. 5.25B new Dogecoins are ""dug"" annually, that is \~4% inflation and the rate drops every year. There are currently 128B Dogecoin in circulation, 5B/128B, 4% inflation, the following year, 5B/133B, 3.76% inflation. The inflation rate drops and the additional coin‚Äôs value will stabilize. Compare that to the dollar, Federal Reserve injected about \~$5T in 2020, additional $1.9T likely to be injected this month. That is just in the US! JPow confirmed today the printing will continue to support our economy and rates are expected to be low. Annual 5B Dogecoin does sounds too bad in that context, especially since each Dogecoin is currently valued at $.30.

Dogecoin is more like a digital dollar with Bitcoinisk properties. Declining inflation rate, faster payment processor, decentralized, fractional mining cost compared to Bitcoin, miners keep getting rewards.

So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.

Both are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.

# Definition

APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.

APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.

Who uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.

&gt;Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.

# What Are They Different?

## APR

For example, a yield farming program offers an APR  
 of 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  
.

Once you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.

### Formular

APR = r x N

Where:

r: The interest rate of the year;

N: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).

## APY

APY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.

&gt;What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?

If you have an APR  
 of 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  
 by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  
.

Assuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  
 and APY  
 of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.

### Formular

APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

In which:

r: The interest rate of the period;

n: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).

# Awareness

As such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:

* First, displaying APY  
 will produce a larger percentage than APR  
, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.
* Secondly, the APY  
 interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).

Today we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.

&amp;#x200B;

 

**TLDR**:

Understanding the two terms of APR  
 and APY  
 becomes even more important in DeFi today, as nearly all protocols with yield farming fields display these numbers. Knowing them well is not only for understanding and executing different strategies and calculating real profits.",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,"October 31st, 2008","I'm sure this has been brought up before, that the white paper was released just weeks after Lehman Brothers famous chapter 11 bankruptcy in September and only a few weeks before Fed induced round 1 of QE.

He, she, they, (it) knew this was the perfect time to drop the paper. The timing is too coincidental to say final draft was distributed as soon as it was finished.  

Then how long did he, she, they, (it) hold off on releasing the paper? And why wait? Did Satoshi have insider knowledge of the financial system?

personalfinance,State Tax Withholding for Minnesota,"Hello,

I'm going through my withholdings for both federal and state. I've found the IRS's calculator, but would like to find something similar for state (I'm in MN). I didn't find anything on the MN government's website.

Is figuring out the withholding as simple as finding where I am in the tax brackets ([https://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/ss/ssindinc.pdf](https://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/ss/ssindinc.pdf)), calculating that amount, and dividing that by number of pay periods per year? I don't think that takes into account any deductions, but I'm at a loss as to how to figure it out otherwise.

Thanks!",finance

CryptoCurrency,Is XRP something you've considered? Here's why you might want to jump in,"I know, I know. You think XRP is a centralized bankers coin blah blah blah. But, hear me out.

Do you want to make some motherf\*\*\*ing money? The sleeping giant XRP is currently extremely undervalued. I'm hoping you might read the following and see for yourself that the investment risk is worth the reward.

**Here's what XRP has to offer.**

1. **David Schwartz** \- The CTO of Ripple, this guy is one of the legends of the cryptoverse. Think Steve Wozniak level of genius. The thing I love most is that he's not a maximalist, he wants to see crypto adoption and is happy for any project to succeed. Watch this video to see what I mean:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvxH2tXwMaI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvxH2tXwMaI)
2. **Federated Sidechains** \- Smart contracts are coming to the XRP ledger. This development isn't expected to take long either and means that XRP will finally have Defi.  
[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xrp-more-reason-moon-ripple-175137320.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xrp-more-reason-moon-ripple-175137320.html)
3. **Jed McCaleb's XRP** \- As a founder, Jed was given a GIANT stash of XRP. Since being kicked out of the XRP project he has been offloading it for years. However, this stash is expected to run out within the next 200 days.  
[https://jed.tequ.dev/](https://jed.tequ.dev/)
4. **FLR Launch** \- If federated sidechains aren't enough, XRP holders will receive an airdrop from the Flare Foundation at some stage which enables smart contract functionality for more than just XRP. LTC, DOGE, and XLM are also integrated into this network.  
[https://flare.xyz/](https://flare.xyz/)
5. **The Technology** \- If you haven't used XRP yet, boy you will love it. Instant transactions. Amazing security. It's been running for **9 years**, with over **60 Million** ledgers closed, and can handle **1500TPS.** Oh and besides using very little energy per transaction, you will never have to worry about insane gas fees. Do you ever hear XRP holders complaining about transactions? (Nope)  
[https://xrpscan.com/](https://xrpscan.com/)
6. **SEC Lawsuit** \- This was a big kick in the balls for XRP holders last year. The price of XRP has been suffering since this attack took place. However, the amount of evidence against the SEC's corruption has been adding up over the last few months, and the chance of a settlement increases with every coming day. This lawsuit will likely be over in the coming months and once it does, you will be too late.  
[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFIioyI1rBmv7A4Nn6xhu-A](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFIioyI1rBmv7A4Nn6xhu-A)  
[https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1](https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1)

I know you hate reading, so these are just the top points I've collected. There is so much more than this though. How about Ripple expanding into Asia &amp; South America? The XUMM app is by far the best software wallet I've used. Multiple token airdrops for XRP holders are on the way. What more do you want?

**I don't want to avoid the negatives though:**

1. **Supply Concentration** \- Ripple and its founders own a HUGE stash of XRP, most people recognize this as a bad thing.
2. **SEC Lawsuit** \- If Ripple loses this lawsuit, the price will tank. It won't likely go to zero, but you can kiss your investment goodbye (at least in the short term).
3. **Missing Ledgers** \- The entire first week of ledgers #1 to #32570 were lost. You can make of this what you will. It could be seen as suspicious, or just an early bug.

Check out Tiffany Hayden on Twitter for some criticism about XRP &amp; Ripple  
[https://twitter.com/haydentiff?s=20](https://twitter.com/haydentiff?s=20)

**Bonus info:**

XRP constantly gets attacked by BTC maxis for being a centralized coin. The chain in fact works in a completely decentralized manner. The ledger itself uses a form of the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) consensus algorithm.  There are over 170 validators and 900 nodes that operate at locations across the globe and are run by a broad range of individuals, universities, institutions, and exchanges.  
[https://panos.writeas.com/why-xrp-is-the-most-misunderstood-cryptocurrency](https://panos.writeas.com/why-xrp-is-the-most-misunderstood-cryptocurrency)

**So, to recap.**

You can currently get a coin, for roughly $1, that can transfer in 3s, with (almost) no transaction fee, at zero cost to the environment. Do you want Smart Contracts? They're coming. Defi? On its way. Jed McCaleb FUD? Almost gone. SEC? Can go fuck themselves.

How can you read all this and not be bullish? Ripple is trying to solve a **multi-trillion-dollar** problem with XRP. You've heard of ""buy the rumor, sell the news"". This is the ""buy the rumor"" stage. Just remember to DCA, there is no knowing what will happen short term. Play it safe.

Happy to update any of this info if you have amendments.",cryptocurrency

Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy ‚Äúsome things‚Äù minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
36. Cardano‚Äôs closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it‚Äôs EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We‚Äôll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano‚Äôs deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

I want to go into the career field I went to college for and what I had previous work experience in. I‚Äôm getting so desperate that I‚Äôm considering jobs listed online that seem to be temporary, 6-12 month contract jobs that pay anywhere from $30 to $40/hour, but they may not have benefits.

I have well over $25k saved with investments on the side but I am planning to move out and in with my girlfriend, get engaged in the near future and eventually get married and have kids, so my goal lately has been more so to provide for my future family and have financial stability. But I am also at odds with my sanity in my current job since it does not fulfill me.

Thinking financially, is it better to keep my current job and go up that ladder with secure pay and benefits even though I won‚Äôt be completely happy, or make the jump into the career I was more passionate about but possibly risk having a less ‚Äúsecure‚Äù job with potentially lesser or no benefits?",finance
personalfinance,Should I close some credit cards? And other budget advice,"TLDR: got a 15k consolidation loan to simplify and reduce monthly payment and interest rate. Credit cards at 0 balance out of 15k. Want to close 3 credit cards and keep 2, one for emergency medical payment and one because it's my oldest line of credit. Is there any reason I should have a different plan for them?

I was recently approved for a loan to consolidate my credit card debt to be paid off at a lower interest rate. I've tried and failed over the years to even make a dent in this so breng approved for this loan and seeing the balances go to zero is honestly freeing.

I know I still owe the same amount but seeing the pay off date gives me a concrete goal to work toward and the interest is lower and the payment is easier to keep track of. My credit has been poor because my credit utilization has been too high. Each time I tried to make a larger payment I would be short money and overdraft my account or have to use the credit cards to get by till payday. 

I'm not great at managing my money, but I have created a budget and I'm thinking of pulling out cash allowance every week so that I can't lose track of spending like I do. 

My other thought is that I need to close 3 or my 5 credit cards. The balances will be zero when I close them so it shouldn't affect my credit. I have a car loan, student loans, and now this consolidation loan that will have my debt at like... 75k and I make about 60k a year. 

If I close all but my 2 oldest lines of credit, my limit will go from like $15,000 to $6000. Is there any reason I would need to keep these credit cards open? I'd rather close them and rid myself of temptation. I want to keep 1 for medical emergencies (interest rate is better) and 1 because it's my oldest line of credit. I don't think my average credit age will decrease much. Heck, should I lower my limit to 300 so I can never go over my monthly budget? 

...Would also like to add that I have been lurking this sub for a long time and I have made several budgets to attack my debt but I was unsuccessful. I know what this says about me. I'm great with research and making a plan but struggle with execution. In this case for me it is the end. I'm sick of credit cards. I don't want anything to do with them any more and I do not plan on using mine except every few months for gas and then immediately pay it off.  Getting a loan was a risk but only if I return to using the credit cards, which I will light on fire before I do that again. ... 

Thoughts?

Edit: Thank you to those who took the time to answer me.  I have chosen to keep 4 of the 5 open. The 5th was an Amazon credit card and I cannot trust myself with that. 2 will be used for 1 recurring bill each and I have set up the credit cards to automatically pay the balance in full before the due date. I can cut up or hide the cards and monitor them through my phone. I will probably just keep them in my closet and forget about them. 1 is designated for emergency vet bills, hopefully I won't need it while I'm building my emergency fund. 1 will used for gas and in case of emergencies. I understand this isn't what some may recommend, but if I'm ever in an accident or need to rent a car (some rental agencies only accept credit) I will need to have this on hand. 

I have an excel spreadsheet that details all of my bills and their due dates and I have all of my account linked to a budget monitoring app. I have a plan to build my emergency fund and have to rein in spending but all this seems doable now.

CryptoCurrency,Some of the Most Interesting Yield-Farming Platforms,"Yield farming is the popular strategy DeFi users take advantage of to put their cryptocurrencies to work to earn high interest.   

There are multiple types of yield farming projects offering different financial services, mostly to earn astonishingly high interest. Large banks might earn you 0.01% to 0.25% a year, but these sub-percent yields can‚Äôt compete with the 20% to 200% earnings some DeFi platforms tout. Often, the higher the interest, the riskier the staking pool is.  

Here are some of the most interesting yield-farms in 2021:  

1) Uniswap: 20-50% APR Uniswap is the second-largest decentralized exchange (DEX) behind Curve Finance by total value locked with more than $5.5 billion in the platform. The platform offers swaps with Ethereum and thousands of ERC-20 tokens and staking in liquidity pools to provide the swaps. Liquidity providers earn a percentage of trading fees for every swap, and with a large enough principle deposited, they earn significant interest. Interest rates on Uniswap and all other DEXes vary by the pool and market fluctuations.  

2) Aave: 0.01-15% APR Aave is the reigning DeFi king in terms of total value locked with a staggering value of over $10 billion, according to [DeFiPulse.com](https://defipulse.com/). Aave is a decentralized platform on Ethereum (and the Polygon sidechain) that offers low-interest cryptocurrency borrowing and lending. Because investors have deposited so much crypto into Aave to earn interest, its borrow APRs are some of the best on the market. Variable borrowing of stablecoins (like DAI, USDC and USDT) range from 3% APR to 7% at the time of writing.   

3) ZooKeeper: 5-58% APR Zookeeper brings a new and interesting farming experience, leading to experience higher mining rewards and richer and more interesting NFT gameplay. ZooKeeper is a brand new project built as a Wanchain Dapp. It is entirely conceived and developed by passionate members of the community with some collaboration from the Wanchain team. ZooKeeper drastically improves the functionality of NFTs by giving them a real use case within their platform. They provide a dual farming experience while embracing the popular crypto trend of NFTs.   

4) PancakeSwap: 8-250% APR PancakeSwap, like Uniswap, is a decentralized exchange (DEX). It functions similarly to Uniswap but is on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network instead of Ethereum and has a few more features focused on gamification. It holds the highest total value locked of all BSC DeFi projects by a mile at about $7 billion. PancakeSwap offers BSC token swaps, interest-earning staking pools, a gambling game where users predict the future price of BNB and even non-fungible token (NFT) art.

personalfinance,Cash-out refi to pay off student debt right after buying home? Other creative ways to use equity?,"We just purchased our home last month and paid $440k for it. Because this was a family transaction, we acquired it at significantly below market in our HCOL area. The mortgage bank's appraiser came in at $630K. We are very, very lucky, especially in this market.

We have been paying down a *lot* of very dumb credit card debt. I also have substantial student loans. I'm wondering whether a cash-out refi is possible, and/or would make sense, to wipe out at least some  of this debt. I also feel like I could have gotten a better rate (my credit score was around 800 when I applied in my name only).

I am the only earner right now. My income is variable but is currently \~$12k-$15K per month. I have $30k in traditional IRA, \~$2k in 401k (recently opened, no match) and a newly opened Roth IRA awaiting funding.

**Mortgage**: $440k at 3.125%/30 year. Monthly payment including tax and insurance is \~$2,900.

**Student loans**

* $88,000 at 3.590%, 19+ years remaining (just refinanced this), $522 monthly payment
* $11,000 at 2.875%, 10 years remaining, $107/month

**Credit cards**:

* $17,000 at 0% for 17 more months, on track to pay all by end of the 0 interest period, $1,000/month
* Monthly revolving balance paid in full

After writing this all out, I get the sense that any savings on a lower interest rate and the student loan would get eaten up by refi fees, and that I'd just be turning personal unsecured debt into secured, foreclosable debt (bad).

personalfinance,"Credit card balance has been $0 for 7 months but is still reporting a high balance, trying to get a mortgage and it's causing an issue","I have two credit cards, a Bank of America card with an $11,000 limit and a Citi card with a $1,000 limit. I use the Chase card for my day to day purchases and pay it off monthly.

Back in early February I needed to pay a contractor and when it was time to pay could not find my checkbook (nothing bad, just turned out my wife had moved it) so I paid $10,736 on my BoA credit card. Once the charges processed, I paid off the balance 3 days later. By the time the statement cut, the balance was zero and has reflected zero in my account ever since.

Now my wife and I need to relocate for my job, so we need to get approved for a new mortgage. The bank immediately pointed out my credit card usage because I was using over 90% of my available credit. On top of that, my credit score is sitting in the low 700s. Turns out they were showing that the $10,736 is still being reported by Bank of America.

I checked my Citi account, which provides a monthly credit score and history, and my score was consistently above 800 until March, when it dipped and has now been sitting around 705 every month. The person I spoke with at the bank looked over the report they pulled and said there is nothing else of concern - no other debt, no new inquiries, no late payments, etc., and that he thinks the score drop is solely due to the high credit usage. He advised me to talk to BoA and get it corrected and then said I'd be in great shape.

I've spoken with BOA about a dozen times at various levels and have not gotten anywhere. So, I filed a dispute through Transunion based on my statements showing $0. I was notified that it was removed the following day, and it stayed gone for 2 weeks, then reappeared again. 

At this point the bank says that since I have documentation showing that the debt is actually paid off, the loan can still be done and the reported debt won't stop me from getting a mortgage. However, he said they can't do anything about the score aspect, and says I am getting a drastically lower interest rate with my lowered score, and I will pay a lot more over the life of the loan because of it. His recommendation was to keep pushing to get my report and score corrected before taking the mortgage so that I can get a better rate with the higher score that I ""should"" have. 

Does all of this sound right? I don't know what I'm missing or where to go from here. We are on a timeline and need to move very soon for my job (deadline in early December) so I have considered just taking the mortgage with the crappier rate, and then once this gets sorted out and my score is higher, hoping to refinance at a higher rate. But at the same time I'm feeling very stuck on the fact that this is happening in the first place - I can't throw money at it to make it disappear because it's ALREADY paid off, and BoA is just running me in circles.",finance
defi,Weekly Staking and Yield Farming Review,"**About us: CryptoQuestion is an independent platform providing free resources for cryptocurrency investors. From an on-demand Q&amp;A service to online courses, from books to our weekly Moonshot Monday podcast. Visit us at** [**www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)

This week we are on a search for the highest return and lowest risk investments in the staking marketplace.

Much has been said about the sustainability of crypto staking APRs. And most of it makes sense. You don‚Äôt need to look very far to see where the skepticism comes from. When the 10 year Treasury note is yielding 1.28% how is an investment going to be able to afford to pay returns substantially above this figure unless there is a catch? Usually that catch is in the form of a Ponzi scheme.

However by taking on more risk in the crypto market investors are legitimately able to earn interest rates which will make your eyes water. Most high APRs come with high risk. The more risky the cryptocurrency the higher the return. The highest APRs are offered by cryptocurrencies with low liquidity and low market caps. It isn‚Äôt default that is the major risk as with your average Ponzi scheme, it is the risk of ending up with a bunch of worthless tokens.

But if you look close enough you will be able to find APRs at a substantial premium to the bank rate and which are also low risk when compared to other crypto investments. However don‚Äôt be misled when you hear the words low risk in crypto.

*Low risk in crypto is high risk in the traditional investment world.*

**Follow us on Telegram for more investment ideas and comment without the spam:** [**https://t.me/moonshotmonday**](https://t.me/moonshotmonday)

**A few examples of low risk crypto investments**

Let‚Äôs take Coinbase as an example. They are offering an APR of up to 5% if you stake Ethereum, Cosmos, Tezos, Algorand and a few other coins.

What‚Äôs the risk?

The biggest risk is that the price of any of these assets falls.

This is a high risk investment compared to other asset classes because of the volatility inherent in crypto, however within the crypto ecosystem this investment could be considered medium risk.

BlockFi offers an interest account where you can stake around 12 different cryptos and earn up to 7.5%. Again the same risk applies as Coinbase. The chances of the platforms defaulting is low.

However there is a twist to the tail that provides the seed to our search for that low risk high return investment. If you stake USDC, the leading stablecoin, BlockFi is paying 7.5%, that compares to only 0.15% on Coinbase.

There are numerous staking services offered by the big centralized exchanges and decentralized platforms. If you are a supporter of Binance for example you will not be worried by its recent problems and will feel comfortable staking its native token BNB and earning up to 6.81%. Its most attractive and low risk APR is when you stake BUSD, it‚Äôs stable coin, and earn up to 4.4%.

**Formulating a low risk high return strategy**

If we can find a strategy to reduce your exposure to crypto volatility by buying and staking stablecoins on platforms that are low risk, as in they are likely to be still around when the staking period is over, then this could be a lucrative investment strategy worth pursuing allowing us to earn superior returns with limited downside.

On that basis let‚Äôs turn our attention to a few of the DeFi platforms and see what we can find in pursuance of our new strategy.

BUSD USDT USDC

% % %

Aave 9.28 9.12 6.07

Yearn 5.90 6.84 5.44

Harvest 11.82 8.98

Compound 1.24 1.47

Curve 0.56 2.32

PancakeSwap 7.49 9.31 7.49

**Strategy risks**

The main risks of following this strategy are as follows:

**Platform risk**

We have to assess whether the platform is financially stable and is likely to be around once the staking period expires. That is likely to be the case with most of the platforms we have included above. However one must be aware that things move fast in crypto so we wouldn't recommend tying your money up for more than a year at a time. Your best bet would be to review your financial position every 6 months. Regulation is a black cloud that hangs over this sector however that is unlikely to affect your investment, but never say never.

**Hacks**

There is a risk of a hack, particularly in the DeFi space. With the centralized exchanges many say they are insured however the reality is they aren‚Äôt. Take Coinbase for example whilst their headlines state they are insured, the small print explains they are only insured for their US cash balances. That doesn‚Äôt cover money held in a central wallet which is the majority of client funds. The question you have to ask yourself is, if there was an attack would the exchange make good the loss? The answer is probably yes in the case of Coinbase and BlockFi, but the answer is only probably. This is another reason why you must not put your pension into these investments, only invest spare cash that you can afford to lose.

**Default risk**

Lastly there is the risk that Tether or Binance will not support the stablecoin peg and that there is a run on the currency which sees the currency dropping below $1. As you can see above there is a risk premium built into Tether‚Äôs USDT and Binance‚Äôs BUSD. However we would suggest avoiding these two currencies, particularly when staking longer than 6 months, and stick to USDC which seems a more financially sound stablecoin.

**Follow us on Telegram for more investment ideas and comment without the spam:** [**https://t.me/moonshotmonday**](https://t.me/moonshotmonday)

**Summary**

Based on the above analysis we would suggest the following are the lowest risk highest return investments available in the market at the moment:

For longer term holding periods of more than 6 months

BlockFi 7.5% USDC

Harvest 8.98% USDC

For short term holding periods of less than 6 months

Harvest 11.82% USDT

AAVE 9.28% BUSD

AAVE 9.12% USDT

As with anything in life, it is always worth experimenting before diving in with both feet, in this scenario that means investing only a small amount to test out how it works and to figure out the peculiarities and the catches before investing larger amounts. And remember, whilst these investments are probably the highest return lowest risk in the crypto market they are still high risk investments and should be treated as such!

retirement,What's wrong with my calculations?,"I'm trying to do a quick-and-dirty estimate of how long my money will last in retirement. The goal here is not precision, but rather a simple answer to the question: Can I afford to retire? (Note: I have no heirs, so I don't need to have any $ left when I die.)

There are lots of online calculators of how long my money will last, but they don't let me account for when Social Security income kicks in. So, I made the spreadsheet you see here: [https://imgur.com/a/yN9rrAH](https://imgur.com/a/yN9rrAH)

Here's what I did:

\- I live comfortably on about $44,000 a year now, so I increased my net income to $50,000 a year to account for having to pay my own health insurance. With Affordable Care Act insurance in my state I can get a ""silver plan"" for \~$6,000 a year.

\- I completely ignored the fact that my mortgage will be paid off in 7 years.  When that happens I'll just give myself a $900 a month raise in net income.

\- I also completely ignored Medicare kicking in at 65 or any increase in the cost of health care.

\- I excluded some of my current net worth from the calculations altogether and put that amount aside (mentally) for major medical expenses.

\- My tax rate of 16.25% includes federal and my state income taxes at this income level. I did not use a capital gains tax rate, I used earned income tax rate, which is higher. I also did not account for the fact that a little bit of my investments are in a Roth IRA, because most of my $ is in a 401K, a traditional IRA or a brokerage account, so most of my money is taxable.

\- For the years before I take Social Security I simply deducted $50,000 plus $8,125 for taxes from my investments for that year.

\- At the end of each year I took what remained of my investments and increased that amount by 4% to come up with the following year's stating total. I realize that some years I'll get more than that in the stock market, and some years I'll get less, but I can't predict this, so I had to pick a number. Also, I didn't spread out the gains over the year. To make the calculations easy I just made it one jump at the end of the year. This is where I think I may be led astray the most, but I didn't want to get into a month-to-month calculation that accounts for an average monthly growth in investments and a monthly withdrawal.

\- Once Social Security kicks in at age 70, I subtracted that much from net income to come up with how much I'll need to withdraw from investments, but I applied taxes to the full net income.

\- Every ten years I increased my net income to somewhat account for inflation without getting into annual calculations.

CryptoCurrency,Savings accounts,"I mean this isn't necessarily about crypto. It's moreso a rant about traditional finance. I imagine a lot of us know how fractional reserve banking works. Well I now have $2000 in my savings account. The interest I got for that? 55 cents. Meanwhile they've absolutely loaned that money out and are making bank on it. I have that same amount staked in Eth (give or take. It's .63 eth, the value of it rn is about $2400, but when it was originally staked it was i think $1800??) and I already have $37. I've had it staked for like 3 months. My interest rate on my savings account is .5%. Hell I have $60 in dai which is getting 2% interest and I'm already at 6 cents. I've only had the dai for a month (that's where I've been putting my profits from my link and dot trade).
Idk, maybe I've just gotten used to higher interest rates because of crypto and it disillusioned me with the paltry crap I get from the traditional banking system. 

Actually, that brings up a question. If the ultimate goal is to switch from traditional finance to crypto, what steps does one take to do that? Would you consider having all of your money in crypto right now, or are you still doing a mix until there's more adoption and infrastructure",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"When refinancing car loan, should we finance for value of car and use the extra money for downpayment on a home?","Hello!


My husband [28M] and I [27F] are hoping to buy a home. We know that the market right now is crazy. We live in the Midwest US so home prices here are not as ridiculous as they are in other locations, but the market here is still not the same as it used to be. I make about $2900 per month and he makes about $3100 per month. Since we are hoping to buy a home, we have been trying to analyze our financial situation more closely to see how we can be more efficient with our money. We are actively trying to be more mindful of our finances.


Up until a few months ago we drove a junky vehicle. We saved up to make a down payment on a 2015 Ford Fusion with 26k miles on it. The price of the vehicle was $15,300 plus taxes, etc. Since we used our savings (not emergency fund) on this, we don't have much saved for a home down payment. We were kind of saving for one thing at a time. 


We want to refinance our car loan through our regular bank which would offer a 2% lower interest rate. While discussing this with them, they asked if we would like to finance for the amount we owe on the loan (14k) or for the value of the vehicle (16,250). There is a home we have been keeping an eye on and thought if we financed for the value of the car it would give us a boost towards a down payment on the home. We are unsure if this is a smart idea as it seems off for us to take extra money from a car loan to use towards a home. What would you do in this situation?

Thank you",finance
CryptoCurrency,"Caution: The global crypto market cap went from $200 Billion in early 2020 to $2.3 trillion in a matter of 18 months. Not to sound bearish, but the market is over-leveraged. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.","You see it in the news almost everyday. Millions of people are getting liquidated whether they were shorting or going long. Either way we see over leveraged people everywhere. 

I didn't think of this much before until I saw Dr. Michael Burry's (The guy who predicted the 2008 subprime housing bubble) tweets regarding the current scene of the world. 

Interest rates are near zero and negative in some parts of Europe. Growth stocks are booming. Meme stocks and the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Rock NFTs are being sold for millions. Heck even invisible NFTs are being sold.

All it takes for all of this to come crashing down is for the fed to raise interest rates and boom! Almost everything will see a massive correction. 

However, the bright side is that it's unlikely it will happen anytime soon because it's political suicide. No administration would want to raise interest rates during their term. 

Nothing goes up parabolic without a correction. So be cautious. I believe in the technology of cryptocurrency. I'll be a long term investor and holder.

My goal of this post is to knock some sense into anyone reading this post, that we are on shaky grounds right now. Don't leverage. Invest only what you can afford to lose. Think long term.

I do believe cryptocurrency is the future. But we can have small bubbles in between the growth. Don't get wiped out.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Interest Rates September 2021,"When looking for a place to compare crypto interest rates I found most sites were either out of date, inaccurate, or didn't compare sites I was interested in. Here are the current US interest rates as of September 2, 2021. All data is pulled directly from their respective sites.

To keep things as apples-to-apples as possible, the APY rates here are all for the lowest level, tier 1, etc. rates. These are all non-staking/flexible term rates. Hope some find this data helpful. Let me know in the comments if you think I missed a site, but these seem like the more popular platforms.

personalfinance,Pension or lump sum if finances are solid without the pension?,"Looking for a sanity check, holes in my logic, opposing viewpoints...

I'm planning to retire later this year and was incredibly fortunate to have been grandfathered into a defined-benefits pension.

For years my company has been trying to get as  people  to take a lump sum since it helps them out with liabilities on their balance sheet and offloads risk to the recipients.  Knowing this, I had always planned to take the pension, but the incredibly low interest rates right now have  goosed the lump sum to where it's looking very attractive.

If we took the lump sum and received 0% interest, it would fund the pension obligations for 22 years, with a 1%, 2% and 3% return that goes up to 26, 31, and 39 years, with my life expectancy being realistically 30-35 years.

We have  enough in savings  / 401K that we could easily put the entire lump sum in the S&amp;P500 and not touch it for 10+ years.  A 4% WD of our savings would  be more than our combined income and significantly more than our expenses given our &gt;25% savings rate.

It seems like a no-brainer since the longest market downturns (excluding the Great Depression) have lasted no more than 4-5 years.  While there could be some black swan event which could put the stock market into another 20 year downturn, such a downturn could also swamp my companies pension so that I'd end up getting a fraction from PBGC.  

For the number crunchers this is a 65% survivor, $46k annual pension with a $27K early retirement supplement (next 7 years) vs a $1.2M lump.",finance

personalfinance,Fed Retirement Help - Looking for a reality check and advice.,"I tried to post in FI subreddit but they were not having it. Hoping that this sub is the right fit.

Everyone's situation and plan are unique. I hope to find some guidance within this subreddit that I think will help me and help many others lurking‚Äîspecifically, government employees. Now, I am going to be brutally honest with my financials. I know I am way behind, and I know I spend like crazy. I'm trying to put a stop to that. Be kind but honest and direct, please.

I'm seeking advice on understanding and interpreting the linked documents and how to plan for my future. More on that, in a minute.

First, let me give a high-level overview of where I am currently. I am 39 years old and in a high-paying job in an HCOL area (sort of - $1800 / month rent). I have one son. I make plenty of money, but I have been highly horrible at managing it lately.

Rought breakdown:

* Gross Pay ($135,000 / year) approx
* $88K in TSP (401K) + Roth
* $380 in Vanguard savings (hoping to get to $3,000 and invest in VTSAX?)
* $13,000 high interest loan ($318 payments)
* $2,600 loan from TSP ( &lt;1% interest)
* $14,000 loan (6.39% interest ($144 every two-week payments. )
   * 2017 Nissan Rogue - I am not emotionally tied to this car at all
* $44,000 school loans (I plan to always pay min on this, but who knows)
* \~$7,500 in credit card loans (high interest)
* $155 for car insurance
* $80 / month for two cell phone lines
* I'm vested with about 20 years so far. I get 1% of the base pay per year of my work. Right now, base pay is about $100,000, so the math is easy. If I do 30 years, I get 30% or $30,000 per year from the pension plan.
* I do not own a house.
* My son is 14 years old.

I bumped my TSP contribution up to 8%, and Roth is at 2%.

I have attached many documents to help people understand my financials.

I hope I stripped enough info not to include PII.

Now, for my goals.

* I want to retire around 51 or 52. But, unfortunately, the problem with my federal retirement is that I believe I have to be [57](https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/fers-information/eligibility/) to draw benefits (and that's with some penalties).
* My main concern is how to have money from ages 51 or 52 to age 57?
* I plan on retiring in an LCOL country (Colombia, Turkey, Vietnam, others).
* I hope to have roughly $45K+ per year to live off of

I am willing to make some significant changes in my life to make this happen. I hope this post can generate some discussion because I am sure I am missing valuable information here.

Any help is appreciated.

Edit: My pension would kick in at age 57. I would have \~$30-35K from that as income for life, plus some inflation factor. Also, I have a guaranteed income of $3,500 plus inflation for life.   


I think this narrows it down to: 

1. How do I cover years 51-57
2. I'm fairly certain my TSP + Pension will cover the cost of living past 57, easy. 

If this is not possible, what are some alternatives? Find a part-time job? Find more passive income, today, and put that into investments? Ideas? I really do want to *clock out* I my early 50's.",finance
personalfinance,Lender Offered Mortgage Rate/Payment Reduction,"Hey folks:

Question here that I hope is kind of an easy one.  We have a jumbo 30-fixed with a major lender (it's a bank, doesn't really matter who) at 3.875%, no escrows.  The loan is roughly 18 months old and we have plenty of equity in the house with no need to pull cash out for anything.

The bank sent us a letter via FedEx (and verified it via their secure messaging, so no fraud there) that they're offering a reduction of the rate down to 3.000% for the remainder of the loan without needing any other changes to the loan.  I called and asked- it does not add term to the loan, no additional fees to do so, all that happens is the rate comes down and thus the payment reduces.

Here's the question:  Any reason NOT to do this?  It doesn't appear to preclude prepayment of the loan or other refinance, it doesn't change any other terms, and there are no fees to do this.

#### Now, a few words on the criteria I‚Äôm using and sources of data.

**1. TheStreet score**

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I‚Äôm only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *‚Äì The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication ‚Äî not a guarantee ‚Äî we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html):

*TheStreet Ratings‚Äô stock model projects a stock‚Äôs total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

**2. Zacks Rank**

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we‚Äôre avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company‚Äôs shares. More from https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6:

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs +10.6% .*

**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**

We‚Äôre only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:

*‚ÄúA‚Äù Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company‚Äôs earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our ‚ÄúA‚Äù rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ‚Äú****Strong Buy****‚Äú.*

*‚ÄúB‚Äù rating:* ***Good.*** *The company‚Äôs stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our ‚ÄúB‚Äù rating is considered the equivalent of a ‚Äú****Buy****‚Äú.*

**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**

It is required that the Yahoo Finance stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

**5. Piotroski F-Score**

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company‚Äôs financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski‚Äôs paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from https://www.gurufocus.com.

**6. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  tradingview (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

I hope you enjoyed the reading. What do you think about this stock selection and the strategy? Feel free to leave a comment below.

personalfinance,Use Teacher Debt Forgiveness or wait for PSLF?,"So many fiance and I have outlined a plan to hopefully pay off all debt, minus the house, in 2 to 3 years; about $50k. Half of that is my fiance's federal student loans. He'll qualify next year, as a teacher, to get $5000 forgiven.

That said, I was recently reading about the PSLF which stated that after 120 payments on a loan, the remaining is forgiven. However, if you take the teacher loan forgiveness, those payments (5 years in total), will not count towards the PSLF.

My fiance  pays about $250 a month.

I have a few questions regarding this:

1. Would it be better to just pay the minimum for that loan, and wait for forgiveness in 5 years?
2. If he's eligible for teacher forgiveness, does he have to take it?
3. Would it be best for us to remain unmarried? I'm concerned if we marry, the payment will increase since my income is about double his.

Thanks!

First post here! I just bought my first house with my partner (we move in tomorrow - exciting!). I've never earned a lot of money but I have been fairly good at saving what I have.

personalfinance,Best savings account 2021,"Hello,

I‚Äôm looking to get an idea on the general consensus of the best high yield savings account in 2021 (Ally vs Vio vs etc?). Due to an ongoing recession etc, many banks and institutions changed terms and agreements for their high-yield savings banks lowering it extensively.

This, however, did not really affect me as I‚Äôm stupid. Currently, I have my money parked in BofA savings account with a, whopping, interest rate of .01%. I am now looking to move all my money a high yield savings bank. I will put about $40,000 initially and $550-ish bi-weekly and am also a college student for 2-3 more semesters if the options expand. 

It seems like the general high-yield savings bank is from .5% to .6% . Some of the banks, at least of bankrate.com, I don‚Äôt recognize. This account would only be used for direct deposits and to pay 4 cc. I would prefer to also have a debit card, for months of more spending (I‚Äôm very frugal, live with my parents).

Mostly concerned with:

1. Exorbitant P/E ratios fueled by aggressive buybacks ‚Äî inflates stock price without adding any tangible assets to companies 
2. Powell had no room to lower rates, we‚Äôre at the bottom, when we go up it will massively affect business lending and many low-margin businesses won‚Äôt be able to stay around without massive price increases 
3. Inflation isn‚Äôt transitory. Now that money velocity is returning to pre-pandemic levels we are seeing inflation everywhere. It‚Äôs not just cars. Unless there‚Äôs more lockdowns you restrict spending, you can calculate CPI anyway you want and it will continue to climb 
4. The reverse repo market is super sketchy and more banks are participating

You may not agree with any of this and believe the bull market will continue forever, but I believe we‚Äôre back in the pickle faced by Carter and will need to boost interest rates to combat inflation at which point a great majority of small companies will fold ‚Äî and largely inflated P/E ratios will fall resulting in a catastrophic loss of market cap on Wall Street.

personalfinance,Question about paying in cash vs. rates/lender credits,"Apologies if this seems super obvious, but I'm new in the mortgage process, and mathematics and finance has never been a strong point for me.

What prevents you (assuming you have the cash) from taking a loan with a higher interest rate, but with lots of lender credits, then paying off the loan really early, say at 3 months?

For instance, let's say there's a 3.5% rate but with $18,000 in lender credits.  The 2.5% rate requires you to pay $800 in points.

With Better, you get an Amex $6,000 for a jumbo mortgage, which appears on your statement after 2-3 months.  There is also no prepayment penalty.

First question is why not take the 3.5% rate over the 2.5%, pocket $24,000, and pay the 3 months of extra interest (according to the amortization schedule it's about $1500 total extra in interest IIRC).

Second question is why not do the 3.5% rate instead of paying in cash?  It would seem like with an extra $24,000 you would profit even given the extra closing costs versus cash?",finance

It would save me about $200 a month but will be a 5 year loan and seeing the interest charges and fees I would pay by the end is a bit scary because it's a big number. However, for my situation right now, it feels like my CC debt will never be paid off because I just keep paying minimum payments. Is it stupid to consolidate with this personal loan for 5 years when the interest rate is so high? It just seems nice to have that goal post and more money each month - but 5 years is a long time and high interest rate. I would stop using my credit cards altogether (I already have for about 5 months now - I asked my fiancee to lock them away in a safe I don't have access to.)

The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed the three major indexes, rising 0.68%. Following the Federal Reserve‚Äôs annual Jackson Hole Symposium last week, market participants are anxiously waiting for the August Jobs Report, which will further illuminate the state of the labor market, a key factor in the Fed‚Äôs decision-making regarding a potential taper timeline. 

ADP, a leading human services and payroll management company, released their monthly private job report, which estimated that the US gained 374,000 jobs in August, far short of estimates of 600,000, though an improvement over 326,000 last month. Most of the new jobs came from leisure and hospitality, which added 201,000 positions in a somewhat hopeful sign that an industry beset by a labor shortage continues to recover. Education and health services combined to add 59,000, with employment dented by a surge in Delta variant cases. This sets a backdrop for the official August Jobs Report, set to be released on Friday. Economists estimate 756,500 jobs will be added, which would represent a slowdown compared to the 943,000 jobs added in July.

Mike Loewengart, managing director of investing strategy at E-Trade Financial, wrote in a note to clients, ‚ÄúThe private payroll numbers have been all over the map during the pandemic. But with so much pressure on improvement on the labor market front coming from the Fed, this could send a signal that jobs growth is stagnating. That‚Äôs likely a good thing for the markets, though, as it means easy money policy continues.‚Äù 

Members of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially close at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the ‚Äúsubstantial further progress mark‚Äù the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, ‚ÄúI think that one more good job report if it‚Äôs in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.‚Äù As I have said multiple times in the past, personally, I remain bullish even during tapering talk, I think the real test for equities will come when interest rate hikes start being discussed.

Because of that, we have an interest rate of 5% to pay it off over 3 years. But with mortgage rates so low right now, we're considering refinancing early (by about one year) to lower our rate. We don't know for sure how much we'd have to pay back, let alone what closing costs would be. But we have about $13k in savings and aren't sure what would be the best decision, since we'd like to replace all the floors in the house before selling again in a few years. 

Our current monthly payment is around $1850 and calculators estimate it would go down to about $1200 if we refinance. Plus, hour house value has gone up from 298k to about 375k, so we (likely) wouldn't have PMI anymore either.

CryptoCurrency,Compound interest - the investment MVP,"I don't hear this talked about nearly enough, so I'm sharing some well-worn knowledge, in the hope that it reaches a few new people. Feel free to add comments with information I may have missed here...

While compound interest has always and will always be relevant to savings and investments, combining it with the growth rate of Crypto provides genuine opportunity for people to make life-changing amounts of money in a relatively short time period.



**What is Compound Interest?**

Compound interest is the addition of interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit, or in other words, interest on interest. It is the result of reinvesting interest, rather than paying it out, so that interest in the next period is then earned on the principal sum plus previously accumulated interest.


**Explain that in simple terms, please!**

In the most basic of examples, imagine you had $100 held at 6% APR. After one year, you would have $106. However, with compound interest the APR applies to *all* funds, including *earned* interest, so in year 2 you would be making 6% on $106, which would mean an annual earning of $6.36.


**That's great and all, but it doesn't look like much of a difference.**

While after 1, or even 3 years the gains may not seem markedly different, there are two things to consider here. Firstly, that the longer you compound your gains for, the bigger the annual increase in interest will be, and second, the above example assumes that you never add to that initial $100 investment.

Depending on how much you are able to invest, it's not unreasonable to be able to provide yourself with a reasonable annual wage in interest alone, by the time you retire.


**Okay, let's see some examples - How rich can it make me?**

Here we'll look at a couple of examples of compound interest, starting with the most basic. Here are the assumptions:


\- $1000 initial buy-in

\- $100 a month deposit

\- Yearly compound (interest is folded into holdings once a year)

\- 10% interest (it is possible to stake crypto at this level, but YMMV.


Year 1 - $1000

Year 3 - $3,865

Year 5 - $9,327

**Year 10 - ¬£22,739**


Here you've deposited just $12,000 over ten years, and turned it into $23k - almost doubling your investment - earning interest of over $2,000 a year by year 10. This is assuming the Crypto you are staking does not change in price (up or down). *Any* increase in the value of the base asset would see these results improve significantly.


**Now let's look at a seriously bullish example**

If you want to see the most outlandish performance for compound interest, here is an example of a recently available liquidity pool where you can stake tokens for 66% APR, which is compounded daily (This effectively makes the interest rate 94% after compounding)

Let's assume you just have $1,000 and cannot afford to invest any more. You invest this amount and walk away for ten years. Assuming that the interest rate did not change during that time, this is what you would come back to...

Year 1 - $1000

Year 3 - $7,229

Year 5 - $27,031

**Year 10 - $730,727**

(earning over $350,000 in interest in year 10)


It's worth noting that any service that provides these interest rates are going to carry some very  significant risk, but my reason for showing it was to illustrate just how impactful compound interest can be.

Equally, it can be your worst enemy. If you have a mortgage, you are almost certainly at the negative end of compound interest. It's the reason that a 2-3% interest payment on a mortgage can amount to literally hundreds of thousands over a 20-30 year period, depending on the value of your property. (pro tip, always try to overpay your mortgage payments where you can, providing it doesn't cost you additional charges to do so!).

I won't link to any specific coins or programs here, as this isn't designed to be a shilling post - As always, you are advised to DYOR and look carefully at your options before staking or investing your Crypto. However, I would highly encourage everyone to look at the benefits and effects compound interest, as I genuinely think it's a life-changing mechanic if you can make the most of it.

For a look at what compound interest might mean for you, this is the calculator I used to help me with this post:  [Compound Interest Calculator - Daily, Monthly, Yearly Compounding (thecalculatorsite.com)](https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php)",cryptocurrency

CryptoMarkets,International Bitcoin (Gold) Standard?!,"# General Conclusion

&gt;Did you know how money was once backed by gold? That was called the International Gold Standard. Since Bitcoin is ""digital gold"", can we go back to the system and create an International Bitcoin Standard?

In this episode, we will uncover why Bitcoin will never play a role in the international monetary order. We do this by uncovering the various international monetary order the world has seen ‚Äî International Gold Standard, Bretton Woods, Plaza Louvre Accord.

# 1. Lessons Learnt from International Monetary Order (IMO)

We need an international monetary order to coordinate countries' monetary policy and macro-policies.How? We do that by having rules and countries must follow.At the end of the day, we need price stability and financial stability in an IMO.

# 2. Bitcoin's Role in IMO

Bitcoin has the function as a store of value due to people's believe in the price level. Yet, it is difficult to be a medium of exchange nor unit if account due to the price volatility.It will still function on a P2P level, but not on an international trade level. Because it is not meant to do so, as much as the neolibertarians would love for it to be true.

# 3. Why Bitcoin will never be part of IMO?

Bitcoin's in-code governance of monetary policy is unlike that of central banks. It does not have any nominal anchor to target price stability. So, it will be difficult for it to play a role in the IMO, and replace like the USD.Also, Bitcoin does not have a discretionary control over its monetary base (which is good!). So if we use Bitcoin like gold and have money backed by gold, it will work for a while until it stops working, like how the international gold standard failed.And because of that, other countries will not want to anchor their currencies to bitcoin. And you also do not see bitcoin anchoring the exchange rates to other countries due to the in-code governance. **TLDR**:Bitcoin's automated monetary policy does not have a nominal anchor and thus does not strive for price nor financial stability. It will continue to function on a P2P level, as it was meant to be. But not on an international trade and finance level, as it was not designed to do so",cryptocurrency

The government has increased penalties for food hoarding, but the shortages come as the country of 21 million battles a fierce coronavirus wave that is claiming more than 200 lives a day.

The economy shrank by a record 3.6 percent in 2020 because of the pandemic and in March last year the government banned imports of vehicles and other items, including edible oils and turmeric, an essential spice in local cooking, in a bid to save foreign exchange.

Importers still say they have been unable to source dollars to pay for the food and medicines they are allowed to buy.

Two weeks ago, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka increased interest rates in a bid to shore up the local currency.

Sri Lanka's foreign reserves fell to $2.8 billion at the end of July, from $7.5 billion in November 2019 when the government took office and the rupee has lost more than 20 percent of its value against the US dollar in that time, according to bank data.

Energy minister Udaya Gammanpila has appealed to motorists to use fuel sparingly so that the country can use its foreign exchange to buy essential medicines and vaccines.

A presidential aide has warned that fuel rationing may be introduced by the end of the year unless consumption was reduced.

CryptoCurrency,Unpopular Popular Opinion: Crypto is probably one of the best addictions you could have,"Obviously being obsessed about your health, diet and exercise is much better. But still. IMO Crypto is one of the better addictions that you could have. It's one of those things that will bring you a lot of good things, specially discipline and experience to take decisions under pressure.

A lot of addictions make you spend money on temporary things, things that will give you a short burst of serotonin/dopamine but will later create a desire to repeat the same process again and again, giving us a smaller psychological reward each time. 

If you are obsessed with crypto, not only are you constantly learning new things, processing news everyday, training your brain, but you are also investing in your future. You are investing in long-term assets (Unless you invest in some sort of CumSafeRocketMoonShot420, and even if you are, who knows, maybe it'll all work out).

People that are very serious about investing in crypto, start to become more disciplined, they cut some unnecessary expenses, and relocate that money to buy some more assets, they start thinking long term, looking at the bigger picture. 

Crypto gives you a mental stability, it gives you hope of upgrading your future. Of course it's hard at the start, but what isn't? We are talking about a revolutionary technology, so take your time, don't stress. Checking the charts every 2 minutes is a common thing between new investors, but even that phase will make you more disciplined, sooner or later you won't have that constant need.

Banks will give you shit interest rates, while staking crypto gives you some decent passive income if you plan on holding long term.

The future is bright, no matter how much you hold, you already made the correct first step.



Edit: Don't get me wrong. Excessive addiction is a bad thing. Don't invest what you can't afford. Always be careful ‚ö†Ô∏è",cryptocurrency

solar,New Solar System Question,"Currently going through process of getting Solar system quotes. I live in AZ.

The quotes I have received are for an 8.51 kW system with every quote being ~$30K (I plan on paying cash). 

All quotes have been competitive compared to eachother but when I google ‚Äúsolar cost per watt in Arizona‚Äù I find the average is ~$2.60 which is almost 30% less than what I have been quoted. I asked one of my prospective installers and he indicated that‚Äôs just the equipment cost and doesnt account for installation. 

I then decided to sign up for www.energysage.com to get some additional quotes and the first one I got was $2.30 per watt for cash option (this is not including fed and state tax incentive). 

Is that $2.30 per watt too good to be true or am I being gouged by the other quotes all around $3.50 per watt? All installers have roughly same google review ratings.

All quotes are for Tier 1 370w panels and Enphase IQ7+ Microinverters.",energy
CryptoCurrency,A good day for Crypto: Leading Global Digital Bank ‚ÄòEQIBank‚Äô Chooses Tezos For DeFi Offerings,"###

### EQIFI, EQIBank &amp; Tezos

Tezos has experienced tremendous  growth over the past months. With an ever-growing ecosystem of use-cases  and dApps, Tezos is processing millions of transactions per month. 

Last month over 3 million of those transactions were interactions with smart contracts. 

A growing group of popular applications are decentralized finance  (DeFi) dApps that allow users to interact with often lucrative financial  products in a decentralized manner. This growing industry on Tezos has  not gone unnoticed.¬†

[EQIFI](https://www.eqifi.com/%20), powered by the global digital bank [EQIBank](https://eqibank.com/),  has chosen Tezos to launch new yield and lending products.¬†

*EQIFI is a regulated and licensed decentralized finance platform and has chosen Tezos because  it is a leading Proof of Stake network with time-tested on-chain  governance, an active DeFi (decentralized finance) ecosystem, and a  global community of builders and creators.* 

*This new product launch cements EQIFI as a leader in the  DeFi space and as the world‚Äôs first seamless bridge to decentralized  finance.*

EQIFI will offer Tezos staking and  borrowing services to its global customer base. EQIFI is powered by  EQIBank, one of the world‚Äôs leading licensed and regulated digital  banks. 

EQIFI operates under a community-focused, decentralized standard through its native EQX token. 

This allows community members to provide input on decisions such as  listing and delisting assets and tokens, adjusting interest rates  according to the market, and modifying collateral limits.¬†

&gt;*‚ÄúA product offering with an industry leader such as Tezos  signifies the bar EQIFI is setting in the DeFi space. Providing exposure  to Tezos holders for staking and borrowing is just the next step in  positioning EQIFI to become an industry leader.‚Äù ‚Äì Jason Blick, Chairman  of EQIFI*  
 

EQIFI has been following the progress of the growing Tezos network for a while. They mentioned:

*Tezos is one of the original  Proof of Stake smart contract layer one blockchains. Since launching in  2017, it has successfully upgraded itself seven times, logged millions  of transactions, and attracted a vibrant, global community. Developers  are able to easily build powerful tools and products, while new users  can explore NFTs, DeFi and DAOs.*

personalfinance,Will I retroactively owe insurance premium deductions if OT pushes me into another deduction bracket?,"My workplace has been understaffed all year, and they‚Äôve encouraged all wage workers in the office to take as much OT as we like to make up the difference. While this isn‚Äôt a great situation to be in, I‚Äôve taken advantage of the fact that I‚Äôm stuck at home anyway and logged a ton of OT this year. 

I just realized that my OT is going to push me into a new bracket for insurance premium deduction. At my workplace, $67 is deducted from each paycheck if you make $55K-$100K, and $87 is deducted if you make $100K-$150K. I‚Äôve calculated forward and determined that I‚Äôll be in the second bracket this year, even if I work no more OT from here forward. But they‚Äôve been deducting the $67 based on my position‚Äôs salary.

I am now nervous I‚Äôll be hit with a ~$500 retroactive deduction once my pay crosses the $100K threshold. 

Is there common practice on this, or is every workplace different? Are these maybe ‚Äúmarginal,‚Äù in that they‚Äôd start deducting $87 once I cross the threshold, but not before?

I am going to reach out to HR, but just wondered if there‚Äôs a standard answer to this kind of question. I can afford the hit on a future paycheck if they take it, but I haven‚Äôt budgeted for it and would obviously prefer they didn‚Äôt.

4. The regulatory purge of stablecoins is getting into full swing now with Bloomberg running a piece on a DOJ criminal probe of the Tether founders. Of particular note for the Cardano ecosystem is that the first attack surface for regulators is the relationship of the stablecoin with legacy banking institutions. This is something that Cardano ecosystem stablecoin, Djed, may already fix with its own crypto backed reserve system.

28. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy ‚Äúsome things‚Äù minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
29. Cardano‚Äôs closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it‚Äôs EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We‚Äôll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano‚Äôs deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

30. Senators Toomey, Wyden, &amp; Lummis took to the Senate Floor to plead for a vote on their amendment which would fix the overly broad crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill.

31. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements. This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry!

35. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. Both revisions were good for Cardano since they included proof-of-stake implicitly and then explicitly.

I am in a horrible spot and I have ruined my life. I have an online sports gambling addiction that has ruined me. I am a 31 year old male in a large city in the southern United States. Please read this and understand that addictions are real.

Long story short I have been addicted to gambling online since I was 21 and had a paycheck. I have gambled away everything. I have somehow racked up ~$65,000 worth of current debt between badly refinanced car loan, credit cards, loans, and payday loans which shouldn‚Äôt be legal, but that‚Äôs not the point right now.

I have reached my lowest low. I need help. Today I finally blocked and shut down all my gambling accounts online (Bovada/sportsbook/betonline). 

I make good money and have the ability to repay most this money if not for the horrendous interest rates. I am a secondary math teacher and I coach 2 sports. My net pay after all taxes and deductions is over $4600/month. I also work a summer job that brings home $7000-9000 per summer as well. After taxes and all I clear $60,000 a year. So I have the means to pay things off if I can get help from others to pay down everything in the bad spot I am in.

Once again please no judgement for me asking this. Is there any sort of program where guarantors will pay off debt and a person can then pay them back over time instead? Basically, a program where everything gets paid off and I would then be responsible for paying the person back? Obviously I would be paying interest to the person, but it would help me rebuild my bad credit by clearing the debt off the books, while whoever pays things off can make a profit in the long run.

Example: They pay off $65,000 in debt for me, I pay then $2500/month for 34 months so they make back the $65000 + $20000 profit i. Just under 3 years. Something along those lines.

Basically I would be able to salvage credit, pay much much less than what I would owe to debtors, and the person investing would make a guaranteed profit in the long run. (23.5% ROI) I would be willing to be extremely transparent about all finances and spending over the time as well (no using a credit card, no taking out any debt etc)

This would be easily do for me based on my rent/bills and so on.
$4600/month broken down like this:
$1000 rent/bills
$2500 pay back
$500 living expenses (food/gas/occasional socializing)
$600 savings 

And for those wondering $500 to socialize and live on would be way more than what I do because well I used to gamble it away or pay horrendous interest.

Basically I have a plan, I just need a person to help me.

Sorry this turned into a weird ramble. I‚Äôm in a bad spot in my life. I have parents, brothers , friends, and a girlfriend who have no clue about this and I want to a way to fix it before I ruin my life for good. I don‚Äôt feel I can ever bring any of this up out of embarrassment and also it‚Äôll actually probably give my parents heart attacks (that‚Äôs not a joke). I want to get my life together before I ruin it for good because my girlfriend is the girl of my dreams.

So yeah all advice or directions welcome. And if you‚Äôre a rich person that ones to sponsor someone or help a good person out you can control my finances a few years along the way. Please reach out. Surely there‚Äôs some professional athlete, or tech giant, or someone who can help change a life for the better and make a small profit along the way. And yes I am going to look for counseling to help better myself.

Much love. 

Sincerely,

PHMGMLB (Please help me get my life back)",finance

I realize that in all my multiplayer PVP games, I prefer the start. When everyone struggle to get good units / weapons stuff. I found this way more fun &amp; it allows you to show ur skill better.  
Let me explain with somes examples 

\- DOTA2 &gt; I love early game when no one has gold items &amp; levels, where each placement or spell must be used correctly. So funny

\-APEX &gt; MaN those fist/P2020 fights when you just land are so cool :D, late game with red shields ultra stuffed weapons is retarded when every1 is just camping with Charge Rifles

\-RUST &gt; Primal Era is fucking cool mate, when everyone try to soft side wall or fight with crossbows / bows. This is madness :D NAked everywhere screaming

\-WARCRAFT3 &gt; I love the early counter creeping, towerrushing strats, fast expos or mass t1. Kinda oldschool i admit

\-CS &gt; Pistols rounds are ALWAYS my favourite.

\-WOW &gt; Twink on Warsong is the best way to play the game. At least back 8 years ago (mine was Troll War with enchant so fucking imba)

To be honest I think this is because I'm an old person now &amp; I cannot deal with too many informations / shortcuts. But man, early game is always cool",technology

CryptoCurrency,Yet to come: Banks as crypto facilitators,"It's against the spirit of crypto, but once banks ""bend the knee"" and start providing crypto services to the masses, I expect a significant jump in coin prices as more people will be able to join the cryptoverse without worrying about doing a ""wrong move"" and lose all of their life savings. 

We can't expect everybody to ""be their own bank"" as it comes with great responsibility and requires a certain not-so-basic level of technical knowledge. It also requires to spend considerable amount of time to buy/sell or follow the news and developments.

This may not be something happening soon, but when big and established banks fed up with losing cash to exchanges and decide to *milk* the crypto system, I feel like the value of our crypto portfolio will get multiplied real fast. (apart from the gradual and persistent increase of the coin prices that we experience every year) 

For those who are hesitant to enter crypto world, I just wanted to say that cryptocurrency is really in its **infancy** and significant gains are ahead of us. If several top coins' exponential increase in value in recent years is not convincing enough for you, just drop an insignificant amount of cash into your crypto piggy bank regularly, (like few dollars/euros/pesos/yens every week or two). In a year or two, you will most probably be one of the most enthusiastic supporters of crypto when you see what happened to your insignificant and expendable investment.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Paying Down Debt versus Investing,"Hello all,

Just trying to see what your advice would be in my situation. Currently 30 and married (to 26). Our gross salary is 125k combined annually before taxes and expect that to go up to 140-150k by the end of 2022. 

Currently our debts are:

Short term debt

* 2.5k credit card 0% 

Long term debt

* My student loans 33k @ 5-6.8%
* My vehicle 27.5k @ 3.74%
* Spouse student loan 6.5k @ 4.5%
* Spouse vehicle 33k @ 2.2%
* Mortgage 116k @ 3.875% (thinking about moving shortly so don't want to refinance)

Investments / Liquidity

* 75k combined in 401k 
* 20k in assets with decent liquidity 
* 3.5k in cash 

So here's my question - with the extra cash every month should I be focusing that towards either paying down student loans with it being my highest interest rate, vehicle loans (since student loans are a bit more forgiving if trouble happens), starting a ROTH/putting more in 401k, or building my cash fund? My current thoughts are paying down student loans first, then focusing on my vehicle. After that heavily going into cash and ROTH/401K 50/50.

Thoughts?

Edit: My current 401k rate is 17% after employer match.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"I investigated how many coins you can actually buy with 20, $100, and $1000 on 11 US crypto platforms, accounting for both fees and the spread","I investigated how many coins you can actually buy with 20, $100, and $1000 on 11 US crypto platforms, accounting for both fees and the spread

------------------

**Results**: https://i.imgur.com/sUhXAQe.png

**Summary**:

* **Top Tier**: Kraken (Pro) &gt; Gemini ActiveTrader &gt; Coinbase Pro &gt; Binance US (Basic)
* **Mid-Top Tier**: BlockFi, Kraken (Instant Buy) [, Robinhood, PayPal]
* **Mid-Bottom Tier**: FTX US
* **Bottom Tier**: Coinbase (normal), Gemini (normal)
* (**Not compared**: Binance (Advanced and International), Nexo, Celsius, Voyager, CDC)

------------------

These charts compare how each platform differs for total costs, which include **both fees and the hidden spread**. While fees are usually reported by the platforms, you can only determine the actual spread and spot price by making/simulating a purchase.

I took a look at how many coins (BTC, ETH, ADA, LTC, LINK, USDC, USDT) you can buy with $20, $100, and $1000 in USD on 11 different platforms available in the US. To do so, I had to open accounts, go through full KYC, and fund each account with at least $1000 to preview each purchase. Results are the average of 3 trials designed to minimize price fluctuations. (Methodology included at bottom of post.)

This post only covers purchasing coins from Fiat and stablecoins. It does not cover swaps and withdrawals, which are a different topic and subject to different fees.

There are 2 tables in the image:

* **1st table**: Amount of coins purchased using $20, $100, $1000 USD (or the platform's stablecoin). Higher is better.
* **2nd table**: Percent fewer coins received compared to the best rate among the listed exchanges. Lower is better.

**Commentary**:

* Not surprisingly, fee differences are more pronounced for smaller purchases than for larger purchases. Differences could vary up to 8% for $20 purchases but only up to 2% for $1000 purchases.
* **Kraken**, **Gemini ActiveTrader**, and **Coinbase Pro** had the best rates. However, their normal (Level 1) counterparts had much worse rates. There's such a huge difference that they must be making so much money from casual investors using the non-Pro versions.
* Since **Gemini/Gemini AT** also offers 10 free monthly withdrawals, it often considered the best choice for funding other off-platform accounts. The downside of Gemini is that it has a limited selection of coins. You also have to enable ActiveTrade in the settings to be able to use it. It's very simple to enable and disable ActiveTrade in the settings. Unlike Coinbase Pro, Gemini and Gemini AT share the same account balance. Compared to Coinbase Pro and Kraken, Gemini AT's UI was much easier to use. (Gemini AT was the only platform in my table that didn't include fees within the subtotal, so I had to subtract the coin value of the fees manually.)
* **Kraken (Pro)** is the trading platform version of their product available via their main Trading page. The fees are much, much lower than that of any other platform across the board. I like that both Kraken (Pro) and Kraken Instant Buy show the most precision during purchases among all the platforms. In their documentation, Kraken (Pro) states that their taker fees range ""from 0% to 0.26%"", but in reality, it's probably averages closer to 0% based on another comparison I did.
* **Kraken (Instant Buy)** was ok for low-value purchases, but it doesn't get discounts for high-value purchases. You're basically paying the same higher fees no matter the amount. It shares the same balance as Kraken (Pro), so you might as well use Kraken's main trading page instead of Instant Buy.
* **Coinbase Pro** also has excellent rates, but its website is a bit convoluted. One thing I didn't like is that it's the only Level 2 platform in the chart that has separate balances for its normal and Pro versions. You can transfer funds between Coinbase Pro and Coinbase without fees, but I always end up having dust leftover, which is painful for anyone with OCD.
* **Binance US** has a minimum of $20 per transaction. Rates were a little worse than Coinbase Pro's. It has a smaller selection of coins and features than its bigger international version, but it's still a big selection. Note that these rates are for their Basic trading platform with 0.5% taker fees, not the Advanced version with 0.1% taker fees. The **Advanced version** should perform almost identically to Kraken (Pro) based on its reported fees and a couple of test purchases. The differences are almost as small as minute-to-minute price fluctuations. (Unfortunately, there isn't a way to preview purchases for the Advanced version, and I'm not going to make 50+ purchases just to test it, so I've left that version out of the chart. I don't entirely trust Binance US's reported taker fee structure because their actual rates seem to be slightly higher than reported.)
* **BlockFi** did impressively well considering that it's a lending platform instead of a dedicated exchange. They also offer 1 free stablecoin and 1 free non-stablecoin withdrawal monthly. Its lending interest rates have fallen recently compared to other lending platforms like Celsius, Ledn, Nexo, etc., so a lot of their customers are currently eyeing other lending platforms.
* **Robinhood** offers very few coins (BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC). Ignoring all the drama about storing ""NYKNYC"" crypto on those platforms and how RH treats their customers, their rates are quite good and on par with that of Binance US and Coinbase Pro. However, it is a trap! I lowered their tier because they have a ridiculously up-to-5% spread when selling crypto, so their platform is like a bait and switch.
* **PayPal and Venmo**: In terms of coin selection, fees, and rates, they are completely identical to each other. They both use Paxos Crypto Brokerage for the backend. Their fees do not scale well compared to that of other platforms.
* **FTX US** has the worst website UI among the Level 2 trading platforms I examined. For small purchases, purchasing power was only displayed to 1 significant figure, making it practically useless for determining value. $20 of BTC was showing up as the same as $24 of BTC: 0.0004. It also lacked a lot of alt coins found on Binance US and Coinbase. For small purchases, it had much worse rates than all other Level 2 trading platforms, but it was on par for larger purchases. Their website's search is also broken. And, it takes 15 days to withdrawal Fiat even at Level 2 Identity Verification. I can't recommend them when they have these many issues.
* **Coinbase (normal)** and **Gemini (normal)** were the opposites of their Pro versions and had the highest fees. I'm surprised how big of a difference there was. So if you want to avoid fees, don't use the normal versions of their exchange for purchasing coins. There is one thing I really like about Coinbase: you can occasionally earn free coins from taking short 2-4 minute lessons on random coins.

**Other platforms I left out**:

* **Voyager** is a mobile-open app (like crypto.com), and I'm not a fan of mobile-only apps. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to trade on it because my account is still being verified after so many days. Their app said that it could take up to 12 weeks, and I can't wait that long.
* **Nexo** has one of the nicest-looking websites and highest lending interest rates. I only took 10 minutes for them to approval advanced verification once I completed it. Unfortunately, I have to do a $10+ wire transfer (in addition to bank fees) from my bank to fund the account since ACH isn't yet available. So Nexo runs in the same issue as Celsius Network where it's better to fund your account from coins transferred from other platforms with free withdrawals (e.g. Gemini or BlockFi).
* For **Celsius Network**, you have to go through a 3rd-party, Gem, which charges the most ridiculously-high fees ($30 fee for buying $10 of coins--I'm not joking). So instead, everyone just transfers their coins to Celsius from other platforms. It would be unfair to blame them for their 3rd-party provider. FWIW, it's great that Celsius doesn't charge trading or transfer fees. I've chosen not to compare Nexo and Celsius until they support ACH or a better way for funding accounts directly from fiat.
* I listed **Crypto.com**, a mobile-only app in the US, in the [original comparison](https://i.imgur.com/q8zOGtc.png) but removed it because a few members of their community were salty ~~that I was including their expensive 3% for buying coins via debit~~ or ~~that they were at the bottom of the list~~ or ~~that I was not using ACH push from my own bank's website to fund my account~~ or that I was not using their trading exchange, which isn't available in the US. Every time I fixed something including the fees, they found something else to complain about. So to avoid descending into a bottomless pit, I've left them out of this comparison. The sub is too cult-like.

**Methodology**: For each set, I determined the final amount of coins, including the cost of fees and spread, that I would receive for spending $x on each of the crypto platforms. I repeated this 3 times per set (and averaged) to normalize for price fluctuations, each time randomizing the order of platforms. Price fluctuations were within 0.1% per trial because I could finish a set within a minute. Repeat again for each of the 7 coins and each dollar amount ($20, $100, $1000) for a total of ~160 sets. For Level 2 trading platforms, I used the market price. I did notice that the spot price floated +/- 0.05% between most Level 2 platforms, so it's pointless to try to get anymore precision than 0.1%. One platform might be more expensive than the other by 0.05% and then cheaper the next moment. The ""USDC*"" column actually represents USDC / BUSD / GUSD (i.e. any sponsored stablecoin of that platform). I also didn't use any discounts you get from staking platform-specific tokens or from promotions. It's not perfect, and I'll make corrections when appropriate.

------------------------

**Update 1**: I added 3 platforms (Kraken Pro, RH, PayPal) and removed 2 of them (Celsius &amp; CDC). I also changed the lowest value from $10 to $20 since Binance US's minimum is $20. Instead of doing 1 trial per set, I did 3 per set.

**Update 2**: There's a 2nd chart that goes along with this that compares the actual fees I found in the first chart vs the fees reported by each platform's documentation: https://i.imgur.com/MtBTjSV.png . You can't always trust documentation.

**Update 3**: I got the Kraken website all mixed up. What I originally called ""Kraken (normal)"" was actually Kraken Instant Buy. Kraken Pro is actually what's used when you visit their main Trading page.

Fees in Binance US, Coinbase (non-Pro), and Gemini (non-AT) seem to be a little higher (0.5% to 0.8%) than what they're reporting in documentation. In fact, all the fees on the other platforms seem to be 0.2% higher than expected. This suggests that I overestimated the 0.26% correction I made based on Kraken Pro having the lowest fees.

Kraken Pro states that their taker fees range ""from 0% to 0.26%"", but in reality, it's very likely closer to 0%.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,[Begginer's Guide] How to avoid scams and invest safely,"This are the top 5 investment schemes that people fall for:

1. Advanced fee scheme: scammer tries to convince the victim to send money (to pay gas fees for example, or trade for you and make a profit) and claims he will repay you an enormous amount of money for your help. Spoiler alert: he isn't.

2.Boiler room scam: using unfair or dishonest sales tactics. Someone sets up a fake company (usually trading company) and promises low fees/high interest rates. Once you have deposited you will never be able to retire your money, so only use trustworthy exchanges and store your crypto on a cold wallet.

3.Fake Guru (investment seminar scum): self-proclaimed millionaires claim they have discovered the secret to get crazy rich crazy fast. They only want you to buy their course/seminar/textbook so they can make a buck. Once you fail with you own money they will tell you it was your fault and that you must have done something wrong when trading at 125x leverage or doing the high risk-high reward stuff they encourage. Think about it, if they really had an easy way to get rich, why sell it to you and not use it?

4.Pump n' dump scheme: they are the most known. Usually organizated through chat rooms in telegram for example, this schemes target small market cap tokens/coins/shitcoins in order to move the price as demand rises exponentialy for a few minutes. They promise guaranteed returns as other people (bots, big investment firms etc) will jump into and buy when they see the price rises. In reality the organizers of the sheme have already bought a sizable amount of this coin and sell it to you once everyone involved raises the price. In a matter of minutes/seconds the price returns to normal and you lose most of your money.

5.Ponzi scheme: finally the most referenced but least understood. They usually promise incredibly high returns ""guaranteed"" (really high APY). You feel the hype for this great opportunity and call friends, family or coworkers so they don't miss this opportunity. In reality, no value is being generated and investors are paid using money that they/other people have put into the project. Once this blows up, those that ""bought high"" or ""entered late"" are literally left with nothing. They might keep going as people keep joining but eventually the scheme runs out of money or cashes out. 
The pyramid scheme is a variation of the scheme in which you are paid more if you bring other people to the scheme.",cryptocurrency

**What is Algorand:**  
 

Algorand is Silvio Micali‚Äôs envisioned solution to the blockchain ‚ÄúTrilemma‚Äù ‚Äì security, scalability, and decentralization. It leverages Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS), which achieves consensus by leveraging the following sequence of events:

1. Block Proposal: Accounts propose new blocks to the network

2. Soft Vote: Committee votes on proposals and filters down to one

3. Certify Vote: Separate committee votes to certify the block

4. Each node receives a certificate for the block and writes it to the ledger

5. New round is initiated and process starts over with new block proposers and voters 

This differs from other PoS chains for a couple reasons. First, to improve security, Algorand uses cryptographic sortition - which allows a set of users to secretly select themselves to participate in Algorand‚Äôs consensus protocol, without them being known to anyone else‚Äîincluding potential adversaries. Second, the ‚ÄúPure‚Äù in PPoS implies consensus participants are free to come and go as they please ‚Äì with Algos not locked up or ‚Äúbonded‚Äù for any period of time.

Another note ‚Äì Algorand has traditionally incentivized participation by issuing participation rewards on every block (generally averaged out to \~5.7% for holding Algo). This is changing over the next few months, as Algorand rolls out their governance program. Beginning October 1st, Algo holders will be able to commit Algos (1 algo per 1 vote) into governance, and will be rewarded for participation in voting. As a note ‚Äì ‚Äúcommitted‚Äù algo aren‚Äôt locked, and can be sold during governance, with the ramification of not incurring governance rewards. Depending on how many total Algos are committed ‚Äì these new rewards can range from 12% (4b total committed) to 30%+ (1b or below total committed). These rewards will be in addition to the normal \~5.7% participation rewards from Oct-Dec, which will end following this first governance cycle.

**Algorand‚Äôs Ecosystem/Roadmap:**  


From a high-level, Algorand‚Äôs marketing efforts target enterprises (state/business) and large institutions to inspire top-down adoption (see their head of marketing‚Äôs (Keli Callaghan) recent AlgoFest interview - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aqMVsXVS3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aqMVsXVS3s)). This differs largely from the grassroots marketing/adoption efforts conducted by other chains ‚Äì with marketing often geared towards consumer adoption first (via AirDrops, weekly AMAs, high-levels of community engagement). The top-down approach has flaws ‚Äì it can limit the growth of the ecosystem (DEXs, swaps, total transaction counts and related growth of confidence in the tech), it‚Äôs much slower (enterprises don‚Äôt just adopt ‚Äì they do research, analysis, testing, etc). As a result, and relative to other chains, Algorand‚Äôs peer-to-peer ecosystem has grown at a much slower pace, which serves as one contributing factor towards slower price growth. To combat this, Algorand has set aside significant amounts of funding ‚Äì and hosts/attends a significant amount of blockchain events ‚Äì to inspire devs to build the tools required to promote ecosystem growth. The top-down approach also has benefits. There‚Äôs an opportunity cost incurred when marketing/development efforts are focused on a grassroots marketing campaign ‚Äì largely, you risk over-developing and over-committing resources towards solutions that benefit a niche population at the expense of mass adoption. Anyone that‚Äôs done strategy development/implementation understands the complexities involved to successfully nest a major technological progression into enterprise-level goals/objectives ‚Äì it takes a significant amount of resourcing, team authority, and synthesis among various stakeholders. As a biased Algorand holder ‚Äì this is where I hope their top-down marketing/influence attempts, paired with their team authority in the field, pay off.

**Deep Dive: Algorand‚Äôs Tokenomics**  


Here‚Äôs where most of the confusion seems to be ‚Äì and admittedly, this took a while to wrap my head around.. and I'm still not confident in why some discrepancies exist in circulating supply counts. Algorand is relatively new (founded in 2017 but not launched until June 2019), and as such, is still relatively early in its distribution schedule.

As of today, \~3.0b (30%) of the total Algo supply has been injected into the circulation through the inaugural auction in June 2019 and then via community rewards, Early Backer / Relay Node Runner reward vesting, grant funding, and structured sales. This 3b number will likely ruffle feathers ‚Äì as algoexplorer.io lists circulating supply as 5.7b. I believe this discrepancy is due to pending future participation rewards and early backer/relay node runner rewards counting as circulating.. although I‚Äôm honestly not sure. If someone has a concrete answer there ‚Äì please post. Until then, I‚Äôm using \~3.0b which is listed in Algorand‚Äôs most recent official Economic Evolution Report (Sep 2021) on page 2.

Algorand‚Äôs Economic Evolution Report (Sept 2021 ‚Äì linked below) breaks down historical distribution ‚Äì and uses charts that I recommend you view. 

The Algo market started with an initial tiny supply, so that subsequent reward flows, represented mainly by participation rewards (paid to all holders) and first-node-runner rewards (paid to the initial supporters that had invested in the project and committed to run relay nodes), had a disproportionate inflationary impact. This led to the need to introduce some early reforms to tokenomics. 

First, participation rewards were stabilized compared to the initial distribution trend, until market conditions, almost one year later, allowed them to restart growing. Second, the vesting plan was changed, first by pausing vesting for several months (EIP-09092019PC and EIP-10182019), and later (EIP-11252019AF) by introducing a new vesting agreement shifting payments to node runners to the further future and allowing in return a contingent increase and a possible acceleration, but the latter only when the market will be sufficiently mature for smooth absorption. This second piece is where I see the most confusion ‚Äì and is generally call ‚Äúaccelerated vesting‚Äù for the ‚Äúearly backers/relay node runners‚Äù. I‚Äôll copy out of the official proposal ‚Äì EIP-11252019AF (and then explain after):

////////

**Variables:**  
  A: a fixed award amount, set to 0.0015 (0.15%) of the Node Runner‚Äôs original total vesting amount  
  **DAB** (‚Äúdaily acceleration base‚Äù): a moving parameter, initially set to $0.30.  
  **MAd**: 30-day moving average of the Algo price in US dollars on day d

Each day, Algos vest, in an amount that is 1/365 of the yearly amount specified in the base rate.

On day **d**, if the moving average **MAd** is larger than **DAB**:

The Node Runner receives additional Algos in an amount proportional to the difference between **MAd** and **DAB**, and the number of days **d** that have elapsed since the start of the program.

Specifically, on day d, with moving average **MAd** and daily acceleration base **DAB**, the additional amount of Algos will be **A\*(MAd - DAB)\*d.**

The parameter **DAB** is updated to **MAd**

3. The distribution terminates when the Node Runner has received 125% of its original allocation.

////////

So.. lots of words to essentially say ‚Äì additional algo‚Äôs will be distributed to the early backers/relay node runners when the **MAd** (current 30-day moving average of Algo price) is higher than the **DAB** (which started at .30 but has since progressed to the most recent highest 30-day moving average). The amount distributed is **.15% \* (MAd ‚Äì DAB) \* day**. It‚Äôs important to note a couple things here:

1 ‚Äì The total ALGO max supply is 10b. This accelerated vesting could account for up to 3.125b (original 2.5b + 25% contingent) ‚Äì and ends after those Algo are distributed. 

2 ‚Äì From the Sep ‚Äô21 Economic Evolution Report ‚Äì ‚ÄúAs a result of acceleration, on June 16, essentially 2 years after launch, when the original vesting program was supposed to be completed, around **2BN** had actually been distributed, almost 80% of the original predicted amount..‚Äù this implies that **no more than 1.25b** remains to be distributed as part of the price-sensitive accelerated vesting program.

3 ‚Äì From a personal standpoint ‚Äì I don‚Äôt see the *accelerated vesting* portion of this as a bad thing. Top down adoption requires a certain stability and lack of investor craze ‚Äì this helps with that. That said, the sheer number of Algo distributed to the early backer/relay node runners is over 30% of the total supply, giving a relatively small group of organizations a large amount of governance ability. This is one of the largest issues I see with Algorand present day.

Beyond the accelerated vesting ‚Äì the remainder of the tokenomics seem easy to explain: 

Participation Rewards ‚Äì 2.5b   
Early Backers Relay Nodes - 2.5b + Contingent Incentives (\~1.2b)  
Total ‚Äì **6.2b**

Innovation Fund - 400 M  
Protocol R&amp;D and Capital Markets Innovation - 400 M  
Foundation Algo Grant Program (with community voting) - 250 M  
Research and Social Good Program - 200 M  
Total ‚Äì **1.25b**

Algorand Inc - 2000 M  
Algorand Foundation - 500 M  
Already Injected for operations and ecosystem - 50 M  
Total ‚Äì **2.55b**

= **10b**

This distribution schedule started in 2019 and runs through 2030 ‚Äì there‚Äôs an extremely valuable bar graph on Algorand‚Äôs official tokenomics page (linked below). Couple key points ‚Äì the majority of distribution happens from now to 2026, with only \~1b distributed from 2026-2030. We're currently \~30% through total distribution..  and lastly governance voting will likely steer future consideration of coin distribution. Running out of steam here - but I hope you made it this far, and I hope this is valuable.

CryptoCurrency,"Mark Spitznagel of ""Black Swan"" Fund gives a mixed view on crypto","[https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/boss-black-swan-fund-predicts-122549954.html](https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/boss-black-swan-fund-predicts-122549954.html)

&amp;#x200B;

Mark Spitznagel is the boss of the ""Black Swan"" Fund.

&amp;#x200B;

He talks about how bad the fiat is:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;4. ""The Federal Reserve is manipulating the most important information parameter in the economy, and that's the interest rates."" - *Spitznagel described financial markets as a ""homeostatic system"" that responds to corrective feedback, and said the Fed was messing with the system by keeping interest rates artificially low, incentivizing people to borrow instead of save.*  
&gt;  
&gt;5. ""When you drive on ice, you have this delayed feedback so that when you do something, nothing happens until all of a sudden it does. That's what central-bank interventions do to this homeostatic system, they delay it and they concentrate it through time."" - *Spitznagel said delaying the corrective process would worsen the inevitable crash.*

&amp;#x200B;

So he is definitely not a friend of fiat.

&amp;#x200B;

He DOES like Crypto:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;8. ""Cryptocurrencies are a fundamentally terrific idea, and I'm aligned with the thinking behind them - the destruction of our money through the actions of central banks, and the dangers of the banking system as a result of that.""

&amp;#x200B;

He does see crypto as a threat to fiat.

&amp;#x200B;

But then he turns around and FUDs:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;9. ""It's turned itself into a casino, which is a very bad idea. It's killing the golden goose in many ways. It's massively noisy and not a very safe haven at all."" - *discussing crypto's value as a safe haven.*",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Paying off Student Loans with 401k?,"I'm not great at finances. But the way I'm looking at it, it might make sense to pay off all my student loans in one go by withdrawing my 401k, even with the penalties. 

Here's my caveman math. I'm sure I'm missing things, but if anyone has the knowledge and math to help me out that would be so awesome...

* 401k:
   * **Total funds = $65k**
   * Monthly returns (this year, not including self and employer contributions) = $1.1k
   * The starting amount this year = $50.9k 
   * My caveman math tells me I'm getting a **monthly interest/return rate of \~2%**
* Student Loans
   * **Total amount = $15.6k**
   * 6 loan groups at: 
      * $4.6k @ 6.8% interest rate
      * $4.3k @ 3.4%
      * $2.1k @ 6.8%
      * $3k @ 3.68%
      * $1.1k @ 3.68%
      * $0.6k @ 4.66%

I've read on Investopedia that federal loans do not compound interest (is this true?). Regardless, my inner caveman math is telling me that **since I'm paying a much higher interest rate on my loans every month (and that interest amount is prioritized in my loan payments; i.e. the interest amount is paid first, then the principle), the smrt thing to do is pay off all these student loans in one, big payment using my 401k money, which makes a lesser rate of return, even though the monetary returns in my 401k is more than the monthly loan payment**. This includes the 10% penalty fee for withdrawing that 401k money (penalty = 10% of money withdrawn, which would be \~$1.5k). 

Once that loan interest no longer exists, I can reallocate my loan payments towards my 401k and, in the long-term avoid flushing money towards the loan interest.

personalfinance,Cannabis Stock Transfer,"If this isn't the right forum, I apologize.  Kindly point me in the general direction.

A while back, through Regulation A+, I participated in a pre-IPO offering for a cannabis stock.  I was awarded a number of shares and also some warrants.  The stock went public a few months back, and I have a statement from a stock transfer company stating a book entry for X shares.  Since they are now public, I could buy them on the secondary market through my broker.

In the past, whenever I had IPO shares, I'd transfer them to my brokerage account, and that would be the end of it.  I'd be able to hold or sell them to my heart's content.  When I sell, I'd pay my tax or take a loss on next year's taxes.

In attempting that with these particular shares in this particular situation, my broker tells me that because a) it's a cannabis stock, and b) I bought them on primary market, with proceeds going directly to the company, US law prohibits me from transferring them to a broker, because, well, Reefer Madness.  I'm US based, and the company is Canadian.

My broker also told me that they could accept shares in this company if I were to a) sell them on secondary market, and b) immediately by them back.  Of course, it seems to me, that in order to sell them, I'd have to transfer them to somewhere first, and my broker just told me that wasn't possible, so I see a catch-22 here.

I suppose I could wait until US Federal law changes, and then transfer them, but that brings the warrants into play.  If I exercise the warrants, and US law doesn't change, then I'm out even more money.

Am I missing something here?  It's not a lot of money, and I don't need it immediately, but I didn't consider the fact that they are shares from a primary market would be that big a deal. I'm a bit cheesed off that even if it were possible to sell my shares and buy them back, that I'd need to pay taxes on that transaction, but this is secondary to the fact thay I can't simply transfer my shares.",finance

personalfinance,Creative financing: Manhattan condo,"I'm thinking about buying a condo and financing the purchase not just through a mortgage, but also through a pledge-asset line (also called margin loan).

I would take up a regular mortgage for about 50% of the purchase price (at around 3.15% interest rate), and make a downpayment on the rest, using a line of credit backed by my brokerage account (at about 1.15% interest). The loan-to-value for that would be kept at 50% (the brokerage accepts up to 70% LTV and would margin-call with a 5-day fuse if it goes below that). Selling the securities would incur a very substantial tax bill for me, as they have appreciated quite a bit. The securities are growth-type ETFs and mutual funds, such as VDIGX and VUG.

I have enough income to service the loans and any condo fees. However, I would plan on investing this income and taking out sufficient funds to service the loans against my margin line, keeping the LTV at around 50%. This would, over time, shift the financing toward the cheaper margin loan. I expect the investment portfolio to grow, with time, of course.

I would like to get some input here. Is this a typical way of financing RE? Any caveats?

So it is very interesting to me what do you think about his printing and QE - do you really worry about the potential negative impacts on the market and economy or you are calm and are sure the guy is doing the right things?

CryptoCurrency,High Level Overview: IOTA - a short squeeze,"I found a really good summary of the short squeeze with IOTA, i wanted to share because it gives great info, credit to u/kutkraft .

 **Short sellers (Hedgers)**

* Short Sell = Establish Margin &gt; Borrow Asset &gt; Sell Asset &gt; Buy Asset Back &gt; Return Asset
* Shorters think the price of something will go down, and they want to profit from their hunch.
* Assume the short seller has **margin account** on an exchange that allows short selling and lending.
* The exchange requires he put up a deposit (a **margin**) to his **margin account** before he can **borrow (loan)** an amount of IOTA.
* The margin might be something like 50% of the IOTA value he is looking to borrow. More or less? I dunno..

**Margin Example:** He wants to borrow 1000 MIOTA to sell at $1 ($1000 worth of IOTA) - the exchange needs him to deposit $500 to his margin account to begin the loan process. He puts in the $500.

**The Loan:** The condition of the 'IOTA' loan is that it gets paid back in 'IOTA'. The loan conditions come with fees, time constraints, and interest rates.

**The Sale:** He receives the IOTA loan and sells the 1000 MIOTA at a rate of $1 per MIOTA, receiving $1000 to the margin account after the sale.

*Liability -- Now he is liable to return the 1000 MIOTA at some point in the future. He is not liable for the $1000.*

**Opening Buy Positions:** He thinks the price of IOTA will drop to 0.25c, so he opens some positions from his margin account to buy back the 1000 MIOTA at a price that is lower than what he sold them for ($1).

He'll sprinkle buy positions around 0.25c until he gets the 1000 MIOTA back, so he can return the 1000 MIOTA, and close the loan.

He thinks he can buy back the 1000 MIOTA for $250, profiting $750 after having sold them for $1000.

**Exchanges must publicly note when something is a 'short position'.**

**Squeezing the Short.**

* Short sellers exit their positions by buying the asset (IOTA) back and returning the asset to the lender (exchange). They need to buy it back, cos the loan is tied to the asset (IOTA) and not the fiat.
* When SSB galaxy brains catch on that unreasonable amounts of short positions have been taken on a stronk asset, they sound off about wtf is happening.
* A mass buy event begins, where new money floods in. Everyone buys in quickly (usually at market), driving the price up. The bros buy and hodl. This increases upward pressure on price, because the new money aint sellin. Then more bros come in, buy and hodl. Price goes up.
* This is bad for the short seller, he thought he would be able to buy 1000 MIOTA back at around 0.25c - but now it's worth $1.40
* The loan expires in 2 days, and the price keeps rising. He panics and closes his positions at 0.25c - instead he buys back ASAP at $1.40 to cut his losses (fknlol)
* This further reinforces the price, since shorters are buying back in higher than what they sold for, maybe at market.
* The newbros who bought into the squeeze are now benefiting from creating a feedback loop.
* They drove the price up &gt; short sellers forced to panic buy at higher prices &gt; price goes up again",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Which Loan Should I Choose: 15-yr term (w/ 30-yr amort.) at 2.375% or 30-yr term/amort at 2.75%?,"I‚Äôm trying to decide on a primary residence refinance loan (no cash out). Here are my choices: 
Option #1 
- 15 year term loan with a 30 year amortization schedule (so a balloon amount is due at 15 years) 
- Interest rate is 2.375% 
- No points

Option #2 
- 30 year fixed rate term loan with a 30 year amortization schedule 
- Interest rate is 2.75% 
- No points 
- mos. payment is $167 more than the 15 year loan

Here is more context on my situation: 
- I plan on keeping the house forever 
- My current loan is a 7/1 ARM at 2.875% that will start floating in 2024 
- Loan balance is $850,000 (house is worth $2.6M) 
- I don‚Äôt want to pay down the loan any more than necessary

Here is how I‚Äôm currently thinking about it. I was trying to take advantage of the historic low interest rate environment by getting locked into a long term low rate. However, I‚Äôm intrigued at the 15 year option because it is a really low rate. On the other hand, I would appreciate the peace of mind in getting a 2.75% rate locked in for 30 years.

From a math perspective, I would pay $40k more in interest costs for the 2.75% 30 year loan during the first 15 years. If I pick the 15 year loan, my balance at the end of 15 years would be $500k. In order to ‚Äúbreak even‚Äù with the 30-year loan interest costs, I would have to find another 15 year loan at 3.75%. Any interest rate higher than that, then my total interest costs over 30 years would exceed the interest costs for 30 year loan at 2.75%.

What do you think I should do? How should I be thinking about this?",finance
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, September 3, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, September 3, 2021**

Stocks finished the day mixed, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) falling while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) pushed higher, closing 0.31% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 0.46%. Market participants are digesting the release of the August Jobs Report, which showed a sharp deceleration in employment amid the latest surge by the coronavirus Delta variant. 

The Labor Department released their monthly unemployment report, which showed hiring in August slow down dramatically as the US continues to battle massive spikes in coronavirus Delta cases in certain parts of the country, mainly the South/Southeast (according to the CDC, roughly ‚Öì of all COVID-related hospitalizations are in Texas and Florida as both states deal with record coronavirus cases and low hospital capacity). Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous month‚Äôs numbers. Here are the numbers.

* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July
* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July
* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July 
* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July

President Biden said of the report, ‚ÄúWhile I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what we‚Äôve seen this year in continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.‚Äù

This is a little confusing but follow me here. In a weird quirk of the market, the low employment numbers actually benefit equities by staving off the need for tapering, which is why we saw tech stocks in particular popping today. Members of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially close at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the ‚Äúsubstantial further progress mark‚Äù the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, ‚ÄúI think that one more good job report if it‚Äôs in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.‚Äù Regardless, as I have said before, I remain unconcerned by taper talks, I think the real test for equities will come when discussion about potential interest rate hikes begins.

Steve Sosnick, Chief Strategist at Interactive Brokers, said of the report ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre seeing is the market really trying to wrestle with the idea of what matters to it more: Is it about the economy, or is it about monetary policy? Now, we‚Äôve been in a monetary-driven market for so long it‚Äôs hard to say that monetary factors aren‚Äôt at the forefront of the market‚Äôs mindset right now. But what I think we may be seeing here ‚Ä¶ we can‚Äôt really figure out whether this delays tapering in a meaningful way. But there‚Äôs stuff in here that is not necessarily bad other than the headline number. Wages are good, the unemployment rate is good.‚Äù

**Highlights**

* Moderna (MRNA), Workday (WDAY), Nvidia (NVDA) were among the best-performing stocks in the Nasdaq today, driving it higher.
* US auto safety regulators disclosed they are investigating a July 26 fatal crash involving a Tesla that may or may not have been using the advanced driver assistance system. This is the latest regulatory headache for Tesla and their autonomous driving technology given there is already another investigation currently underway.
* Dish‚Äôs (DISH) Sling TV, which reportedly has 2.7 million subs as of December 2020, has partnered with Penn National Gaming (PENN) to launch a Barstools Sports Channel on its streaming service. 
* Match Group (MTCH), which owns popular dating app Tinder, filed a letter with Dutch competition regulators to public state their decision regarding a complaint filed against Apple for anti-competitive practices for forcing Match to use Apple‚Äôs in-app payment system. Ever since Fortnite-maker Epic Games‚Äô original lawsuit against Apple regarding this seems more and more companies are hopping on. A new South Korean law that was recently passed forces Apple and Google to accept third-party payment systems.
* Amid regulatory crackdown and a falling stock price, Alibaba (BABA) committed to spending the equivalent of roughly $15.5 billion by 2025 towards the Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs drive to ‚Äúcommon prosperity‚Äù.

personalfinance,Car loans for repairs on cars.,"So I own my ""classic car"", this is actually reliable enough to be my summer daily driver... useally

 

Every time I look at a car loan i cant stop thinking to myself ""man this 5K car I REALLY want, I can buy it outright, but I would really like to do X to this to make it a more practical daily driver"" or ""fuck man if I spent 20k on my VW instead of this car then I would have the most badass one in the Midwest"" 

 

For example, my VW needs paint, suspension, and probably 1000$ worth of bullshit under the hood for general maintenance. But this car would not go out of style as it did 30 years ago. 

 

I dont have 7K cash to just drop this car off at a shop. And I dont really have time to do some of these larger projects.  thankfully I have a long winter that I wont be driving the car. 

 

I have accepted that interest on loans is an acceptable cost to getting the car to the place it needs to be. Main issue is that I am not in the world to accept a 30% personal loan interest rate when I can get (a more expensive car) with 7% interest. 

 

This car is not the only example, there are land rovers that are in good shape that I can buy, but I know that SOMETHING is gonna be expensive down the road. 

 

understand that this is more about wanting to keep old cars running than wanting a new car that I dont have as much interest in.

Bitcoin,BITCOIN IS SEPERATE FROM ‚ÄúCRYPTO‚Äù,"The difference between the two is becoming more and more apparent as bitcoin is poised to challenge the world‚Äôs monetary system.

There are many out there who believe that Bitcoin falls under the ""crypto"" umbrella. This could not be further from the case. ""Crypto"" is designated for the affinity scams that launched in Bitcoin's wake and attempt to leverage its pedigree and latch on to its narrative to sell useless tokens to unwitting noobs. The affinity scammers believe they can ""beat"" Bitcoin by providing a feature set and a ""culture"" that turns out to be more appealing to the masses and thus makes individuals more likely to pick their favorite ""crypto"" over the best money humans have ever come into contact with.

These people couldn't be more delusional. The success of Bitcoin doesn't depend on the ""culture"" of bitcoiners. Bitcoin is an amoral and dumb protocol that has no way of knowing the ""culture"" of its users. And if it is successful it will be used by many different people from many far off lands with very different cultures. A cultural hold on a particular competitive landscape of social media LARPing doesn't really matter at the end of the day. Whether or not certain pseudonyms or blow hard VCs on Twitter are partial toward your favorite ""crypto"" is nothing more than noise. It is inconsequential in the long-run.

What really matters is the quality of Bitcoin's monetary policy and the public's confidence that the policy will be respected in the long-run. The best way to build confidence in that policy is to make the cost of attempting to change that policy, or falling out of line with the consensus rules of the network as high as possible. Nothing in ""crypto"" comes close to Bitcoin in these regards, and that is because the Bitcoin network is slowly but surely integrating itself into the energy sector of the globe. The execution risks associated with mining Bitcoin have become very high. If a miner fucks up and falls out of consensus, they are punished materially by missing out on precious block reward payouts. As the network becomes more ingratiated with the energy sector, these costs will rise and abiding by the monetary policy put forth by the network of full nodes will be paramount.

Heck, it already was in 2017 when the biggest corporate players and miners attempted to hard fork a block space increase that fell out of consensus with the full nodes on the network. The unwillingness to follow consensus ruined reputations and lost a lot of miners a lot of money over the four years that have followed the hard fork. This is what gives people certainty that bitcoin is a suitable monetary good in the digital age.

All of ""crypto"" LARPs focused on speed, app building, and being less ""energy intensive"" have completely missed the plot and have relegated themselves to a hedonistic sand box filled with degenerate gamblers and low energy thinkers.

Bitcoin has already won because it has won the energy game. And the energy game is what will protect Bitcoin's monetary policy in the long-run because it will be strongly incentivized by full nodes to do so. Very few understand this.

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning September 6th, 2021","Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 6th, 2021.

# **Stocks could look right past the weak jobs report and focus on strong profits - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/03/stocks-could-look-right-past-the-weak-jobs-report-to-another-strong-earnings-season.html)**
*****
&gt; After a weak jobs report, strategists say investor focus may stay on strong profit growth rather than other potential negatives.
*****
&gt; Stocks were mixed in the past week ahead of the long Labor Day weekend, with the Nasdaq outperforming, the S&amp;P 500 rising slightly and the Dow flat. The best-performing sectors were on the defensive side, led by real estate investment trusts, utilities, consumer staples and health care.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got this Labor Day effect. People are back from vacation‚Äù in the coming week, National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said.
*****
&gt; Hogan said investors expect the trading activity to pick up as a result, but it typically remains slow in the holiday shortened-week. Investors may assess their summer performance and move to lock in gains or add hedges.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIf you look back at the last five post-Labor Day weeks that have happened with the market near all-time highs, the post Labor Day week is the worst for September,‚Äù Hogan said.
*****
&gt; # Year-to-date returns
*****
&gt; https://i.imgur.com/I2dgbkQ.png
*****
&gt; Friday‚Äôs disappointing August jobs report ‚Äî with just 235,000 jobs added ‚Äî was a dampener for sentiment, but stocks were mixed.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúMy outlook for the last several weeks is sideways to moderately higher, and that seems where they‚Äôre headed. There isn‚Äôt a lot of bearish data accumulating. At worst we go sideways,‚Äù said Randy Frederick, Charles Schwab managing director of trading and derivatives.
*****
&gt; Frederick said even with worries about the weaker jobs and Covid,-19 investors may continue to focus on profits. Economists blamed the spread of the Covid delta variant for the weaker than expected jobs report.
*****
&gt; Strategists say other issues for stocks in September could include the efforts in Congress to pass infrastructure legislation and possible new taxes.
*****
&gt; # Ignoring jobs report
*****
&gt; Frederick said he expects the market to look beyond the August employment report, which was about 500,000 lower than expected.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs spillover much into next week for the most part,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThe markets are down a little bit, but I think they‚Äôve taken it in stride better than might be expected.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Weekly jobless claims data Thursday could be even more important than usual because of the big miss in August‚Äôs employment report. Jobs data is important because that is one area where Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he would like to see more improvement before the central bank can decide to slow its bond purchases.
*****
&gt; The market has been fixated on the Fed‚Äôs move to end its $120 billion a month bond-buying program because it is viewed as a precursor to interest rate hikes. However, Powell has stressed the two are not linked.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIf feels like [the jobs report] pushes the announcement of a taper to the November meeting, rather than the September meeting, and for the most part that was consensus,‚Äù Hogan said.
*****
&gt; Hogan said the market will also be watching any inflation-related data, so that makes Fridays‚Äô producer price index important after it surged last month. The consumer price index, released the following week, will be even more important for the market.
*****
&gt; NatWest Markets head of macro strategy John Briggs said the markets will be watching for any Fed-related headlines after the disappointing employment report.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúNext week, you have [New York Fed President John] Williams speaking. His take will be important. He‚Äôs viewed as being close to Powell,‚Äù Briggs said. Williams is set to speak Wednesday at a briefing on the economy.
*****
&gt; # What‚Äôs next for stocks
*****
&gt; Besides the Fed, the next big event for stocks will be the third-quarter earnings season, which gets underway in early October. Before that, investors will be watching for any company comments on results.
*****
&gt; Frederick said the strength of earnings has been propelling stocks and could keep doing so. ‚Ä≥The market was so overvalued for awhile until earnings caught up, but earnings were spectacular and now the valuations aren‚Äôt as high as they were a few months ago, so we can do this,‚Äù he said.
*****
&gt; Earnings are expected to increase by 29.8% for the third quarter after the second quarter‚Äôs stunning 95.6% increase, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a vacuum of earnings related news,‚Äù Frederick said, noting the market could be influenced by geopolitical events in the meantime.
*****
&gt; But even if the market loses steam, he doesn‚Äôt expect a major sell-off because for now, dip buyers continue to come in whenever the market has a setback.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week up 0.6% at 4,535, versus a 1.5% move higher by the Nasdaq to 15,363, a new high. The Dow was flattish, off 0.2%, at 35,369.
*****
&gt; The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.32% late Friday, just above where it was a week ago.

&gt; # Weakness Day After Labor Day &amp; Sell Rosh Hashanah

&gt; In the last 21 years, only Russell 2000 has registered an average gain of 0.04% on the Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have struggled with negative average performance. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have been up five of the last nine years, but DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have fallen for the last four years on Tuesday. On Wednesday the market‚Äôs performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best, up 76.2% of the time with an average gain of 0.33%. S&amp;P 500 is worst, up only 47.6% of the time with an average gain of 0.25%. NASDAQ has a better record up 52.4% of the time on Wednesday, but a smaller average gain of 0.14%.

&gt; **Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur**

&gt; As the High Holidays approach you may remember the old saying on the Street, ‚ÄúSell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur.‚Äù It gets tossed around every autumn when the ‚Äúhigh holidays‚Äù are on the minds of traders as many of their Jewish colleagues take off to observe the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement.

&gt; The basis for this, ‚ÄúSell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur,‚Äù pattern is that with many traders and investors busy with religious observance and family, positions are closed out and volume fades creating a buying vacuum. Even in the age of algorithmic, computer, and high frequency trading these seasonal patterns persist as humans still need to turn the machines on and off and feed them money or take it away ‚Äì and these algorithms and trading programs are written by people so the human influence is still there.

&gt; Holiday seasonality around official market holidays is something we pay close attention to (page 98 Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac 2021). Actual stats on the most observed Hebrew holidays have been compiled in the table here. We present the data back to 1971 and when the holiday falls on a weekend the prior market close is used. It‚Äôs no coincidence that Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur fall in September and/or October, two dangerous and sometimes opportune months.

&gt; Perhaps it‚Äôs Talmudic wisdom but, selling stocks before the eight-day span of the high holidays has avoided many declines, especially during uncertain times. While being long Yom Kippur to Passover has produced 64% more advances, half as many losses and average gains of 7.0%. This past year DJIA gained 19.9% from Yom Kippur 2020 to Passover 2021.

&gt; This year the high holidays arrive early on Labor Day eve, September 6, and end Thursday September 16 with Yom Kippur at mid-month one of the strongest days September. But with the market in full rally mode on easy Federal Reserve money and free Federal Government fiscal stimulus month selling ahead of the Jewish High Holidays could trigger a mild correction of 5% or so. The end of September after Triple Witching is notoriously the weakest part of the month, so it may be more prudent to ‚Äúbuy‚Äù later in the month.

&gt; # Here Comes the Worst Month of the Year

&gt; The incredible bull market continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up to a record 53 new all-time highs before August is over, topping the previous record from 1964.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.31.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; ‚ÄúAlthough this bull market has laughed at nearly all the worry signs in 2021, let‚Äôs not forget that September is historically the worst month of the year for stocks,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúEven last year, in the face of a huge rally off the March 2020 lows, we saw a nearly 10% correction in the middle of September.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.31.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 hasn‚Äôt had so much as a 5% correction since last October and with stocks up more than 100% since March 2020, investors should be open to some potential seasonal weakness. The good news is we remain in the camp that stocks will continue to go higher and investors should use any weakness as an opportunity to add to core equity holdings.

&gt; Let‚Äôs be honest, stocks can‚Äôt go up forever. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 is about to be up 7 months in a row, one of the longest monthly win streaks ever.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.31.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; It is what happens next that has our attention. As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, after 7-month win streaks, the S&amp;P 500 has been higher six months later 13 out of 14 times, with a very impressive 7.8% average return. This reinforces our belief that in the event of a well-deserved pullback, it would be an opportunity to buy at cheaper prices.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.31.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; With a very highly anticipated Federal Reserve Bank meeting in September, along with continued Delta variant worries, coupled with the fact that stocks haven‚Äôt pulled back in a long time, investors should be on the lookout for some seasonal volatility in September. We remain in the camp that any weakness, should it occur, could be short-term and likely be contained in the 5-8% range. This bull market is alive and well and we would view any potential weakness as an opportunity.

&gt; # August Payrolls Disappoint

&gt; It seems to be two steps forward, one step back for the U.S. labor market.

&gt; The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its August employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added a disappointing 235,000 jobs during the month, falling well short of Bloomberg-surveyed economists‚Äô median forecast for a gain of 733,000. This comes on the heels of a strong July during which payrolls climbed by an upwardly revised 1.053 million jobs. The unemployment rate fell to 5.2% in August, in line with expectations, and was paired with an unchanged labor force participation rate, which stayed at 61.7%.

&gt; ‚ÄúThe Delta variant surge is the unsurprising story behind August‚Äôs big payroll miss,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúLeisure and hospitality jobs, a proxy for economic reopening, were flat month over month. The good news is that we see promising signs Delta‚Äôs effect will wane in coming months and payrolls will resume growing at a fast clip.‚Äù

&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, we remain 5.3 million payrolls shy of February 2020‚Äôs peak.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.3.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The other key takeaway from this report is wage pressures are building. Average hourly earnings came in hotter than expected, an increasingly common occurrence, posting a 0.6% month-over-month gain versus expectations for 0.3%, and a 4.3% gain year over year versus expectations for 3.9%. Wages have important implications in the inflation debate, as they and rents are considered to be among the ‚Äústickier‚Äù components of inflation. Today‚Äôs report is likely to bolster those in the camp asserting inflation will be less transitory than the Federal Reserve (Fed) thinks, though it should be noted that the lack of employment growth in lower wage in-person sectors likely contributed to the higher wage numbers.

&gt; Looking ahead, we continue to believe there is reason to expect a strong jobs rebound in coming months. Schools closed for the summer, potential disincentives from enhanced unemployment benefits, and the troublesome Delta variant have all acted as speed limits on the pace of employment growth recently. August‚Äôs report, though, figures to be the last where all of these factors remain in full force. Enhanced unemployment benefits are set to expire on Labor Day (ironically), meaning their effects will only be present for part of the September report‚Äôs observation window, and will be fully gone by the October report. Schools and daycare facilities, meanwhile, are beginning to reopen, freeing up parents to rejoin the labor force. And, most importantly, we are seeing promising signs that the worst of the latest flare-up in COVID-19 cases may be behind us.

&gt; Zooming out, this job report has the potential to delay the Fed‚Äôs tapering timeline. Fed Chair Powell has made it clear that the labor market will serve as his tell regarding when to begin tapering asset purchases. With today‚Äôs big payroll miss, it is clear the labor market is under some near term pressure, and while these pressures are likely to dissipate the Fed will probably err on the side of caution to avoid acting prematurely. The next month is sure to be an interesting one for Fed-watchers.

&gt; # Bullish Sentiment Finally Rises in Back to Back Weeks

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has continued to press higher resulting in a coincident rise in sentiment. The AAII's weekly reading on bullish sentiment rose back above 40% for the first time since the week of July 8th. While 43.4% is not a particularly elevated reading on sentiment (72nd percentile of all periods), the move higher is particularly notable in that it was the first time bullish sentiment has risen in back-to-back weeks since February. That is especially surprising given the fact that bullish sentiment was very elevated at points between now and then, such as back in the spring when it eclipsed 50%. That is also a historically long stretch of time without back-to-back increases in bullish sentiment. As shown in the second chart below, at just over half of a year-long, the only two similar streaks on record were in 1995 and from 1997 to 1998.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/090221-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/090221-AAII-Bull-Back-to-Back.png))**

&gt; Negative sentiment has broadly picked up over the past couple of months. In the AAII survey, bearish sentiment was slightly higher at 33.3% versus 33% last week. While below the peak from only a couple of weeks ago, that is still elevated versus readings from earlier this year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/090221-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Similarly, the Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers has also seen bearish sentiment on the rise throughout the summer. This week, it topped 20% for the first time since March 10th. At 21.3%, bearish sentiment in this survey is at the highest level since last October. With that said, the current reading is also well below the 20 year average of 24.19%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/090221-II-Bear.png))**

&gt; As a result of the larger gains to bullish versus bearish sentiment, optimism remains the favored response in the AAII survey. The bull-bear spread rose back into positive double digits this week for the first time since the last week of July.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/090221-AAII-Bull-Bear-Spread.png))**

&gt; Given both bullish and bearish sentiments were higher, neutral sentiment has continued to unwind. That reading fell 4.3 percentage points this week to a new low of 23.2%. That was the fourth decline in the past five weeks as neutral sentiment came in at the lowest level since mid-April.

&gt; # Emerging Markets Leave China Behind

&gt; In last night's Closer, we noted the record underperformance of Chinese equities relative to the US over the past six months. As a result of the weakness in Chinese equities, the MSCI Emerging Market ETF (EEM)‚Äîwhich has roughly a 37% weight in Hong Kong and Chinese stocks‚Äîis well off of its highs and has been trending lower over the past several months. Today, EEM is up a healthy 1.37%, but that brings it just short of its 50-DMA which recently fell below its 200-DMA. That is also at similar levels to the lower high from the start of this month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/083121-EEM.png))**

&gt; When factoring out China, emerging markets look much better. Again, the MSCI Emerging Market ETF that excludes China (EMXC) is currently 1.13% below its 52-week high, but the downtrend that has been in place since the early June highs has been on the ropes over the past couple of sessions. Yesterday saw the ETF trade and close right at that downtrend line, but the 1.15% gain today has smashed through it. That leaves EMXC at the highest level since June 15th. The ETF is also at some of the most overbought levels (1.8 standard deviations from its 50-DMA) since then.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/083121-EMXC.png))**

&gt; Pivoting over to bonds, looking at the Fixed Income screen of our Trend Analyzer, the best performer over the past five days is also in the EM space. The USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF (EMB) had been mostly flat throughout the summer trending right alongside its sideways 50- and 200-DMAs. Significant gains last Friday and yesterday led EMB to break out of that range as it reaches some of the highest levels since February today.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/083121-EMB.png))**

&gt; As previously mentioned, EMB has not ventured far from its 50-DMA recently. In fact, the rolling 50-day standard deviation has been right around some of the lowest levels on record since EMB began trading in 2008. Given that lack of volatility, the rip higher this week has resulted in the ETF moving well beyond the upper end of its narrow trading range. In fact, yesterday the ETF closed over 3 standard deviations above its 50-DMA. That joins only 14 other days where the ETF closed at least 3 standard deviations above its 50-DMA with the most recent of those back in June 2019 when it reached as high as 4 standard deviations above its moving average.

Currently the payout quote I'm given when I check online is only $100 less than (8*monthly payment amount), so it hardly seems worth it to me to pay a bunch of money at once just to save $100 in the end. 

My question is: is it worth attempting to negotiate my payout quote lower based on this information? Is it worth it to refinance before requesting a payout quote?

3. SEC Chair Gensler gave another speech strongly signaling that a lot of stablecoins, lending platforms, synthetics platforms, and other DeFi projects are probably non-compliant in the eyes of the SEC. I would heed this warning very carefully if I were one of those projects. [https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tusQLLCgrDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tusQLLCgrDs)

5. We‚Äôre now up to 5 different states that are getting after BlockFi for their crypto lending activities. Reportedly, this includes New Jersey, Vermont, Alabama, Kentucky, &amp; Texas.

6. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy ‚Äúsome things‚Äù minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
7. Cardano‚Äôs closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it‚Äôs EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We‚Äôll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano‚Äôs deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

9. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements.

13. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. Both revisions were good for Cardano since they included proof-of-stake implicitly and then explicitly.

The local motorcycle dealers cannot get any stock and I am unable to buy a bike, as everything is sold immedaitley. All used veichles are selling for ridiclous prices. Everything seems disrupted. There are wanted signs everywhere for labor.

When do you suspect production of goods and services return to normal to meet demand? Do you expect a change in QE or increase in interest rates? Do you suspect the production side of the economy to rebound and meet demand (and when?) to cease the current price gouging and increased costs of goods, or do you suspect this to be the new normal?

CryptoCurrency,5 most common cryptocurrency scams and how to avoid them,"## How to identify cryptocurrency scams?

The best way to identify potentially fraudulent situations involving cryptocurrencies is to familiarise yourself with some of the most common crypto scam warning signs.¬†

According to the [**cybersecurity firm Kaspersky**](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/cryptocurrency-scams), the following scenarios should trigger an alert for investors when being presented with an offer involving cryptocurrency:

1. The website that you are visiting lacks the security credentials that are often necessary to safely transfer your data. This includes, but is not limited to, having a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate and displaying HTTPS instead of HTTP ‚Äì the insecure version of a website.
2. Receiving an email offering a reward or any form of compensation from a company even though the email is coming from an unknown domain that is different from the firm‚Äôs official website.
3. A character in social media or via email sends you a link to register or access your crypto wallet, but the link turns out to be different than the provider‚Äôs official website.
4. Receiving a reward for persuading your friends and family to invest, buy, or otherwise engage in transactions with a company or individual who is promoting a token or a certain blockchain project.
5. Being asked to participate in an initial coin offering whose supporters and backers are unknown parties with no social media profiles, references, or track record.
6. Being asked to provide your wallet‚Äôs PIN number, private keys, and other similar information to pay for a certain good or service being purchased online.¬†

## Five most common cryptocurrency scams

Forewarned is forearmed, so to help you protect yourself, let‚Äôs see how some of some of the most common scamming techniques work in practice¬†

Here‚Äôs is a crypto scams list, which consists of five types of fraudulent actions seen on the web today:

### #1 - Social media scams

A social media scam can work in different ways. For example, the fraudster may attempt to impersonate a celebrity, a reputed character within the crypto and financial space, or any other person whose credibility might be sound enough to make you think the offer is legitimate.¬†

Moreover, they may go as far as hacking that character‚Äôs real social media profile ‚Äì as happened last year when a [**hacker accessed the account of multiple high-profile individuals**](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53425822) including Jeff Bezos, Barack Obama, and Elon Musk, and used those accounts to ask their followers to send a certain amount of crypto assets in exchange for a higher payout.

### #2 - Social engineering scams

The power of social media nowadays to shape people‚Äôs opinions is sometimes underestimated, and that is even more true when it comes to investment fraud. People might feel prompted to invest in opportunities that are being ‚Äòvalidated‚Äô by a relatively large group of people, and that is how this type of scam works.

In a social engineering scam, the fraudster will operate multiple social media accounts that will be used to validate a project, an investment idea, an initial coin offering, or a certain crypto-related service to get real people to put their money into it.

Most of these accounts are fake but investors fail to realize the coordinated nature of the fraud until it is too late.

&amp;#x200B;

\#3 - Unregulated cryptocurrency exchange scams

The number of crypto exchanges has been constantly growing since [**bitcoin (BTC)**](https://capital.com/btc-usd-chart), [**ethereum (ETH)**](https://capital.com/eth-usd-chart) and other crypto projects started to get traction.¬†

As of 29 July 2021, there were 390 exchanges listed on the CoinMarketCap. The biggest cryptocurrency exchanges ‚Äì based on a 24-hours volume according to [**Statista.com**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/864738/leading-cryptocurrency-exchanges-traders/) ‚Äì include Binance, Tokocrypto, Upbit, ZG.com, Tokencan and OKEx.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7re2sxp00il71.jpg?width=1350&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9261a2d47c449608e5e1fb0f7d11300ce9d8f2bf

However, alongside numerous trusted exchanges which have proved to be legit and gained track records asreputable crypto trading providers, there are crypto exchanges which have been linked¬† to incidents involving stolen funds and allegedly hacked systems that have led to multimillion losses for investors.

In 2017, for example, the authorities in South Korea revealed one of these [**fake crypto exchanges**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korean-government-concerned-with-scams-in-bitcoin-market-fake-exchanges). BitKRX was created and represented as a cryptocurrency branch of the largest and legitimate South Korean platform Korea Exchange (KRX). Using KRX's goodwill, BitKRX made investors believe in the project and eventually lost money.

In most cases, the crypto exchanges that have blown up were those that lacked the regulatory oversight that most traditional brokerage firms are subject to. In this regard, investors should be careful with depositing funds into exchanges that are not actively overseen by top-tier jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom, United States, Japan, or Australia.

### #4 - Email scams

Even though most people may not fall for the regular spam email that is filtered out by Gmail and other providers every day, email scam techniques have become more sophisticated and include cryptocurrency phishing scams in which the fraudster will attempt to get the investor‚Äôs access credentials to a wallet or crypto exchange account by directing them to log into their accounts through an imposter website.¬†

### #5 - ICO Scams

ICO scams, also known as cryptocurrency exit scams, seek to raise money from a group of investors in the form of valuable tokens like bitcoin (BTC) or ethereum (ETH), only to then disappear with the money.

Even though most of these scams occurred during the ‚Äúgolden days‚Äù of ICOs back in 2017-2018, they still can happen nowadays. For example, a person could approach an investor with an opportunity involving the launch of a certain token or blockchain project that needs funding for the ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù stage.

In exchange, the investor will get a certain amount of the project‚Äôs tokens at a very low price, with the promise that these tokens will increase in value once the project is launched. However, the criminals who promote these projects ultimately disappear once they have raised a certain amount of money by collecting tokens from investors.

## How to avoid cryptocurrency scams?

Knowing and understanding how the most common crypto scams work and which are the most frequently used techniques employed by criminals to steal money from investors is the first step to avoid them.

However, there are other preventive measures that investors can take to further protect themselves from falling victim to these activities:

* Avoid engaging with unknown characters in social media who might be promoting a certain project without first double-checking their identities and whether they are who they say they are.
* Block and flag spam any emails coming from unknown addresses that are asking for your wallet‚Äôs information or prompting you to access your crypto exchange account through an unverified link.
* Do your own due diligence on any project you would like to participate in, existing or new. This includes investigating:
* Who are the members of the developing team?
* Who is backing the project (institutional participation)?
* What is the track record of senior developers?¬†
* Consider participating in initial exchange offerings (IEOs), which are projects promoted via formal and regulated exchanges.
* Keep your wallet information safely stored (private keys) and do not share that kind of information with anyone, as that could facilitate access to your holdings.
* Only invest money that you can afford to lose. Even if you are trading or investing in legitimate projects, you should keep in mind that the cryptocurrency ecosystem is still relatively immature and volatility levels are very high. This means that you could lose a significant portion of your money if you fail to implement adequate risk management procedures to protect your invested funds against sharp drawdowns.

## Latest crypto scams 2020/2021

Since October 2020, [**the Federal Trade Commission reported**](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/data-spotlight/2021/05/cryptocurrency-buzz-drives-record-investment-scam-losses) that it received complaints from almost 7,000 people in the United States who lost a combined total of nearly $800 million as a result of crypto scams.

Meanwhile, these were some of the most prominent and curious incidents involving crypto scams in 2021.

* Elon Musk‚Äôs impersonators: The same report from the FTC said that thousands of people have sent money to wallet addresses of fraudsters impersonating the founder of [**Tesla**](https://capital.com/tesla-share-price) and SpaceX, Elon Musk, for a combined eye-popping total of $2 million.¬†
* The Twitter incident: In [**July 2020**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/technology/twitter-hack-arrest.html), a hacker from Florida managed to get access to the Twitter accounts of multiple high-profile characters, extracting a total of $121,000 after asking their followers to send money to a wallet address in exchange for a higher amount.
* Wotoken: In June 2020, [**CipherTrace revealed**](https://ciphertrace.com/2020-year-end-cryptocurrency-crime-and-anti-money-laundering-report/) that Wotoken, a Chinese crypto pyramid scheme, reportedly stole over $1 billion from investors.
* The Africrypt theft: Brothers Ameer and Raees Cajee [**reportedly**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-23/s-african-brothers-vanish-and-so-does-3-6-billion-in-bitcoin) defrauded crypto investors who traded cryptocurrencies through their AfriCrypt exchange by stealing 69,000 bitcoin, whose value ‚Äì in June this year, when the incident was reported ‚Äì was around $3.6bn.
* 2021 DeFi rug pulls: [**CipherTrace reported in May 2021**](https://protos.com/crypto-crime-defi-hackers-ciphertrace-fraud-2021/) that fraudulent DeFi projects had siphoned over $240 million from investors in the form of rug pulls (exit scams) and stolen funds from crypto staking platforms during the first five months of the year.

Bitcoin,"Feeling like you're not gonna make it? I am here to help. Below is my (huge) comprehensive guide, composed of Youtube videos and personal notes, to give anyone interested in learning about Bitcoin everything they need to succeed, in one convenient location.","**--T H E B I T C O I N G U I D E --**

So first off, I want to start off this ridiculously large guide with an equally ridiculous story.

So the year was 2015, and I was grinding away on RuneScape (an extremely dated MMO game from 2007), really living my life to the fullest, when one day I happened across a guy who apparently wanted to make me extremely rich. A player by the name of BUYBITCOINNOW decided to follow me everywhere I went, spending hours trying to convince me to buy the magic internet money that had inspired his name. Of course, I spent the hour laughing at this gambling-addicted drug dealing cybercriminal hitman who was ultimately distracting me from a matter of great importance: increasing my mining level. The price of his magic internet money was sitting at around 300$ at the time and it would obviously be 0 within the week. Unfortunately, as of my writing this, it is valued at 45,000$ today, and it is now clear to me that I missed an opportunity that life dropped right onto my lap.

I want to give the same opportunity that was given to me, to anyone willing to take the time to go through this guide. Below you will find a structured list of Youtube videos and my personal notes that will give anyone, completely for free, the tools they need to begin learning about and investing in Bitcoin. (All of the YouTubers have tons of great additional content, and I encourage you to check them out. None of them are me. I am not a Youtuber.)

I know that it was not my time in 2015, but it is now. Rampant, senseless money printing by the Fed has driven me to search for a monetary solution that does not end in my wealth being deluded and destroyed by misguided bureaucrats only seeking to enrich themselves. Inflation is here ‚Äì this is absolutely undeniable.

This search has consumed my life over the past 12 months and will continue to for the next 12.

As I hope I can convince you throughout this guide, Bitcoin is so much more than what it appears to be at initial glance, and so much more than a magic internet money used by gambling-addicted drug dealing cybercriminal hitmen.

Learning what Bitcoin truly is will require opening your mind, and opening your schedule, as I have included well over 100 hours of video in this guide. It will require diving down a rabbit hole that you may never climb out of, but I believe I have included enough, in this one convenient location, to lead anyone through their own initial research.

Some key points about this guide:

* I don‚Äôt know what the Bitcoin price is going to do, and I don‚Äôt have a crystal ball. I made this guide to help people make a well-informed decision on a technology that, I believe, has the potential to improve the lives of billions of people.
* I will present both sides of the argument, both the positive and the negative, and let you come to your own conclusion.
* Yes, this guide is huge. I truly believe this technology must be understood at as deep of a level as possible. This understanding will guide your paper hands if Bitcoin makes another meteoric run, to the upside or the downside, because there WILL be volatility. Many early adopters have made the mistake of selling too early, and that is because they did not understand what they truly possessed.
* I do not EVER recommend buying with money you can‚Äôt afford to lose. The price of Bitcoin can, and almost certainly will be, a roller coaster ride. Do not get on if you cannot stomach the volatility, financial assets are not worth losing happiness and peace of mind over.
* I am not, as of this time, a Bitcoin maximalist. I believe a 1-3% allocation in your portfolio is appropriate. Each Bitcoin is extremely divisible and you can buy it with less than 5$.

I hope to show you with this guide that Bitcoin is an idea whose time has come, and day after day it becomes increasingly unlikely that anything can stop it.

Let‚Äôs get started.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**--U.S. Economy in Deep Sh\*\*--**

The Fed has added over 30% to the money supply since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and they show no signs of tapering; it is up for debate if they ever can. These trillions of dollars they create out of thin air steal our wealth, exacerbate income inequality, and a large majority of them are misused by hiding massive spending plans in 2000+ page bills that no one has even read. Our top policy makers are receiving millions in ‚Äúspeaking fees‚Äù from institutions that want this game to continue, and that believe it is righteous to continue stealing our wealth.

Reddit vs Wallstreet - GameStop, The Movie

\- Multibillion-dollar hedge funds destroyed by an ordinary Reddit investor, the legend himself: DeepFuckingValue. Market manipulators turned the stock market off to prevent total financial collapse, along with many other control measures. This led to retail investors suffering, while Wallstreet escaped with the bag. It was caused by rampant corruption, greed, manipulation, and abuse of power by those in control. This is a revealing case study on how the stock market is designed to help the rich get richer by legislating the odds in their favor.

**--SAYLOR--**

Michael Saylor is one of the most influential speakers I have ever come across. If Bitcoiners spent the next 1000 years in a lab designing the perfect representative to explain this technology to millions of people, we would never even come close to Saylor. I won‚Äôt list his resume here, as it will be mentioned throughout these videos, but it is wildly impressive. I know I have included many videos in this section, feel free to move on to other sections and come back as you see fit.

Notes: If you like the voices behind bitcoin (many of them represented in this guide) you can think of them as being on your team now. You are investing in them. In their knowledge. In their ability to convince people over time. In their ability to simplify this incredible and complex technology into something we can all collectively understand.

\- True price discovery is difficult in Bitcoin because it is being speculated upon with 100x leverage all over the world 24/7 365. This causes high volatility and makes it hard to access it as an asset / inflation hedge / viable currency. What happens when the fed stops injecting billions of liquidity into the market and debt driven liquidity/volatility dries up?

Why the World Needs Assets Such as Bitcoin - Robert Kiyosaki and Jeff Booth

\- Jeff Booth: Bitcoin saves the world via forcing us (by being 100x better than current systems) out of the endless inflationary world we live in. As technology gets better, making us dramatically more productive, governments around the world print more money. This money is often used to fund wars, nefarious activities, and it drives extreme wealth inequality. Example of technology enabling a greener planet: compare the carbon footprint of Blockbuster and the thousands of physical locations they once had to Netflix. And a more recent example: imagine the effects Zoom has had, and how many people no longer need to commute to work every day.

The Best Bitcoin Debate Ever Recorded (Anthony Pompliano vs Mike Green)

\- Is Bitcoin primarily used for crime, and under the control of dominant foreign powers? Who owns the majority of Bitcoin? Is it in the hands of just a few people, or evenly distributed?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjL9yZc5ZY8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjL9yZc5ZY8)

Is Bitcoin the Future of Money? Peter Schiff vs. Erik Voorhees

\- Schiff makes a great point here. He states that because Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, it has no buyer of last resort. So, in the event of a dramatic crash how can the price be determined? Unfortunately, the moderator is this debate is batshit crazy

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G2ZihXvtUQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G2ZihXvtUQ)

Is Bitcoin worth $100k or $0? Debate with Saifedean Ammous, Steve Hanke, and Hong Fang (Pt. 1/2)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvYOBVT5TIA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvYOBVT5TIA)

Is Bitcoin the next global currency? The debate continues: Ammous, Hanke, Fang (Pt. 2/2)

\- Great point Hanke makes here (despite his unlikability in the discussion). A digital currency backed up by hard assets and endorsed by central governments (congruent with a ban on all other cryptos) could compete with Bitcoin, and potentially destroy it. Governmental measures against Covid-19 have shown us that many governments are moving towards increased control to get their way. Believing governments will not attempt to shut down Bitcoin once they realize their power to print money is slipping away would be, in my opinion, illogical.

personalfinance,Lease vs. Buying - Lease Seems Better for EV?,"Hey all,

My partner is in the market for an EV. We've settled on the Kona.

After looking at the math behind lease to own vs. financing, it looks like leasing is actually the better option since they would not benefit from the full $7,500 federal tax credit. The dealer is incentivizing the lease with a $10,750 dealer rebate for the lease which ultimately brings the starting price of the KONA to $36K. It also seems like the residual buy out amount @ $23K would actually be lower than the estimated depreciated value of the KONA based on prior models.

[https://imgur.com/a/59oy6UM](https://imgur.com/a/59oy6UM)

In that google sheet is the lease vs. finance scenario as I understand it...Lease is $1,500 worse assuming the full federal tax credit was possible, but better given the reality.

personalfinance,Rolling Over TSP?,"I resigned from my work for the federal govt as an engineer. I was making the max 19k contributions per year for my salary (83k/year) into the TSP (when including the matching). But I am moving to another job in the private sector since they are providing me a 40% pay increase (so I should be able to continue max contributions) and its more in-line with the work I want to do (R&amp;D)

My question is: should I leave the money in the TSP or roll it over into the 401k I will have at the next job?

My first guess was to keep it in TPS because I am only in my 20s and will most likely be hit with fees. Also the TPS seems to have lower fees/taxes than a private sector 401k",finance
personalfinance,Help with understanding if a credit union is jerking me around in regards to RV loan,"I applied yesterday for an RV loan in the amount of $16,445 with Mountain America Credit Union (MACU). The loan is for a Cowboy model truck bed camper on a 5.5' truck bed plus some amenities by Capris Campers LLC (CC) based in Bluff Dale, TX. 

When I initially applied for the loan I made MACU aware that CC is a relatively small volume RV manufacturer. There are literally 10 of their Campers curently listed on RV trader in all of the U.S. Typically they built to order instead of stocking dealerships.

After being initially approved for a 5 year term at 5.45% interest for the RV loan MACU called me today stating they're having difficulty figuring out the market value of the camper which will ultimately sack my loan due to the fact they cannot locate CC in their database. In response I've sent multiple documents to them along with other sources of information to assist them to include: exact build sheet &amp; MSRP sheet from manufacturer, an exact build request from the manufacturers website, 3 models similar to mine listed on RV trader. 

In response MACU stated that the information I sent was not enough for the underwirghters to guage market value of the model according to their guidelines. The exact reason is because the other models listed for sale on RV trader are for an 8' and 6.5' truck bed instead of the 5.5' truck bed model I'm ordering completely ignoring the fact that CC makes all base models the EXACT same price regardless of the models bed length! The only difference from model to model is the added amenities, not length/size.

Even with all that information MACU said the last way for them to guage market value is by calling the manufacturer and getting from them their exact build cost for the model. Somehow knowing CC profit margin on the camper will solve all MACU market value problems?

MACU's only solution should the loan fail due to them failing to establish market value of the camper is to upsell me to a personal loan at a much higher interest rate!

1. Can an underwrighter help me to understand how MACU is failing to aquire the market value of the Cowboy model when the manufacturer is blatantly obvious with all pricing and I have a build order from them among other finacial proof of value?

2. How will attaining CC profit margin on the model I want to have built help MACU obtain market value and finish approving my loan? Whether or not they get this information it changes NOTHING in regards to the loan amount because its not going to change what CC is selling it for.

3. If the loan fails due to MACU failing to establish market value of the model how can I rebuff the hard credit check on my score? If it fails I will have my score lowered and my time wasted for nothing. I made it clear from the start that CC is a small volume RV manufacturer.

I'll reply back and/or answer any questions soon as I can. 

Thank you for any help provided.

EDIT: This camper is small, lightweight and will be used for work purposes. Staying in this camper will help to avoid hotel fees that can easily rival that of a mortgage and provide better fuel efficiency than a travel trailer saving even more money. I regularly travel around 1500 miles a month between work and home in CA and sometimes AZ.

THIS IS FOR WORK PURPOSES; NOT A TOY FOR FUN.

EDIT: Thanks to the helpful information you and others provided I was able to work out a deal with MACU. Being able to understand their reasoning and process behind the loan application was indispensable and allowed me to better work with them. The loan is now taken care of and even ahead of schedule.Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Bank of America nightmare,"I'll try to keep this as brief as I can.   I decided recently to open a Bank of America account, I wanted a larger bank to work with and wanted to do more with investing etc.

I apply, I fill out the online forms etc.   Next thing I know I'm getting emails about ""Welcome to Bank of America..."" etc etc.   Good stuff right?   I was working at the time so I didn't click the link in the email to check out my new account.   About an hour or two later I had the opportunity to download the BoA app on my phone and check it out.   When I logged in it said ""Account locked"".   Hmmm.

1st. call - Speak with rep and they said hold on....I hold on, eventually hear beeps and get disconnected.

2nd call - Speak with another rep that says something about the ""fraud"" department and says he has to transfer me.  I say ""ok"".   I get transferred and get greeted by an automated message asking me for my account number.   Something which I don't know because I don't have a valid account to go in and check.

3rd call -  I speak with a rep that is able to get me my account number so that I can talk to the fraud dept.  \[that department was closed at the time so I called the next day

4th call - I get a hold of this department and they say they just need to see two forms of ID at one of their branches.   I say ""ok"" but I'm baffled as to why they didn't tell me this.   So I log onto their website and come to find out the closest branch to me is a bit over 40 miles.   At this point I'm fed up and eventually make my way over to [Schwab.com](https://Schwab.com).

The [Schwab.com](https://Schwab.com) experience was wonderful!!  No issues no problems whatsoever!!

&amp;#x200B;

Days later I get a letter in the mail that tells me that BoA decided not to keep my accounts open.  Verbatim this is what they tell me.  ""We've made the decision to close your deposit account ending in xxxx.""

The very next statements simply inform me to not try to use this account anymore.

There is one bullet point they give near the end of the page that says. ""Our decision to close your account is final and may affect your ability to open a checking or savings account with us in the future.""

On the back it says ""We may report our decision to Chex Systems Inc..  This may affect your ability to open an account at other financial institutions for up to 5 years.""

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone at all explain the very bizarre behavior by this bank???    Has anyone had a similar experience?  I'm going to contact the closest branch and ask to have an appointment on the next business day and see if I can find out just what the hell is going on.

What I will say, is that I'm completely floored that a large Bank would operate this way and treat someone like this w/o communicating more to find out if this ""alert"" is valid or not.    When I called them over this they said I just needed to show 2 forms of ID, now I'm getting a letter about fraud and possible action taken against me.

I checked on [Chexsystems.com](https://Chexsystems.com) and there is nothing on my profile that is remotely bad.  My credit is ok and I have absolutely no odd dealings or oddities with any of my accounts.  Does any body have any insight on how or why a bank would behave this way?",finance
personalfinance,Trade in car now or wait a couple of months?,"Tl;dr - $9k positive equity. Looking to downgrade vehicle. Do it now or wait?

I have a 2017 Buick Enclave I bought last year for $26k. Carvana is now offering me $30.5k. I owe $21k (1.75% interest loan). 

I bought the Buick with all the bells and whistles last year because I used to have a horrible commute (2+ hours). I figured if I was going to be in the car that much, I might as well enjoy it. Well, now I have a permanent remote position, and I really don't need that much car, or so many whistles. I was thinking of downgrading to something Camry-sized. I drive only a couple hundred miles a month at most now. 

My plan would be to trade in the Buick, use the extra to pay off my husband's car (about $8k, same terms as mine), and get a new loan for me for the same interest rate (I've been preapproved) for no more than $20k, but likely less.

I know the used car market is really hot right now, and I've read that it will continue to be hot for the next year or so. I don't need to trade in my vehicle now, so would it better to wait to see if it goes up in value at all, or just go ahead and do it now?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Jobs report and the elephant in the room,"This Labor Day weekend marks the end of multiple Federal pandemic jobless aid programs for more than 9 million Americans. As unemployment benefits cut across the country many people will see a gross reduction in income. 

An additional three programs covering a combined 12.1 million people will expire on Monday, September, 2021 without action from the governing bodies.

Additionally 5.4 million non-traditional workers are set to lose their weekly benefits early next week.

Extended aid being offered to 3.9 million Americans will vanish on Monday as well.

Other aid programs offering up to $300 weekly, to an estimated 3.9 million Americans will leave many penniless in the coming weeks.

Toping all of this, the August jobs report released on Friday displayed significant slowdown in hiring rates.

This has convinced many market experts that the above circumstances will influence a dovish approach to the feds tapering in the coming weeks. Signaling a continued rally for both crypto and stock markets.

 But what if the Fed pushes forward with tapering?

Let's examine some additional information, in US markets assets like gold approached and closed above a critical level of 1,825$. The S&amp;P 500 traded sideways for the first time in a long time. Stocks across the board traded in the negatives or sideways.

Does this create the perfect storm when coupled with the large number of jobless Americans and vanishing income? Or am I a bear that's about to get dumped all over and sent to bed crying?

Purchasing 2nd house as primary residence, renting 1st house","Hello all - I recently spoke with a mortgage lender who suggested a conventional 2nd mortgage or some kind of HELOC option. To be honest I'm not sure how a HELOC helps me in the following scenario - help?

Current home has a 2020 mortgage for $270k at a 2.75% fixed interest rate. Home is valued at ~$430k. Monthly mortgage payment (principal+interest) is $1400. Rental value is ~$1800.

I'm considering a HELOC to help me purchase a 2nd property which I will use as my primary, utilizing my current home as a rental property.

The purchase price for the new property is $700k. Between putting 20% down and closing costs I will likely need $140k. Mortgage payment on the new property is ~$3500.

Does it make sense to use a HELOC given these circumstances? What other factors should I consider, if any? My goal is to keep my current home as an investment, income producing property and move into a newer, larger property as my primary. 

Should I just forget about the HELOC and sell my current home, using some or all of the net proceeds to purchase the 2nd property?",finance

Bitcoin,"Put in the work, or don't","I hope this post provides information whether you are thinking about buying bitcoin, thinking about selling, or simply want to learn.

Synopsis: The vast majority of people who I know who do not buy bitcoin generally do not understand it. The vast majority who buy a little are risk averse (they avoid any type of significant financial risk and are the type of person who generally will never be rich and never be poor). I respect you if you do the work and say I don't want to buy it for x/y/z reasons. I haven't met anyone in that category.

In the last decade I acquired real estate. As I kept buying, I heard from most people on the last few purchases that it would crash, it was over valued, etc. I did not understand the money printing. I did understand that payments relative to wages was more important than just purchase price. I can't believe people could say xyz will happen and have no basis to their argument. What I have learned is people saying crash or similar to people who chase-emotions rule over common sense. Lack of research pays the price.

There is nothing wrong with saying a market is overvalued or is going to crash. What is wrong is saying that and not having a reason. If you can't explain your lack of investment or your investment, that's a bad sign. I was that way with Tesla- judgemental, not open to ideas.

I have friends who have been saying bitcoin will crash, tulips, etc. Once again, these are fair criticisms. What's not good for them is that they can't explain their position.

Of my group, the people that kept saying real estate crash-well, 50% of them bought homes in the last year. 50%. Why did they buy? Same reason-no reason at all, no research. I might add, many of these people have great incomes, good careers, business owners, etc. It teaches me that you can be smart in many ways and an absolute moron in others.

This same group owns a very small amount of bitcoin, if any. They generally have no idea what bitcoin is. For example, one of the common arguments used is abc coin is better or who is to say another crypto can't take bitcoin's place? Fair reasoning, but that's where their argument stops. They literally parrot a headline they read. They don't put in the work. They can't explain their position. It reminds me when I say a NBA superstar makes $40 million a year and they scoff and say that's outrageous. No research, no thought process, pure emotions.

My thought is that bitcoin is headed towards 500-1,000,000 within the next 5-10 years. I consider this conservative. The lack of putting in the work or putting in the work will have a massive, massive effect on the wealth of you and your family in the next 5-10 years. Many who don't put in the work now will generally fomo in and potentially lose much of their net worth-JUST LIKE THEY DID FROM 2006-2008 IN HOUSING. I am American and can tell you the vast majority will end up with no assets. Leased car, rented house, no retirement. I am closing in on 40 and my research leads me to the following conclusion:

For the first time in our history, at least my generation's, those in the middle and the bottom have a decent chance to better their situation. What is going on with $ printing and interest rates reminds me keenly of 2008-when everything fell apart but the grey haired said it was a bump in the road, things were fine. Those same people are telling us they can taper, that they can normalize rates, or sweet jesus, rates will actually go up.

I don't write this to scare you. I don't think the world will burn down. It will simply change. IMHO, we are 15-20 years away from a real disaster when the dollar finally has it's exit...but we aren't even close to that yet. 

THIS IS A ONCE IN HUMAN HISTORY EVENT. A FIAT SYSTEM ON IT'S WIND DOWN OF 50 YEARS. AN EXPONENTIAL CHANGE OF TECH. SOCIAL UNREST INCREASING. THERE WILL BE DIGITAL WALLETS IN EVERY NEW PHONE IN 5 YEARS.

The people in the government do not care about you. They care about the wealthy and they care about keeping those in power, in power. The #1 way to lose power is a bad economy...and so they will keep doing what they are doing. And especially with the bad economic news, they will refuse to taper or raise rates. Every time-100% of the time-that there has been a recession, the fed has cut rates twice. 100% of the time. Keep that in mind when they say rates will go up.

The price of bitcoin is all about the trading at the margin. We know that 70% of people are long term holders-what really happens is the behavior on the margin.

My 2 cents: the next quarter, if it comes with at least 2 S&amp;P 500 companies and an ETF or futures based etf, will drive the price parabolic. And the most critical people, the ones that scoff tulips, will chase it far above 500.

If you choose to buy bitcoin or not buy it, I hope you have a reason. In my opinion: in 5 years you will be at a couples dinner date. And the guy with the 1500 sat score, the high iq, the guy who did everything right will be waiting for the valet. The Bentley will be brought around to the guy with the 1200 SAT, the guy with the C average. The only reason is that he will have put in the work.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Should I pay off my car loan?,"I owe $8,200 on my car. My payments are about $400/mo. I am getting eaten alive on the interest rate (18.6%) because my credit sucked when I got the loan on it (its predecessor was falling apart and with the money I had to spare, I couldn‚Äôt afford to buy anything that wasn‚Äôt 15+ years old, so I used it as a down payment).

My credit has improved drastically, and I would be inclined to refinance but I lost my job in June (hence I doubt my ability to refinance). Before anyone says anything, I had every intention of refinancing my car before I lost my job, but between COVID, my former job working me to death, and my mental health taking a dive for the two reasons previously mentioned, I never got around to doing it.

I have multiple job offers on the table, so I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be working soon. The job offer I‚Äôm inclined to take has a Health Savings Account that I can put money towards (pre-tax money) and I‚Äôd like to put 10% of my paycheck towards my 401K (once again, pre-tax money).

Here‚Äôs the problem: the cost of living, mostly taxes (34.18% for both state and federal) and rent (I‚Äôm ‚Äúlucky‚Äù to only be paying $1,120/mo), is so nuts where I live that to make ends meet, I cannot take advantage of neither the Health Saving Account nor the 401K, and I‚Äôd probably have to get another job and work 6 days a week.

So, if I paid off my car, that frees up $400/mo, and my auto insurance would likely drop as well (though I‚Äôm only paying $400/mo for the 6-month policy). I can actually max out on the Health Savings Plan AND put 10% of my pay towards the 401K. I‚Äôm just hoping it won‚Äôt ding my credit too hard by paying it off (the only other debt I have is a credit card that I have less than $700 of debt on and never use; the credit card has a $9k limit and is 0% interest until Feb 2022, so I've got time to pay off the balance if I don't have to use it for anything).

From where I‚Äôm sitting, this seems like a no brainier. A car is a depreciating asset, and there's always a chance it becomes a worthless asset if it's stolen, vandalized beyond repair, or I get in a car accident that totals it. I wouldn‚Äôt have to get another job (I might anyway just for a little extra money to put back into my savings account has taken from being unemployed, and the money for paying off the car loan if I go this route), but I want my fellow Redditors' opinions on this matter in case they have some insight that I don‚Äôt have.

Edit:

I forgot about a couple of thing coming up within the next few months. My best friend and are going to be roommates. He's expecting a $300-400 rent increase when his lease expires, which he can't afford, and I'm sick of living in a shitty neighborhood and can't afford to make rent if I live anywhere in the area by myself. It's likely I will have to front the money for the security deposit with the agreement that he will reimburse me for it (I trust him to do it).

Also, if I pay off the car now, my credit will certainly take a dive, which might make finding a place a lot harder (I've dealt with landlords who would refuse anyone with a credit score of less than 750, and my score ranges from 718 to 788 depending on what score we're talking about. Also, my experience is that the better my credit score, the cheaper the deposit.

The job I plan to take starts Sept 27th, and I won't see my first paycheck until midway through October. I have another month of rent and living expenses, plus I have to renew my car's registration, but by auto insurance policy and renter's insurance policy as well this month.

So, I plan to pay off the car by the end of the year when I should be in my new place and bringing in a paycheck.",finance

3. SEC Chair Gensler gave another speech strongly signaling that a lot of stablecoins, lending platforms, synthetics platforms, and other DeFi projects are probably non-compliant in the eyes of the SEC. I would heed this warning very carefully if I were one of those projects. [https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tusQLLCgrDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tusQLLCgrDs)

5. We‚Äôre now up to 5 different states that are getting after BlockFi for their crypto lending activities. Reportedly, this includes New Jersey, Vermont, Alabama, Kentucky, &amp; Texas. Probably relevant for those building lending solutions on Cardano. [https://www.coindesk.com/blockfi-receives-fifth-cease-and-desist-from-kentucky-financial-regulator](https://www.coindesk.com/blockfi-receives-fifth-cease-and-desist-from-kentucky-financial-regulator)
6. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy ‚Äúsome things‚Äù minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
7. Cardano‚Äôs closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it‚Äôs EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We‚Äôll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano‚Äôs deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

8. Senators Toomey, Wyden, &amp; Lummis took to the Senate Floor to plead for a vote on their amendment which would fix the overly broad crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423381402905726983](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423381402905726983) [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423413806634577922](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423413806634577922)
9. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements. This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry! Please call your Senators and ask them to support the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis Amendment!

13. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. Both revisions were good for Cardano since they included proof-of-stake implicitly and then explicitly. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424040216961114112](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424040216961114112) [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424074177770921992](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424074177770921992)

19. Very action packed day today (Aug 9). The Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema came together and proposed a compromise amendment to the crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. They were not able to include any section for exclusion of developers from the ‚Äúbroker‚Äù definition but did cover the previous progress on transaction validators and wallet sellers.

CryptoCurrency,Top 10 Cryptocurrency Conspiracy Theories - from the totally absurd to the highly probable,"What is a conspiracy theory? A crazy wacky fringe movement? An alternate way of thinking? Something different from mainstream news? Or a dystopian look at a tangible future reality?

###Bitcoin Signals the End Times

- This theory revolves around the Bible book Revelations chapter 13 ‚Äú16¬†It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, 17¬†so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.‚Äù

While Bitcoin does represent a shift to a cashless society, it‚Äôs highly unlikely that we are going to have tattoos of Bitcoin QR codes on our foreheads‚Ä¶ anytime soon. 


###China Invented Bitcoin

- The theory claims that China is the original developer of Bitcoin. While the concept does seem far-fetched, China housed the largest number of BTC miners in the world. They were also home to the largest BTC mining rig manufacturer in the world, Bitmain.

Recent regulations by China outlawing all mining and now even blocking access to exchanges and references to cryptocurrencies outside of it‚Äôs borders have probably put an end to this theory‚Ä¶ for now. 


###The Single World Currency

- The banks Goldman Sachs,  ING and the Rothschild family are strengthening their ties to cryptocurrency businesses and creating a mysterious new IMMO cryptocurrency linked to ‚Äúthe price of gold or other limited natural resources‚Äù and used to ‚Äúmaintain control over the market of cryptocurrency‚Äù.

The dark fantasies of a global cartel attempting to take over the world‚Äôs financial systems. The baseless conspiracies swirling around IMMO seem to have been an effort to suture toxic fictions onto the anti-authoritarian idealism behind bitcoin. Vitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum tried to tamp down the hysteria, writing on Reddit that ‚Äúthey are just people born into various old-money-type high society positions, and the theories that they are anything beyond that are fairly baseless.‚Äù


###NSA behind the Algorithm

- This is a claim that the  National Security Agency invented the SHA-256 algorithm. SHA-256 is the mathematical protocol that Bitcoins‚Äôs Proof-of-Work system functions within.

This theory does not hold up well when you consider that SHA-256 is an open algorithm that the best cryptographers in the world have examined for over fifteen years without discovering flaws.


###Satoshi Nakamoto is A.I. 

- Bitcoin contains 31 thousand lines of coding. Professional coders will tell you that this is not a large amount. To put the size of the Bitcoin protocol into perspective, Windows has 50 million lines of code. Still, the quality of the coding and impact of the technology has led a small group to believe Artificial Intelligence developed BTC.

Discussions regarding the probability of this theory are plentiful. To date, no hard evidence has surfaced, and it‚Äôs hard to imagine that someone could program an AI so advanced. However, it may continue to exist until Satoshi Nakamoto comes forward, if he/she/they/it ever does.


###21e8

- On Wednesday, June 20, 2018, a new block was mined on the Bitcoin blockchain. It was a typical block, except that its hash was 00000000000000000021e800c1e8df51b22c1588e5a624bea17e9faa34b2dc4a It caused a massive uproar among the community, with Twitter and Reddit awash with speculations concerning the origins and meaning of the number.

Firstly, The number of zeros at the beginning of the block hash was similar to the ones in the block hash of the Genesis Block, or the first block of Bitcoin ever mined and it was speculated that it is highly improbable for the hash to be generated at random.
Secondly, the number that came after the first zeros was 21e8. This number is an important one in physics because it refers to the E8 Theory, which is an attempt to describe all known fundamental interactions in physics and to stand as a possible theory of everything. Possible explanations for the event ranged from a simple chance to A.I. or Nakamoto‚Äôs resurgence and even time travel.


###Bilderberg Bitcoin

- This conspiracy claims that members of the Bilderberg group, the Federal Reserve, and Mastercard conspired in 2018 to take over the Bitcoin market through the use its subsidiary, AXA strategic ventures, who invested $55 million into Blockstream.

Blockstream is one of the primary funders of the Bitcoin core development team, and the Bilderberg Group contains some of the world‚Äôs wealthiest people. This strategy of investing heavily into BTC‚Äôs development could give significant control to a centralized body. It is claimed they have taken over Bitcoin, crippled it, to turn it into a currency system that they control &amp;amp; profit from. Further supporting the idea that small but extremely wealthy groups are owning more and more Bitcoin, accumulating wealth and manipulating the markets. Whale watchers take note.


###Governments Are Buying up All the Bitcoin

- This theory doesn‚Äôt take much to imagine. According to believers of this theory, governments around the world are secretly buying up all of the Bitcoin in the world.¬†

While it may be difficult to prove precisely how much Bitcoin governments own, there has been an uptick in crypto confiscations. These confiscations have led to some serious funding boosts for the countries involved. There is a long list of countries but special attention is often paid to Bulgaria which isn‚Äôt officially storing Bitcoin but has made millions from selling confiscated coins.


###A Single Trader Crashed Mt. Gox

- Evidence presented by BitcoinMarkets on Reddit seems to link the Mt. Gox collapse in 2018 to the movements of one trader. Mt. Gox was the largest crypto exchange in the world until it collapsed in February 2014 due to multiple hacks. The exchange‚Äôs collapse caused the entire BTC market to tank for months.

According to this newly found evidence, on December 22 2017, a trustee moved 6,000 BTC which caused the value of the coin to drop from $16,000 to $10,000 briefly. The same seller dumped another 6,000 BTC on January 31 and yet another 6,000 BTC on February 5. This case makes it the fourth time for Mt.Gox to directly or indirectly crash the bitcoin price. First time was hack in 2011, then a DDos in 2013, 2014 is when they went bankrupt and now this sell off.


###U.S. Government Regulating cryptocurrency away

- Crypto haters in the government are pursuing a one-two punch: first, use the new US tax bill to cripple proof of stake and DeFi projects with compliance costs; second, come after Bitcoin using environmental regulations.

Not so much a theory as a discernible concern at this stage. There's a good chance the White House and its allies are conspiring against the crypto industry. It's easy to suggest it's because our political leaders are old or stupid or anti-technology, but there is probably something else at work: Crypto threatens the government‚Äôs control of the currency, and messing with the money supply will always lead to serious repercussions. 

. . .

###When conspiracy theories are telling you where to look, they are often also telling you were not to look. 

So in conclusion, there are clearly some ridiculous and hilarious theories circulating which are nothing more than funny stories. Then there are the clearly harmful and damaging theories, whose sole purpose seems to be to muddy the waters and stir up hatred and anger towards particular groups. However, there are also some reports that are compelling and if proven correct may cause a serious setback to cryptocurrencies.

###Take care and think carefully before choosing to believe any of these stories.

CryptoCurrency,The truth about IOTA rising +90%,"#**What‚Äôs IOTA?**

IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger and cryptocurrency designed for the Internet of things (IoT). It uses a directed acyclic graph to store transactions on its ledger, motivated by a potentially higher scalability over blockchain based distributed ledgers.

#**Why is IOTA rising so rapidly?**

In the last months IOTA upgraded their mainnet which required everyone to migrate their tokens, including exchanges. Binance and other exchanges disabled deposits and withdrawals during that time.

Binance uses custom Ledger hardware devices and software on their backend. So they had to wait on Ledger to update their software integration. Just recently they were able to resume withdrawals.

Since Binance is roughly ~80% of IOTAs trading volume, coin supply on exchanges went up since nobody was able to withdraw. Simultaneously big short positions built up as well.

#**The Breakout**

The short squeeze began, millions in short positions rekt as Binance resumes withdrawals after months. People were desperately waiting to withdraw all their IOTAs since they were so fed up with exchanges gatekeeping their coins.

Liquid supply became illiquid really rapidly. Less exchange supply means higher prices.

#**The Technology**

IOTA recently announced, running smart contracts on the current decentralized devnet. This is quite an advancement, but certainly not really the reason for the current outbreak.

I can recommend everyone to check out IOTAs roadmap and goals towards crypto innovation. They are by far the ones that are advancing the most towards solving the limitations of the blockchain and the trilemma between security, scalability and decentralization. Feeless transactions are unarguably the future of DeFi crypto.

IOTA received a lot of hate from the community since they were often too optimistic with ETAs and deadlines in the past. Nonetheless they are advancing with a completely new approach on crypto, with not really many projects to compare to. ‚Äî I‚Äôd say IOTA just reached their normal coin value again, since they had a similar valuation before the -50% market crash caused by Tesla, China bans, Leverage capitulation etc.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Do cryptocurrencies really solve the problems we have with fiat currencies and banks?,"Disclaimer; about 1/4 of my life savings is in cryptocurrencies, and I'm still DCA'ing in slowly. That being said, I want to talk about 2 of the biggest problems this community usually claims that crypto solves; monetary inflation (FED money printer) and credit bubbles (banks).

FED has been non-stop issuing new USD, and injecting it into the economy. It is widely feared that this will soon result in USD losing its value, and lead to inflation, and a big economic crisis. Same applies to other fiats as well, money printers have gone wild all over the world.

The second issue is banks giving out loans with money they don't have in their reserves. This, when done with responsibility and caution, helps the economy grow and can be a good thing. However it also has been abused many times, causing disasters like the mortgage crisis of 2008.

Now, to come to the main question; Isn't all of this already happening in the crypto space as well (albeit on smaller scales)?

Money printer?

Just look at Tether as the biggest example. They ""claim"" to back the Tether with real assets and currency, though they've not been through any real audits, and their money printer keeps brr'ing non stop. And Tether is not the only one pulling this, just the most widely discussed one.

What about banks? 

This is my bigger gripe. **Aren't crypto exchanges slowly starting to resemble banks?** Let's say I'm keeping 1,000 tokens of a random cryptocurrency on an exchange I trust, and even receiving interest on it. The exchange is free to play with my tokens as they wish, like give all 1,000 of it as 'loan' to someone else on the blockchain. Even worse, if they manage to keep all the transactions within the exchange, i.e. the person who takes the loan uses it to purchase something from someone who also is using the same exchange, the tokens don't need to move at all. The system can claim to move the coins between different exchange user accounts, without touching the blockchain. Exchange then can give multiple times their reserves out as loans.

Not until I or other token holders try to withdraw more tokens than what's left in the exchange's wallet at a specific time, we'll never find out. And if that happens, it's not going to be very different than what happened in 2008, the exchange, and people holding their investments there are fucked. This is no different than banks giving fiat that does not exist, they can loan out crypto that doesn't exist, potentially creating the same credit bubble.

Crypto is going more mainstream every day. Increased adoption by financial institutions will come with all the baggage those institutions have in the first place.

This has been on my mind for some time, and haven't seen it discussed much here. Wanted to share my thoughts with the community and read what you guys think about it.",cryptocurrency

*1. Drunken Rant*

What made altcoins terrible to hodl in 2018-2019 was the fact there was little actual product and nearly zero real adoption. 

Alt coins make up a diverse ecosystem of value added services that didn‚Äôt exist in 2017.

- AAVE has $27B in its liquidity pool; paying out 3-10% interest on USDC. Totally decentralized.
- Compound has $21B in its pool.
- UNI‚Äôs volume in august was $39B.
- ‚Å†$3.3B of NFTs were purchased on open sea in august.
- ENJIN network (NFT gaming token) has over 20 million users. The token backs 1.1+ BILLION assets. Their app has 2.3M+ downloads.

This is only the beginning. 
- MANA and the sandbox are making inroads into a decentralized meta verse - though one can argue adoption is lagging. People certainly are willing to pay for the land. 
- Tezos averaged 38-40k transactions per day earlier this year. Over the last few weeks it‚Äôs averaged about 250k transactions per day. This is 3x ADAs volume. 
- the monumental size of stablecoins of which USDC seems to have the best mixture of fundamentals and usage.

personalfinance,What to do with School Semester Refund,"Hi all, friendly neighborhood college student here. Wondering how to make the make the most of my school refund. Background info time.

Just turned 24, which means finally federally recognized as independent student (been paying my own tuition for 6 years, fafsa such a scam), which means expected family contribution finally alligns withs reality (aka $0), which means I finally get more from fafsa.

Tuitions costs ~$7200 per semester. Between Pell grant and my school‚Äôs ‚Äújunior/senior‚Äù grant, im getting ~$5100 in grants per semester. Qualified for about another $4k in loan totals, making up about 60:40 subsizidized/unsubsidized. Maybe the other way around, cant really remember and not currently in a position where I can check.

As far as I can tell, my loans don‚Äôt accumulate interest until I graduate, which is the only reason I‚Äôm considering taking the extra money instead of just denying the loan.

Anyways, this means if I take the loans, I will get about a $2k refund each semester. So, a few questions on what to do with it.

1) Should I bother accepting the loan in the first place? If i deny it, i believe I will have a few hundred dollars to pay, which I can easily do. Only bills I have are $500/m rent, $100/w food, $300/6m car insurance, plus miscelanious stuff like gas, amazon prime, etc‚Ä¶ basically, I could survive without taking it

2) if i should take it, considering the 0% interest rate till i graduate (looking like spring 2023), where should i put it? My idea here is to invest it until i graduate, then pull it out and immediately apply it to my loans before the interest kicks in. Obviously can‚Äôt predict the future, but 2 years should be enough to accumulate enough value for this to be logical, right?

Thanks, appreciate the help",finance

personalfinance,"Would you please confirm that I'm thinking about my 2022 estimated tax payment conclusion and strategy correctly? I‚Äôm new to estimated tax payments and looking for feedback, thanks!","Would you please confirm that I'm thinking about my 2022 estimated tax payment conclusion and strategy correctly?  I‚Äôm new to estimated tax payments and have done research and think I understand what I should be doing but am unsure.

&amp;#x200B;

Facts:

Assume that I'm reallocating my entire stock portfolio every quarter- so I will always be either incurring short-term capital gains or losses- so this is why the estimated tax payments will always be required if there are net capital gains.

2021 income and taxes are an extreme outlier (way higher than any other year) due to extreme outlier investment performance (stock gains being exceptionally high due an unusually good 2021 stock market year)

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion: For 2022 estimated tax payments, My understanding is that I will not want to use the prior year income safe harbor (2021 income) because I would overpay estimated taxes by an extreme amount (because 2021 taxes are an extreme outlier (way higher than any other year) due to extreme outlier investment performance)- I would instead want to use the 90% of current tax (taxes due for tax year 2022) due safe harbor.

&amp;#x200B;

2022 estimated tax payment strategy:

calculate net short-term and net long-term capital gains tax due as soon the quarter is over and pay it to Federal and California within the 15 day deadline between the end of the quarter and the estimated tax payment deadline.  Do this for each quarter.  This will guarantee that I pay over 90% of our taxes due via estimated tax payments because we usually have a $5500 tax refund due to my wife's employment withholding. So this strategy should cause us to overpay tax by about $5500 (leading to a $5500 refund on April 15. 2023) which is fine and always cause us to meet the 90% tax due safe harbor in order to avoid estimated tax payment penalties and interest.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Ethereum Vlassic? Bitcoin Sapphire? What will be the next great garbage fork?,"**No, sadly, there‚Äôs no Pickle themed Ethereum -YET- but there *are* already garbage forks.**

So for some if they newbies, garbage forks are the forks of coins that don‚Äôt typically lead to anything good.  (It‚Äôs not a technical term by the way, its -my- term lol.  Some of the best examples are Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH.). Both of these are inferior versions of the original coins that are basically riding on their coattails on name alone.

Ever take a picture of your hemorrhoids, photocopy that picture, drop it in the toilet, turn that sumabitch sideways and take a photocopy -that- copy? Yeah, that‚Äôs Bitcoin Diamond.). Anyway, how about some guesses as to the next garbage fork on the ash heap of crypto history?  Here are some of my own:

**Bitcoin Crash** (BICH) Its bitcoin, except instead of being made of Satoshis, the smaller coins are called ‚Äúbitconnectors.‚Äù  Don‚Äôt tell your wife about this one, she might say it‚Äôs a scam.

**Bitcoin Cubic Zirconium** (BCZCM) - It‚Äôs like Bitcoin Diamond, but you can only buy it at pawn shops.

**Ethereum Retro** (ETHRT) It‚Äôs like, totally awesome dude.  Use it to buy some ninja turtles figures or I dunno, bell bottoms or something.

**Ethereum Hipster** (EHH) Spend these at overpriced coffee shops while you complain about the lack of a hookah bar in your newly gentrified housing project

**DogeEatDoge** (DED) It‚Äôs great because it moves inverse of doge, meaning if you buy both Elon can‚Äôt ruin your bank account

**Cardanope** (NADA) This is excellent for the Cardano haters as it confirms their bias as it has no plan to ever release a smart contract but says it will eventually

**Icosehedron**  (ISOH) oh, so Polygon has layer 2 solutions?  Achshually, this is the first LAYER 6 SOLUTION!  Send 20 trillion transactions per millisecond AND tell you friends you‚Äôve got a girlfriend in France that will be flying in one day while you adjust your fedora!

**Algoransom** (ALGOSM) -Please, please stake this coin so we can never unlock it until you pay us more money

\*\**Also, obligatory I don't know shit about fuck.*

As I stated in the title, a majority of the reason people don't understand crypto stems from the fact they hardly understand (or care to understand) the mechanics of the financial systems we've already had for decades. The general public can be pretty ignorant of the finer points of financial affairs, and a lot of them don't even understand the history and functionality of the money they use everyday.

* They don't know about the [Nixon Shock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nixon-shock.asp) or what that implies about USD.
* They don't know how the [federal reserve printed roughly 22%](https://www.somagnews.com/9-trillion-story-22-of-us-dollars-printed-in-2020/) of the money in circulation in 2020, or how [it ramped up even more to 40% of money in circulation](https://techstartups.com/2021/05/22/40-us-dollars-existence-printed-last-12-months-america-repeating-mistake-1921-weimar-germany/) in a little over the past year.
* They don't understand the kind of influence over daily events the banking systems holds by being so centralized.

The **real** indicator, in my opinion, that we're still early is the lack of adoption of cryptocurrency in the modern world. Even after this process has been more or less completed (however long that will take), most people probably still won't grasp how the new system they're using works on too deep of a level.",cryptocurrency

gaming,Final Fantasy I Dawn of Souls Write Up,"Final Fantasy I Dawn of Souls- A HiddenShorts Writing


Does this game hold up in 2021? Ehh‚Ä¶.If you‚Äôre a fan of the series and want to see where it started, then yes, I‚Äôd recommend it. If you want to have an amazing Final Fantasy experience then it‚Äôs hard to recommend this game. I understand the concept of letting the player find their own path, but I personally got a little too lost and felt there wasn‚Äôt enough guidance for me to enjoy the game without the help of a guide. Or at least a quick search to find out what to do next. 

How I played GBA, Dawn of Souls Edition: 

Hours played to complete: 30

Did I complete everything? I think so. Finished the story, completed all four bonus dungeons

Write up
Four Heroes of Light appear in Cornelia (don‚Äôt know how since it‚Äôs a small island with one town, and the only bridge is destroyed). The king believes they are the fabled heroes of light, ask them to save his daughter Sarah from Garland, a once proud knight of Cornelia that turned evil. 

That‚Äôs how this whole ordeal starts. You go fight Garland, kick is ass, save the princess, then the king holds to his promise to build a bridge from the island you start on. Again, this island has nothing but this one city, the Chaos Shrine, and a dungeon that was added to this addition. How the hell did the heroes get here? Some things are better not asked. 

From there you will be set out on an adventure to restore the crystals, fight bad guys, and eventually save the world from the same cataclysm that you unknowingly created. 

Oh, and you choose which four classes of characters you want. Or maybe you want all white mages. I dunno. Pick at the beginning and that‚Äôs what you stuck with. I went for a rounded (boring)  approach of fighter, thief, white mage, black mage. 

I have to say I quite enjoyed the graphics on this version of the game. While not being the original 8-bit graphics, they don‚Äôt achieve 16-bit either. A nice rounded look that carries throughout from the cities, world map, and into the detailed sprites seen during battle. It all works to create a well rounded experience, especially when playing on the small screen of a GBA.

The combat is...something. It‚Äôs the absolute basic turned based style battles. You select your attacks/spell/items, then let the stats in the background determine the play order. Nothing special here at all. Though I suppose with a game this old you wouldn‚Äôt expect much. However...using items during combat. What the hell is this? There are spells/skills available only by using items, nobody is able to learn them. I played this game for probably 20 hours before realizing you could use items repeatedly. I was always afraid to use them, thinking they were one time use. There NOTHING in this game telling you about that. Maybe something was in the manual, but who reads manuals these days?  Honestly. 

White magic. Black magic. Certain characters can learn spells, which are divided into levels. A character can learn three spells of any given level, out of four. These are not level restricted, but are class restricted (eventually you can turn your white and black mages into more buffed up, badass versions). Learn what you want, you can always unlearn a spell to make room for another.

Combat through the main game can generally be completed with spamming attacks with the occasional heal. Seriously, most battles, even boss battles, were boring affairs of holding the button to select attack, watch and wait. The main story offered practically no challenge in combat. It was awful. 

Following the story, if you call it that, is also terrible. You‚Äôre guided to the first crystal, then after that on your own. Pure exploration. While this could be fun, and I tried my best not to look up guides, eventually I couldn‚Äôt figure out where the hell the airship was. Yes, I went through the towns, talked to people, thought I knew what desert to visit, but I‚Äôll be damned if I wasn‚Äôt too stupid to figure it out. I eventually looked up what damn desert to visit. 

Exploration is a typical JRPG style world map of your character being as large as a city. Worked then, honestly still works now and wish more games stuck to thi. 

Toward the end of the main story there is a big plot twist where it‚Äôs revealed you basically doomed everybody until you fixed your own fuck up. We‚Äôre the heroes because we created the problem to fix. Perfect plan right? 

Now, the bonus dungeons. These things kicked my ass. Hard. Harder. Until I caved and looked up a guide. In short I was told to spam certain buffs (using items instead of spells obviously) during each fight. After reading that method I again was able to steamroll through most of the dungeons without much trouble. Although the end bosses were often long affairs, more of attrition than anything else. I was just too stubborn to quit and kept doing the same pattern of buffing/attacking/reviving/healing until I kicked asses. 

That said, the creativity of these was amazing. Not to be trapped with typical maze-like caves, the dungeons could be that, or full size world maps turned into a maze, or even simple puzzles like ‚Äúkill this many yellow dragons, this many green dragons.‚Äù While these were more often overly long, they added a fun diversity to the game, making me happy that I still had the physical copy of this game and a working GBA SP.",technology

In my spare time I've been learning and developing some skills that I hope to be able to use for a career change in order to significantly increase my income within the next few years, but I don't want to count on something that's not certain yet.

I have $45,000 in Federal student loans that range from 3-4.5% interest (0% until the covid relief ends in January). No other debt. I have very good credit, and I have three cards that I pay in full each month. I own a car but it's 16 years old with 100k miles and I'm not sure how long it's going to last.

I have an $8,000 emergency fund in an HYSA, and about $1700 combined between my 401k and Roth IRA. If I move out, I'll probably want to first increase the efund to $10,000 and save about $2,000 on top of that for moving expenses.

Here's my planned monthly budget. Let me know if I'm missing anything or spending too much/too little on particular categories.

*Transportation*:

$100 Gas - If I can move closer to my job or within range of public transit, this could be drastically reduced.

$50 Auto Insurance - Currently with Progressive, I'm paying for 100/300/100 BI/PD, 100/300/100 uninsured motorist, $2500 guest PIP. No comprehensive or collision.

$50 Auto Maintenance/Repair fund - This is a sinking fund, and I currently have $400 saved in it

$50 New car fund - Currently have $500 saved toward a replacement car, for when I need it

$120 Parking - Job is in the middle of a business district within a major city, street parking is not really available in the area. If I can rent a room in the city I may be able to ride the bus instead.

$7 License and registration renewal

$8 Roadside assistance

*Food*:

$200 Groceries - As I said, I'm not paying for groceries where I live right now, so I'm not sure exactly what I would need here. I'm hoping I can make 200 work.

*Health/Grooming*:

$25 General healthcare - Sinking fund to cover copays and deductibles

$5 Prescriptions - This covers the three medications I am currently taking

$10 Haircuts

*Housing and bills*:

$600 Rent and utilities - I've been looking on Craigslist and Facebook for roommate ads and this seems somewhat doable, though may take some searching. If I can find something for $500 or $550, that would be ideal. I'm willing to live in a not-so-great neighborhood if that's what it takes to make this work.

$60 Mobile phone service

*Shopping*:

$5 Clothing

$5 Gift giving - Sinking fund for covering birthday and holiday gifts

$15 Household/bathroom supplies

$50 Miscellaneous/entertainment - Could reduce this if needed but it's nice being able to buy something for myself once in a while

*Debt Repayment*:

$200 Student loans - I'm on an income-based repayment plan

*Total*: $1560 out of $1685 take-home pay

This budget would only leave me with about $125/month for retirement contributions, which is far below the usual recommendations and I'm already way behind.

Can I make this work? I know I should try to switch over to public transit, as that would save quite a lot, but it would depend on where I can find housing. Any other advice is appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Does having the money mean I SHOULD pay off one of my student loans?,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm 26. 

I have a student loan of the amount $5400 via Sallie Mae for a total of 144 months at a 10% interest rate. I pay ~$80 a month on it. 

I have a savings account with several grand in it. If I were to pay this loan off I will still have about $21,000 in savings. 

My gut tells me to just pay off the $5400 loan in full and be done with it. I still have serval loans from school but the 5,400 one is the least amount. Just because I do have the money to do this, should I?

Edit: I put at least $500 into savings every month. No credit card debt.",finance
personalfinance,How to tackle high amount in student debt?,"I have around $160,000 in student debt. I finally just recently started to make enough money to pay it off. I am currently making $180,000 per year. With my spouse, our household income is around $250,000. 

What‚Äôs the best way to do it? Should I stop all none essential expenses and pay it off as soon as possible? Or, should I stretch it out to 4 - 6 years while I invest, buy a house, buy a car, and live comfortably? All my debt is federal and is at around 6 percent. My minimum monthly expenses are around $5000.

Also, a controversial question, what are the chances that federal student loans will be eventually forgiven and discharged? Obviously I would not be a candidate for the discharge as I can pay it off. However, the thought of paying it off just before there is a full discharge has crossed my mind. 

Thanks",finance
personalfinance,Where to go from a Federal Money Market Fund?,"I have a lot of money in a Vanguard Cash Reserves Federal Money Market Fund Admiral Shares  account.  I just sort of put it there, not being sure of what to do with it and being happy the return was better than a bank account.

The amount is now large enough that I am embarrassed to have it there with such a poor return.

I looked at the mix of things in my retirement funds.  I already have a Roth IRA.  I understand you can only contribute about $6,500 year, which is already being done.

Any advice on a savings/investment/retirement vehicle that is reasonably stable, reasonably *liquid*, and will give me a better return?",finance
personalfinance,Car financing advice for someone keeping money invested?,"So I've never financed a car before (previous two were under $10k used cars I paid cash for) but am considering it for my next car this week. I have the cash to pay in full, but have been keeping it invested in stocks where it has been making me money with probably a 10+ percent return during the last year (it may be more but I can't accurately check right now, but it's never been in the red for a rolling year period).

I like paying in full for vehicles and avoiding falling behind. However I see finance options with 1.9%APR for example. If APR is the interest rate (again, no financing experience yet) then it seems to make sense to finance and keep my money invested in stocks, only selling as needed to make car payments, correct?

If I go this route, what fine print or pitfalls will I possibly get into? I want to be able to put as much money as I want towards the principal and have no penalty if I pay it off in advance. Is this common? Do I need to look for specific verbiage regarding this? Are there other things in the fina financing details/lingo I need to look for?

Thanks for any input in advance.",finance

gaming,"Stop Calling Exploits ""Techs""","A fairly large game recently got an announcement that an exploit that was widely used in high-level play will be removed soon. Many players of said game have gotten extremely upset about this, somewhat understandably, but it got me thinking. 

Gamers these days have normalised exploits to such an extent that they try to refer to it as ""techs"", to get away from the bad connotations the word ""exploit"" has. When you're using a tech, you're just good at the game, when you're using an exploit, you're doing something that isn't intended and might even be considered cheating. Just because a game engine has a certain area that provides infinite loot under certain conditions doesn't mean that using it isn't exploiting the game. 

Just because a game engine allows instantly transferring your momentum from one direction to another, doesn't mean you aren't exploiting the game. 

Now, that's a pretty strong statement to some people, so I'll say that I have nothing against using exploits, as long as they aren't blatantly unfair. As long as it's all in the name of fun. What I do have against exploits is getting so used to them that you consider a game or the Devs bad or clueless for deciding that it isn't something that they want to keep around. 

Exploiting is technically cheating. Playing a game in a way that was not indended by the creators to give yourself an unfair advantage is a bannable offence in most games. Just because you're really really good at using that exploit does not change the fact that it is an exploit, and you should expect it to get changed or removed in the future. 

People have built streaming careers around becoming highly skilled at using these exploits, and then complain when the Devs state that the unintended behaviour that they have been abusing is getting removed. The moment an exploit becomes wide-spread is inevitably when it gets removed, so in a way, those people who spend so much time publicising the exploits that they abuse are the ones who bring about the removal of the exploits. 

To summarize, just because it's repeatable and you can get highly skilled at using it, doesn't make it any less of an exploit. 

Now, for the whole ""techs"" vs ""exploits"" terminology, I would define a tech as a technique that you can use within the legal, intended parameters of the game, that can be practiced to become formidable. An exploit, on the other hand, is a method or technique that is *not* within the legal, intended parameters of the game. Now, that might seem a bit arbitrary to you, and to a certain extent it is - many techs started out as exploits that got refined and kept in the game, but a good rule of thumb is that if it requires binding certain keys to something like a scroll wheel or macro to spam inputs repeatedly and confuse the game engine, that's a god damn exploit and expecting it to stay around is moronic. 

There are tons of games that have had things like the jump key bound to the scroll wheel for whacky effects, or the fire button bound to the scroll wheel to allow for rapid-fire. Certain abilities in games could be spammed with extrememly fast inputs to provide unintended results. This sort of exploit is not new, but no matter what, it still remains an exploit. 

Just because you can do it doesn't mean you should take it for granted an expect it to stay around forever. Have fun with it while it lasts, but stop calling exploits ""techs"" because that implies they are intended and won't be removed. And don't base your career or game strategy around using an exploit because that's just stupid, it'll get removed sooner or later, and then you'll be right back at square one. 

And finally, for the love of God, if you want to keep using an exploit don't show it to a youtube or twitch audience in the thousands, because what the hell do you expect to happen when you publicise an unintended mechanic that gives you an objective advantage over other players? 

Don't be stupid, and don't rely on unintended mechanics then get angry when the unintended mechanics are taken away from you. Stop treating unintended mechanics like they're normal, because that just makes it worse for you when they get removed or nerfed. (And they will. Don't kid yourself.)",technology
Bitcoin,Update: Sold my investment property for bitcoin,"Yes, the title is true and I did this last years. It was an investment property. Here's what I've learned along the way.

I see 3 paths for someone who is working and having disposable income. The first path is saving, a guaranteed losing option. Most who are saving think of it as safety and do not understand (yet) what is going on. They are years away from waking up. The second path -and probably much more dangerous-is the speculator. Options, random stocks, random cryptos, etc. I am not making fun of this person-I was this person 2 years ago. They are motivated by the right reasons often. Most will lose the vast majority of their money. It's a step 90% of us take. The third choice is an asset accumulator -they can have a short term trading horizon, but this person has the attitude that they must keep XYZ bitcoin.

\-I continue to DCA and think it's the only strategy that works for 90% of people because most people that say they are waiting for a dip are talking, not planning. The dca is an actual plan. The ""I will buy at 20k"" crowd is the same crowd that loves to give opinions and talk. Talk is cheap. do not listen to these people-hanging out with them will make you poorer.

\-The vast majority of people are clueless about what bitcoin, and crypto in general, is. This is a very good thing.

\-The average person brought into bitcoin brings 1-2 more people. Monstrous.

\-I knew several people who were saying from 2015-2020 the housing market would crash. Most of them have recently bought homes. I still think housing, especially luxury housing, goes up fast. Most of these people have little to no bitcoin relative to their net worth.

\-There are many in bitcoin who have bought with no research. There seem to be more who hate bitcoin/think it's a scam who have done no research.

\-I commented on an earlier post, and as huge real estate bull this pains me to admit: bitcoin in my opinion is much better than real estate at this point. Both are bets on long term interest rate suppression because of aging demographics, more money printing/debt, and essentially a debasing monetary culture. Bitcoin has the advantage of a fixed supply. The only reason I see real estate being better is if someone is okay with 20/1 leverage and/or buying a house and renting 3/4 rooms out. 

\-Bitcoin is not mainstream yet. Most people have more wealth on their wrist than they do in bitcoin. 80% of the people I know, most who have at least $2,000 month in disposable income, some who have $10--$12,000 a month in disposable income, have zero bitcoin. The rest have a laughably small amount.

\-Most people who don't participate do so because of three things that all revolve around not putting in work: they think they are much smarter than they are (Go ahead: ask your friends how smart do you think you are? the answers are telling), they have not put in the work (very dangerous for a not smart person), and they believe I'm too late (once again, they do not put in the most basic of work).

\-I can see that with bitcoin getting yield, it will start to nip at a small amount of bonds. The bond market is hundreds of trillions. Or, simply, there are 14 trillion dollars of negative interest bonds and much more to be issued in the future. Crypto is 2 trillion and bitcoin is 1 trillion. I expect the crypto market to be 20-30 trillion within 10 years.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Unpopular Opinion: [Insert your favorite coin] will never become universally adopted,"I‚Äôm not going to provide a lot of substance to back up my point, but I have two points I want to make:

(1) The US is unlikely to adopt a cryptocurrency as a legal tender. If they do then it will be their own coin, and certainly not Bitcoin or nano or any other mainstream coin. If they adopted Bitcoin then the Federal Reserve would be out of it job (which might be a good thing, but this is the US we are talking about). As long as the US dollar remains the national currency, then that‚Äôs what people will need to pay their taxes in. Thus once a year there will be a massive conversion from shitcoin X to USDs.

CryptoCurrency,My grandparents plan to give money for my kids. Give me a reason not to invest all of it into crypto.,"So last weekend my grandparents told me they want to give us money for both their grandchildren. They told me to invest it as I please. But they emphasized since there are negative interest rates and a projection of at least 5% inflation and that I should look into ETFs. The amount of money is as much as I have saved working for 2 years full time while saving extra during Corona times (instead of buying crypto fml). Anyway this is a very generous gift since the money is the result of them leading a very humble life. 

Now if the money would be for me, I'd DCA all of it into crypto in the coming 2 years. However, I am now in the position that I am administrating the money of my kids (2 and 6 years old) which is supposed to support their university and early career life.

CryptoCurrency,How bad is it that most people do not understand the math behind cryptocurrencies?,"As a computer science student I tend to be around people exactly like me: nerdy, educated and with a fairly good understanding of math and cryptography. As such, it is easy to forget that most people never heard of asymmetric cryptography, elliptic curves and zero knowledge proofs. Even amongst cryptocurrency enthusiasts, knowledge about the underlying math and technology is not as common as one would hope for.

I also don't expect that to ever change. At the rate these technologies are advancing, it is even hard for computer scientists to keep up, let alone the general public.

So, how will this impact the future of cryptocurrencies? I would argue that there are at least the following aspects to it:

1. People fear what they don't understand. This negatively impacts the trust in cryptocurrencies and could be a major problem for widespread adoption.

2. Not knowing how technology works makes you vulnerable. We see similar problems with smartphones and messenger apps, where most people are not aware of problems concerning their  privacy. This is even more problematic in crypto where people's money is on the line. Even tech-savvy users get hacked, so how do we expect normal people to protect themselves?

3. Only having a small number of people know how a financial system works is against the core idea of decentralization. Crypto should allow anyone to participate. Sure, we have public proposals and votes on protocol changes. But these proposals are made by people that have in depth knowledge of the system. If this does not change, it leads to a small amount of people having significantly more impact on monetary policy than others.

economy,How are art markets related to interest rates?,"**TL:DR: Art markets perform well during low-interest rate regimes**  


Art prices have tended to move inversely in line with real interest rates, *ie*, interest rates after inflation. Periods of falling and/or low real interest rates have often coincided with rising art prices. This relationship is rooted in the nature of art as an investment. Art assets do not pay an income stream. When real interest rates are high or rising, the opportunity cost of owning art is higher. Owners pass up the returns they might otherwise have earned on interest-bearing assets. However, this consideration fades as real rates fall, hence art‚Äôs often-stronger performance in such times.

&amp;#x200B;

Central banks around the world are committed to keeping interest rates low for the foreseeable future. But extensive monetary easing plus government spending has increased the risk of inflation in the future. History shows that art (and other real assets like wine, vintage cars, real estate, commodities) prices rise during inflationary periods and outperform financial assets like stocks and bonds.

CryptoCurrency,Introducing Coins and Tokens - 10 of the most common categories defined in simple terms.,"There are various categories and sub-categories of coins and tokens with some projects falling under more than one category. Tokens differ from coins as they are created on existing blockchains. Depending on the token, they can be sold, traded, exchanged, and staked just like any other cryptocurrency. 

###Stable Coins

- Projects that link their value to another ‚Äòstable‚Äù asset, such as fiat currencies, like the dollar or euro, precious metals such as gold or other even cryptocurrencies. They are linked either through a¬†smart contract by being backed one-to-one with the underlying asset or through introduction of supplementary instruments and incentives, not just the collateral - DAI, USDT, USDC etc.

###DeFi Coins 

- Used to facilitate interaction and engagement with Decentralised finance (Defi) ecosystems and protocols, which include banking services (borrowing and lending), exchanges (swaps) and investment tools (futures, longing and shorting) etc. UNI, LINK, AAVE, CAKE, MKR, RUNE, COMP, SUSHI etc.

###Wrapped Tokens 

- A token with a value identical to another cryptocurrency.¬†Often used to be more easily utilised by decentralized applications (DApps) because they are much quicker not worked through multiple blockchains. For instance Wrapped Bitcoin WBTC on the Ethereum network address the restrictions of the lack of cross-chain interoperability within the two different blockchains. - Specific to the Platform

###Utility Tokens 

- Primarily used to access a company‚Äôs digital product or service. In other words, utility tokens are designed so users can interact with the software using the tokens. Users can pay for, hire, earn or be rewarded for engagement, with these tokens. Unlike security tokens, utility tokens are not used as investments as they can be exempted from the federal laws governing securities if they are properly set up. - FIL, SIA, CVC etc.¬†

###Governance Tokens 

- Used for blockchain-based voting systems. Users who hold governance tokens are able to vote on new proposals and upgrades to the protocol, and their vote is often weighted in proportion to the number of governance tokens the hold.¬†- UNI, AAVE, CRV, BAL etc.

###Security Token

- Resembling traditional investments and are used to represent ownership of real-world assets and financial instruments (securities), such as company stocks, bonds, and real estate, with associated rights to dividends, profit sharing etc. Moreover, security tokens are actual financial securities. So, your tokens are backed by something tangible, like assets, revenues, and/or profits of the company. Unlike Utility tokens they are governed by SEC laws and regulations.

###Shit Coins

- With little to no real utility and no immediate discernible purpose and rarely created in good faith. Value based purely on speculation and shilled with pump‚Äôn‚Äôdump schemes. (Mostly just tokens, created on the Ethereum or Binance chain and rarely coins at all) - Unfortunately too many to mention

###Meme Coins

- Another coin mostly without a specific utility but with a highly supportive network or fanbase primarily on Social media. Usually promoted for self-referential fun or purposeful disruption - DOGE, SHIB, BAN etc.

###Charity Tokens 

- A charity token allocates a percentage from each transaction and funnels it to various charitable organizations ‚Äî sometimes those organizations are distinctly laid out in their white paper and sometimes they are voted on by the community - SVS, PAWS, AOG etc.

###Non-Fungible Tokens 

- NFTs represent ownership rights to a unique or limited  digital or real-world asset, using identification codes and metadata that distinguish them from each other. ""Tokeninzing"" these assets allows them to be bought, sold, and traded. NFTs can also be used to represent peoples identities, property rights etc. - Cryptopunks, Cryptokitties, BAYC etc.

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. IOHK releases a detailed thread on concurrency and upcoming documentation to help quell some of the misinformation currently circulating on this topic. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1434518391465943048](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1434518391465943048)
2. Cardano City has finally dropped. The mysterious project appears to be art NFTs as expected. [https://cardanocity.io/](https://cardanocity.io/)
3. Here‚Äôs a cool website that attempts to rundown all the Cardano projects. [https://www.cardanocube.io/](https://www.cardanocube.io/)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Cardano has been listed by Bitpoint in Japan! [https://www.bitpoint.co.jp/news/info/info-2021080301/](https://www.bitpoint.co.jp/news/info/info-2021080301/)

3. SEC Chair Gensler gave another speech strongly signaling that a lot of stablecoins, lending platforms, synthetics platforms, and other DeFi projects are probably non-compliant in the eyes of the SEC. I would heed this warning very carefully if I were one of those projects.

5. We‚Äôre now up to 5 different states that are getting after BlockFi for their crypto lending activities. Reportedly, this includes New Jersey, Vermont, Alabama, Kentucky, &amp; Texas. Probably relevant for those building lending solutions on Cardano.

6. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy ‚Äúsome things‚Äù minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
7. Cardano‚Äôs closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it‚Äôs EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We‚Äôll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano‚Äôs deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

[https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423381402905726983](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423381402905726983) [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423413806634577922](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423413806634577922)
9. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements. This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry! Please call your Senators and ask them to support the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis Amendment!

13. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill.

19. Very action packed day today (Aug 9). The Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema came together and proposed a compromise amendment to the crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. They were not able to include any section for exclusion of developers from the ‚Äúbroker‚Äù definition but did cover the previous progress on transaction validators and wallet sellers.

It just means we gradually trend up without an 70%-80% pull back.","I made a thread about a week ago with regards to BTC supercycle theories / people posting their ideas about it. **2 of these cycle theories were data-driven, and dictated by nothing more than numbers, one simply cited environmental factors like the Federal reserve and interest rates, etc.** If you're curious you can read about that thread here: https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pe6uf1/3_credible_analysts_who_think_this_time_we_break/

CryptoCurrency,El Salvador makes history: Will Bitcoin bring it prosperity? - Crypto Virtuoso Chicky Nuggys Expert Opinion,"El Salvador makes history tomorrow by becoming the first country in the world to make Bitcoin official legal tender - and other nations will soon follow suit, predicts the CEO of this Reddit account Chicky Nuggy.

The prediction from Chicky Nuggy comes ahead of Tuesday‚Äôs adoption of the cryptocurrency as national currency alongside the U.S. dollar in the small Central American country.

Currently, outside of the U.S. and its territories, there are seven other sovereign nations that use the U.S. dollar.

Nuggy comments: ‚ÄúEl Salvador is making history with a bold jump into the future of money ‚Äì which is, inevitably, digital ‚Äì by officially recognising Bitcoin as legal tender together with the U.S. dollar.

‚ÄúOther countries, in particular other Central and South American nations, will be watching with great interest to see if the experiment works to shore up El Salvador‚Äôs shaky economy.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no doubt that there are major risks attached to the decision made by the young maverick president, Nayib Bukele.

‚ÄúThese include that there is a possibility that El Salvador could run out of dollars and that institutions, such as the IMF, might not look favourably on a nation that has adopted Bitcoin.‚Äù

The risks prompted some El Salvadorans last week to take to the streets to protest against the adoption of Bitcoin as an official currency.

Chicky continues: ‚ÄúHowever, I‚Äôm giving El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin move a cautiously optimistic welcome for five key reasons

‚ÄúFirst, El Salvador chose to be reliant upon a major ‚Äòfirst-world‚Äô currency, the U.S. dollar, to complete transactions.¬†But this reliance on another country‚Äôs currency also comes with its own set of, often very costly, problems.¬†

‚ÄúThe El Salvadoran government cannot print its own money and the economy cannot benefit from the U.S. Federal Reserve‚Äôs money-printing agenda. Therefore, El Salvador must either borrow or earn the dollars it needs.¬†

‚ÄúA stronger U.S. dollar can have a crippling impact on emerging-market economies, such as that of El Salvador.

‚ÄúBy adopting a cryptocurrency as legal tender these countries then immediately have a currency that isn‚Äôt influenced by market conditions within their own economy, nor directly from just one other country‚Äôs economy.¬†

‚ÄúBitcoin operates on a global scale and is, as such, largely impacted by wider, global economic changes.

‚ÄúSecond, central banks around the world have been devaluing their currencies, while Bitcoin‚Äôs supply is not only limited, but also new coins are mined at a decreasing rate too. El Salvadorans could, therefore, find their new adopted currency gives them more purchasing power when they buy from overseas.‚Äù

Nuggy goes on to say: ‚ÄúThird, El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin could cut the cost of remittances, a major source of income for millions of people. The remittances would be made faster and easier too, compared to money transfer services or bank wires, so remittances are likely to further increase.¬†

‚ÄúFourth, by diversifying the nation‚Äôs dollar reserves into the cryptocurrency, there could be additional opportunities to earn yield, meaning the size of the reserves would grow.

Time for a quick ad break: tell me your favourite Nuggy dip and i'll send you an award!

‚ÄúAnd fifth, El Salvador could benefit from significant¬†foreign investment and capital inflows as digital asset organisations are likely to relocate to the Bitcoin-friendly nation.‚Äù

Clearly, if the adoption proves to be a success it will be a massive step for Bitcoin‚Äôs mass adoption as other countries will follow El Salvador‚Äôs lead.

‚ÄúDue to their similar reliance on remittances, amongst other factors, other nations, including Panama, Guatemala and Honduras, could also adopt Bitcoin should the process in El Salvador run smoothly and there‚Äôs greater economic growth, stability, and levels of financial inclusion as a result.‚Äù

The Nuggy connoisseur concludes: ‚ÄúI'm giving a measured welcome to the move that could make a hugely positive impact on this Central American nation and its population.

‚ÄúThis is truly a landmark moment in the evolution of digital currency.‚Äù",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Taxes for inherited IRA - need some guidance,"Ok, Wise Ones who are more financially intelligent than me.  I need your help.

I, very unfortunately, have an inherited IRA because of my mother's sudden passing a few years ago.  I'm pretty young (mid-30s).  I set up the automatic yearly distribution thing over the phone and they were very helpful.  However, they couldn't help me figure out how much tax to have withheld from that yearly transfer (which goes from the inherited IRA to an individual brokerage account).  I understand why. But I still need to know how much to have withheld!

I forgot to get this answer before this year's schedule transfer, so I need to put money aside to pay that extra tax from my salary next April.  I also need to go ahead and set up tax withholding for Federal and State (Georgia) to start in 2022.

Is there some kind of calculator to figure this out???  I know what my marginal tax rate is...is it just that?  So if my marginal rate is 22% for Federal, I should save 22% of that distribution to pay in taxes?  And I should ask them to withhold 22% of it every year (+ whatever I need for GA)?  I'm very confused and I would appreciate some guidance.  Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Dispute with my bank.,"I'm hoping that some Capital One 360 president is reading this post today and can offer assistance. ü§ûüòã

I had a Walmart.com order for ~ $2190 back in May for a watch and other things. The shipping box that the watch came in had a hole in the side of and it was retaped shut with clear packaging tape instead of Walmart's branded tape. Well the watch was a cheaper model than what I had ordered. I complained to Walmart, sent it back, was offered a refund, was given a refund and had that refund taken away hours later because it didn't match the item description. They said they made a note of it when I called to complain earlier in the month. So on my bank statement later in May it shows an $831.04 credit (which was from when Walmart first received the package back from me) and a $831.04 debit on the same day (hours later) because the item didn't match the description (the reason for the refund) and apparently that means no further investigation is necessary. I disputed it twice and got the same resolution of basically they refunded you already. I sent Capital One e-mails that showed I initiated a return, FedEx shipped the package, Walmart received the package and issued the refund, then (later that same day) Walmart cancelled the refund and recharged me because the watch I sent back didn't match the one I ordered. Walmart already knew that though since I called and complained the day I received the wrong watch. Also, when I look up the order through Walmart's chat it says I was recharged. I told Capital One that I originally ordered the watch in that ~$2190 order. 

I'm still owed $831.04, aren't I?

Some other tidbits.. I asked to speak to someone ""higher up"" at Capital One, but I guess they don't exist because the agent I always get first tries to resolve it. Unsuccessfully.

The agents I get also just finish talking after they see I was refunded and charged the same day. They start off all supportive and then it's a brick wall. It's like no one is making an effort to actually investigate the issue because it shows a +/- on the same day for the same amount.",finance
crypto,How much does undergrad prestige matter when applying for a crypto PhD?,"I know there are lots and lots of general questions about undergrad prestige but I wanted to try and give a little bit more information about my situation to make the best guess, I hope that's not a problem. I'm an high school graduate from Turkey. I'm able to go to the [Hacettepe University](http://www.mat.hacettepe.edu.tr/index-en.html) this year but next year I'll be able to go to [Middle East Technical University](https://math.metu.edu.tr). These are both considered good schools in Turkey but the math program of Middle East Technical University is considered more prestigious than Hacettepe's and its language of instruction is English. (Hacettepe's language of instruction is Turkish) Hacettepe is better known by its medicine program rather than STEM programs. Although, this difference is not greatly reflected in [US News rankings](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/turkey) where Middle East Technical University ranks second and Hacettepe ranks fourth. My question is, granted I do great at college wherever I go and possibly even get a master's degree from a ""good"" college before my PhD, how much would going to Hacettepe affect my chances of admission to a PhD program (or a master's program for that matter)?

To give you a little bit more information about the universities:

* I can't really see a big difference between the faculty members in both universities except that Hacettepe has 11 more faculty members and the h-index of one professor [Mustafa Turkyƒ±lmazoglu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=F_6HfxsAAAAJ&amp;hl=tr&amp;oi=sra) is more than any professor in Middle East Technical University. 
* On average the h-indexes of the professors in Middle East Technical University seem better partly because the ones in Hacettepe often doesn't have google scholar profiles.
* Hacettepe math program is [FEDEK](http://www.fedek.org.tr/) accredited, Middle East Technical University's math program doesn't have such an accreditation.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinancing vs. PF Prime Directive,"I recently checked the rates if I refinanced my student loans with Earnest (I will check other lenders, but I plan on waiting to do anything loan related until January for obvious reasons) and now I'd like the PF community's thoughts on what to do. So here are the facts:

* I'm a 29F lawyer in a safe career (probate and estate planning) in a MCOL city
* Salary is $86k a year, monthly expenses around $2.5k ($1200 mortgage, no car payment, no credit card debt), $18k emergency fund, $18k in retirement currently (traditional IRAs) 
* $160k in student loans, interest rates between 4-7%, all unsubsidized, mostly grad school loans. Pre-covid my loans generated about $700/month in interest, I was doing income based repayments 
* Refinance rate offered through Earnest was either 3% for 10 years, or 3.67% for 20 years. So we've basically got (rough numbers)
   * Refinance, pay off in 10 years, pay $185 total in next 10 years, $1550 month/payment (difficult but doable if I forgo 
   * Don't refinance, pay off in 10 years, pay $214k in 10 years, $1750 month/payment (honestly not sure if I could afford this) 
   * Refinance, pay off in 20 years, pay $226k total in 20 years, $1000 payment
   * Stay with government, pay off in 20 years, pay $275k in 20 years, $1150 payment
   * Keep doing income based repayments, pay $200k in 23 years, but possibly have $150k of taxable income at the end (this payment, based on my current income, would be around $500/month). 

Assuming the facts around student loans don't change (avoiding getting political here), I think that doing the 20 year refinance is my best option to balance potential lifestyle changes and emergencies with saving money on my loans. The pros of government backed loans (Forbearance, forgiveness if I become disabled, disappearing at my death) just don't seem worth the interest rates if I don't plan on leaving private practice. 

So the next question becomes: if I refinance, because the loan is under 4%, do I pay minimums and invest heavily in retirement? Or pay off aggressively so I don't have student loans until age 50?",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Savings Account vs Crypto Account Stable Coin Interest. ""How much would I need in savings to earn ¬£500 per month?"" - I asked this question to two friends that both work in finance","TL:DR - In a UK bank I\`d need ¬£565,000 where as on an Exchange/DeFi investing into stable coins it's 1/10th of that at \~¬£50,000

**Background**

Friend one works at a well known banks (mortgages department), whilst friends two works in treasury.  I asked them both to answer quickly; roughly how much would I\`d need in either a regular savings account or an ISA to earn ¬£500 passive income per month.  Neither of them would know the answer, but I was just interested in their response.

Friend one said; ""probably close to a million"" whilst Friend two said; ""more than half a mil"".  

I did the calculations and the answer is that I would actually need ¬£565,000 in the banked; based off 1.07 (the best rate that I could find)

They were both shocked when I told them that I could earn \~¬£500 per month from putting ¬£50K into a stable coin such as USDC; either on an exchange or through DiFi lending that would give me a return of &gt;12%.  

**UK Banks**

In the UK, the average  savings account interest rate is just 0.01%, meaning that same ¬£50K could earn you as little as ¬£0.41 per month.

The UK has an inflation rate of 2.5% meaning the banks are not even paying us enough on our savings to break even.

&amp;#x200B;

[UK Saving Rates - Source BoE](https://preview.redd.it/k5wxqpqt4xl71.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da6b399ee3026066886ed4f0c2ec274b448f4527)

&amp;#x200B;

The best savings account that I could find in the UK will pay out 3% but only up to the first ¬£1,000, anything after that and it drops to a pitiful 0.01%. 

There's another that gives 1.75% interest... BUT, you can only hold a maximum of ¬£600 - totally useless.  

If I was happy to lock my money away for a year then I could get 1.07% with another bank.

  
**Exchanges**

So, even basic earn rates on an exchange will give you far more.  

Coinbase will pay out 2.00% APY on DAI

Binance Tether (no thanks) pays out 1.20% APY on a flexible saver

[Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) will give you 10% PA on USDC locked for 3 months (12% with higher tiers)

DiFi lending will get you 10 - 14% APY USDC",cryptocurrency

Between 95 and 97, 20-30% of the consumer in the US had invested in a home computer.  During this time Interest Rates had continued to drop, freeing up capital and people started pouring money into both Real Estate and the Stock Market.

investing,China to push on with opening capital markets to foreign investors,"**This might be good news after the rout in China tech since Feb 2021. There was a lot of uncertainty whether China is shutting itself off from foreign capital and how it could lead to delisting of ADRs like BABA, BIDU, JD, PDD, NIO, etc. But I guess they won't be turning their heads away from foreign investors anytime soon.**

BEIJING, Sept 6 (Reuters) - China will further open its capital markets to foreign investors, the country's top securities regulator said on Monday, adding that it will pursue pragmatic cross-border cooperation to regulate overseas-listed Chinese companies.

Global investors have been spooked in recent months by a flurry of Chinese regulations targeting sectors ranging from technology to private tutoring. U.S. plans to kick non-compliant Chinese firms off American exchanges has fuelled concern.

""Opening-up and cooperation is the inevitable trend in the integrated development of global capital markets,"" China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Chairman Yi Huiman told a conference organised by the World Federation of Exchanges.

China is studying further measures, including expanding the scope of the stock connect scheme linking China and Hong Kong and improving the Shanghai-London Stock Connect program, Yi said in a speech posted on CSRC's website.

Meanwhile, CSRC will conduct ""pragmatic"" cooperation in areas such as supervision of overseas-listed Chinese companies, cross-border auditing and law enforcement, he added.

Yi said that given interwoven global markets, governments should abandon the mentality of a ""zero-sum game"", as companies and investors share both the boom and the doom.

Global financial centres should facilitate cross-border financing, ""rather than become the platforms and tools governments use to sanction other countries"", Yi said, without mentioning the United States.

Yi's speech came a day after CSRC vice chairman Fang Xinghai made similar pledges to further deregulate China's markets.

China will expand the channels for foreign capital to invest in Chinese securities and futures markets, and will further facilitate the issuance of yuan-denominated ""Panda bonds"" by foreign institutions, Fang told a separate conference on Sunday.

China will also improve domestic listing rules for overseas entities, as well as regulations on overseas listings of Chinese companies, Fang said in a speech also posted on CSRC's website.

Fang also vowed to safeguard Hong Kong's status as a global financial centre, saying that Beijing supports domestic companies listing in Hong Kong.

personalfinance,Is my plan for a HYSA alright?,"Hi, I (23M) don't want to go too far into my situation but I'm looking at opening a high-yield savings account with Alliant and just want to make sure that there's nothing obvious I'm missing. I used to work paycheck-to-paycheck and so wasn't really worried about saving money as much as I was worried about having money, but my financial situation has gotten much better in last 12 months or so. Long story short, I minimized unnecessary expenses and paid off debts. I have already worked on an IRA with max contribution.

Due to savings I have about 30K in my checking account, which is great for my feelings of security but it's kind of just sitting there doing nothing. I remember when I saved up just 5K I thought that was amazing, so this is just kind of a lot to me. I do not need 30K just sitting around and have no big expenses planned soon so I want to do something useful with it. I plan to put 10K (amount can be lower but I don't want to put more for now) in an Alliant account, because that seems to be among the most recommended. Is there any particular drawback with them? I see on the sub's wiki page for banks it says there's a $20/month ""refund"" limit. Is that different from regular withdrawals? 

My parents laughed when I told them about the interest rate being 0.55 percent, but they don't even realize that their chain bank account is just 0.01 percent interest so whatever; just a laugh for anyone who wants it. I just want to know if there's something I'm missing or should be aware of beforehand, or if I should look at another HYSA account. If this is solid, then great.",finance

A merge of the physical and digital worlds to build a new ecosystem. Feeding them will earn you rewards in the native token and airdrops of future VIM. Way more complex than simple art. I am open to any questions! This will change the way you think about interacting with NFTs.

The native token is VEED and you can feed it to your VIM daily to increase their rank and earn staking rewards. On top of being smart NFTs these bad boys also act as bank/investment accounts where they pay you rewards(dividends). For me it‚Äôs primarily the community that makes it and the growth in value of my VIM is just the cherry on top. This isn‚Äôt just another shill post, this is a post of a project that has actual great potential beyond just being 2D art. 

Once you are at a high enough rank you will unlock new art and your NFT will move from a 2D to a 3D model. 

TLDR: VIM can utilize IOT tech to give it a soul, can be fed VEED to rank up and earn you staking rewards and NFT air drops.

So my boyfriend and I just sold our car and are going to buy a new (for us)  car this week. We sold out car for 3.800.000 CLP and the new car costs 7.700.000 CLP (1 USD = 770 CLP, for reference). We're going to take out a loan to pay the rest of the car, but we're wondering if it's better to save some of the money (500.000 CLP specifically) and put in mutual funds for a rainy day and take out a bigger loan (4.400.000 CLP), or if it would be best to take out a smaller loan (4.000.000 CLP). 

The interest rate is 1,36%, with the smaller loan we'd have 36 payments, and with the bigger loan, it would probably be 40-42 payments.

personalfinance,Mortgage Refinance - Please check my math,"My parents have a 20 year 3% interest rate loan with a remaining $115300 balance and 125 payments left at $1088.93 P&amp;I. It was originally $196346 opened on 12/1/12 but had some extra paid to principal.

They can refinance to a 10 year 2.24% for $1088.66 P&amp;I which would be a loan for $116944 = $115300 + $1644 closing costs (no points, no escrow).

I think the math says they should go through with it given the break even point is at payment #25 and they have no plans to move or accelerate payments beyond a few hundreds dollars whenever their checking account is higher than normal. I calculated the break even point as the payment when the new loan principal would drop below the principal of the old loan. Is this the correct way of thinking about it?

personalfinance,Use 401k for down-payment on a house or continue to rent and save and buy a house later even though interest rates may rise?,"So I recently left my old job for a new remote job. 

When leaving my firm gave me a 401k notice that I had options to either take a personal check of what I have in there (55k) or roll it over into my new 401k plan. 

My husband and I have been renting for years ($1,450 a month)   and we were thinking since interest rates are so low we should take money from my 401k and use that for a down-payment. 

I was told by Fidelity I would not be charged penalties, only taxed, if I opted to take a personal check rather than roll it over. 


What I'm wondering is, is it best to take my 401k money and deplete my 401k and start over (34 years old) and purchase a home?

Or 

Keep roll over my 401k into my new 401k and instead save for a couple years for the down-payment of a house, continue to pay rent (which goes to nothing), and interest rates will probably go up. 

I have talked to a couple of people in finance about this and it's pretty split advice. 

Half say use the 401k and buy now because renting is a waste of money, and others say don't touch your 401k and instead save. 

I'm not sure what is best financially. Or how the housing market will even go. Right now it's a sellers market and it's slim pickings on finding a house. Most are small and overpriced. We  would be looking to buy in east brunswick NJ or near around that area.

Also, can you earn interest on your crypto when holding it in a wallet or you have to connect to a third party protocol like [aave.com](https://aave.com) in order to earn interest? Or do you have to stake it (and do you have to connect to a third party in order to do that or can you do it directly in your wallet)? Or does this vary from wallet to wallet? Can some wallets pay you interest on your crypto via other methods (I know you can earn interest on a lot of custodial wallets by allowing the company to loan your crypto out)?

6. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations.

7. Cardano‚Äôs closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it‚Äôs EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We‚Äôll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano‚Äôs deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

CryptoCurrency,Crypto Adoption: International Organization for Migration (IOM) - Uses Tezos-Based Application ‚ÄòeMin‚Äô In Anti-Slavery And Human Trafficking Prevention Program,"&amp;#x200B;

[Header Image from the Thailand IOM Migration website.](https://preview.redd.it/1tro1ed2g1m71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0099e6403cd18d53a58ab453e9bfa9d1a05f71bf)

Using Tezos-based supply chain application eMin, which is developed by Diginex, the UN Agency ‚ÄòInternational Organization for Migration (IOM)‚Äô collected information on recruitment and employment experiences of Myanmar migrant workers.

### The International Organization For Migration (IOM) &amp; eMin

The UN Migration Agency (IOM) is the  leading inter-governmental organization in the field of migration and is  one of the specialized agencies of the United Nations.¬†As part of the CREST Fashion program, IOM is partnering with the fashion industry to eliminate slavery and trafficking. 

(CREST¬† stands for Corporate Responsibility in Eliminating Slavery  and Trafficking). One of the companies that take part in this program is  Delta Galil, an Israeli textile firm headquartered in Tel Aviv, with  factories around the world.

Using Tezos-based supply chain  application eMin, which is developed by Diginex, they collected  information on recruitment and employment experiences of Myanmar migrant  workers. 

*The information gathered,  enabled Delta Galil to pinpoint the stages of the labour migration  journey where migrants are particularly vulnerable to exploitation.* The first trail took place between 9 and 23 April 2021.¬†

&gt;***‚ÄúOur results showed that technology can facilitate better  communication between migrant workers and their managers while helping  international companies to get a bird‚Äôs eye view of recruitment trends  and risks in their supply chain at a regional and even global level,‚Äù***  
 ‚Äì Ms. Leanne Melnyk, Head of Global Supply Chains at Diginex  
 

Mr. Leslie Shull, Global Compliance Director at Delta Galil, explained that:

&gt;***‚Äúthe project helped identify areas where Delta Galil must  take a deeper dive to improve conditions for migrant workers in its Thai  facility. It has also informed the direction of a forthcoming review of  its factory management system and the employer-worker communications  channels.‚Äù***  
 

### United Nations and Tezos

eMin is the second Tezos-based  application that is used in humanitarian aid solutions that are used in  programs that are run by the United Nations. 

Earlier this year we reported about  the Tezos-based Digital Identity application which is developed by  ‚ÄúGravity‚Äù and is being used in the Education credentials for Syrians  under temporary protection in Turkey program for the United Nations  Development Programme (UNDP).¬†

Gravity has projects with: United  Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Norwegian Red Cross, International  Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), Norwegian  Refugee Council (NRC), Save the Children.

CryptoCurrency,El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin rollout and purchase is President‚Äôs legacy and start of ‚Äònew world‚Äô? Chicky Nuggy weighs in.,"The CEO of Nuggets has said El Salvador becoming the world‚Äôs first sovereign nation to officially buy Bitcoin and to make the cryptocurrency legal tender ushers in the ‚Äústart of a new world.‚Äù

The comments from Chicky come as El Salvador‚Äôs president confirmed that his government has bought 400 Bitcoin - worth about $21 million ‚Äì just before the Central American country formally adopts the world‚Äôs most popular cryptocurrency as legal tender. 

President Nayib Bukele said the government plans to ‚Äúbuy a lot more‚Äù too.

The price of Bitcoin rose following the announcements on Twitter to trade at around $52,680.

Nuggy says: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost universally recognised that the future of money is inevitably digital, in some form or another. 

‚ÄúEl Salvador has today made history by not only becoming the first country in the world to declare Bitcoin as legal tender, but by also becoming the first sovereign nation to officially buy it. 

‚ÄúI believe this is a threshold moment in the evolution of digital currency and that it ushers in the start of a new world as we can expect more nations, especially those with developing economies, to follow El Salvador‚Äôs historic lead.‚Äù

On Monday, the Nug conceded that there are major risks attached to the move, including that there is a possibility that El Salvador could run out of dollars and that institutions, such as the IMF, might not look favourably on a nation that has adopted Bitcoin.

These risks prompted some El Salvadorans last week to take to the streets to protest against the adoption of Bitcoin as an official currency.

However, he set out five reasons why he ‚Äúcautiously welcomed‚Äù the Bitcoin decision.

‚ÄúFirst, El Salvador chose to be reliant upon a major ‚Äòfirst-world‚Äô currency, the U.S. dollar, to complete transactions. But this reliance on another country‚Äôs currency also comes with its own set of, often very costly, problems. 

‚ÄúThe El Salvadoran government cannot print its own money and the economy cannot benefit from the U.S. Federal Reserve‚Äôs money-printing agenda. Therefore, El Salvador must either borrow or earn the dollars it needs. 

‚ÄúA stronger U.S. dollar can have a crippling impact on emerging-market economies, such as that of El Salvador.

‚ÄúBy adopting a cryptocurrency as legal tender these countries then immediately have a currency that isn‚Äôt influenced by market conditions within their own economy, nor directly from just one other country‚Äôs economy. 

‚ÄúBitcoin operates on a global scale and is, as such, largely impacted by wider, global economic changes.

‚ÄúSecond, central banks around the world have been devaluing their currencies, while Bitcoin‚Äôs supply is not only limited, but also new coins are mined at a decreasing rate too. El Salvadorans could, therefore, find their new adopted currency gives them more purchasing power when they buy from overseas.‚Äù

Nuggy went on to say: ‚ÄúThird, El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin could cut the cost of remittances, a major source of income for millions of people. The remittances would be made faster and easier too, compared to money transfer services or bank wires, so remittances are likely to further increase. 

‚ÄúFourth, by diversifying the nation‚Äôs dollar reserves into the cryptocurrency, there could be additional opportunities to earn yield, meaning the size of the reserves would grow.

‚ÄúAnd fifth, El Salvador could benefit from significant foreign investment and capital inflows as digital asset organisations are likely to relocate to the Bitcoin-friendly nation.‚Äù

Of El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin legal tender rollout and massive purchase, Nuggy concludes: ‚ÄúThe world is watching. This is likely to be President Bukele‚Äôs legacy in the making.‚Äù",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Dad wants his personal loan deposited directly into my bank account.,"My dad is getting a personal loan of about $3500 from his credit card company. It's in his name only, I'm not co-signing or anything. He wants to have the money deposited into my bank account instead of his own, then immediately use that money to pay off the remaining balance on his travel trailer (the interest rate for the loan is cheaper than what he has currently; there's also a personal reason he wants to pay it off ASAP but I don't think it matters for the questions I have).

The reason he doesn't want the loan to touch his bank account is that he recently applied for Medicaid and is worried the loan would count as income and make him not qualify. 

He asked me if I would do that for him today, I couldn't think of any reason to say no other than a general ""this is kinda squirrely"" feeling. I have a good relationship with him so I'm not worried about giving him my account number or anything like that. I told him I would think about it, and he's going to call again tonight (Tuesday). 

So, I have a few questions.

1) Is it even possible for him to get a loan direct deposited into an account that doesn't have his name on it?
2) Is it legal?
3) Is there some way this could blow up in my face or somehow put me on the hook for the loan that I'm not seeing?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin and Fiat -- deflation and inflation in equilibrium?,"While reading about the monetary policies of BTC vs Fiat, I have seen a lot of commentaries about deflation vs. Inflation, as though one system could or would become the dominant force in the world economy, but isn't it possible that the long term presence of bitcoin alongside fiat economies would create a kind of hybrid system? I think this may be what Saifedean Ammous has said in some recent interviews about bitcoin being able to 'gently dismantle the fiat house of cards'. In other words, BTC as a kind of blowing off steam mechanism for inflationary economies without losing the capital the same it is lost in a panic in inflationary spending. I'm not an economist and don't know if this subject has been covered before in these terms (i.e. the hybrid coexistence of BTC and fiat), but i would be interested if anyone has any suggestions for further study.

For me it seems like this coexistence of both models would do a lot to remove the stress and shorttermism from (hyper)inflationary situations and provide a kind of instant cool down with foundation for future spending. A kind of global economic battery that has a positive and negative charge, one that is easier to maneuver than simply one extreme or the other. Greetings from Argentina.

stocks,Thinking about going all-in with this one! ~~DraftKings $DKNG what do you think?,"I've been researching **DraftKings** and the **sports-betting industry** for a while now.  
gotta say I really liked what I found, and I think it could be a great long-term investment opportunity... but still wanted to hear people's thoughts about $DKNG.

# THE ONLINE BETTING INDUSTRY

# The market is worth $67 billion today and is estimated to reach about $93 billion by 2023‚Äîgrowing at roughly 11.5% per annum.

There are few reasons for the aggressive growth, First, more of our activities are taking place online, a trend that extends to betting as well.

The second is regulation. The U.S. Supreme Court uplifted the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act in May of 2018 to legalize sports betting on a federal level. Since then, 25 states have legalized sports betting.

# SPORTS BETTING

The most popular activity by far is [sports betting](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/americas-multi-billion-dollar-sports-betting-industry/), which makes up over 40% of the total online betting market.

&amp;#x200B;

# DraftKings

DraftKings is a *sports betting*, *daily fantasy sports contest*, and an *iGaming* operator.

In total, DraftKings now operates sportsbooks in **14 states** and averages **1.5 million monthly unique paying customers** across its online sportsbooks, iGaming, and daily fantasy offerings.

DraftKings's revenue keeps surging YOY, in Q2-2021 revenue reached $297,605M which is a 22% higher sales compared to the analyst expectations. last year the company delivered $74,998M in revenue.

The company also said that it had grown the number of monthly unique payers by 281% and the average revenue per monthly unique payer by 26%. In other words, fundamental growth was very strong.

Even though I really think that the potential for growth here is clear, the company still losing a lot of money, Cost of revenue spiked this quarter to $187,006M from $53,172M, and new loss reached $305,526M - even more than DraftKings's revenue.

personalfinance,Philosophies on Credit,"My significant other and I have competing views on credit and the credit system. Up until about a year ago both of us had no credit on our credit history. The back story there is in her early to mid 20s she abused CCs and over-extended herself therefore ruining her credit and in my mid 20s I let a family member use my name in order to do shady real estate deals (circa Housing market crash) and ended up having foreclosed houses in my name. We didnt know each other at this time but since then we both lived lives in which the credit system just didnt factor into our everyday lives. We both figured if we needed something its best to pay for it cash in hand and if we couldn't afford to do that then that item is not in the budget. Debit to Het (russian?)...

My financial education up until about a year ago was cut and dry. Don't spend more money than you make/Have more money coming in than you have going out. I didnt understand that there were tools out there that a responsible person could utilize to help them better navigate the financial system. It started when I went to buy a car and the dealership ran my credit. I probably hadn't looked at my credit report since 2010 and just assumed that my credit history would show foreclosures and hover at a score around 400ish. To my surprise (and surprise) the credit report came back showing none of those things but instead of me getting a neutral interest rate, I got an interest rate of someone with bad credit (18%). I thought it was the dealership trying to screw me over so I went to others and they all came back with similar #s. This is going to be my first car ever that I pay a note on as before, my way of thinking was always pay for it upfront. I started a new career and I promised myself that my treat would be to get a car I actually valued (my previous was on its last leg) and would last a decade. So I bit the bullet and bought a car at 18,000 with $4000 down at an interest rate of 18% for 7yrs. Nothing makes me sick more than paying interest so to beat that I paid the car off in full in about month 8. 

I was relaying this story to a friend of mine and she conveyed to me how she uses credit. I was financial literate at this point but mostly in terms of the investing side of the ledger. I was still a cash on hand guy for the most part. She was like she got a car for around 2% interest and if her money plays right the excess cash someone like me would shell out to beat the interest, she could invest that money and it grow larger than her interest rate. Short end of it she sends me down the journey of credit rewards (with the assumption I'm not spending JUST to reap them) and how CCs can be a positive if used correctly. 

Today I've got an excellent credit score, a small personal loan and a small CC, and I'm ahead of the financial game in many ways. My GF on the other hand, seeing all of this first hand, still doesnt see the value in obtaining a good CC score. She still only uses debit (doesnt trust herself in using credit, which I understand) but more so than her unwillingness to see the value in trying to achieve a good credit score she is disavowed of the entire credit/financial system in general. She has about 100k in total assets. I told her just get a small secure card, put her nominal bills on it, pay that card off in full via autopay and she could get a good credit score passively. I'm trying to convey to her the value and long term importance of at least having a good credit score but she's adamant in her stance (the last conversation we had on this topic she said she definitely sees the value in having a good Business credit report but personal credit is a pit trap). In a nutshell her financial goal is to have enough money to live/travel/work as much/little as she wants whenever she wants. 

Has anyone else been in a similar position (on either side) and how did the situation work it self out?What other ways can I best instill in her the advantages of garnering a good credit score given her position? Is she right that she can achieve the life she wants with a cash in hand philosophy given relatively above avg means?",finance

personalfinance,Pay off debt - 401k loan?,"I know this is a taboo thought; however, I‚Äôm trying to weigh my options here.

I have two VERY high interest loans out. (I had to take them out due to unexpected house expenses upon closing on my house).

1 loan is for $14,889.54
1 is for $10,674.78.

In total I pay $798 in payments a month for these loans. They are both 24.99% interest rate. I have a GREAT income, this is new due to a new job. My monthly income (after taxes) is about $10,000 give or take. I have lots of expenses right now including my mortgage, 2 cars, credit cards, utilities, and other loans. Anyway, I‚Äôm wondering if it would be more beneficial for me to take out a $26,000 401k loan to pay these loans to 0 and get rid of them versus just hunkering down and paying money towards them? I am struggling with the thought of paying these high interest loans versus, taking out a 401k loan, paying them off then paying myself back via the loan?

I want to hear thoughts? I‚Äôm drowning right now. Also: if you did take out a 401k loan, what would you suggest for payback timeline? 12 months? (1,112 payment semi monthly) or 24 months (smaller payment).

Now I know the payment being 1,112 semi monthly is much higher than the $798 I pay now, but it‚Äôs going back to my 401k.",finance

personalfinance,Losing hundreds of $$$ because our solar company has been extremely slow to fix our solar inverter. Is there anything I can do?,"We got solar on our house a couple years ago and it's been spotty - it has gone out every 3-5 months and needs to be reset. We often don't notice it right away though so have gone weeks where we're paying the solar loan off as well as for regular power. 

The company who installed it has been extremely slow to fix it. They did finally get it replaced (after several rounds of just resetting it), but the new one didn't work at all. So now it's been at least two months. 

I called just now and the guy said they are short staffed and have a lot of customers with this problem (them blamed the lack of staff on the unemployment payments - which was annoying but I won't get into here). 

Is there anything I can do? Since they installed it they're doing the work for free, so that's nice but I'm losing hundreds while waiting for them. 

I've tried asking for them to somehow reimburse me for the expense but that hasn't gotten anywhere. At this point I'm not a paying customer to them anymore, so they don't seem to have a huge incentive to make me happy.

Edit: Also I've given them the benefit of the doubt for just about everything so far. I'm sure they didn't intend for any of this to happen and they're in a shitty situation too. But I do want to know what my options are.",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loan or save for a down payment on a house?,"After paying off some debts, I have around $600/month at my disposal. I could use this money to either:

* Pay off my $18,000 student loan. It's a federal loan, so right now I don't have to pay and it has 0% interest rate (it was usually 5%). However who knows how long that will last and who knows if the current admin will forgive it

* Save up for a down payment on a house. 

Both these goals could be achievable in about 2-3 years, but not concurrently. I would have to choose one or the other and I am not sure which is more financially sound. 

I've always heard that it's a good idea to pay off debts aggressively, but I also don't want to miss out on the housing market once I'm ready to buy a house (in like 2-3 years).

personalfinance,2021 W4 Questions. Withholding Seems Too Low. Calculator says I owe.,"Hi Personal Finance!

To preface this, I am a cybersecurity engineer and have very little knowledge of the tax system or how it really works. I tried my best to research and search Google for answers but I am at a loss and it doesn't help that it's hard for me to grasp an understanding of terminology or the system, or what numbers to plug in. I am, however, very good at budgeting (I enjoy what I can control I guess, lol) and making sure I dont overspend and all the bills gets paid. Downside is because of my limitations on knowing the system, I'm not sure i'm being smart with my money overall. /end personal rant about my own shortcomings.

I started a new job in a new state (VA -&gt; CO) in November of 2020. For 2020 taxes. I ended up getting a refund for fed taxes. 
My 2021 paychecks have a lower Fed Withholding amount than what I would have *perceived* it to be. 
***

*My Income: 122,491*

*Paid bi-weekly*

*Tax Status: Married Filing Jointly*

*HSA contribution: $6025*

*Medical/Dental/Vision: $121.93 per paycheck*

*Wife income: 38,227*

*Quitting job end of September*

*Total income after last paycheck ~~ 10484*

*Pension: 5% (income dependent on hours worked for the month)*

My paycheck has the following columns:


Total Earnings | Fed Taxable Gross | OASDI Gross | MEDI Gross | Net Pay
---|---|----|----|----
4711.20 | 4214.50 | 4355.84 | 4355.84 | 3313.49

My usual Federal withholding each paycheck is $387.77. 

The Income Tax Withholding Assistant for Employers [here](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/income-tax-withholding-assistant-for-employers) asks me to enter ""Employee's Taxable Wage"", which I read as the **Fed Taxable Gross** number says that the amount to withhold for federal taxes is $388.

However, when I've researched this on Reddit/PF, I found the irs.gov tax withholding calculator. I entered all my info (income 122k, HSA amount, 401k amount) and at the end it says that I'm going to owe $1600ish dollars. I've never owed fed taxes before, I always usually get a refund. So I'm going stir crazy thinking this new W4 is making me underpay in taxes. If I plug in **Fed Taxable Gross** (so around 110k + 401k + HSA) income into the Tax Withholding Calculator, I end up with a small surplus. 

I'm going crazy trying to find this information, or if I need to add $$ to line 4c on my W4 but nothing I find is giving me the most accurate answer. 

Is $387 enough? 

Do I need to add money to line 4c? 

What income column number am I supposed to use on the calculator?

personalfinance,"Paycheck is taking the wrong amount for federal taxes, medicare, and social","**TLDR: I believe my taxes are being taken out of my paycheck at the incorrect rate.**

\*Commenters have corrected some of my assumptions which coincidentally have worked until now. I'll take a look at my work again, and correct as possible\*

\*\*I've corrected several of my calculations based off comments\*\* It seems the new guidelines calc fed taxes differently, and the 0.01-0.03 cents off for medicare and SS could be accounted for if calc-ed annually.

Background:

I've had a google sheet for estimating my paychecks depending on the hours I've worked. I have a ""salary"", but I'm technically paid an hourly rate (based on 40hr week) + Overtime (which appears on the paycheck as a bonus.) The point of my spread sheet is to predict my paychecks based off hours worked.

**Since receiving a raise in July, my paychecks have not matched my calculated spread sheet.** I believe the culprit is exclusively fed tax withholding, medicare, and Social security. 

Please check my work, and let me know if I'm misunderstanding how these taxes should be calculated. Before now, they worked every time to the penny. What's different?

My spread sheet is based off calculations from [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/n1036.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/n1036.pdf)

personalfinance,Which credit cards should I get in medical school?,"My wife and I are both in our mid-20s with limited credit history (joint car loan will be paid off in a couple of months, a few store credit cards, and hefty federal student loans). I am a third year medical student. We have been meaning to get some good lines established, but between our parents (who are all pretty avidly against credit, mainly due to fear of credit card debt which they have experienced), my regular credit checks for loans, and a lack of immediate need, we haven't gotten around to it. My next credit check is in Summer 2022, and aside from that and these cards we have until March 2023 (at the absolute earliest) to bounce our credit back to ""good"".

I don't have any impending expenses in mind for these cards, looking mostly for the cashback and strengthening our credit histories. We're somewhat frugal and I'm trying to avoid annual fees because I don't know that I'd make up the cost with benefits. We are responsible with credit, have a relatively fixed budget, and I have no fear of accumulating debt here. Our top expenditures are groceries (mostly at Walmart, which nullifies pretty much any grocery bonus) and Amazon (which is also generally not considered in most cashback bonuses). We both have current FICO scores of 775-780 (Experian).

We are looking for multiple cards for multiple purposes right now. Is it feasible to apply to two at once, wait a few months, and then apply to one or two more, or do I need to apply one at a time? Is there a certain amount of time/score bounceback we should look for before applying to another? I'd like to get them ASA(reasonably)P.

My thoughts for cards (please help) are:

\- A good all-around cashback card. I have my eye on Wells Fargo Active Cash, with no annual fee and 2% unlimited cashback. The other one I have seen is the Citi Double Cash Card, which has an effective 2% cashback with your balance paid in full each month, but Wells Fargo seems the more obvious choice even with a slightly higher APR. Am I missing anything here, or any better cards?

\- A card with good rotating bonuses. I have looked at Discover It CashBack Credit Card, no annual fee, 1% unlimited cashback on all purchases, and 5% cashback (on up to $1500/quarter) on rotating quarterly categories. One of their quarters (October through December) includes Amazon, which would be mighty handy for Christmas shopping. I am open to suggestions.

\- A Costco Anywhere Visa card. I am looking at a Costco membership anyways, and I understand that Costco cardholders get access to great car rental rates. The card has 3% cashback on restaurants and travel purchases, no annual fee.

\- A card for miles/travel/flights. I don't know why, but I am having a hard time understanding the benefits for miles and points, so I really don't know where to start here. I'm in kind of a weird situation here - normally, my fourth year of medical school (next year) would be filled with potentially cross-country interviews and auditions, but everything is still online right now and may be that way by the time I get there. I have absolutely no flexibility in life right now and I don't want to get something that puts all of my rewards into points or benefits that will expire. If I get the Costco Anywhere Visa I'll end up with 3% cashback on travel purchases anyways, so I'm not sure if I should just stick with that.

Afterthoughts:

\- Capital One Walmart Rewards Card. This offers 5% cashback on Walmart Pickup, 1% cashback everywhere else, and for the first 12 months, 5% cashback in stores. We are shopping at Walmart more than anywhere else for the next year and a half, and possibly more than we ever will. I'm on the fence with this one among the others that we want.

\- An Amazon card. I'm still mooching off of my in-laws Prime, so I don't think it would be worth getting this one.

Help, advice, suggestions, would be appreciated.",finance

2. Is it worth asking other lenders for rates?
3. Anything else I should be thinking about?

* **Is the process usually faster with an existing lender?** We want to buy/sell quickly (ideally within the next month and a half)
* **Does staying with the same lender can reap benefits in a hot market where contingent sales are less favorable?** We don't have enough cash reserves to buy without selling, so we're relying on the sale.
* We're moving cities and need to move in the next month or two.

inflation,How can we build a crypto-inflation-dashboard? Support needed!,"As an economist, I went into cryptocurrencies because of their fascinating technical properties and their transparent monetary mechanics - which another currency has a truly limited supply?.

Contrary, fiat money is due to its nature the sole reason for boom and bust cycles.

Since inflation is man-made it's a hindrance to becoming financially independent within this currency system.

The trillions printed by the fed will further increase the currently 5.4% (The increase was driven by a 2.3% increase in energy commodities, a 2.4% increase in gasoline prices, and a 1.7% increase in new car prices), Europe faces a 10-year high and Germany has its highest inflation since 28 years with 4%.

While some countries haven¬¥t disclosed their inflation rate for a few years, most likely because governments fear public unrest.

Not being able to really discern as an individual what's really happening around them, could become a real driver of cryptocurrency adoption.

We need a decentralized inflation dashboard for two reasons

1. a dashboard that sources its data from various independent inputs, instead of centralized institutions.
2. a dashboard that is censorship-resistant and can¬¥t be switched off by regulators who don¬¥t like being challenged on their sole power of inflation data interpetation.

Former CTO of Coinbase and GP of a16z Balaji Srinivasan announced recently at the smart contract summit a collaboration with Chainlink on funding the development of a [decentralized and censorship-resistant inflation dashboard](https://1729.com/inflation) that will provide a cryptographically signed source of truth of global inflation. The winners will get a $100k investment from Balaji and a $100k grant from the [Chainlink Grant Program](https://chain.link/community/grants).

This is a deep tech level challenge and we¬¥re building right now a community to work on all different mechanics and questions of this solution.

We are working on different data crawling solutions, have a concept on how to use oracles that provide data to smart contracts, consider different tokenomics approaches in rewarding data providers, and partner with crypto payment websites to get their price data.

We highly need talented people from this community who want to support this community endeavor from an economics perspective, challenge our datasets and models.

I am confused by taxes (aren't we all...who are not CPAs)....My wife just started a new job and got her first partial check. What confused me is the amount of federal tax that was withheld. 

&amp;#x200B;

Gross income for the pay period was 1211.60 in NYS. The federal withholding for the pay period was 24.62. I checked the ADP site for NYS and keeping everything 0, I got the same withholding amount for federal taxes. When I switch to the pre-2020 W4 version the amount that was calculated was 74.24.

&amp;#x200B;

What kind of dark magic is there that our tax liability is 3x less under the new W4-2020s?

I know I'm not the only one who is fed up of the Ethereum gas fees and therefore looking to move to Solana where the grass is greener, but I need some help. I'm looking to bridge ERC-20 tokens held in a Metamask wallet to a Phantom wallet on Solana, to then convert to SOL on some kind of (preferably decentralised) exchange. However, I've not quite worked this out - or at least found a neat way.

At present, I've tried to use Wormhole to bridge these assets - however, it's a bit weird... Wormhole did not accept ETH but required Ethereum pre-wrapped, which I had to do on a separate Dex. Wormhole worked after this - but now I'm left with a ""Wrapped ETH (Wormhole)"" in my account, which I can't seem to trade anywhere. 

A couple of questions therefore:

1) Is there any exchange that deals with Wormhole Wrapped ETH tokens, and provides liquidity to swap these to SOL? I note that [Saber.so](https://Saber.so) provides some liquidity for tokens bridged through Wormhole, but not WETH.

2) What's the easiest method of trading ERC-20 tokens to SOL (preferably decentralised), and storing these in a Solana wallet?

Bitcoin,Bitcoin from an MTG perspective,"I've seen posts about the correlation between Magic: The Gathering card prices and BTC's price, but this is more about how I see the crypto market through the lens of an OG magic player/speculator and how it drew me to Bitcoin specifically rather than alts.

THE MARKET

The MTG secondary market is split up into various approaches. Some people buy boxes and leave them sealed, hoping to flip them later. Some people look at new sets, try to evaluate the strength of the newest cards before release, and buy them cheap in the hopes they will become widely used, and thus profitable. Others buy the old stuff, as they know original printings are more desirable, due to the pimp factor and nostalgia from old school players. People have made a lot of money on trading cardboard! But it takes a lot of time in the space to know what you are doing; you can get left holding bags.

THE RESERVED LIST

Long ago in the 90s, Wizards of the Coast released Chronicles, a set of reprints from the earliest sets. While kids like me were stoked to get access to older, previously expensive cards, the value of these cards tanked, and a lot of players were pissed, not to mention vendors who had been hoarding the stuff. So Wotc made a promise to never reprint a particular pool of cards, named it the Reserved List, and have held that promise to this day.

However, anything outside of this list is fair game, and in the last few years, previously expensive cards have been crushed by massive printing. I saw the writing on the wall, as did many players, and sold out of the newer formats. It was a timely decision. The only stuff I held was from the oldest sets and from the Reserved List, and many of my cards have 4-5x'd since then.

COMPARISON TO CRYPTO

See where I'm going with this? You have people buying new cheap cards trying to catch a moon, speculating on essentially penny stocks, or in the crypto world, ICOs, shitcoins, meme coins, NFTs, etc...its all about flipping and making gains, because long term most of this stuff will be worthless. It's risky, you have to watch the market 24/7; things can change in a heartbeat. You can get screwed.

Or...you can invest in the Reserved List, which can never be reprinted. Many of these cards have been lost, destroyed, etc...they have become increasingly scarce, and people in the space know they will only go up in value over time. Long term, they have appreciated wildly. I'm sure people are familiar with the legendary Black Lotus, if they haven't heard much else of MTG.

Thats what helped me understand why Bitcoin is the place to be.  There are tons of alts, some have real utility, but the crypto landscape is always changing. alts can and have been replaced many times, once successful ones are dead now...Bitcoin is still here. Sure you can make money trading, but it's a full time job, whereas I can just sit on BTC and my old MTG cards, knowing that in the long run they will only increase in value. People will always be making new alts, their supply is essentially infinite, same as magic cards.

FIAT MONEY

Wotc being able to print to infinity isn't much different from the Fed printing money either. Both are completely centralized, they can devalue your holdings at will. In that sense, BTC as money is fantastic. Maybe im just a nerd but MTG really came to mind as I did research on Bitcoin. It's money that is also a collectible! Love it.

Bitcoin,6 Years still no less volatile? Will it takes 50+ years for this to stabilize? Will it ever stabilize?,"I know we're in the early stages of mass adoption and I'm no expert or mathematician, but over the past 6 years BTC has gained a TON more adoption and still hasn't become any less volatile. Price/market cap have also had basically zero impact on volatility. Look at the stock market, $45+ trillion market cap and the only thing that keeps it from tanking 20% during ""black swan"" events are circuit breakers and the Fed backstopping corporate debt. Without a central gov backing its value, circuit breakers, or some other form of stabilization, how can BTC/crypto ever actually become a stable store of value/currency?

Thoughts?

personalfinance,Taxes question (w4),"Hello,

I started a new job a few months ago and to my surprise I didn't have the option to claim 1 or 0 on my tax forms.

I went with what I thought was best and unfortunately my pay checks have been getting hit hard.  I make $60,000 before taxes and each pay period I'm getting charged about $500 in taxes between federal and state.  I spoke with HR and they advised I use the IRS W4 calculator but even that says it may not be accurate in the middle/late of the year calculating.  Every result I got was me paying an ungodly amount.

If I were to keep $150 from federal and state each month, would I been in for a nasty surprise when taxes come due?  Any information would be greatly appreciated as this is new territory to me.  Thank you.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"The SEC is going after Coinbase now. First it was Ripple and all of us laughed. Now it is Coinbase, Next it could be us.","The SEC is suing Coinbase over its Lend product that pays out interest to asset holders. This is appalling, because it is something that the banks that the SEC protects will never be able to do - give actual returns to user‚Äôs assets, not the 0.05% interest pittance that is dished out to users by banks. 

Somehow, the big brains at SEC, well funded by tax payers, have now come up with legal arguments as to why giving retail end users a decent interest rate is a crime and securities fraud. ü§Ø

The regulators never act in the interest of retail users, mom and pop investors and regular folk. They simply exist to protect the rights of the banking and securities cartel. There never was any investigation into dark pools, naked shorts by hedge funds, trading restrictions and manipulation by the big players. Instead, the SEC even made rules that now prevent retail from buying shares in companies they own. Basically legitimising Robinhood‚Äôs tactics. 

Even right now, there are more GME shares held by institutions than the total shares outstanding. So many counterfeit shares. Over the last week, shares of defunct companies like Blockbuster and Sears have surged 1000%... these are companies that are already bankrupt and in liquidation, but somehow a well regulated SEC monitored market still allows Blockbuster to rise 1500%.

The SEC is utterly incompetent and exists only to harass retail and prevent small time investors from making it big

Coinbase CEO Brain Armstrong put out a message just now :

 ‚ÄúSome really sketchy behavior coming out of the SEC recently.
Story time‚Ä¶Millions of crypto holders have been earning yield on their assets over the last few years. It makes sense, if you want to lend out your funds, you can earn a return. Everyone seems happy.
A bunch of great companies in crypto have been offering versions of this for years. Coinbase came out recently and said we would be launching our own version....

They responded by telling us this lend feature is a security. Ok - seems strange, how can lending be a security? So we ask the SEC to help us understand and share their view. We always make an effort to work proactively with regulators, and keep an open mind.‚Äù

Tl DR: the SEC refused to meet either Coinbase, saying they don‚Äôt meet crypto companies. But prefer regulation by litigation approach. 

These are not the actions of an regulatory agent acting in good faith.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Mortgage refinance and PMI removal questions.,"Hello all! 
The wife and I are currently trying to navigate some issues and are looking for guidance/advice.

First is mortgage refinance questions. We are approaching 4 years in our first home. Our original FHA loan amount was $141,390 at 4% interest. We didn‚Äôt have a lot to put down when we purchased so we had to get Personal Mortgage Insurance which is about $92 per month. 
 Our current principal is at $130,474 and we‚Äôve started to receive notices about the option to remove PMI payments. Usually, I ignore notices about things like refinancing from random banks but our current loan service has also sent us mail about removing PMI by refinancing from FHA loan to a Conventional loan at around a 3% interest rate. My credit score when I bought this house originally was just under 700 and is now over 800 (according to Credit Karma)

Realtor.com and other sites are currently ‚Äúestimating‚Äù our current home sale value at around $209,000. 

 Currently, we are considering refinancing from FHA to Conventional and keeping the same term but we also are talking about upgrading into something a little larger to accommodate our growing family. The current market is tough though since most single family homes of decent size that we have looked at are usually around 250k-300k in our area. (Central Florida..if that matters) and we don‚Äôt have much saved up since we‚Äôve put money into repairs and upgrades in our current home over the last 4 years.  
 Also, I changed jobs 3 months ago and am changing jobs again in a couple weeks. I know that will be looked at during loan approvals. Before that, I had a stable 3 year job and a 6 year job before that. For the last few years, I‚Äôve worked 2 jobs. One at 35k per year full time and second job was 15k per year part time (both hourly). The new job will be 55k per year at 45 hours per week (salary).

A secondary inquiry: 
We‚Äôve recently received a yearly statement from the property appraisal office that says our property value is appraised at $109,000. I‚Äôm not sure what to do with that information. It would seem beneficial to have the house properly appraised but would that increase our property taxes also? 
 Should I wait until we decide to sell this home to get it appraised for proper sale price? Or, is that somehow the ‚Äúproper‚Äù value of the property and I should ignore websites like Zillow and the currently market inflation?

Extra info in case it helps: current property is a middle unit townhome of a 3 unit block and it is homesteaded. 

Thanks for any help in guiding us in a good direction.",finance

personalfinance,Is there any real reason to not seek down payment assistance?,"Local down payment assistance program is 5% DPA in the form of a 3 year silent loan that is forgiven after 3 years as long as you don't move or refinance before that 3 year mark. It's a form of govt or industrial subsidy, not a bank program. The primary mortgage will have a 5% interest rate but it can be conventional. There are other programs that offer better terms for people with lower incomes, but my current income is near the top of the eligibility criteria and might exceed that criteria in a few years.

I qualify for 2.8% conventional loan rates right now. And I have enough to cover 20% down payment on a house up to 300k, but I'm looking more at 250k houses. 

This is how I calculated the possible scenarios out, trying to understand the apples to apples comparison.

Scenario 1: 20% down with my cash, no DPA. 250000 house means 200000 mortgage at 2.8%. Total interest is 95844 with payoff in Sept 2051.

Scenario 2: Same as Scenario 1 except if I paid like it's 5% then total interest is 62803 with payoff by Feb 2042.

Scenario 3: 25% down with my cash plus DPA. 250000 house means 187500 mortgage at 5%. Total interest is 174855 with payoff in Sept 2051

Scenario 4: Same as Scenario 3 except I refinance after 3 years. Three year interest before refinance will be 27505. Refinancing 178769 at 2.8% and paying like it's still 5% means 52348 interest on the refinance, for total interest of 79853. payoff by Nov 2043

Scenario 5: 20% down with my cash plus DPA, 250000 house means 200000 mortgage at 5%. Total interest is 186512. Invest my 12500 in market at 6% return and after 30 years it is worth 71794. Interest minus final value of investment is 114718 net cost. Payoff Sept 2051

Scenario 6: Same as Scenario 5 except I refinance after 3 years. Three year interest before refinance will be 29338. Refinancing 190687 at 2.8% and paying like it's still 5% means 55848 interest on the refinance, for total interest of 85186, payoff by Nov 2040. The invested cash by Nov 2043 will be worth 45484. Interest minus final value of investment is 39702.

I'm trying to understand if I did my math right. If that's the case then I should be talking to a lender that can get me the DPA. The only real risk is if interest rates go up 3 years from now, but I don't think there's going to be permanent inflation that keeps interest rates up once the pandemic supply shocks are smoothed out over the next year or two.",finance

CryptoCurrency,El Salvador means nothing and means everything.,"El Salvador's GDP is $27 Billion with a -7% annual growth. It's the 107th largest economies in the world.

In global finances terms El Salvador means nothing.

However, El Salvador is one of many countries that uses the United States Dollar as it's currency or pegs their currency to USD.

It makes a lot of sense - USD is extremely stable historically. Most Central and South American countries major trade partners are the US or other USD using/pegged countries within Central and South America.

However as a result all of these countries are held hostage by a central bank from another country.

El Salvador making little impact on a global scale is the best reason for them adopt BTC and make it one of their national currencies.

It creates a proof-of-concept of a small country gaining autonomy from the whims of the US FED without causing the US to march in and ""change regimes"". 

This won't be easy for them and I guarantee the US will try and make it even worse, but if they pull it off then they are free of a USD empire. If not lessons learned for anothet economy to try it next.

Either way US Dollar is still an official currency. El Salvador may have over-reached in some areas forcing Bitcoin adoption, but in the end people will decide what works best for them. If you think BTC is a better currency than USD then El Salvador leaders are just agreeing with you.",cryptocurrency

7. Cardano‚Äôs closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it‚Äôs EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We‚Äôll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano‚Äôs deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

solana,Warning. Services offering unsustainably high interest rates are securities,"Hello Sol frens, brothers and sisters.

Please completely avoid any services offering unsustainably high interest rates. Remember this is how debacles like the 2008 crash and Icesave happened. The higher the APY they offer you the more unsustainable and risky it is.

Lending, bonds, high interest offerings are all securities In just about every country in the world. The US SEC has sent a warning letter to Coinbase about their offering and is threatening to sue them if they do not get a license and register any securities such as USDC. All stable coins have the features of MMFs and therefore are securities.

This will not impact you in long term. It just requires that exchanges and defi operators acquire the correct licenses which they can easily afford to do. Any party who created a premined token or offered a pre-sale will also have to register their product as a security, which they can afford to do too. 

Then we don‚Äôt have anon rug pills and exit scams. If a company raises money to create a video game they are then obliged to produce and release it.",cryptocurrency
solar,"Would it be worthwhile to buy this system upfront, on a new home build.","I am about to sign the paperwork for a new home build. The builder has a company, sunnova, install solar panels before the closing on it, and the I have to decide how I want to pay for it. They also don't give me any say in the size of the system.

The house I am buying would have 10 panels, rated for 340w each, 3.4kwh total.

The lease option (called lease plus) would be around $50-60 per month, I have been given the exact amount yet. With the option to buy at anytime, and the cost to buy reduces each year.

I can also buy it if I have the cash to cover it at closing. It would be $10880 to do that.

If I follow the math correctly.. The system would produce 17kwh during a 5 hour day or 510kwh per month and 6205kwh per year. The overall cost would be $6.40 per wh, without any tax breaks, $4.73 after the 26% federal tax deal.

510kwh costs around $60 from my power company and in my current home, we average around 500 kwh in the winter to as high as 1000kwh in the summer (AC  going constantly). So I expect that the current size of the system will never take on 100% of our usage.

Based on the $60/m savings and tax rebate, I figured it would be just over 11 years before the system breaks even. 

I don't see any advantages to going with the lease option, since there is 0 savings, it just make my power bill go to 2 companies. Also, from my understanding, if I don't buy it at close, I don't get the tax rebate if I buy it out later.

So all that rambling, I am hoping for some input on.. Is my math right on this? Is the cost of this system high/low/average? Has anyone worked with sunnova and do they ever add more panels to and existing system if you lease from them?

Long term, I would like a system large enough that would handle my daily usage with enough overhead to also change a battery system of some sort (like a tesla powerwall) so I can get to a point with minimal reliance on the power company.",energy

Chainlink,Lets build a crypto-inflation-dashboard with Chainlink as Oracle for price data,"On Chainlinks Smart Contract Summit did former CTO of Coinbase and GP of a16z Balaji Srinivasan announce that he and Chainlink will fund the development of a [decentralized and censorship-resistant inflation dashboard](https://1729.com/inflation) that will provide a cryptographically-signed source of truth of global inflation. The winners will get a $100k investment from Balaji and a $100k grant from the [Chainlink Grant Program](https://chain.link/community/grants).

There is plenty of reason to build such a dashboard: the trillions printed by the fed are causing inflation of 5.4%, the 0% interest rates by the ECB cause a 10-year high and Germany has its highest inflation since 28 years with 4%. But some don¬¥t disclose the inflation data at all - most likely because governments fear public unrest.

Not being able to discern as an individual what's happening around them, could become a real driver of cryptocurrency adoption and this is why we need a decentralized inflation dashboard.

This is a deeptech level challenge and we¬¥re building right now a community to work on all different mechanics and questions of this solution.

We are working on different data crawling solutions, have a concept on how to use oracles that provide data to smart contracts, consider different tokenomics approaches in rewarding data providers, and partner with crypto payment websites to get their price data.

Do you want to make this happen?

We need talented people from this community who want to support this community mission from an economics perspective, challenge our datasets and models - and build this until the 5th of November. We also have set up governance to reward the work.

My SO pensions contributions, the monthly equity on our rental mortgage and refinancing account for our monthly saving. Is it wrong of me to assume?

For the private loans, we have two:

1. $46,000 at 3.895%
2. $37,000 at 3.24%

My thinking is just to blast away the private loans with Amazon stock. Originally my wife and I were saving for a house, but the market is completely screwed for now and we decided to keep renting. So I figure we were saving Amazon stock for that, we could just remove the student loans and rebuild a down payment fund over the next few months.

There are 7 different federal loans totaling around $30,000 with an average interest rate of around 4%.  
The research we have done has told us that the main reason people consolidate their loans is to make them more manageable and make it less likely for you to default on them.   


However the payment website we use has an automatic debt payment option you can set up. Why would you consolidate if you can set up automatic payment? The largest individual federal loan has a lower interest rate than the average interest rate (unless they use weighted averages).

I hope no one is in disillusion that the markets /crypto and stocks/ are rigged.  The federal reserve and the banks have inflated all beyond belief and while they are secretly trading and speculating, while they act as ""supervisors"".

And all will go to hell at one point and they need a scapegoat. As they did with the Internet and the 2000 bubble. They knew back than that the technology will prevail even with a crash and they pushed forward with it - lending money and letting people put in absolute crap stock that were 100 % sure to crash, because they were worth nothing ... /shiba inu comes in mind with crypto and many others/. And when they crashed it, what did they say - It is your fault, you went into unregulated territory and lost your money. Tough luck BUT IT IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

And to me, crypto is the same as the tech bubble ...

They are lending and giving free money and most people gamble on crypto ....

Now, if they crash the crypto market, they can easily blame the incoming stocks crash on crypto and say - WE HAVE TO REGULATE IT, BECAUSE IT IS A PHENOMENAL TECHNOLOGY.

Same as 2000, just with a new name

During all this, they will get the loot in the end, blame it all on us and try to force regulations, because .... you know .... IT WAS OUR FAULT AND WE NEED TO BE BABYSIT !!!!

Stocks fell today, extending the previous day‚Äôs decline in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) as market participants continue to digest the recent August Job Report and concerns surrounding rising coronavirus infections across the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) 0.33% down while the SPY and DIA fell 0.11% and 0.2% respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 1.10%.

Yung-Yu Ma. Chief Investment Strategist at BMO Capital said, ‚ÄúWe think the fundamental drivers of strong earnings, an accommodative Fed, and a still healthy appetite for risk taking are really what‚Äôs going to support the market for the rest of the year.‚Äù 

The Labor Department released their monthly unemployment report, which showed hiring in August slow down dramatically as the US continues to battle massive spikes in coronavirus Delta cases in certain parts of the country, mainly the South/Southeast (according to the CDC, roughly ‚Öì of all COVID-related hospitalizations are in Texas and Florida as both states deal with record coronavirus cases and low hospital capacity). Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous month‚Äôs numbers. Here are the numbers.

* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July
* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July
* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July 
* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July

President Biden said of the report, ‚ÄúWhile I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what we‚Äôve seen this year is continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.‚Äù

Members of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially closely at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the ‚Äúsubstantial further progress mark‚Äù the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, ‚ÄúI think that one more good job report if it‚Äôs in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.‚Äù August was not the report they were looking for. 

In its latest Beige Book, which is basically a report by the Federal Reserve on current economic conditions, members said the economy downshifted slightly due to Delta variant concerns. The report stated, ‚ÄúThe deceleration in economic activity was largely attributable to a pullback in dining out, travel, and tourism in most Districts, reflecting safety concerns due to the rise of the Delta variant, and, in many cases, international travel restrictions.‚Äù 

In the US, the surge in infections in certain parts of the nation continues unabated, with hospitalizations this weekend roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people travelled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention‚Äôs recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling.

In other news, the battle between Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos is heating up! Last week, SpaceX sent a filing to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accusing Amazon of using regulatory and legal means to stifle and slowdown competition. SpaceX said, ‚ÄúWhile SpaceX has proceeded to deploy more than 1,700 satellites, Amazon has yet to even attempt to address the radiofrequency interference and orbital debris issues that must be resolved before Amazon can deploy its constellation‚Äù and suggested ‚Äúas it falls behind competitors \[Amazon\] is more than willing to use regulatory and legal processes to create obstacles designed to delay those competitors from leaving Amazon even further behind‚Äù (ouch).

In response, Amazon said, Whether it is launching satellites with unlicensed antennas, launching rockets without approval, building an unapproved launch tower, or re-opening a factory in violation of a shelter-in-place order, the conduct of SpaceX and other Musk-led companies makes their view plain: rules are for other people, and those who insist upon or even simply request compliance are deserving of derision and ad hominem attacks. If the FCC regulated hypocrisy, SpaceX would keep the commission very busy.‚Äù SpaceX won this one IMO, that was a nasty burn. 

**Highlights**

* Job openings in July as measured by JOLTS soared by a staggering 749,000 ‚Äî hitting yet another all-time high just shy of 11 million open jobs, enough to eliminate most of the current slack in the labor market.
* El Salvador became the first country in the world to roll out a digital currency as a form of legal tender, allowing businesses and customers to transact using blockchain. There are some initial teething problems with the launch of the Chivo, the country‚Äôs wallet app and locals being unfamiliar with the technology. Digital currencies also fell, though I don‚Äôt know unknown if the drop is correlated to the launch in El Salvador
* Damn, the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) market is red-hot right now. Following Sqaure‚Äôs (SQ) acquisition of Afterpay for $29 billion and Amazon (AMZN) partnering up with Affirm (AFRM) to offer BNPL on Amazon, PayPal (PYPL) is now stepping into the arena by acquiring Japanese BNPL firm Paidy for $2.7 billion
* Twitter (TWTR) launched a global test of a tool it calls Communities, a feature similar to Facebook Groups that gives users a way to tweet to people with similar interests. This follows the recent launch of Super Follows, where content creators can charge their followers for their content. 
* Applied Materials (AMAT) announced it was releasing two new tools aimed at improving efficiency of making a new class of chips for electric vehicles. The machines announced on Wednesday are designed for chips made from a material called silicon carbide. Such chips are gaining traction in electric vehicles like those made by Tesla Inc because they are more efficient and lighter in weight than standard silicon chips for transmitting power from a car's battery to its motors, helping improve range. Silicon carbide chips are difficult to manufacture because the material is very hard

CryptoCurrency,"What are the major, long-term risks to the established cryptos?","In the earlier days, the common advice was ""don't invest more than you are willing to lose."" This was good advice, because we all thought that the price of a crypto could go to $0 at any moment. But, now that crypto is more established, what are the major long-term risks? Is it safe to put a significant portion of our net worth into crypto, instead of traditional stocks/bonds/savings? What could cause something like BTC or ETH's price to drop by 95+%? I want to hear all of your opinions on this, here's what I've though of. If these risks are really unlikely, then maybe we can invest more than we're willing to lose in the major cryptos...

1. **Technology improvements**. What if some major vulnerability is found in the cryptographic algorithms that secure all cryptocurrencies? I've heard that quantum computing could crack our underlying security.
2. **Decreasing adoption**. We all think that crypto is an amazing innovation that will change the world. But, there have been plenty of great ideas that didn't take off because of the inertia behind the status quo (e.g. [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto), and [Dvorak keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout)). We still don't even use the metric system in the US! Will the vast majority of the world continue to use their government's currencies due to inertia and convenience?
3. **Government interference**. As a decentralized system, cryptocurrencies are very difficult for a government to ban unless they have full control over the internet. But, governments may interfere enough to prevent mass adoption. China has (successfully?) banned bitcoin mining. What if major governments banned crypto on/offramps, like coinbase or kraken? If we had to meet sketchy people on the street to exchange crypto/fiat, or use VPNs or the dark web, only the very dedicated would continue to use crypto. This could kill adoption enough that the price falls significantly.
4. **Replacement by a better crypto**. Bitcoin is the major crypto right now, but it's definitely not the best from a technology standpoint, it's just the first. What if people get fed up with their transactions being tracked, and they all migrate to Monero? Will Ethereum be replaced by Cardano or a similar smart-contract chain before they can lower their gas fees? Will Ethereum replace Bitcoin at the top?",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Parliament passes law to legalize cryptocurrency in Ukraine,"[article](https://www.kyivpost.com/technology/parliament-passes-law-to-legalize-cryptocurrency-in-ukraine.html)

Parliament passed a law on Sept. 8 that makes cryptocurrency and other virtual assets like tokens, legal in Ukraine. Although virtual assets will be legitimized in Ukraine, they cannot be used as a means of payment or be exchanged for goods or services.

Cryptocurrency is hugely popular among Ukrainians ‚Äî the daily turnover of virtual assets in the country accounts for $37,000, according to Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine‚Äôs Minister of Digital Transformation. If cryptocurrency becomes legal and therefore safer, more Ukrainians will invest in it, Fedorov said.
‚ÄúOnly a few countries in the world have legalized crypto assets ‚Äî Germany, Luxembourg, Singapore. Ukraine will be one of them,‚Äù he added.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,How much to allocate in mutual funds vs. savings,"Looking for some advice here! I have ~$33k tied up in a Fidelity account:

* $15k in a total market index fund
* $5k in a total int'l index fund
* $4k in a U.S. bond index fund
* $6k in an S&amp;P Small-Cap 600 fund
* $3k in individual stocks 

I'm aware that this investment mix is very stock-heavy, but for what it's worth, I'm not really planning on touching this money until I retire - this account is intended to supplement my 401k).

Here's where I could use some advice... I also have ~$92k in a Marcus savings account. When I first started saving money in this account, the annual interest rate was between 1.5% and 2.0%, but now it's dipped down to a meager 0.5%. The purpose of this savings account, FYI, is to pay for random large but infrequent expenditures - e.g., my annual lump-sum property taxes, down payments on vehicles, occasional vacations, etc. My wife and I use a checking account with a different bank for day-to-day expenditures.  I can't help but imagine I am leaving money on the table by not investing a portion of this in my Fidelity accounts, so I'm thinking of moving some money over this week to start earning more interest on it.

CryptoCurrency,Unpopular Opinion: making bearish comments that can be backed up is better than promoting bullish nonsense,"The last few days have been interesting for our crypto market to say the least. The last few months even more so. However, I've noticed an ironic trend come about in our comments and the daily recently that is quite amusing but also has me fairly worried: bullish comments get *up*votes and bearish statements get *down*votes. 

Don't get me wrong, I too love my fair share of hopium, and have laughed at the pack dog mentality that comes from a project's faithful investors mauling anyone who anti-shills what they have put their money into. But I do notice a ton of comments with people talking out their ass specifically for moons. To be honest, sometimes I wonder if this reddit page is going to be its own biggest enemy in the end for the greater picture of adoption. A lot of that worry comes from the fact that anyone new that comes here to learn gets fed false shills with no factual backing - and when a crash happens they lose trust in this space because of the people who know nothing in it. Maybe we do it all for the moons? But I prefer to think we'd be better off speaking as factually as possible in the hope of educating one another to higher heights. Call me crazy, but I think that will actually end up being more beneficial for all in the end.

Who knows, maybe you all think I am talking out my ass too. Just my 2 cents.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Is a cash-out refi worth it if I'm only staying 2-3 more years?,"So I'm looking to do some home improvements and am considering a cash-out refi and taking out $25k.  I'm trying to determine if this makes sense financially or if a HELOC would be better.   Either way I have no concern about paying off the amount so I'm really looking for what'll save me the most money.  The main benefit to the refi is it'd knock down my interest rate by a full 2%.

My current situation:
Remaining mortgage = $175K, 30 years fixed, 4.6% 

Cash-out refi:
New mortgage = $218K (cash-out + cash to close), 20 years fixed, 2.6%

Haven't gotten a reappraisal yet but my house value should be around $240K now (up from $195K purchase price 3 years ago).

personalfinance,Student Loans and Investing,"Hey guys so I‚Äôm taking out federal loans to pay for grad school.
I have two loan options:

1) Take out loans each semester of 12,000 for three semesters (trimester program) totaling 36,000 for the year.

2) Take out loans for the spring and summer semester of 18,000 each. 

I have enough to pay for the first semester and living expenses for the whole year but I was thinking of Option 1 to invest and save up while the loans are being deferred until the end of January. Tuition costs 18,000 each semester so if I go with Option 1 I‚Äôll have 6,000 leftover during the second semester that will have interest accruing. What do you guys think?

- $7,729 @ 5.05 %
- $7,729 @ 4.53

CryptoCurrency,Coinbase should not give in against the SEC. It is a private company. The SEC is going too far with their bias towards banks.,"If you didn't know yet, the SEC wants to sue Coinbase for offering people a 4% interest rate on their stablecoins. This is should not be the SEC's business whether or not Coinbase offers more interest rate than the banks since they are a private company.

This is just another way for the SEC to save the banks from competition. Banks currently offer terrible interest rates compared to Crypto. This is just basic capitalism. If you can't offer decent interest rates compared to your competitors, you deserve to lose out on customers. Yet they are trying to save their ass by directly attacking Coinbase.

The average bank interest rate for interest checking accounts in the United States is **0.03%.** Coinbase plans to offer their customers 4%. The banks know that Coinbase is giving them a run for their money. Them trying to sue Coinbase is pure stupid. In my opinion, as a private company, Coinbase holds the right to offer their customers whatever interest rate they want.

The feds should not oppress a private company from their rights to provide their customers financial service. They are going after Coinbase since they know they can't do shit against Cryptocurrencies that offer high interest rates directly. Coinbase should definitely fight this in the court. The SEC has no business trying to sue a private company for offering tough competition.

TLDR: Coinbase is a private company and holds the right to offer whatever interest they want. The SEC is being total bullshit and just wants to save the banks from the competition from Crypto.

EDIT:  Apparently, Coinbase is no longer a private company unfortunately. However my point is  still there. The SEC doesn't have any business attacking a company that is just offering financial service superior to their competitors  (Banks). It's publicly traded, but still a private company as it is not owned by the government.",cryptocurrency

House, baby, car, investments, etc.","Hi everybody, I am looking for some advice on how to move forward in my current situation. Thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to read or offer any insight or advice. 

I have gone through the wiki a bunch of times, and honestly it's a lot to take in. I have been working towards the prime directive for a while now. My wife and are I are considering consulting with a financial advisor, but I figured I would check with you guys first. After all, it was this sub that got me to where I am today. Am I on the right track? What can I change? How can I do better?

My situation is this:
I am 34 years old, my wife is 32. We both have decent jobs. We currently rent a home. In the near future we are planning on having our first child, building a home, and buying a new vehicle. 

‚Ä¢ Combined gross income = $190-$250k  (significant increase from last year. $190k is base. $250k max with bonuses and overtime. 3% increase in salary every year for both if us.)
‚Ä¢ total monthly expenses = $5k + or -
(Currently trying to narrow down our budget)
‚Ä¢ Primary HYSA total = $180k + or - 
(saving between $600-$1400 a week total)
‚Ä¢ emergency fund = $32k (+$25-$100 a week)
‚Ä¢ Future 529 plan = $5k (+$60 a week)
‚Ä¢ Combined roth 401k amount= $50k + or -
 (we both started late in the game and only 1 company matches unfortunately. we both contribute 7% for a total of 14%)
‚Ä¢ Secondary savings total= $28k (in separate Roth IRAs with $24k total in contributions to be used for house if necessary. $12k total annual contributions.)
‚Ä¢ robinhood investments = $8k 
 (Moving half to brokerage, mostly short term)
‚Ä¢ new brokerage account = $1.3k 
 (planned annual 1.3k contributions.) 
‚Ä¢ student loans = $20k 
(included in expenses. Paying extra monthly)
‚Ä¢ credit card debt = usually around $1-$3k total

Both of our vehicles are paid off and owned. One of them still has some value and is in decent shape. It should definitely last a few more years. The other one is falling apart. It has no real value and we plan on running it into the ground, which will be soon. unless its wise to use as a trade in? We plan to spend $30-$35k on a new vehicle. 

We finally feel financialy stable enough to start a family, although we would really like to have more progress on our home build first, atleast have the land bought. We are also a little concerned about potentially losing a large chunk of income when the baby comes. We have not figured out childcare, or if and when my wife will return to work in this circumstance. Our goals are achievable on my salary alone, but it is not preferred. 

Some family friends of ours are going to sell us some land. It should be subdivided and appraised by early next year. They offered to sell it to us for 1/2 or 3/4 the value. They estimate the cost to us will be around $75-$125k. Pre covid ball park put us at around $350-$450k for our build, not including the price of the land. Now adays that's closer to $550-$650k.

Those three prime factors effect each other, as far as spending our savings, different financing options, and what we will be able to save in the future. 

1. Am I on the right track? What should I change? How can I do better? Should we be allocating more or less money in different places?

2. I know the vehicle is probably the first order of business, but is it worth paying off the rest of our student loans first? If I remember correctly the interest rate is around 3-4%. Maybe do this instead of a down payment?

3. I drive alot for work. Would it be smarter to put miles on the newer vehicle? Or to keep the ware and tare on the older one? I figure driving the newer vehicle would make the other last longer, but would depreciate quicker.

3. We have three things to purchase. The land, the construction loan, and the vehicle. Where should we put our cash vs financing?

4. A friend of ours recommended buying the land outright. we could then use the additional value of the land as collateral towards the down payment on the construction loan. This way we would potentially hold on to more of our cash. Is this a viable/reasonable option? Any other reason to buy it cash? Or should we just roll the loan for the land into the construction loan?

5. Should we wait to build? Are goal is to aquire the land as soon as possible. Thats not a problem. But With the way the market has been going, we have been considering holding off contruction for a few years to see if anything changes. Any logic in this?

6. Should my wife and I change retirement investment strategies? Both my wife and I originally chose to put our retirement into roth 401ks and roth IRAs. Would there be any benefit to switching to traditional? 

7. Any other thoughts or ideas? Anything I missed?

CryptoCurrency,Top Finance Platforms on BSC This Year,"Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a dual-chain architecture that allows users to build and develop their own digital assets and decentralized apps on one blockchain. The platform also empowers users to take advantage of the growing trade to exchange from one blockchain to the other. Since its launch, BSC has enjoyed significant growth in activity and volumes.  

Here are some of the top finance platforms in terms of functions on the BSC:  

1.  Venus: Venus is a decentralized money market and synthetic stablecoin protocol that uses an algorithm and launched exclusively on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The protocol allows users to earn from their crypto assets through lending and also enables borrowers to access a liquidity pool where they can take crypto credit. 
2. 1Inch Exchange: 1inch Exchange is an aggregator of decentralized exchanges that allow users to access liquidity from various exchanges and optimizes trade strategies using smart contract technology. The protocol allows users to swap tokens and place limit orders for various tokens. The platform allows crypto asset holders to sell, buy, and swap their tokens across multiple platforms. The platform also allows users to access and trade multiple cryptocurrencies.  
3. Pledger: Unlike most available lending protocols, Pledge won‚Äôt be focused on crypto traders borrowing digital assets in real-time for day trading. Instead, Pledge answers the need for longer-term financing, mainly serving crypto-asset holders to diversify their portfolio with non-crypto assets, e.g. real estate, without the friction of portfolio rebalancing. By reducing the exposure to interest rate volatility for borrowers/lenders, Pledge resolves the missing, core component in the existing DeFi world thus creates a decentralized lending market that will accelerate the adoption of DeFi apps in people‚Äôs daily financial activities. This yet-to-launch platform is one of the most anticipated one on BSC.  
4. Swipe: Swipe is a company offering several crypto-related services including cryptocurrency debit cards, a multi-currency wallet, issuance of custom cryptocurrency debit card, cryptocurrency savings, cryptocurrency borrowing, and cryptocurrency payment solutions for merchants. While it is relatively new in the crypto space, the multi-asset cryptocurrency ecosystem has reported unrivalled growth in the crypto space. The company managed to secure partnerships with leading players in the digital currency industry like Binance and Coinbase within the first few months of its launch. Binance is currently using Swipe to power its credit cryptocurrency card payment.  
5. Linear Finance: Linear Finance is a new platform in the DeFi space that seeks to bring more people into the crypto space by increasing inclusiveness and easy access to investment opportunities.  The company offers a cheap, quick, and transparent synthetic asset exchange platform that allows users to save fees and secure assets at a fair market price.  
6. Belt Finance: Belt Finance is an AMM protocol built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and which has in-built multi-strategy yield optimizing capabilities.  Investors use the protocol to access low fees and aggregation through lending, vault compounding, and yield generation for maximum returns. Belt Finance allows users to instantly and directly swap between stable assets and automatically earn from stable assets by yield farming with an optimized strategy while also getting BELT tokens. All these processes are undertaken through BSC smart contracts without any centralized processing.

CryptoCurrency,What are the DeFi Systematic Risks?,"# General Conclusion

Risk is one of the most prominent issues in traditional financial markets. In particular, risk helps investors to quantify a specific number representing an asset value, in order to assess whether that level of risk is acceptable.

In DeFi, however, risk is often undervalued as the majority of participants do not fully appreciate it. Several lending/borrowing protocols are at the forefront of this field when it comes to assessing the risk of an asset. In other protocols we rarely see full consideration of risk.

In this article, we will introduce the concept of systematic risk (generalised) from traditional markets to DeFi.

# What Is Systematic Risk?

Assuming you invest in a single asset, what is the source of risk for this ""portfolio""?

We can say that there are two common sources of uncertainty:

1. Risks arise from overall economic conditions, such as business cycles, inflation, interest rates and exchange rates. These economic factors are difficult to predict with certainty and all affect the return on assets.
2. Risk comes from the asset itself (specificity). For example, is the government controlling the asset or is their direct demand for it, etc. These factors affect one asset but do not affect other assets.

Now we look at the ""portfolio"" of even more assets (a diversification strategy), asking the same question, what about portfolio risk?

Diversifying multiple asset classes spreads the risk of the entire portfolio. The ability to decrease the value of one asset provides the ability to increase the value of another asset. These effects will offset and stabilise the return on the entire portfolio and portfolio volatility will continue to decrease.

However, even if we hold a certain amount of assets (e.g. &gt;1000 assets), we still cannot avoid risk completely, because almost all assets are affected by factors such as general macro factors. For example, if all assets held are affected by the business cycle, then we cannot avoid business cycle risk no matter how many assets we hold.

&gt;This risk that persists even after diversification is called market risk, which is associated with sources of market-wide risk. Such risk is also known as systematic risk, or non-diversifiable risk.

*Note: Risk that can be eliminated by diversification is called unique risk, nonsystematic risk, or diversifiable risk.*

 

**TLDR**:

In conclusion, risk analysis of DeFi protocols is a very complex process as the areas of risk exposure are very different and often interfere with each other. For example, a protocol that allows more freedom in governance will attract investors who want to make the most out of being able to cast their votes on a wide variety of factors, but it will also be subject to more volatility in changes and be undesirable to another group of investors who want to hold the tokens for stability in asset value. Thus, we have to be clear of our purpose first, and then make the relevant analysis and comparison across protocols.",cryptocurrency

1. Risks arise from overall economic conditions, such as business cycles, inflation, interest rates and exchange rates. These economic factors are difficult to predict with certainty and all affect the return on assets.
2. Risk comes from the asset itself (specificity). For example, is the government controlling the asset or is their direct demand for it, etc. These factors affect one asset but do not affect other assets.

Now we look at the ""portfolio"" of even more assets (a diversification strategy), asking the same question, what about portfolio risk?

Diversifying multiple asset classes spreads the risk of the entire portfolio. The ability to decrease the value of one asset provides the ability to increase the value of another asset. These effects will offset and stabilise the return on the entire portfolio and portfolio volatility will continue to decrease.

However, even if we hold a certain amount of assets (e.g. &gt;1000 assets), we still cannot avoid risk completely, because almost all assets are affected by factors such as general macro factors. For example, if all assets held are affected by the business cycle, then we cannot avoid business cycle risk no matter how many assets we hold.

&gt;This risk that persists even after diversification is called market risk, which is associated with sources of market-wide risk. Such risk is also known as systematic risk, or non-diversifiable risk.

*Note: Risk that can be eliminated by diversification is called unique risk, nonsystematic risk, or diversifiable risk.*

 

**TLDR**:

In conclusion, risk analysis of DeFi protocols is a very complex process as the areas of risk exposure are very different and often interfere with each other. For example, a protocol that allows more freedom in governance will attract investors who want to make the most out of being able to cast their votes on a wide variety of factors, but it will also be subject to more volatility in changes and be undesirable to another group of investors who want to hold the tokens for stability in asset value. Thus, we have to be clear of our purpose first, and then make the relevant analysis and comparison across protocols.",cryptocurrency
CryptoMarkets,What are the DeFi Systematic Risks?,"# General Conclusion

Risk is one of the most prominent issues in traditional financial markets. In particular, risk helps investors to quantify a specific number representing an asset value, in order to assess whether that level of risk is acceptable.

In DeFi, however, risk is often undervalued as the majority of participants do not fully appreciate it. Several lending/borrowing protocols are at the forefront of this field when it comes to assessing the risk of an asset. In other protocols we rarely see full consideration of risk.

In this article, we will introduce the concept of systematic risk (generalised) from traditional markets to DeFi.

personalfinance,House: love it or list it?,"If your basement has a little water when it rains &amp; ankle foot water in some spots occasionally when it rains a lot would you spend $20k to fix it when the house is only worth 100k? Or would you take $20k to make minor changes so that you could sell &amp; move??? The basement is currently not being used for anything in particular now and even if it was waterproofed it might not be used for much. Mostly just worried about structure overtime and mold. 

Keep in mind that it is easy to sell right now but hard to buy. I originally bought house for 90k with 20k down 6 years ago which was the max my bank allowed me. I am making slightly more now but still at same job (just got minor raises). With the boom right now houses in my area are going for 100k-120k (it‚Äôs iowa). Would like to upgrade to something $130-220k but not sure what i would be able to get from the bank. I owe 60k on my house right now. In the last 6 years i got a new water heater an furnace but no other updates. My interest is around 6% fixed. I believe interest now is 1-3%. 

I would much prefer to paint the exterior and interior, put a new deck on, do some landscaping, do minor updates in the bath and kitchen, refinish the wood floors, redo the driveway, replace a couple windows. Also new roof might be needed in the next few years. The basement is last on my list but first on my husband‚Äôs list.

Edit: I have cement floor and not sure what kind of walls  but i have received 2 estimates and both were 20k. They want to put drains all around the inside perimeter and install sub floor over top with sunk pump. I was told that a basement with headspace was an after thought when they made foundation so there is a ledge going around the bottom of the wall and the floor was dug a little deeper so the water comes in at that joint.",finance
personalfinance,"Car is officially dead, need advice on buying a replacement asap","Recent med school grad with a f\*ck ton of student and credit card debt. I make around 60,000k a year (yay resident salary),  approx. 4000/month, and am not making payments on my student loans yet (thank you covid). I recently moved to a different state for residency and was ""gifted"" a used car from one of my parents. Which was amazing for one month, but now the car is dead. I've already spent 2k on repairs, only to have it breakdown again and it's been in the shop for almost a month being worked up. They threw a diagnosis at me (which at this point seems like a hail mary) which will cost another 2-3k to fix. It's a 2011 VW GTI with close to 150,000 miles on it. At this point, I don't think shelling out the cash to fix it is a smart decision nor do I feel that a second opinion will be worth the time/effort/money

I need a car to get to work. I need a reliable car that won't require repairs every month (i simply don't have time or mental capacity to deal with the stress). Trade in value for car at the dealership is like $500 lol I need a car by the end of the week so not much time to shop around. Used cars seem to be going at rates similar to new... Obviously, I'm in no place to buy a new car but the price difference seems almost minuscule. Does anyone have any tips on leasing vs. buying? Should I just suck it up and buy a beater and drive it to the ground until I can save up some money? If a used car is within a certain $ of a new, do I just go with new? Any tips on getting a decent interest rate? ugh. ranting post (coming off of a 20-hour shift) but any help or advice would be appreciated.",finance
cardano,"Cardano Rumor Rundown September 9, 2021","Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. Coinbase reveals they received a Wells Notice from the SEC on their crypto loan product. This is relevant for Cardano loan projects. A low professor subsequently posted a takedown of the Coinbase Chief Legal Officer‚Äôs view on the SEC notice. [https://twitter.com/brian\_armstrong/status/1435439291715358721](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1435439291715358721) [https://twitter.com/AdamLevitin/status/1435650584271589376](https://twitter.com/AdamLevitin/status/1435650584271589376)
2. We just saw a record number of daily transactions on Cardano (Sept 7)!  [https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1435559731133825031](https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1435559731133825031)
3. Messari has updated its ‚ÄúInitial Token Distribution‚Äù chart to include a previously missing project and Cardano is still among the very best in the Gen 3 space in terms of broad public coin ownership. [https://twitter.com/CryptoIRELAND1/status/1435708439951552513](https://twitter.com/CryptoIRELAND1/status/1435708439951552513)
4. After lots of criticism of Cardano layer 2 possibilities by ETH maximalists, Vitalik has announced that ETH NFTs need to be moved to layer 2.  [https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1435413681588736007](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1435413681588736007)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Cardano has been listed by Bitpoint in Japan! [https://www.bitpoint.co.jp/news/info/info-2021080301/](https://www.bitpoint.co.jp/news/info/info-2021080301/)
2. Senators Wyden and Toomey are trying to fix the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill! [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/crypto-rules-in-infrastructure-bill-eyed-for-bipartisan-rewrite](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/crypto-rules-in-infrastructure-bill-eyed-for-bipartisan-rewrite)
3. SEC Chair Gensler gave another speech strongly signaling that a lot of stablecoins, lending platforms, synthetics platforms, and other DeFi projects are probably non-compliant in the eyes of the SEC. I would heed this warning very carefully if I were one of those projects. [https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tusQLLCgrDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tusQLLCgrDs)

5. We‚Äôre now up to 5 different states that are getting after BlockFi for their crypto lending activities. Reportedly, this includes New Jersey, Vermont, Alabama, Kentucky, &amp; Texas. Probably relevant for those building lending solutions on Cardano.

6. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy ‚Äúsome things‚Äù minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
7. Cardano‚Äôs closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it‚Äôs EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We‚Äôll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano‚Äôs deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

8. Senators Toomey, Wyden, &amp; Lummis took to the Senate Floor to plead for a vote on their amendment which would fix the overly broad crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423381402905726983](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423381402905726983) [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423413806634577922](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423413806634577922)
9. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements. This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry! Please call your Senators and ask them to support the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis Amendment!

13. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. Both revisions were good for Cardano since they included proof-of-stake implicitly and then explicitly. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424040216961114112](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424040216961114112) [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424074177770921992](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424074177770921992)

19. Very action packed day today (Aug 9). The Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema came together and proposed a compromise amendment to the crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. They were not able to include any section for exclusion of developers from the ‚Äúbroker‚Äù definition but did cover the previous progress on transaction validators and wallet sellers.

gaming,"I sold a complete copy of Pokemon moon to a Mother with kids, for half the retail price.","Today I got a new 3DS that came with a bunch of games that I already had, including a full copy of Pokemon moon. So I decided to put it on local FB marketplace. 30 minutes later someone offered to buy it, looked her up and she has two 14 year old boys and a loving family. After making sure that she was legit, I let her know that she can pick it up in the morning. Hopefully they will enjoy it as much as I do, and I can stash the extra 30 towards a PS5, win win. When I think about it, with the stupid prices out there you can't really share good games with good people, with that kind of crap they will never get to know or experience these epic journeys I had growing up. And people are so fed up being in lockdown too that people are rebelling against each other and not looking after one another, If I were a kid with little money I would be so pissed right now. Hopefully her kids will be able to wind down and enjoy life a bit more. And you guys do what you do best in supporting each other, in your own way. :)",technology
investing,"China said to suspend approval for new online games, heating up Beijing‚Äôs campaign against gaming addiction","**Seems like every other day there is some regulatory news. China stocks are currently value traps with no end in sight. There are reports peppered in between of Chinese authorities assuring investors to not worry, but the regulatory pressure on China equities is alive and scary**

Tencent Holdings Down 8.2%  
NetEase Skids 11%   
Alibaba Down 6%   
Others like BILI, BIDU, JD, etc down big  

Sources said the decision to freeze new video game approvals was revealed at a meeting between Chinese authorities and industry giants Tencent and NetEase
It is unclear how long this suspension of new game approvals will last, the sources said  
  
The Chinese government has temporarily suspended approval for all new online games in the country, dealing a fresh blow to the video gaming businesses of industry giants Tencent Holdings and NetEase, as Beijing steps up measures to tackle gaming addiction among young people, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  
That decision was revealed during a meeting on Wednesday called by Chinese authorities, led by the publicity department of the Chinese Communist Party and gaming watchdog the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA), to discuss with representatives from Tencent and NetEase how they will implement Beijing‚Äôs new restrictions on video gaming for minors, according to a person briefed on the matter, but declined to be named because the information is private.  
The authorities‚Äô move means ‚Äúeverything is on hold‚Äù, the person said.

personalfinance,Recovering from a rental scam; What now?,"As the title suggests, I fell victim to an out-of-state rental scam. I've already reported the incident to local and federal authorities, as well as the banking systems used, but I still haven't been able to recover most of the funds (missing $2500). There's also been no updates on how any investigation may be proceeding. 

My question at this point is what the best way to recover is? Job recommendations, something I might have missed, etc. I returned to my hometown with family to minimize bills, but the area is low-income with most jobs available being ""unskilled."" I've been looking into remote work as well as those sorts of jobs because I obviously need a steady income, but it just isn't feasible financially, emotionally, or mentally to permanently establish myself here (I studied Visual Media; no networking or job opportunities). Also, what's the best way to go about moving out again quickly on a short budget? 

Please no rude comments about the scam because this sort of thing can happen to anyone. I did lots of research before sending the money and things seemed mostly legit until I arrived. Thanks for all the help in advance.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Even the US government is starting to notice the strength of crypto. The SEC-Coinbase controversy is the biggest example.,"The advantages you have with crypto is simply too big for governments to ignore. Especially with more and more people getting to know crypto, they know it will soon be impossible to stop.

With US interest rates being 0.03% average, some cryptocurrencies are offering higher than 10% while some are even giving sub 20%. interest rates. 

This is hundreds of times higher than what you would recieve from a bank. Banks would all go bankrupt only if more people knew about crypto.

The interest rates are so good, that even the SEC is trying to sue crypto exchanges offering more interest. Thankfully they can only go after exchanges.  

Individual cryptocurrencies aren't owned by an exchange or a person and is almost impossible to hack. No SEC can stop or sue currencies that are offering triple the interest rate even Coinbase was planning to give. 

It's only a matter of time. The SEC going after Coinbase is just a sign that even they are scared. Crypto is superior in almost every way compared to banks. People are taking notice.",cryptocurrency
investing,How I made more than 10% annual profit using microloans,"Hi everyone!

I would like to tell you about my experience of investing in P2P lending platforms.

During my studies in the EU, my fellow students introduced me to the investments in P2P lending platforms.

2019 was the year of the lowest interest rates on deposits in the EU- fluctuated around 0.5-1% per annum, and this has been around for more than 2 years.

While all of them were receiving interest rates 20 times higher than in banks.

Everything got to the point that my fellow students, being EU citizens, began to take loans in banks and invest these funds in these microloans.

Sounds crazy, but it works for now.

I decided to try.

Having invested 8K, in 18 months I received 1258 Euros of income, which amounted to about 10.5% per annum.

After moving back to the United States, I discovered new opportunities with Prosper.

It was a terrible experience.

On Mintos, I was not limited in the amount of investment, and most importantly, I did not have any time limits, since the vast majority of loans were microloans for a short period (up to 2 months).

But in Prosper, you could invest for a period starting from 36 months, and the fee could reach up to 2%, in Mintos it is fixed at 0.85%.

In the end, I was refused because I could not show my gross income over 80.000 $ Plus.

Also, there was no secondary market on Prosper where you could quickly and with a premium resell your investment.

Fortunately, I still have a European SEPA bank account in Euros and continue to invest in Mintos.

Of course, the system is not perfect:

1) You can earn more than 12% (the maximum that can be earned on the platform is 30% per annum), but then you get into loans with a rating of C- and below, and defaults can sometimes reach more than 30%.

After all, the risk is all yours!

2) When transferring money to a European bank from the United States, after I left the EU, I had slight difficulties.

My payment was frozen by the bank due to suspected money laundering. I had to submit documents on the origin of money through the Bank of America, and explain why, being in the USA and being a US citizen, I transfer money to a European bank, and for what purposes it will be used. It is good that they did not demand to obtain a license for investment activities.

3) When converting from Dollars to Euros and from Euros to Dollars, you have to lose up to 4%.

From now on, I intend to increase my investment to 20K dollars, I will continue to invest in Mintos, and also try a new platform that uses crypt and promises interest rates two times higher than the European one.  


I will try to write monthly reports.

CryptoCurrency,I'm sitting pretty with my ALGO at the moment.,"I'd love to say that it was because I'm a genius and because of thorough due diligence and an in-depth knowledge of the market, what ALGO does and why it's positioned better than other coins...

But the reality is, I had some of it for free through Coinbase Earn, then liked the fact I was getting ""staking"" rewards for it just sitting there. When I get fed up of holding 95% of my pot in NU about 2 weeks ago (NU has incredibly low volume, so even if it ostensibly has a huge rally and goes +100%, even a crypto-shrimp like me could crash the price down double that by selling about ¬£2,500 worth...) I thought to myself ""I'm going to put whatever I've got away for a while and HODL, so I might as well put it in a coin where I'll accumulate some rewards."" Tezos has a 35 day delay on getting rewards so that was out, and ETH on Coinbase has only just started rolling out in the UK so I'm not able to do that yet.

OK I thought... bung it in ALGO since I already had experience of getting the rewards and the coin hadn't done anything too crazy whilst I held it... moderate growth, no real flash crashes etc.

And now, in the just over two weeks I've held ALGO, I've almost doubled my money.

Which now presents me with the problem of whether I HODL like I planned, or try and guess the peak, sell then buy in again if a dip comes along...

It's the paradox of crypto investment... if nothing's happening or the price is falling a bit it's easier to forget about it and not check charts... so you can diamond-hand it (but you're not making any money), but as soon as something happens and the price spikes the steely determination falls away and the FUD creeps in. ""Am I going to regret not selling at this peak?""... ""Am I going to regret selling at what looks like a peak only to find out the coin goes +5000% afterwards.

How do you deal with that? Any tips?",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,"""The Pharaoh of Bitcoin"" is arrested after scamming his victims for over R$1.2 Billion (around $200M)","Most people have no idea, but Bitcoin and crypto are buzzing in the news here in Brazil. For the good and also for the bad side (unfortunately).

Brazilians are known to love a pyramid (Ponzi) scheme, and in 2014 Glaidson Acacio dos Santos (a former waiter in a beach town in the state of Rio de Janeiro) founded a company GAS Consultoria to invest in cryptocurrency.

The investigation conducted by the Federal Police (Brazilian version to the FBI) discovered that the majority of the funds raised - over 1.2 billion BRL (around 200M USD) - was deposited to his bitcoin account in a big exchange (Binance? Coinbase?).

And, the curious part - his victims recently protested over his arrest claiming that GAS was not a scam or Ponzi.

personalfinance,Take a loan out on a car even if you have the cash to buy it to mitigate risk?,"After leasing a couple cars in the past and being required to have GAP insurance (if you owe more on the car than it‚Äôs worth, the GAP insurance will pay the difference) it got me thinking about whether or not this would be a good idea to get on all cars.

My thinking is that if I pay cash for the car, I am tying up the cash and due to the fact that the insurance company will most likely not give you what you paid for the car (even if it‚Äôs a used car and the depreciation curve is pretty flat) if it got totaled a week later that I could possibly lose any and all cash that I used as a down payment.

So, it seems to me that it would be safer to finance as much as the bank will allow on the car (especially since interest rates are so low) and simply purchase GAP insurance, which is less than $10 a month.

If my thinking is reasonable, it seems like it would be best (I‚Äôll be it a hassle) to refinance a car every time you pay the loan off and cash out the equity.

We are buying this house (hopefully) with  the understanding that we will want to do considerable work on it in the next several years.  This is the house we plan to live in.  We have money in savings and investments but perhaps not enough to complete all the work we anticipate.  What sort of loan products exist to finance the work? Does it make more sense to separately finance the work? Wrap it into a mortgage somehow?  Use a large part of our savings? 

Potential complicating factor: we are at least considering holding on to our current home to use as a rental property. We've made good progress on our current loan and have a considerable amount of equity in this property.  We will probably refinance this property for a better interest rate and to lower the payment if we decide to hold on to it for as a rental.  Should/could we use take out additional money on our current home to finance the improvements to our potential home?

personalfinance,What should I do with my cash?,"Hi I'm 27 and my question is: What is the best thing to do with the lump sum of cash I have considering my situation?

I currently make about 75K before taxes. I contribute 10% of my check towards 401K and my employer matches 5%, have been maxing out ROTH IRA for the last two years (mainly due to having lump sum of cash), and also invest 10% into my company stocks on a monthly basis.

My retirement/personal investing accounts total to about \~$80,000, and I have about $50,000 in cash. (Will say that I also have the ability to sell my companys stock for about $12K with profit, even after taxes).

I currently have a positive monthly cash flow of about $700-900 a month.

My debts:

Student loan: $15,000 with the highest interest being around 4.2%

Car debt: I just recently bought a car and took out a loan for about \~$24,000 (Paid 5K down). Interest rate is 1.9%.

&amp;#x200B;

An important factor I should include in here is that I am in the market for buying a house. Where I live, an ideal house would cost me about $400-450K currently. The purchase of my car has set me back a a bit as both my cash flow and down payments have decreased, and at the same time by Debt to Income Ratio increasing.

Now that I have laid out the background information, I would like to get your opinion on what the best thing to do with my cash is.

I believe these are my options:

1. Pay off my student debt and get rid of the 4.2% interest, as well as free up some cash flow. My worry with putting the cash into the market is that I am a little worried as the markets are at a all time high. By paying off my this debt, I'm guaranteed a 4.2% return and do not have to worry.
2. Put it into S&amp;P500. My current returns average at around 20% in the last two years. This makes my 4.2% debt look like a joke.
3. Hold onto my cash, keep making payments towards my student debt, contribute monthly payment to S&amp;P 500, and continue to save for a down payment.

CryptoCurrency,Why I think CRO will be a good hold,"If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with the token, Crypto.com Coin, from this point onwards called CRO, is an exchange token for the Crypto.com app, exchange and DeFi wallet. Crypto.com is a CeFi company just like Nexo, BlockFi and Celsius. These are companies you can stake crypto at and essentially lend them out to lenders for a pretty ridiculous APY if you‚Äôre used to interest rates from Banks.  

Why am I bullish on CRO? There‚Äôs a handful of reasons why I think Crypto.com will thrive as a centralised institute and I‚Äôll discuss a few below here. 

Since a few months ago, they started advertising like mad. When I say mad, I actually mean MAD advertising. I think you all have already seen it pass by watching your favourite sports. They started with formula 1 in late June with a $100m sponsorship. If you popped on the TV during a race there‚Äôs beyond no doubt you‚Äôve seen it pass by. Second down the line in July: $175m sponsorship with the UFC. Then college football and Liga 1 got announced, and yesterday an announcement for upcoming Friday exclaiming ‚ÄúThis Friday Football &amp; Crypto will come together like never before üëÄ‚Äù. Knowing them by now, they will actually deliver. These guys aren‚Äôt the Safemoon Devs. This amount of advertising is actually unheard of within crypto and I don‚Äôt think they will stop anytime soon. They are the fastest growing exchange for a reason. 

The following is copied directly from Crypto.com‚Äôs blog about Cronos, as it explains it better than I can. Cronos Mainnet will launch October 19th and is another reason to be bullish on CRO.

Cronos is the EVM chain running in parallel to the Crypto.org Chain. It aims to massively scale the DeFi ecosystem, by providing developers with the ability to instantly port DApps from Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains, with funding from Particle B‚Äôs $100m EVM fund and access to the 10M+ user base of the Crypto.com ecosystem.

Furthermore there‚Äôs the classic saying of ‚Äúnot your keys, not your coins‚Äù and while a big part of me agrees with this statement, Crypto.com is insured up to $360m for destruction, damage or theft. The only thing to be wary of is that there is (to my knowledge) no way to verify this statement as it is only published on their own blog. 

Crypto.com has possibly the best staking rates for any CeFi institute out there, though the higher rates come at a cost which for me personally isn‚Äôt a downside.  Bitcoin and Ethereum can be staked for up to 8.5% and Stablecoins can hit 14%. These numbers require a stake in CRO. Without a stake the former and latter are at 4.5% and 10% APY. From a $4000 CRO stake they‚Äôre 6.5% and 12% respectively and above $40000 the aforementioned rates. Do note these numbers are for 3 month period stakes. Lower APYs are available for a 1 month period or a flexible stake.

Their Visa Debit Cards are lovely. I‚Äôve owned mine for roughly 4 months now and already racked up about 450$ worth of cashback on everyday purchases and rebates. There‚Äôs a few available card tiers and they come with their own cashback rates. The one best suited for most of you all would be the 4000$ one in my opinion, though if you can afford the 40k one. It is definitely something to consider. They come with 10% and 12% staking APYs and give 3% and 5% cashback respectively. They both give free Spotify premium and Netflix rebates up to a certain amount. Rose Gold and Icy White also get Amazon Prime rebates. They give free access to the airport lounge and the latter cards let you bring a guest too. Though I have to admit that I have yet to try this feature. 

The final reason I‚Äôm bullish on CRO is that they don‚Äôt fuck around. In May their servers crashed because of SHIB launching on their app (which reminds me of the fact that CDC has a wide variety of coins available). They promised a better user experience and after two days ago happened I can say they delivered. While big exchanges like Coinbase were down. CDC kept up and running like a champ. 

As my final words I‚Äôll say that the only thing holding this beast back from currently growing 100s of percents is the unavailability of its exchange app in the USA. If this roadblock gets passed I personally think that there simply is no limit in the amount of growth they will receive, possibly reaching a market cap as high as or higher than BNB.",cryptocurrency

* $16,000 current car I'm about to sell due to constant maintenance costs.
* $1,709 invested in crypto/stocks

personalfinance,Life Insurance (Whole vs. Term),"I know this subreddit recommends against whole life insurance because it is typically more cost effective to purchase term life insurance and then separately invest the money you save (from not paying the high whole life premiums) to make a better return.  So for example, lets say I have a whole life annual premium that is $4,000 vs. a term life (30yr) annual premium that is $580 - PF would recommend that I pay for the term life insurance, and then invest the $3,420 (cost difference) a year in index funds.

With this example, if I save $3,420/year continuously for 30 years, and assume an interest rate of 7%, I'll have $323,055.89 by the end.  This is a good chunk of change, but typically after 30 years you will have already paid off whole life insurance entirely -- and the death benefit would probably exceed this amount.  You can also purchase riders to grow your death benefit as the account grows in value - and you basically don't have to worry about making premium payments anymore.  

All this being said, I have a few questions:

1.  Is my math (roughly) checking out here?  I can see why reddit advises against whole life, but I can also see why it's appealing because you don't have to worry about payments at all, and the death benefit is gauranteed.  I just want to make sure I'm understanding everything before I decide on which life insurance I go with.
2. If I go with term life insurance + investing the extra savings into an index fund, is there anything special I need to do to ensure that the money goes to my dependents/spouse if I were to die?  Like, do I need to set up a trust, or can I just invest in a brokerage account as I normally do (and just mentally reserve that money for my own 'manual life insurance'.  I'm mostly curious about the logistics of this.

stocks,Psycho Market Recap - Thur Sept 9,"**Summary**

Stocks opened higher in the morning before turning lower as market participants continue to balance a hot jobs market against a dent in economic momentum caused by surging coronavirus Delta variant cases in the US. The three major indexes are having one of the worst-performing streaks this year, while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fared slightly better.

According to a report released yesterday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of job openings in August was 10.9 million, higher than estimates of 9.9 million and the 10.18 million last month. The rate of job openings measured against the total labor force swelled to 6.9% in July, up from 6.5% the previous month and 4.6% a year ago. From an industry standpoint, the rate jumped to 10.7% from 10.2% in the critical leisure and hospitality field, which has suffered the most during the Covid-19 pandemic. Openings rose to 1.82 million, a total gain of 134,000 last month. There are enough job openings to cover the roughly 8.4 million unemployed Americans.¬†

Coinciding with an increase in job openings, in its latest Beige Book, which is basically a report by the Federal Reserve on current economic conditions, members said the economy downshifted slightly due to Delta variant concerns. The report stated, ‚ÄúThe deceleration in economic activity was largely attributable to a pullback in dining out, travel, and tourism in most Districts, reflecting safety concerns due to the rise of the Delta variant, and, in many cases, international travel restrictions.‚Äù¬†

Members of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially closely at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the ‚Äúsubstantial further progress mark‚Äù the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, ‚ÄúI think that one more good job report if it‚Äôs in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.‚Äù August was not the report they were looking for.¬†

Unfortunately, a summer that began with plunging coronavirus cases nationwide and real hope that the worst of the pandemic was behind us as the effective vaccination drive began is instead drawing to a close with the US firmly in throes of the pandemic once again, due to the highly contagious Delta variant.¬†

This weekend, hospitalizations were roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people traveled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention‚Äôs recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling.

* The crackdown in China continues‚Ä¶ This time, regulators of video game companies execs to focus less on profits and implement controls to prevent video game addiction. Companies were ‚Äúurged to break from the solitary focus of pursuing profit or attracting players and fans.
* Russian Cybersecurity firm Yandex (YNDX) said it successfully repelled the biggest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in history. This comes just after American company Cloudflare (NET) repelled the previously largest DDoS attack on Aug 19. The Yandex attack was 22 million requests per second, while Cloudflare‚Äôs was 17.2 million requests per second. Cybersecurity is becoming ever more important as attacks become more complex and powerful.

personalfinance,Buy a car or pay off student loans?,"We just did a cash out refi. My husband has about 26k in student loans. Only 9k is private, and we are definitely paying those off. We're considering leaving the federal ones alone (approximately 17k) and instead using that amount to get a car, since we only have 1 and it's a 2007, so realistically we know it won't last a whole lot longer. My thought is it's ""better"" to have student loan debt than car debt. Thoughts?

personalfinance,Opinions on downsizing to one car,"Looking for some perspective on downsizing to one car.  My partner and I have 2 vehicles, first one (Jeep Patriot with 39k miles) has $6000 left on the loan, second car has $11,275 left on the loan (3.5% interest rate). Carvana is offering me $16,500 for the Jeep and I am thinking about taking the offer and using the $10,500 left over to pay off the second car. This would free up about $750+ monthly. Does this sound like a smart financial move? With car payments, our monthly bills average $3,300 and our monthly take home pay is $5,300. This would take our residual funds after bills but before necessities like subsistence from$2,000 to $2,700.

We have no debt aside from our 2 cars and mortgage which is $1,600 monthly. Another reason I have been looking to downsize is because only after I bought my Jeep did I hear horror stories about how difficult and costly Jeep‚Äôs are to maintain. I am afraid to be burdened with costly mechanical issues in the future. Thus far I have been fortunate to not have experienced any issues and I am looking to ‚Äúget out while I‚Äôm ahead.‚Äù Additionally, I am interested in cashing out on this hot used vehicle market while I can. 2 years ago I was looking to sell at a $2,000 loss and it‚Äôs so attractive to be able to sell now at a $10k profit.

I am currently not working as I am taking a gap year to study for the GRE and my partner is in school full time and is completely remote. We don‚Äôt have any kids and we‚Äôve been pretty much using just the second car for 2 months to test out the one car thing and we‚Äôve only needed car #2 on a single occasion.

I now have all 5 wallets set up, seeds written down and secured, with 2 backups of each. I also too the time to write out each receiving address, so if I choose to I could delete the wallet and still be able to send coins to the blockchain. This wasn't an overly long process, but had to be done carefully to make sure it was all proper and legible.


I am using Algorand wallet for my 5 year, and will DCA $50/month, as well as putting a few extra dumps in here and there. Goal for this wallet is a house, or at least a hefty down payment.


For my emergency funds, I am using Shakepay (Canada only, I believe). It's very user friendly and has the added benefit of some extra free bitcoin. It has an extremely fast etransfer speed, which I'm hoping won't be necessary when they roll out visas. I will be putting any leftover cash when payday hits in here.


For my hodl retirement walled, I've gone with Exodus. It has a lot of  projects and is very easy to use. I will be trying for around $50 every 2 weeks, more if possible.


Finally I've decided to go with coinloan for my day to day usage. So far I haven't played around with it much, but from what I can see so far, it offers an amazing opportunity for low interest rates and practical use.

solar,Shopping for 1st solar system / unpleasant surprise,"We live in California, land of many power outages and plenty of sun.  I have engaged several solar firms in discussions of purchasing a system and was thiiiiis close to pulling the trigger.

Oh, they continue to do their photovoltaic job, but the electricity is not piped to power your house or keep your battery charged.  When the grid goes down in California, you have power for as long as your battery charge lasts, that's it.  The battery will not be charged by the arrays until the grid comes back up.

personalfinance,Tax filing help for nanny paid under the table.,"Hello!

My partner is a nanny and has been working with their current family for the entirety of the 2020 tax year. They did not receive a W2 for 2020 and has been mostly been receiving paychecks in the form of checks. Long story short, we paid the estimated tax amount for both state and federal, and filed for an extension back in May. I asked my partner to have their employers talk to their financial advisors on how to proceed, because neither party has paid taxes for this. My partner is now set up on a payroll service, but we still have not had anything to account for 2020. We've tried asking for a W2, but their employer's financial liaison has indicated we wouldn't get one and wouldn't need one. I'm a little in the dark as I'm really just getting information via my partner, but I'm 95% positive we'll need a W2 as their 2020 take home was in the ballpark of 30k.


Obviously, my partner would like to avoid rocking the boat with their employer, but that seems unavoidable in my opinion. If we don't manage to get a W2 by the extension deadline for filing, what steps do we need to take to make sure we are fulfilling our legal obligations? Some steps I saw listed in another thread regarding another nanny suggested the following:


* File Form SS-8 so that you can begin the determination process.


* Review Form 8919 Uncollected Social Security and Medicare Tax on Wages.



* Tally up the amount of income that you received from the employer and enter it on line 6 of the form as well as line 7 of your Form 1040.


* Use lines 7 through 12 to calculate your share of the Social Security and Medicare tax.  You will then enter this on line 58 of your Form 1040.

CryptoCurrency,How to DeFi: Getting Started 101 for Noobs Like Me,"Earlier today, I was trying to explain how to get started in DeFi from step 1. After writing it all out, I realised I should probably just turn it into a full post, flesh it out a little in the hopes of introducing more people into this space which has basically captured my interest for the last 5ish months. Here you go, enjoy:

**WTF is DeFi**

So, you‚Äôve heard of DeFi and you want to generate returns in the DeFi space. But you have no idea where to even start! Your coins are all sitting in your \[insert exchange name\] account just gathering dust as you ride through the roller coaster that is the crypto world. Full disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor blah blah blah and I am only 5 months into DeFi (which considering the age of DeFi, is actually quite long), but I don‚Äôt purport to know everything there is to know, nor can I guarantee I can answer your questions if you have any (but I will certainly try).

Since DeFi is a fast-moving space, whatever I will try to make this as applicable to as many chains as possible so this info is applicable to whichever chain becomes in favour in the future. For reference as to how fast things move, when I started DeFi in April (which feels like an eternity ago), Binance Smart Chain was the shit man. Then in May to June, Polygon was cool. Then that came and went, and Solana came in late July and in early Sept, we‚Äôre now seeing the rise in Fantom and Avalanche. All that in just 5 months.

**""It's dangerous to go alone! Take this.""**

Like most things, you‚Äôll need some things set-up before getting to work.

To start, you'll need:

* A way to on-ramp (this means turning fiat into crypto): This is usually a Centralised Exchange (Binance, FTX, Coinbase, Gemini, CDC whatever is good for whichever country you‚Äôre in).
* A wallet. A wallet is basically something that allows you to manage your coins/tokens. Every wallet supports different chains and there isn‚Äôt a single one that supports all of them. As such, if you are gonna be on multiple chains, you‚Äôll likely end up with more than one wallet. For example, Solana is not compatible with Ethereum-based wallets, so they have their own set of wallets.
   * **Metamask** ([https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/)) is the official and only Metamask site. I use it with Brave Browser, but as far as I know, Chrome and Firefox work great with it too. By default, Metamask is built for Ethereum, but it can be made to accommodate Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Fantom and Avalanche as well amongst others. To figure out how to set up these chains, just search ‚ÄúHow to add \[chain name\] to metamask?‚Äù and you should get a pretty good tutorial.
   * **Phantom** ([https://phantom.app/](https://phantom.app/)) is the official site for the Phantom wallet and in my opinion, is the best Solana wallet now.

Once you‚Äôve got both up, you‚Äôre ready to get started!

All chains require a specific token to pay for gas, which can be thought of as a transaction fee for your transactions on-chain. Without this token, you **WILL NOT be able to make a single transaction**. This also means if you end up depositing all of your gas token into a project, you will not be able to withdraw from that contract LOL. It sounds dumb but it happened to me once kek I call it #forcedHODL.

The gas tokens for some popular chains are as follows:

* Ethereum: ETH
* Binance Smart Chain: BNB
* Polygon: MATIC
* Solana: SOL

Usually, the easiest way to get onto the chain is to send the gas token straight to the chain on your wallet. So, if I wanted to onboard to Binance Smart Chain, I would send BNB straight so I wouldn't have to send say, ETH and BNB, which would cost more in transaction fees. If you are sending over tokens from your exchange to your wallet, do make sure you‚Äôre sending on the right network. If you use the wrong network, you **WILL lose your tokens**, and no one can get it back for you. Same for wrong address.

Do also note that generally, gas fees will depend on each chain and the relative congestion on each chain. You‚Äôll be able to toggle the gas fees used to speed up your transaction (or slow it down if you‚Äôre really not in a rush). The more transactions taking place at any time, the higher the gas required to make it a fast transaction.

Once your wallet is up with an appropriate gas token, you can start looking at the various things DeFi has to offer.

**How to Interact with A Protocol: Where Do I Put It In?**  **( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)**

Now with your wallet on the appropriate chain and with the appropriate gas token, you can head over to the project you wish to ape into!

In this example, I‚Äôm using Uniswap. Upon entering the app, this is what you‚Äôll see. You‚Äôll need to connect your wallet to the protocol, and this is usually in the top right corner of the page (although this can vary obviously). Your wallet will ask you for permission and you just click yes! For most protocols, the ‚ÄòConnect Wallet‚Äô button will change display your wallet address once your wallet is successfully connected.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b46hmtv0qkm71.png?width=1869&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3819d4f5eb70acbb90ac3251b0fc9f39c37580e6

When making transactions, at each transaction, your wallet will prompt you to approve it. And it‚Äôll look like this:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1bq5wtl1qkm71.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=412413f2a935cdb738110d805b3b7768d34d8929

Here, they will allow you to edit the permission (i.e., how much the contract is allowed to spend) and the gas fee. It is good practice to edit the permission to exactly how much you want to deposit since by default this is infinite. The gas fee can be edited as mentioned earlier. Once done, just approve and you‚Äôre good to go.

Don‚Äôt worry if nothing happens for a while. Depending on your chain and the congestion, it may take a while to process. Just check your wallet‚Äôs transaction history to see if the transaction is still pending. Do note that transactions can fail for a variety of reasons.

Most people here are looking at lending and liquidity farming as these are the easiest to get into to earn some return on your assets.

**Lending**

Lending as the name implies, allows you to earn interest on assets you lent out. An example you can look at is Aave ([https://aave.com/](https://aave.com/)). The interest rates vary based on how many people are borrowing at any point in time (sometimes known as utilisation). As a lender, you will look at Supply Rates while borrowers look at Borrow Rates.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3s9cnz05qkm71.png?width=1557&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fcd4a6fc8e87944b6be214878bb6eb8bca1dd784

The good thing about lending protocols is that generally, interest is paid in the token that you‚Äôre lending out. This means that if you lend out BTC, you‚Äôll get your rewards in BTC.

Lending is quite straightforward, so I won‚Äôt go into too much detail in it. Generally, for common tokens like BTC and ETH, the returns on lending are not very high. Stablecoins tend to give much higher lending returns (especially in volatile markets) as people borrow to ape.

**Liquidity Farming**

Liquidity farming is a little bit more complicated. This comes from liquidity pools.

To understand what liquidity pools are, we must first understand Decentralised Exchanges. Decentralised Exchanges are the decentralised versions of Binance, Coinbase etc. on the chain. But because they are decentralised, they need some way to provide the assets for investors to buy and sell tokens. As such, liquidity pools are pools where investors deposit in assets (usually two, and generally in a 1:1 ratio) to facilitate the operations of decentralised exchanges. For example, a pool could be USDC-ETH. So, when an investor comes to this DEX to swap their USDC for ETH, the ETH is withdrawn from the pool and the USDC is deposited.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9z9ruad4qkm71.png?width=1662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac2cb430fdf43c1713cf8f514009229a7d705204

In return for investors depositing their assets into the DEX, the DEX pays out rewards (usually in their native token). Native tokens are tokens that are issued by the project themselves. For Pancakeswap, it‚Äôs CAKE. For Uniswap, it‚Äôs UNI. These rewards usually have to be claimed/harvested for them to show up in your wallet.

Do note that liquidity farming can lead to [impermanent loss](https://medium.com/coinmonks/understanding-impermanent-loss-9ac6795e5baa). This is occurs when the assets you deposit move in different directions or in magnitude. As such, for beginners, I would advise using pools that contain only correlated assets, such as stablecoin pools or to a certain extent, BTC and ETH.

Do also note that since rewards are paid out in native tokens, the actual returns you get may differ from the advertised rates if the token value changes over time. If it drops to zero, then you‚Äôll have no rewards hahahaha. So for low cost chains, some investors will do what is known as farm and dump, where they harvest the tokens everyday or every once in a while to convert to another more stable token, to lock in their returns.

Alternatively, you can also use a yield aggregator. These are projects which help you compound your rewards for you. Some popular ones include Autofarm ([https://autofarm.network/](https://autofarm.network/)) and Beefy ([https://www.beefy.finance/](https://www.beefy.finance/)).

**OMG WHERE DID ALL MY TOKENS GO? SKEM!**

Now, for DeFi, when you're farming/lending, the tokens aren't in your wallet, so it might be hard to how much you actually have. As such, most people use dashboards to see the value of all of their holdings. Do note that if your holdings are in a new or an obscure farm, they might not show up on your dashboard. These are my favourite:

**APEBOARD FINANCE** ([https://apeboard.finance/dashboard](https://apeboard.finance/dashboard)): This dashboard is aesthetic and simple and covers a large variety of chains: BSC, Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Terra and even Ronin! They support a large number of projects across their chains too.

**Debank** ([https://debank.com/](https://debank.com/)): Debank is a close second for me (mainly due to lacking Sol support). They cover quite a number of chains too: BSC, Ethereum, Polygon, xDAI, HECO, OKexchain, Avalanche and Fantom. Debank loads much faster than Apeboard though so if you don't use Solana then Debank is the way to roll (they've said that they're gonna add it in the future anyways!).

Solana Specific:

**Sonar Watch** ([https://sonar.watch/](https://sonar.watch/)): Sonar watch is great for Solana as the dashboard incorporates a graph, plotting net worth and also breaks down where each of your coins are held: yield farming, mining, lending or just in your wallet.

**Step Finance** ([https://step.finance/](https://step.finance/)): Step finance is also pretty good and tends to load faster than Sonar although their selection of projects is less extensive I believe.

Other Tools that I Like Too

**DeFi Llama** ([https://defillama.com/home](https://defillama.com/home)): Good for checking which are the big chains and big projects at the moment. Bigger projects tend to be safer, although not always the case.

**Coingecko (**[**https://www.coingecko.com/en/portfolio**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/portfolio)**)**  **/ Coinmarketcap (**[**https://coinmarketcap.com/**](https://coinmarketcap.com/)**)**: Both are useful to look at coins you're interested in an any of their other stats.

**How to not lose your hard-earned dollahs**

\- If a stranger DMs you, it‚Äôs most probably a scam. No one wants to give you free tokens lmaooo

\- Only click links from official sources (project twitter, official telegram chat etc). I try to stay off discord since a lot of links get spammed there. Best to bookmark sites you use frequently. Watch out for phishing sites on Google search results too!

\- When interacting with smart contracts, edit the spending permissions (by default, it‚Äôs set to infinite, meaning if the contract is hacked, they can drain all of that token).

\- Once you‚Äôre done with a project, revoke the permissions from the contract. You can find these under token approvals on the respective block explorers (polygonscan/bscscan/ethscan/solscan etc).

\- If you‚Äôre using Metamask extension, right click your extension and under ‚ÄòThis can read and change site data‚Äô select only when you click the extension. This prevents the extension from being activated unless you click on it and reload the site. Same for any other wallet.

\- If you‚Äôre dealing with a substantial amount, a hardware wallet might be good to have. Ledger and Trezor tend to be the most recommended ones. If you purchase one, please get from the official store so the seed is not compromised.

\- When choosing projects, try to find audited ones (although many audited projects have been exploited before). Best to stick to high TVL ones and those that have been around for a while. Doxxed devs are generally a good sign as well.

\- Stick to the reputable projects to stay safe. Big is generally better. Use Defi Llama to help you find them.

\- Don‚Äôt connect to sus projects or sites

\- Stop surfing those shady sites LOL malware on your computer is bad for obvious reasons. Best is if you use a completely different device for crypto but of course, not everyone has that luxury.

Oh and one more thing, **DONT EVER TYPE YOUR SEED PHRASE** unless you‚Äôre restoring a wallet (for myself I wrote it down on 3 separate pieces of paper and hid them in safe places hahaaha) Seed phrase being compromised is probably one of the most common ways of losing all your tokens at once.

Hope this made it less daunting to start. Ultimately, the best way to learn is to try it out for yourself. If you‚Äôre not sure, start with a small amount. I‚Äôm pretty sure I spent at least $10-20 on gas when I first started doing silly transactions which were unnecessary hahaha.

personalfinance,457 Contribution Confusion,"Hi /r/personalfinance!

I am approaching the maximum annual contribution for my 457 pretax account ($19,500). 

Year to date I have contributed ~$14k and I currently have a surplus of vacation hours accrued. I have the option to cash out vacation with an additional option to roll vacation hours directly into the 457 account. 80 hours of pay is approximately $5500 so I figured that I would do that now and be done for the year, using my additional take-home income for the rest of the year for other investments/to increase my security blanket. I was advised by my accounts payable department that I still have to pay SS, medicare, and SDI on this income and that it also may increase the state and federal taxes being withheld slightly. They estimated that these 3 withholdings would be ~$450 so I wasn't too worried about it. I planned to contribute the difference on my next check to square everything up at the $19.5k limit.

On a normal 80 hour paycheck, my federal withholdings are about $600 and state is $120... With this additional 80 hours of vacation cash out pay, my federal increased to $1100 and state increased to $220. Both nearly doubled.

Can someone please help me understand why my taxes almost doubled when I increased my contribution to my pretax/tax deferred 457 account. I inquired with the accounts payable department and was told that is normal and they've seen that happen before. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Everyone I've asked said, ""Oh yeah... That's normal"", but they cannot explain the reasoning.

Any advise or explanation would be greatly appreciated.",finance

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. Hai and Dat of Meld have released a public article detailing their plan to deal with concurrency. [https://medium.com/meld-labs/concurrent-deterministic-batching-on-the-utxo-ledger-99040f809706](https://medium.com/meld-labs/concurrent-deterministic-batching-on-the-utxo-ledger-99040f809706)

3. Only two more days until Alonzo!  Get the whiskey ready, ladies and gentlemen!

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Cardano has been listed by Bitpoint in Japan! [https://www.bitpoint.co.jp/news/info/info-2021080301/](https://www.bitpoint.co.jp/news/info/info-2021080301/)
2. Senators Wyden and Toomey are trying to fix the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill! [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/crypto-rules-in-infrastructure-bill-eyed-for-bipartisan-rewrite](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/crypto-rules-in-infrastructure-bill-eyed-for-bipartisan-rewrite)
3. SEC Chair Gensler gave another speech strongly signaling that a lot of stablecoins, lending platforms, synthetics platforms, and other DeFi projects are probably non-compliant in the eyes of the SEC. I would heed this warning very carefully if I were one of those projects. [https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tusQLLCgrDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tusQLLCgrDs)

5. We‚Äôre now up to 5 different states that are getting after BlockFi for their crypto lending activities. Reportedly, this includes New Jersey, Vermont, Alabama, Kentucky, &amp; Texas. Probably relevant for those building lending solutions on Cardano.

6. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy ‚Äúsome things‚Äù minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
7. Cardano‚Äôs closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it‚Äôs EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We‚Äôll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano‚Äôs deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

8. Senators Toomey, Wyden, &amp; Lummis took to the Senate Floor to plead for a vote on their amendment which would fix the overly broad crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423381402905726983](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423381402905726983) [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423413806634577922](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423413806634577922)
9. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements. This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry! Please call your Senators and ask them to support the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis Amendment!

13. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. Both revisions were good for Cardano since they included proof-of-stake implicitly and then explicitly.

19. Very action packed day today (Aug 9). The Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema came together and proposed a compromise amendment to the crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. They were not able to include any section for exclusion of developers from the ‚Äúbroker‚Äù definition but did cover the previous progress on transaction validators and wallet sellers.

20. Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema sought the required unanimous consent, but their attempt was thwarted by a disagreement over $50 billion in defense spending. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424832132204138503](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424832132204138503)
21. Several co-chairs of the Blockchain Caucus have already written a letter to all the members of the House of Representatives letting them know of the dire need to fix these crypto provisions once the bill hits the House.

\~Army of Spies",cryptocurrency
cardano,Decentralization is at the heart of Cardano,"Decentralization is an absolutely key feature of public blockchain networks, as it is this feature that differentiates them from current protocols. Let‚Äôs explain what decentralization is, how to measure it, and how to maintain its high quality in the long run.

# TLDR:

* Public blockchain networks do not meet the general definition of decentralization, and we can observe elements of centralization in every existing network.
* The quality of decentralization is dynamic and changes over time. It can rise or fall.
* In a decentralized blockchain network, there are entities that have a higher status than others. Decentralization of networks can thus be compared to some extent with each other.
* The current quality of decentralization is not so important. Decentralization must scale with increasing adoption.
* The only way to keep the network secure and fraud-proof as the number of users grows is to scale at the decentralization level.
* The quality of network decentralization should be measured by how many people use the network and how many assets need to be protected.
* Cardano is designed in such a way that decentralization can be gradually increased.

# What is decentralization

A decentralized system is a kind of system that requires the users to make their own, individual, decisions. In such systems, there is no designated central authority making decisions in the name of all participants. Instead, each participant, also known as ‚Äòpeer,‚Äô makes their own autonomous decisions pursuing their own self-interest that may collide with the goals of other peers. In a decentralized system, there are no regulations regarding entry into or exit from the system.

Decentralization concepts can be applied in science, private enterprises and organizations management, politics, law, and public administration, economics, money, and technology. The word ‚Äúdecentralization‚Äù first appeared during the Great French Revolution, which saw the enactment of decentralization of government. France was divided into departments, which were separate administrative and economic units.

In the case of cryptocurrencies, we are generally talking about decentralization at the technology level, specifically at the network level. The first generation of cryptocurrencies are trying to achieve decentralized monetary policy and a decentralized transmission network through decentralization at the network level. Cardano extends this concept to the possibility of decentralizing basic economic activities such as lending or stabilizing the economic environment, the identity of the population, decision-making power, etc.

The goal of decentralization, generally speaking, is to take decision-making power out of the hands of unreliable intermediaries and put it in the hands of decentralized technology. This may create new financial and social linkages in which traditional intermediaries, such as banks or authorities, may play a less important role.

Decentralized networks are inherently global, so there are no international borders for them. People all over the world can be connected and all use the same network, which is completely independent of any government or organization. The potential of this technological achievement is not yet widely realized.

# How to distribute decision-making power

Decentralization is a dynamic process and can therefore grow or decline. Decentralization is dependent on many internal and external factors such as the economic motivation of people to participate in decentralization, the network budget and reward scheme, regulation, the cost of engaging in the process, protocol adoption, and high competition.

Ideally, by the basic definition of decentralization, all participants should be equal. In the case of cryptocurrencies, this is so far an unattainable goal in practice. Thus, in any decentralized network, some entities have more rights or higher status. Obviously, the drive to be the higher-ranking one will be enormous, as there are economic benefits from high status. It can be said that in every decentralized network we can find certain features of centralization.

If you look at the image below, you will see a common distribution of power in a public decentralized blockchain network. You can see 3 groups of participants: block producers, delegators, and coin holders.

&amp;#x200B;

[How decentralization works.](https://preview.redd.it/vtdr2zeqdmm71.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cce71fcecd5de0274817e89626d613b5be2c7207)

 

It doesn‚Äôt matter if we‚Äôre talking about Cardano, Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, Polkadot, Ripple, or Solana. This basic distribution of power works everywhere, although it may differ fundamentally in the details.

In practice, the smallest group, but the most important, are block producers. The individual members of this group are in charge of producing new blocks. These people decide whether to create a block at all, what transactions to include in the block, or what the previous block to build on. This group thus has the most decision-making power. The people in this group are the most rewarded for this work by the protocol. This is because these entities have the ability to cause some damage, so their economic motivation must be the highest. It can be assumed that no one would be willing to deliberately destroy an economically profitable business. In the Cardano ecosystem, pool operators produce blocks.

This works similarly for Bitcoin, which also uses the concept of pools. In Ethereum 2.0, blocks will be produced by validators, i.e. entities that lock a minimum of 32 ETH. However, this does not mean that pools will not be created. People who have a smaller number of ETH will also want to participate in the staking process. Therefore, pools will be formed that will bring together these smaller investors and run validators with their ETH.

As you can see, it doesn‚Äôt matter if Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus is used. The basic principles are similar everywhere.

The second important group is the delegators. What do delegators have? In principle, they have part of the decision-making power. Delegators are characterized by the fact that they are not directly involved in the production of new blocks, but they determine by their decision to whom they delegate this task. In the Cardano ecosystem, delegators can be all owners of ADA coins. There is no lower limit to the coins a delegator must own. Let us add that this process is called staking. Delegators also have an economic incentive to appropriately choose the pools that will be tasked with producing blocks. The Cardno protocol rewards pool operators but also delegators in proportion to the number of coins they hold. We can say that the group of coin holders and delegators overlap. However, not every coin holder will delegate their ADA coins.

PoW networks, coins are not used to delegate power. Power is delegated through a hash rate. Delegators are a group of miners who delegate the hash rate to a selected pool. Pool operators receive a reward from the protocol and promise to send the miners a reward according to the work they have done. An important difference is that native coins play the role of reward, but do not carry any decision-making powers. This means that the group of coin holders have no decision-making powers and do not participate in decentralization. Decentralization thus depends only on groups of block producers (pool operators) and delegators.

In the case of PoS projects, a larger number of participants will be involved in decentralization. It is easier to buy coins on the open market and receive regular rewards for holding and delegating power. It can be concluded that Cardano gives people an economic incentive to maintain high decentralization. Decentralization increases directly with the distribution of coins among people. It is the easiest way to achieve high decentralization and to approach the basic definition of decentralization. Thus, decision-making power is vested in all network participants, not just a select group of people, as is usually the case in PoW networks.

It should be noted that a group of coin holders, but also groups of people who do not hold any coins, can operate a full node. This means that they can actively check if everything is happening in the network as expected. People are not directly economically rewarded for this activity and are in the role of observers. They have no direct participation in the network consensus. Thus, people can observe inconsistencies but cannot actively prevent them except at the social level. If the majority of entities in the block producer group agree on the rules, they will continue to produce blocks and maintain the longest chain.

From the perspective of attacking the network or the possibility of power takeover, the block producers and delegators are the most important groups and we will focus on them in this paper.

# How to measure the quality of decentralization

The quality of decentralization can be compared to some extent by the number of actors in each group. Since the block producers group is the most important, the number of independent entities in this group has the strongest weight. The second strongest weight is given to the group of delegators, who essentially decide how much decision-making power the entities in the block producers group will have.

 As we have already explained, with Cardano we have an overlap between the delegators group and the coin holder group. For PoW projects, this is not the case and we have to strictly distinguish between the three separate groups.

Obviously, a very key feature for achieving a high degree of decentralization is the economic or social feasibility of becoming a valid member of a block producer group. Entry into this group must be open and not be obstructed by the protocol as we see in the EOS or Tron projects, for example. Here the level of decentralization is essentially fixed and when someone new comes in, they displace an existing member of the group.

Although access is open, this does not necessarily mean that joining a block producer group is easy and economically achievable for everyone. Entry may require some financial resources. Limits must not be too low, as blocks should be produced by someone who has appropriate skin in the game. On the other hand, they must not be too high either, as only the rich would be able to enter.

The number of members in the delegator group should be also as high as possible, as it is the second most important group and can influence the balance of power in the block producers group. If there is a member in the block producer group who does not behave honestly and his behavior is not in accordance with the generally expected conditions, there must be a force that makes him irrelevant. The theory goes that in a decentralized system, there is no way to fire anyone. He can only be economically disadvantaged relative to others.

It is important to remember that decision-making power can always be bought with money, and the only question is how much the attacker is willing to invest in a possible attack or long-term permanent damage. Achieving a high degree of decentralization is the best prevention against attacks. If the majority of coins in the PoS ecosystem are owned by independent individuals who have no intention of doing harm and selling the coins to an attacker, the attacker has no chance of attacking the network. Doing harm with smaller amounts is possible, but economically disadvantageous. The impact on the network may be negligible. In the case of the Cardano ecosystem, delegators are expected to keep track of their rewards. If they delegate the power of their coins to a pool that does not sufficiently reward its delegators, they will choose another pool. This will weaken the attacker‚Äôs pool and strengthen another honest pool. The security of the Cardano protocol thus relies on high decentralization.

PoW networks work very similarly in principle. Miners provide a hash rate to selected pools and thus increase the chance of mining a block. If a pool abused its position and, for example, decided to censor transactions, miners could delegate the hash rate elsewhere. Again, they would remove the decision-making power from the malicious pool and strengthen the honest pool.

We deliberately do not want to compare individual projects with each other, as the numbers may not be fully indicative of the quality of decentralization. The details can be decisive. Moreover, as you will see in the next section, the current level of decentralization is only the beginning and there will be demand for it to grow. However, we can try to compare the largest PoW network, which is Bitcoin, with the largest PoS network, which is Cardano.

Bitcoin is the oldest decentralized cryptocurrency and had no pools at its launch. The network came to the creation of pools through gradual evolution. We can observe that the network has about 10 dominant pools. The 3 largest pools have over 10% position. These 10 pools hold 85% control of the network. Pools that together have about 15% share fall into the category of others. Bitcoin does not support the existence of pools at the protocol level, so unfortunately we have no on-chain data regarding the second delegator group. Statistics regarding delegator counts are unavailable and difficult to verify. Individual miner companies can be tracked down but it can be still difficult to find out what hash rate they have.

Let us add that large mining companies can negotiate better rewards from pools than those that are publicly advertised. Pools have an economic incentive to reward large players better, as it increases their overall hash rate and market position. Large mining firms have a strong position and can easily negotiate better terms. Low transparency puts small domestic miners at a disadvantage and leads to greater centralization.

The same can be said for the purchase of mining equipment and electricity, where large buyers can also negotiate better terms. Increasing decentralization is relatively difficult for PoW networks. The trend is rather negative and economically towards more centralization.

To provide some context regarding the delegator group, 27,000 bitcoins are mined each month. The largest mining farms can produce several hundred BTC coins per month. One of the largest farms in northern China reached 700 mined bitcoins per month, contributing over 2% of the total hash rate. If large investors decide to mine, they buy ASIC miners by the thousands and are willing to pay several million dollars to do so. There can be tens of thousands of ASIC miners in a single farm. It is important to note that from a decentralization perspective, the decision to delegate a hash rate to a particular pool is made by the people who are physically on the farm. No one else. Each new large farm pushes small players out of the game, thus reducing decentralization. Some of the decision-making power to delegate the hash rate may be in the hands of 10,000 independent individuals, or in the hands of the owners of a single farm.

How can we evaluate the decentralization of Bitcoin? Bitcoin has 10 block producers and an unknown number of delegators. Perhaps all competing networks have a larger number of block producers, usually a few dozen or hundreds. Let‚Äôs make a scale from 1 to 1000, where 1 is a centralized network and 1000 is the current level of maximum decentralization. Let‚Äôs do the same for a group of delegators, except that the upper bound will be 1,000,000. In the case of Bitcoin, PoW mining is dominated by large farms, so a significant part of the decision-making power will be in the hands of the order of 100 to 1000 individuals. Bitcoin would get the following rating: 10/1000.

In the case of the Cardano network, everything is much simpler, as the protocol takes into account the concept of pools and delegators. We thus have on-chain data that tells us very precisely the number of pools and delegators. There are almost 3000 pools registered in the Cardano network at the time of writing. However, not all of them produce blocks. Moreover, some pools are controlled by a single entity. The largest player is the Binance exchange, which has about 12% control of the network under its control. However, the very next big pool only has about a 4% share. The pools that have more than 1% control over the network are made up of about 15 entities that together have about 40% control over the network. The rest are smaller players. About 22% control of the network is accounted for by single pool operators, which operate about 68% of the pools. The number of delegators is almost 750,000.

 What rating would Cardano get by our scale? There is one dominant whale in the network, 15 say bigger players, but also a large number of single pool operators. Binance is a big player, but you have to remember that the power of this exchange is delegated and people have the ability to move coins from the exchange to their own wallets. However, it can happen that someone steals the coins. It could be the exchange itself. The rest of the control of power, the whole 88%, is a fairly well-decentralized network. About 1100 pools are rewarded each epoch. Let‚Äôs agree to give the network a mark of 500 at the block producer level. In the case of delegators, this is easy, and we know that there are roughly 750,000 of them. Here again, a single entity can have multiple wallets. Let‚Äôs give the network a mark of 700,000. So the overall rating is 500/700,000.

We can say that the Cardano network is about 50X more decentralized at the block producer level and 700x more decentralized at the delegator level. We leave it to the reader to compare the decentralization of other networks and take into account important details. The resulting numbers are not that important, since as we will show in the next section, decentralization must increase as adoption increases. Thus, for the context of this article, very rough estimates are sufficient and it was not necessary to know the exact numbers.

# Decentralization must scale

Let‚Äôs do a little thought exercise now. Let‚Äôs say we have a group of 100 people who want to exchange money for goods with each other. At the same time, they want there to be accounting records of this. People don‚Äôt trust each other. Not everyone knows how accounting works. Among the people, there are 2 people who know how to account and agree to keep it. In order to ensure that neither of the accountants cheats, they will take turns to keep the books on a regular basis. In addition, the bookkeeping will be completely open so that all the other 98 people can look at the ledger at any time.

If there was one person overseeing the ledger, he could do whatever he wanted. That person‚Äôs decision-making power would be centralized, and no one else would be able to correct an entry in the ledger, even if someone explicitly pointed it out.

If there are two accountants, we can talk about the decentralization of power. However, it cannot be said to be a solid disposition of decision-making power. What if one accountant, let‚Äôs call her Alice, cheats? The other accountant, Bob, will want to correct Alice‚Äôs mistakes, but Alice won‚Äôt agree. So there‚Äôs a stalemate. People will soon come to the realization that 2 accountants are not enough to decentralize the ledger. So they choose a third accountant, Carol. If there is a dispute between Alice and Bob, Carol will be the one to decide the truth. The same will be true if there is a dispute between, say, Carol and Alice. Bob will settle the dispute.

But we‚Äôre still not out of the woods. What if Alice and Bob agree to cheat together and always outvote Carol? There will be accounting errors in the ledger and there will be no way to correct them. People won‚Äôt be happy and they won‚Äôt trust the accountants. They will soon come to the conclusion that 3 people are not enough to decentralize the ledger and they need more.

How many accountants does it take to make the system work well? Instead of answering directly, we‚Äôll bring rewards into our game. If people are happy with the accountants, they will pay them regularly for their work. The accountants will be in a very different position as they will be looking for a reward. If they want to cheat, they will calculate whether it is more rewarding to cheat or to get paid by the people. The reward must be high enough to motivate the accountant to behave honestly.

Let‚Äôs say that everything started working well for now in our game and the accountants behaved honestly because they appreciate a regular income for their work. However, there is a catch. It only works well for 100 people. Once the number of people goes up, the system can stop working.

What if the number of people using accountants increases? What if there are not 100 but 1000 people? As the number of people increases, the amounts that need to be entered into the ledger increase. The number of people has increased by a factor of 10, so potential fraud can suddenly be more profitable. If two accountants colluded to commit fraud, they would gain so much that it would exceed the regular payments over a longer period of time. The system would be in jeopardy again.

People have two options. Either increase payments or increase the number of accountants and let them compete with each other to see who can do the work of an accountant. People can even decide directly for themselves who gets the trust and who can become an accountant. I hope by now you have seen the analogy with decentralized networks.

The budget of public networks is limited and you cannot endlessly increase the rewards as the number of users of the network grows. This means that the only way to keep the network secure and fraud-proof is to scale at the decentralized level. It is essential that the network supports the highest possible number of accountants and that people themselves can choose the accountants who do a good job. So we are talking about block producer and delegator groups.

Would 3 accountants be enough for 1000 people? Maybe. What if there were 10,000 people? Not sure. What if there were 1,000,000 people? That probably wouldn‚Äôt be enough and it would be naive to talk about a good level of decentralization. No one will tell you exactly how many block producers, and delegators, there should be for 1M users. The goal is to scale the numbers of these key entities reasonably, but even that isn‚Äôt very specific. We can probably agree, however, that 3 block producers and 100 delegators for say 10M users is really very few.

The current adoption of blockchain networks is very low. Yet the networks are global and aim to be adopted by tens, hundreds, and eventually thousands of millions of people. Decentralization therefore cannot remain at the same level as it is today and must necessarily grow with the increasing number of users. With increasing adoption, it will come increasing social, political, and economic pressure on the key groups of block producers and delegators. With a small number of these entities, the risk of abuse of power will grow, whether internal, i.e. directly by the block producers themselves, or external, i.e. by regulators, fraudsters, powerful entities, and so on.

 The only way to counteract the risk of abuse of power is to increase the quality of decentralization, i.e. to spread decision-making power over as many independent entities as possible. It is clear that the threat of abuse of power by the whales is greater than by smaller players. Thus, with a higher degree of decentralization, the share of whale power should ideally decrease. In practice, this may be difficult to achieve.

The degree of decentralization should thus be measured by the number of users. If network adoption increases by, say, a factor of ten, decentralization should increase accordingly. If decentralization stagnates, it will decline.

There are around 40 million addresses with bitcoins. Our rating for Bitcoin decentralization was 10/1000. We can say that 10 key entities control the assets of 40 million people, worth about a trillion dollars. Let‚Äôs compare it to the Cardano network. There are about 2 million addresses with ADA coins. Our assessment of Cardano‚Äôs decentralization was 500/700,000. So similarly, we can say that 500 key entities control the assets of 2 million people, worth about $100 billion.

The Cardano ecosystem has about 20 times fewer users, but 50 times more block producers overseeing their assets. At the same time, there are about 700x more delegators.

The big advantage of the Cardano network is that coin owners have decision rights in proportion to the size of their stake. This means that each individual ADA coin owner can be a delegator at the same time, allowing them to decide freely who they trust to produce blocks. People who have a larger amount of coins can run their own pool for themselves and trust themselves. The stakes of individual participants, and thus the decision-making power in the network, do not change over time. This means that a large entity cannot come in and reduce the stake of the coin owner through his money. In other words, until the coin owner sells, it maintains its size decision-making power.

If the number of ADA coin owners increases, the number of delegators increases at the same time. If a decision is made to reduce the saturation level (one of the configurable network parameters), the chances of new pools being created increase as the total number of coins to create a fully saturated pool is reduced. A larger number of people would be able to create their own pool, which would increase decentralization.

It can be concluded that Cardano is well prepared for scaling decentralization by design. Simply put, this is mainly due to the ability to scale up decentralization based on how the distribution of coins among people grows. If Cardano reaches 10M users, there will be 10M potential delegators at the same time. Their position will be proportional to their stake. Further, it‚Äôs the ability to reduce the requirements to create a new pool. As the value of coins rises, in general, the opportunities for newcomers or existing players decrease dramatically. For example, in the Ethereum network, you need to own 32 ETH to become a validator. As the value of ETH increases, the chances of becoming a validator decrease for ordinary investors. It turns out that setting the network parameters fixed for volatile coins is not very smart. It may be necessary to reconfigure the parameters and there may not be a consensus to do so among users. If the number of users in the Cardano network increases and there is a consensus that decentralization needs to be increased, this is easily doable. If pool saturation bounds are lowered, people with less stake, or smaller groups of people, will be able to start a new pool.

The Bitcoin ecosystem is moving towards greater centralization. The number of pools has been relatively static for a long time and has not changed much. However, the number of users is growing. In this light, we can say that decentralization is decreasing. At the miner level, one cannot expect more decentralization either. Rather, what we will see is that domestic mining will eventually disappear altogether, as only large companies will be able to be profitable.

# Conclusion

Our vision of the future is that with the increased adoption of public blockchain networks and the study of on-chain data, the decentralization of individual networks will be measured very accurately over time. Just as people compare the number of users of different social groups, the number of financial transactions, volumes transferred, etc., decentralization will be measured and reported on. Decentralization is a very key feature and if the economic and social importance of networks is going to grow, there will be a strong emphasis on high decentralization. Does it make sense for the assets of half the world to be managed by, say, just 10 entities? The world would become less stable. Decentralization needs to scale, and if decentralized networks are one day to be used by a significant part of the planet, thousands of independent block producers and hundreds of thousands to millions of delegators must be responsible for the assets. We need to think about decentralization, talk about it, and scale it up. At the moment, we are at the very beginning.

PoW is great at security, worse at decentralization, and bad at scalability. Moreover, the design of this consensus does not allow decentralization to increase. PoS is great in all three areas. Security is sometimes questioned by some people, but it‚Äôs only a matter of time before people start trusting PoS more. People didn‚Äôt trust PoW much in the beginning either. PoW security relies on energy consumption, which is a unique system, but probably unsustainable in the long run. Over time, transaction fees may prove unable to provide a high level of security. In addition, high energy consumption generates controversy, which may discourage large investors. This will lower the value of BTC coins and thus result in less security. The PoW concept is good, but it turns out that it cannot exist on its own. Maybe a good way is to link one protocol with multiple consensuses. Cardano can have PoS and PoW alongside it. This would increase security and the protocol would be able to secure enough funding to run PoW. This is the distant future. However, it is a good idea to consider it now.

PoS is often criticized for people staking on exchanges and thus giving decision-making power to the exchange. PoW has exactly the same problem. People buy hash rates from third parties who run ASIC miners for them in their mining hall. In the case of PoS, people can withdraw coins from the exchange into their own wallets at any time. It is more convenient for people to hold the coins in their own custody and, most importantly, it will increase decentralization. In the case of PoW, this cannot be done so easily as domestic mining is often unprofitable. If ordinary people want to mine, they have to rely on third parties, essentially handing over power to the big players. There is an economic barrier that prevents the possible increase in decentralization.

Personally, we trust the quality of PoS security. Security is based on a high level of decentralization and an incentive model. It is important to remember that the security of public blockchain networks is also about decentralization. It‚Äôs not just about security itself in the sense of proof about the computing work, as the PoW consensus does. Will the network be secure despite the fact that the hash rate will be enormously high if a small number of entities have access to it? The risk of attack will simply be relatively high. The decision-making power in the Cardano PoS network is distributed to a high number of individuals, so an attacker has little chance of damaging the network due to low stakes. Getting a high stake in principle means buying up coins on the open market, which can be very difficult since most people are economically motivated to hold coins for their own staking profit. A lot of coins are locked up by pool operators and staked. With DeFi, there will be more opportunities to use the coins and possibly capitalize on them. Few will want to sell them. Additionally, as adoption and the number of new users grow, decentralization will grow, again making an attack less feasible. If, for example, 25M people each own 1000 ADA coins and they would not be willing to sell them at any market value, an attacker would have no chance of getting a majority to conduct a 51% attack. Ten years from now, Cardano may have that number of users and a similar distribution of coins.

You yourself have seen the gross difference in decentralization between Cardano and Bitcoin in the context of the number of users. We can say that Cardano protects users‚Äô assets better than Bitcoin at the moment because of its higher decentralization and the possibility of its growth in the future.",cryptocurrency
cardano,Cardano and Real Finance is a Great Fit,"Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is the most promising emerging sector in the cryptocurrency space. However, this sector lacks the necessary stability and reliability, two crucial prerequisites for further adoption. Cardano can bring DeFi to mainstream users and thus create real finance (RealFi). 

 

# Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies might be two different things

Many people mistakenly believe that cryptocurrencies are a suitable tool for a new financial revolution based on blockchain. The reality is that blockchain is a perfect fit for the world of finance. Unfortunately, native coin projects have little use in the world of finance. If a blockchain network is to be decentralized, it needs native coins that are used as a vehicle to reach that goal. Thus, the decentralization of the Cardano network grows along with the distribution of ADA coins among new users and the emergence of new pools. ADA coins are and will be highly volatile in the future. As the importance of the network grows, the price of ADA coins is likely to grow as well. What the value will be in 10 or 20 years, no one can accurately predict today. Since growth is expected, people mostly hold the coins as a speculative asset.

It is similar for all other projects. If the coins were stable in value, there would not be so much demand for them regarding speculation. Without the ability to do something with such stable coins, there would be no demand from this side either. ADA coins will be used for project management and also generate passive income for the holders. If the network is used, the fees will go from the hands of the users to the coin holders. The speculative nature and the desire for decision rights are important parts of the decentralization of the project.

Speculation always brings price instability. In the beginning, people assumed that cryptocurrencies would be money. That assumption turned out to be wrong and made no sense economically. The world of finance needs stability and predictability. Money has two key parameters, it is a unit of account and also a unit of exchange. People must be willing to spend money or invest it for the long term. For this to work, the value of money must ideally be stable or at least maintain an approximate value in the long run. Money is not necessarily an ideal store of value. There is no asset in the world that meets all three of the basic requirements of good money. That is, it is a good store of value and a good unit of account and unit of exchange.

Some economists believe that a store of value cannot also be a unit of account. The demand for a store of value will fluctuate over economic cycles and people will always prefer to spend other money rather than what they are saving for a rainy day. The unit of account cannot be volatile, and we cannot determine the price of goods based on how scarce money is at any given time. Increasing the value of a scarce resource would reduce the price of goods and vice versa.

Cryptocurrencies derive their value from digital scarcity. Because the number of coins in a given monetary policy of a blockchain project is rigid, it will never be stable. Even though the monetary expansion curve may be known in advance, it does not mean that the price of coins will be stable. Rather, what we can observe in practice is that new cycles may emerge in which the price fluctuates by tens of percent. Predictability cannot ensure stability. This is due to the fact that a fixed monetary expansion curve cannot respond flexibly to the fluctuations and needs of the real world.

There is no stabilizing mechanism and the value of cryptocurrencies is based on current demand, which will never be stable. Demand will be influenced by many external events that cannot be predicted in advance. When something bad suddenly happens in the world, the prices of most commodities can plummet. However, the value of money and good prices cannot fluctuate according to market sentiment, as this would have an immediate and direct effect on the purchasing power of the population.

Blockchain as a technology is an excellent tool for creating a global financial infrastructure. Blockchain is essentially a global immutable database in which all transactions are instantly available to the rest of the world. All coins, assets, and tokens are owned by the users themselves and never by a third party. If a third party is in play, it will be a smart contract whose behavior is predictable in advance and whose evaluation is automatic. The parties involved have voluntarily agreed to its use. There will be no need to look for a trusted intermediary in the physical world for the custody service, as the smart contract can do the same job cheaper, more reliably, and with complete transparency.

Blockchain is natively a global network, so it will never be a problem that a service is only available somewhere in the world. No one decides on availability and there are no economic interests at stake. You could say that Cardano connects people all over the world today. Anyone can install a wallet and start interacting economically with their surroundings. Now we need to further develop this infrastructure and deliver real financial services.

Every blockchain network is for people to interact with each other financially and for ownership of wealth to remain in the hands of users who can dispose of it freely. This cannot be replaced by centralized parties holding cryptocurrencies for people, as their services are cheaper and faster. These parties are always subject to regulation and most importantly, all the benefits that blockchain offers are lost.

Blockchain as a financial infrastructure and volatile native coins of projects are two things that can‚Äôt do without each other but discourage mainstream users from using financial services. Ordinary people on the street have no desire to speculate on the cost of the projects they use. Just like they don‚Äôt hold shares in the banks they have an account with, or shares in Google, which they use every day. Financial services have to do without volatility. For Cardano, as a platform, this is an easy target.

It would be naive to think that all the people in the world will own ADA coins and just so they can be part of the decentralized financial revolution. It‚Äôs probably an unattainable goal to convince the majority of the population to use one blockchain project as the new form of money. Even more so if that asset is volatile and thus unusable for anything other than financial speculation. People would essentially have to exchange this asset for the money they use now. That means they would have to be able to use the new money immediately. It‚Äôs okay for the decentralized infrastructure of the world to be owned and decided upon by maybe only 5‚Äì10% of the population holding ADA coins. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be all users, provided the infrastructure works well and everyone benefits from it. If there is a problem with this arrangement in the future, it will be possible to change the balance of power. Let us not be closed-minded in thinking that everything that is done today must be the same in 10 years‚Äô time. We will have to take good care of decentralization and develop it as necessary.

Most people on the planet are not interested in speculation, either because they don‚Äôt have the spare funds to do so, or it is not their life goal or interest. People from poor countries would be the last ones to participate in such a revolution. The purchasing power of westerners will always be higher. The wealth disparity between people living in developing and developed countries would be perhaps even worse than today. This is certainly not what we would want from decentralized finance. The new world of finance is not about early adopters getting rich at the expense of the rest of the population. We should stop believing the false narrative that people will buy new money and stop being citizens of their countries. Blockchain, as new financial infrastructure, and Cardano, as a global financial and operating system, is surely meant to do more than that.

# The road to stability

It is hard to find something in the world that can maintain its stable value on its own. This is because many phenomena are interconnected and this constantly changes supply and demand. Stability is expected from gold, but even its value fluctuates slightly according to the mood of the markets in the short term. Movements of tens of percent within a year are possible. Fiat currencies in developed countries are relatively stable in terms of purchasing power but at the cost of some effort by monetary banks to maintain this stability. Sometimes control can get out of hand and unexpectedly high inflation can occur.

The scarcity of a resource will never be a guarantee of price stability. A scarce resource is useful as a store of value, but there is different demand for this property in different economic cycles. Our world is too complex for the demand for commodities to be stable. Let us illustrate with an example. In a crisis, there will be less production, so, for example, the price of metals will fall, but the price of gold will rise. People will try to preserve value in a crisis and the value of fiat currencies may fluctuate. Once the crisis has passed, the demand for metals will rise, but the price of gold may fall. Gold will be sold to invest in metals. New products will be made from metals.

The road to stability is likely to lead only through a controlled process that derives stability from a basket of commodities and stable currencies. It is possible to create a digital asset whose value will be stable relative to other assets. The portfolio must be suitably constructed so that the individual components are as independent of each other as possible. It is thus possible to create a stable coin whose value will be more stable than many national currencies.

If the dominance of the current financial giants is to be disrupted at the global level, the same tools are needed as now exist. The only difference will be that these new instruments will honor the ideals of decentralization. One of the most important building blocks is certainly a stable coin. Finance can only work well if it is stable.

# What is Finance

Finance is definitely not about people sending volatile coins to each other. It makes no economic sense and it‚Äôs not good for payments as well. If you wanted to pay with a volatile cryptocurrency for a phone, for example, the thought process would be as follows. Find out the value of the phone, which would be expressed in the national stable fiat currency. Assess the price against other goods and your financial capabilities. You could then exchange some of your cryptocurrency for fiat currency and pay. You cannot use cryptocurrency directly as a unit of account in this process because you cannot evaluate the real price of the phone correctly and with a full context. Moreover, if the price were expressed in cryptocurrency, it would constantly fluctuate up and down according to the mood of the market. Normal buying would also eventually become just speculation and waiting for a better price. This is not how a complex economy can work. If we were to call this by its proper name, it would be the sale of an investment asset or the realization of a profit in order to purchase consumer goods. Unless you are in profit, you probably won‚Äôt want to do business this way. At least that‚Äôs how the majority of the population will perceive it.

A one-off transfer of value has nothing to do with the world of finance in the true sense of the word. Or rather, it plays only a marginal role. Finance is a broad term that describes activities related to banking, leverage or debt, credit, capital markets, money, and investments. Funding is basically money management and the process of raising the necessary funds. These are essential financial operations that are absolutely essential for economics. If we are unable to carry out these operations, we cannot talk about a financial revolution. The key parameter of these financial operations is the stability of the currency in which they are carried out. Since these are operations that last for a long period of time, even several years, any volatility would damage one of the partners in the contract. This is clearly undesirable. It makes sense to use blockchain for these operations, as these operations are a superstructure over money. Almost every adult on the planet has experience with a loan or mortgage. Or has at least thought about it. The problem with volatile cryptocurrencies is that they can‚Äôt perform these operations. This is the obvious difference between money in the true sense of the word and speculative investment.

Let‚Äôs take an example. Let‚Äôs say someone wanted a loan to buy a car, which they would pay back regularly every month for 3 years. The lender would provide the money to buy the car, which the buyer could immediately use for his business and earn the repayments. Let‚Äôs say the car costs $50,000 and the lender commits to pay $1,450 over 36 months. In total, the borrower would pay off 52,200 USD. In the normal world of finance, thousands of such contracts are made every day. The borrower can predict whether he will be able to repay the debt. In the worst case, he can sell the car and thus get rid of a significant part of the obligation. Could the same be done with a volatile cryptocurrency?

The amount of USD 1,450 will be the same, or at least approximately the same value, in 3 years. It is likely that a citizen living in the US will be able to earn that amount and have enough to pay off the debt. In the case of cryptocurrency, unfortunately, it does not work that way. If ADA was worth $1.50 at the time the loan was closed, the lender would have provided 33,333 ADA coins to the borrower. On the same terms as the dollar, the borrower would repay about 966 ADA coins per month. This is a value equivalent to USD 1,450. Now imagine if the price of ADA coins went up from $1.5 to $10 over 2 years. That would be about a six-fold appreciation of ADA coins. If the borrower still had to repay 966 ADA coins, that would be $9,660 per month. In just six such payments, the borrower would pay off $57,960, which is more than the price of the car at the time he took out the loan. The borrower would likely go bankrupt because he would not be able to pay off the car. The lender would have grown enormously and, more importantly, undeservedly rich on the loan or would not have seen the repayment. It wouldn‚Äôt work the other way around either. If the price of ADA coins fell, it would be beneficial to the borrower, who would more easily pay off the debt. The lender would be at a disadvantage because it would get less in dollar value. For example, he would not be able to buy half a car even if the borrower would have paid off the entire loan.

Volatility in the world of finance would have fatal consequences for the economy. No one would be able to borrow for business. People with money would lose the ability to easily expand their wealth by borrowing money. Some would get rich and others would go bankrupt. The whole decentralized finance sector could disappear, as it would be found that it cannot bring anything functional to the real economy.

Finance is about the long term in which one party provides money to another party. It‚Äôs about working with debit and credit, or it can be about long-term investing. Financial transactions have one thing in common. It is a certain algorithm involving multiple parties who transfer value to each other according to certain rules. In its basic essence, it is just a numbers game.

Many contracts are already automated in the traditional financial world. Identities are verified at the bank, bank account details are provided and terms are set. For a conventional loan, the scenario is as follows. One party receives a large sum of money to make the purchase. It could be a house, a car, or just money for a business. This amount has to be repaid over an agreed time, including interest on the loan. In practice, the borrower sends the money to a given bank account regularly by a certain date. If it is late, someone notices and sends a reminder. The legal system ensures that the borrower is forced to repay the amount borrowed.

# Blockchain and Finance

Blockchain and smart contracts are a perfect fit for the world of finance. Entering into a contract is always a multi-party act that includes the terms of the contract and the identification of the parties. Cardano will allow participants to create a decentralized identity through Atala PRISM. Entering into a contract is just a matter of creating or finding a suitable smart contract and deploying it. All financial flows within the contract will be written in the blockchain. with all the necessary details. The mission of the blockchain is to record transactions. Smart contracts will allow multiple transactions to be combined into a single context. A smart contract can react to events and automatically fulfill the terms of the contract.

As we have shown above, it is always economically disadvantageous for one party to borrow ADA coins for a longer time horizon and try to repay the loan gradually. Once you replace ADA coins with stable coins or digital currencies issued by central banks, Cardano literally becomes a global financial operating system. The difference between Cardano and traditional financial services lies in the use of blockchain and decentralization. Most commercial banks operate on a local level with a local currency. Banks dictate their own terms for loans, including interest rates. It is difficult for banks and expensive for customers if the loan is to be international. For example, it is not common to make a loan between a European and an African. The power of a global decentralized network is that it can connect people across continents and no one can prevent this cooperation. That does not necessarily mean that people cannot be involved in the cooperation. They can and probably will. Reputation, risk assessment, and identity verification in creating the digital one will still depend on people. Cardano needs to be seen as a vehicle for financial transactions and these will always be about people first and foremost. The only difference is that smart contracts and blockchain addresses will be used instead of paper contracts and bank accounts. If there is a dispute between the parties, the legal system will be available as a judge of last resort. If, for example, real estate is to be part of the contract, it will still be necessary to cooperate with the authorities. It is only a matter of time before the authorities learn to use modern technology and are willing to provide data via Oracles. It is likely that the first cadastral offices in developing countries will be established directly on the blockchain.

In the traditional world of finance, a bank or a lender has no right to force a borrower to pay. Only an entity authorized to do so under a given country‚Äôs social contract can do so. It is important to remember that blockchain is not here to resolve all sorts of disputes. If only digital assets are in play, the smart contract will be able to take them as collateral and use them to settle the outstanding debt. This can work entirely without a legal system and disputes can be resolved exactly as it is defined in smart contracts. When it is needed to punish the debtor or deprive him of physical assets, the intervention of the authorities will be necessary. Blockchain, like a conventional database, can only record transactions. Moreover, Cardano will be able to automatically execute smart contracts and do similar work that a bank would do. That is enough to disrupt the traditional banking sector.

People sometimes mistakenly operate with the idea that everything around blockchain technology must be completely anonymous and independent from the outside world. As we suggested above, without the interconnection of the physical and digital worlds, we are unable to create the stability we need for finance. Financial services need to work with liabilities and these may not be settled by the parties involved. Failures to settle liabilities can occur for many reasons. Either the failure of individuals or external causes may be involved. The legal system needs accurate information about the contract, and blockchain can provide this instantly, accurately, and without the possibility of the data being altered.

It is good to know the possibilities and limits of the tools we use. Many people have exaggerated expectations of blockchain. Replacing people in financial processes will be a gradual process and at the moment we don‚Äôt know how successful we will be. However, we are confident that changes and improvements are possible.

# Real Finance

The world of real finance exists, but it is mediated by traditional banking services or other intermediaries. It is therefore mainly available in developed countries, but even there it is not accessible to all people living in that country. The problem that decentralization solves is accessibility and openness. With Cardano, financial services will be available in developing countries and all the people of the world can be financially connected. Financial inclusion and meeting the ‚Äúbank the unbanked‚Äù narrative is the ultimate goal for the Cardano project. It must be stressed that at the moment people are not even financially connected. If you don‚Äôt have a bank account, you can hardly send money to your relative who lives in the next village. If people have access to the internet, they can instantly set up a Cardano wallet and essentially get their first financial account.

If people do not have their identity, they can hardly apply for a fair loan. They may have an unfair loan available in the local context. Real finance is about making sure that all people have the same or similar conditions for starting or running a business. Once people have their financial account and identity, they can get loans from people in Western countries. The transfer of finance from developed countries to developing countries can really help people a lot to change their living conditions. Banks from western countries and in a way the countries themselves have failed to build something like this because they were only looking at their economic interests. Cardano is a global infrastructure that will be simply everywhere under the condition the Internet is available.

It‚Äôs also about making people from Western countries see decentralized lending as a relevant option. Borrowing funds to buy a car is possible through a bank. Peer-to-Peer lending must be an adequate option and must be risk-free in terms of the functioning and reliability of the technology. The needs of people from developing countries are diametrically opposed to those of people from Western countries. People from Western countries have relatively stable currencies and can take out loans for their businesses. They can send money to their friends relatively easily, or pay for goods online. In developing countries, the fact that there will be some financial infrastructure will be a big change. People will have access to stable coins and thus be able to preserve their wealth against inflation. It is possible that many poor countries will issue their national currency on the blockchain as this will be the easiest option. Here again, Cardano can play an important role as a platform that can issue tokens. If not, integration and tokenization will allow people to use financial services on Cardano with their national currencies.

Being able to send value between each other cheaply and quickly can help developing countries significantly. The need to build and use financial services comes second. It is important to remember that first-generation cryptocurrencies have no chance of delivering what Cardano can provide. Sending volatile value between each other makes less economic sense than sending stable value, essentially money. As we have shown in the example above, financial services cannot be built at all with volatile cryptocurrencies. Sending ADA coins to each other may be fine at first. People will be happy with an option that maybe they didn‚Äôt have before. However, once the price fluctuations come, it stops being fun. People will start speculating on the price and that will necessarily hinder development in terms of mutual financial interaction. In addition, poor people tolerate these fluctuations worse than rich westerners. Westerners are more likely to look for financial opportunities to invest. People from developing countries need a stable financial infrastructure. These are two quite diametrically opposed things. Blockchain is definitely a technology that can deliver that infrastructure.

# A broader change

The world needs to make fundamental changes in the world of finance, and these will also affect the way people think. The narrative of endless growth must be replaced by a new narrative, and that is the narrative of long-term sustainability. Companies, for example, cannot just strive for profits that benefit a small group around management. Companies must prioritize the long-term sustainability of their business with regard to social welfare and the ecosystem. Societal pressures can force companies not to strive to make a huge profit and rather to align corporate interests with social and environmental concerns. This is, however, easy to say but harder to do. Anyway, it should be our common goal. Greater transparency of financial flows can facilitate this endeavor and blockchain can be helpful here too.

It is possible that in the new economy the tax structure will be completely changed. The economy should work in such a way that a business that does not work will disappear and be replaced by a business that works. Failure must be accepted as the normal state of affairs. The system must make it easier to start a new attempt at business.

It is necessary to think more about the redundancy and necessity of specific expenditures. This is better done in a local context. That is, in a decentralized way. It will probably be necessary to take most decision-making power away from central authorities and decentralize it more to smaller autonomous units. This can happen at the level of local governments and companies. If the interests of people and nature are prioritized in a local context, everything can work better as a whole.

Tokenization can completely change the way we look at project ownership and management. We are technologically ready for it, and voting will expand the possibilities even further. Now it‚Äôs just about redefining the social contract. Technology alone will not force change, but it can serve as a tool to enable change.

The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us that offices can communicate fully digitally when necessary. Offices have often operated analog, i.e. through paper documents and the need to physically visit the office. Greater digitization also goes hand in hand with decentralization.

Blockchain is a fundamental technology and will impact the way the world works. If blockchain succeeds, it can also be seen as a success for the concept of decentralization. It may have a greater impact on the structure of states than we can currently acknowledge. Technology can influence people‚Äôs thinking and it can be the cause of greater changes in society. At the moment, however, everything is open.

# Conclusion

The first generation of cryptocurrencies is not suited to the world of real finance because of the high volatility that they will probably never get rid of. Maybe decades from now, but even then it‚Äôs not certain that they‚Äôll be good sound money. Real finance requires much more than the ability to send value from Adam to Alice. The economy needs to work with debit and credit, and it can‚Äôt do that without long-term stability of money. Cardano will enable the necessary functionality to be built and can become a global financial operating system. For this, scalability is also essential. Blockchain is useful precisely in that transactions are irreversibly written and available to the whole world. This is where privacy can come into play, and it is just a matter of improving the technology. Once transactions are moved to second layers, the whole magic of blockchain as a financial infrastructure is lost. Blockchain is a ledger and the goal is to use it for exactly that purpose, accounting. Accounting and volatility are not compatible with each other. The cryptocurrency world is riddled with a lot of false expectations and narratives that make no economic sense. It is good to call a spade a spade and look for uses where it makes sense. Digital scarcity can be a good investment, but it is largely speculative. First-generation cryptocurrencies don‚Äôt scale well and they will never be a good ledger for the developing but also the western world. Cardano can handle the volatility and maybe it is one of the projects that is a great fit for accounting and transforming the world of finance. Both will find their uses. But let‚Äôs not mix these things together and have false expectations that one project can deliver everything we need.

Digital scarcity has made it possible to create a store of value and perhaps a new monetary system of sorts. However, the monetary system cannot function well without the fiscal system, and the latter is primarily about financial stabilization. For the economy to function well, we need to align a monetary and fiscal policy. Stability requires observation of the outside world and decision-making. Perhaps this can be automated to some extent. Fiscal policy needs to work with a unit of account that is also a unit of exchange. A global decentralized stable coin whose value would be derived by a basket of commodities and fiat currencies could be the next big thing in a world of decentralization. Cardano can deliver something like this, giving a whole new meaning to the public blockchain network, as it would enable decentralization at the fiscal policy level. A volatile asset will hardly bring stability to developing countries, or to countries whose currency has high inflation. This is a job for a stable asset. Cardano will allow people to create and use such an asset.",cryptocurrency
cardano,What forces will drive the price of the ADA?,"There is a widely spread narrative that cryptocurrencies are valuable mainly due to digital scarcity. Besides the scarcity, a technological aspect provides unique features that differentiate cryptocurrencies from gold. What is actually a more valuable feature, the scarcity or technological features? 

# A story about two horses

Economists have been studying the **relationship between value** **and price** since the 19th century, and so far they have basically agreed that they are two different things. We can determine the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency project fairly precisely. Just look at the market capitalization of a given network and we can immediately see the price of coins. The price represents the reality of the market, as it is the result of price negotiations between buyers and sellers. What is, however, the correlation between price and value?

Can we say that the more expensive the coins of a given project are, the more valuable the project is? So why do we see such high volatility in the market? Project prices rise and fall by tens of percentages in a short period of time. The real value of a project may be unknown for a long time, but it certainly cannot fluctuate by tens of percent. We can conclude by saying that the **current value of projects does not match the volatile market capitalization**.

Where the value of cryptocurrencies comes from is still a big unknown for many. Generally speaking, value can be defined as the ability to satisfy a need. Cryptocurrencies can be seen in part as expensive works of art, as people may have a need to own them. The **concept of scarcity or exclusivity** figures here. But we can also see blockchain technology as a global network that is able to transfer value from one end of the world to the other. Thus, a specific **utility or service** is at play. The utility of this property increases proportionally with the adoption rate. In the case of digital scarcity, **adoption can be very low**, but due to high demand, **coins can maintain their value**. A service that depends on **network interaction between users** is more dependent on the number of users, i.e. the **network effect**.

While **digital scarcity is a** **static and immutable property**, technological capabilities can continue to evolve and improve. Blockchain technologies have the ability to induce trust between participants who do not know and trust each other. This area will fully develop with the increased use of smart contracts and the need to perform more sophisticated value operations than simply transferring volatile native coins. So we have the promise of a better future in terms of technological progress. **Technological progress is a dynamic property**.

In general, therefore, cryptocurrencies can be seen as a profitable investment or a kind of speculation on future developments. People can bet on **two horses**. The first horse is represented by **digital scarcity** and the belief that more people will demand the coins of a given project. The second horse is represented by **technology** and the belief that more people will use the same decentralized project in their daily lives.

Every cryptocurrency project involves **both horses**. People may desire to own the coins of a given project for both of the reasons described. Cardano has capped the number of ADA coins at 45,000,000,000. The limited number creates scarcity. At the same time, the IOG team is working on many innovations to expand the project‚Äôs uses. More options offered and the usefulness of services have the potential to attract more users. Note that adoption is the key to success in both cases. However, as we said, in the first case it is not necessary for the project to have mass adoption and yet it can have a high market capitalization.

It may be that within a project people prefer digital scarcity and overlook the need for direct everyday use. It is also possible that people will use the project as a regular internet service on a daily basis. **Both horses can have high social and financial value**. As the adoption of projects increases, so will the price of coins. At the moment we don‚Äôt know which horse will be more in demand. We also don‚Äôt know if a single project can satisfy people‚Äôs needs for both digital scarcity and usability. Cardano is going more down the path of technological advancement and real network usability.

In terms of demand, the **two horses complement each other**, because in the case of cryptocurrency you cannot separate scarcity from technology. **Success will attract attention, which will attract demand for coins**. So it doesn‚Äôt matter whether the project is successful more because of scarcity or more because of technology.

# Narrative fallacies

Blockchain is a **foundational technology**. Many smart and influential people believe that blockchain technology will change the world. But the question is how exactly this will happen and what technology we will need to make it happen. There is a lot of room for speculation here. **Speculation can drive the market capitalization** of projects upwards in the nascent market. Speculations on price do not necessarily reflect the real fundamentals of the project and take into account the **long-term perspective**. Needs, trends, technology, and everything around us are constantly changing. What is valid today may not be valid tomorrow.

Foundational technologies often get caught in multiple **narrative fallacies**. To avoid that, it is necessary to take a long-term view and **accept changes** that can occur on the way. **Narratives are transitory** and they can be seasonal. Moreover, they can be transferred from one project to another. **Narratives are ephemeral, fundamentals are eternal**. It is imperative not to get caught up in narrative fallacies and focus on what is eternal.

What is eternal in the world of digital technologies? Technologies appear to get obsolete over time and be overcome by better one. Technology can be considered eternal in a sense of continuous improvement and innovations. For example, the internet allowed us to transfer information. This is an absolutely essential capability of the Internet that has been around since the beginning. We take advantage of that capability and we don‚Äôt care that every few years the technology evolves and we use different protocols.

Cryptocurrencies allow us to **create digital scarcity** and allow individuals to **exclusively own** and **freely dispose of value**. This is a new feature, but it is **not exclusively tied to one project**. The transfer of information over the internet can be implemented by many protocols. The same can be said of the creation of digital scarcity. Digital scarcity can come in many forms and flavors. It is a **narrative trap** to think that there will be only one single form of digital scarcity and no one in the world will prefer other forms.

Let‚Äôs look briefly at one example for all. Cryptocurrencies were born through the use of PoW consensus. PoW has been the standard for 10 years. However, it currently appears that the **huge consumption of electricity is not in line with people‚Äôs desire to reduce our carbon footprint** and be more conservative with energy in general. Many countries around the world are trying to switch to green energy and there is a risk that there will not be enough energy. Complicating matters is the **trend towards ESG investing**, which emphasizes keeping nature and social welfare in mind when seeking to profit from investments. Many people and investors who care about our planet will be more comfortable with the alternative PoS consensus that Cardano is coming up with. It would be very naive and selfish not to give people the chance to choose a project according to their personal preferences. One of the **widespread narrative fallacies** is that one and only one project can win and everything else will die. This false narrative assumes that the winner is already decided, that the current highest market capitalization forever predetermines the winner, or that technological advances will only happen within a single project. Any technological advances, which are also sought by the team behind the Cardano project, are doomed to fail. All this seems to us to be a trap into which it is not advisable to fall.

No one can forbid the emergence of new forms of digital scarcity. This is a basic principle of decentralization. Decentralization and freedom are very close to each other. Trying to enforce one version of a digital scarcity in an ultimate way is itself a form of centralization and a desire to seize power. People will always fight for power, and decentralization is not the solution to prevent this. **Wealth often fuels the desire for power**. If one form of digital scarcity were to take hold, the early adopters would become very wealthy and would naturally begin to fight for social power over others through their economic power. Diversity and the ability to weaken the power of the rich and influential is a powerful weapon of decentralization as a concept.

From a purely economic perspective, inflation can be fought through decentralization and digital scarcity. However, from a social perspective, it is a bit more complicated, as we would like to avoid the influence of rich people or institutions. **Decentralization aims to get rid of the middlemen.** It turns out that we need technological progress a bit more than decentralized monetary policy to achieve this. There will always be rich people in society and no technology can prevent that. What is **more valuable to us**, a new kind of digital scarcity, or the ability of technology to cut out the middleman? We would probably agree that both are interesting, but the latter will be more useful and valuable to us.

As we have already written, every project has both horses under the hood in some form. Gold is the ultimate and time-tested solution to fighting inflation. Cryptocurrencies in particular benefit from the fact that the **world is going digital** and we have learned to transmit value over the internet. Cryptocurrencies are **fighting the current financial world on a technological level**. From our point of view, this is more of a technological than an economic battle. The key to success is not only the ability to create immutable monetary policy but more importantly the ability to transmit value quickly and cheaply without an intermediary.

At the moment we **have only saddled the first horse**. However, it is still uncertain whether the current projects are **economically sustainable in the long term**. If we are talking about digital scarcity, we are talking about decades, if not hundreds of years. Projects that have a limited number of coins will one day survive mainly on network usage fees. We are still at the beginning of this and we **need to saddle up the other horse** as well.

If one cryptocurrency project massively succeeds, the concept of decentralization can be said to have succeeded. It is very likely that more projects will succeed as they will offer the same or similar functionality. It is unlikely that people would massively embrace one project and reject all others. **Each new attempt would be a new chance for a paradigm shift**. In the open-source digital world, you cannot create exclusive features at the technology level. It is possible to create a protocol that people adopt for its features. One project can **clone another‚Äôs technology**, but that may not be enough for success. What cannot be cloned is adoption and community. However, the rate of adoption is ephemeral. It is probably **impossible to create an eternal project, protocol, or money**. If it does, a strong and capable team will be the most important thing.

What can survive forever is **the concept of decentralization**, which will improve and evolve. Everything else will be an implementation detail.

# Price speculations, technology, and adoption

The **adoption of cryptocurrencies is very low** at the moment, so the market capitalization of projects is mainly driven by the **promise of higher market capitalization** in the future. For speculative coin holdings, the first horse is more important. That is a digital scarcity. Speculation is also helped by the fact that it works without the need for mass adoption. That may or may not happen. A few whales and large investors can keep the market cap high and wait to see how the situation unfolds in the future. Pure speculation on the future cannot keep the price stable. Without growing adoption, it‚Äôs hard to predict success. It could be said that growing adoption is a guarantee of future success.

As we said, the second horse is linked to the development of technology, but **technology must be adopted to be considered successful**. Technologies are still under development. It could be said that there is actually nearly nothing to adopt yet. A certain group of users wants to adopt working and proven services. It takes some **time for new users to build trust in new technologies**. It can take years. Here too we can talk about speculation on adoption. However, in this case, we need to be more patient and follow trends.

The price of ADA will be driven by **both the price speculation and the development of technologies**. In the case of Cardano, investors bet mainly on technology. This can be seen as a **bet on the team**, as technology development is always about people. Cardano is going as a **mission-critical** project that is built on academic research and mathematics. This is absolutely important as delivering a **global scalable distributed network** is one of the biggest challenges in the networking world. **Technology will be the major differentiator** among competitive projects. It is certainly not possible to say that all projects are in the same situation. While you can find thousands of cryptocurrency projects, literally only a few have a team as strong as IOG.

If you look at the **long-term evolution of the market capitalization curve** of major projects, you will see that they are rising. What is actually growing is mainly increasing speculation. There is big investor money coming into cryptocurrencies. **Don‚Äôt confuse the market capitalization of projects with adoption rates**. Adoption in terms of the number of users holding coins in their wallets is not growing that fast. If we were to count users who use a decentralized network **on a daily basis to solve a real problem**, we are only at the very beginning there. That is if we compare it to the adoption rate of the Internet. Participating cryptocurrency holders are **mostly speculators on price**. Large investors are just inflating the price, but they certainly don‚Äôt plan to use cryptocurrencies for payments or anything else.

Cardano may be one of the first projects to **break out of the speculative nature** of cryptocurrencies and offer the world a globally scalable network. A network on which some infrastructure can be built that takes advantage of the key features of a decentralized network. We need to reach a state where we have an **upward curve in technology adoption**. This metric can ultimately stabilize the market capitalization of projects as well. The market capitalization will reflect adoption and actual use. The price of coins will not necessarily be as volatile as it is today. The **growing success of the network will quite naturally drive demand for project coins**. Adoption will be gradual and will grow rather slowly. The price of coins could behave very similarly. It doesn‚Äôt make much sense for the price to rise several times in a short bull market, only to fall to the bottom for several years afterward. The **speculative nature will always be present**, but it will be more reflective of the real fundamentals of the project. Right now, speculation relies mainly on narratives. As we have discussed, narratives can be misleading and are transferable.

We certainly don‚Äôt mean to say that narrative alone cannot ensure success. That is of course possible. If people all over the world, or a significant portion of it, agree that the coin of a project will be the new money or store of value, it can happen. As for this scenario, we are rather skeptical because **people are greedy**. People do not wish wealth for others and look for ways to make themselves rich. The world of cryptocurrencies will always offer an alternative and a certain portion of people will take advantage of it. Rather than agreeing on one global solution, they will competitively choose other projects to root for. This will be done by small investors as well as large ones. **Adoption of cryptocurrencies is voluntary**, so it‚Äôs hardly ever going to happen that people in the same territory will unanimously adopt one project. This kind of adoption must be in cooperation with governments. Something like non-state money may be an interesting idea, but unrealistic in practice.

National governments and their central banks are closely linked. A **state can hardly function without monetary and fiscal policy**. When it comes to economics, most people on the planet do not have the necessary education to fully understand the issue of money. Many people like to rely on their governments, whether they trust them more or less.

# Financial sector disruption will be all about technology

Adoption of decentralized technologies will be **faster through technology** than speculation on price. Cardano will enable the use of decentralized technologies and insulate users from the volatile nature of native ADA coins. It will build services that people can start using with little risk of losing wealth. These services need to be cheap, fast, reliable, easy to understand, and, most importantly, deliver some user benefits. This is an achievable goal through the development of technology. Decentralization is a concept that is interesting for many reasons. Now, new applications must be considered and implemented.

The current financial and banking system is very outdated and rigid. It has hardly evolved for several long years. The transfer of money across national borders is slow, expensive, and unreliable. **Decentralization brings innovations** that, although they do not come directly from the financial world, have the potential to **disrupt the financial world**. Value transfer is only the beginning. Financial contracts between users and their automatic execution will be a logical extension that can bring a fresh wind to the stale waters of banking. The internet is here to connect people. Blockchain networks are inherently global, so creating a global bank is not an entirely unrealistic goal. In fact, it‚Äôs one of the narratives that has been with the cryptocurrency world since the beginning, ‚Äú**be your own bank**‚Äù. We can add others, like ‚Äú**bank the unbanked**‚Äù. These are nice narratives, but so far we have not been able to fully satisfy them.

To be able to provide banking services to those who need it most, we need to continue to build technology. There is a **real demand for micro-lending or an alternative to traditional bank services**, especially in developing countries. Cardano will be a network that can provide banking services to the two billion people who do not have them today. If it succeeds, it will be an important financial service that will also be very valuable.

Financial services are always about the interaction between users. Holding cryptocurrencies in your wallet and speculating on the price is an **individual selfish affair** that has little to do with real financial interaction. Again, we prefer to reiterate that this is not to say that digital scarcity cannot be a solution to printing money. It is just a question of whether it is sustainable in the long term, especially with the advent of projects that will offer innovation and many improvements. The moment a project manages to achieve a high network effect, it will also be successful and investors will take notice. No one can prevent the flow of money from one project to another. The future of projects is therefore very uncertain.

Our view is that **real usability will always be more valuable than speculation** on price. Moreover, only real usability at the network level can generate profit, which is critically important for the network. A **public network must generate profit** in order to reward the people who care about its security and decentralization. Keeping coins in the wallet does not generate profit, which may prove to be a problem. Cardano seems to have a big advantage over PoW projects, as PoS consensus is more easily sustainable in the long term. PoS can handle orders of magnitude more transactions in a given time than PoW. In addition to being fast at the first layer, transactions will also be cheap, ensuring inclusiveness and availability of services.

Usability will grow with innovation. At this stage of cryptocurrency adoption, innovation must be seen as an integral part of projects. The Cardano team is definitely going down this path as they see this as the future. Second layers can play a key role in adoption, but so can other features. The market has to choose what it wants. Nothing is certain at the moment. Rather, it looks like the big **investors are starting to diversify and asking for real usability**. They are no longer satisfied with just narratives and speculation on price. Investors want to see quality transaction networks, smart contracts, and other services. But most of all, we need adoption. Without further adoption of cryptocurrencies, we won‚Äôt know what we want. The current narratives may be false and misleading. We see the future in increased adoption that will influence the evolution of technology.

# Conclusion

The price of coins on the open market is determined by supply and demand. Creating a limited supply of coins is not a problem in the digital world. So the question is what will increase demand. Demand can definitely be influenced by the success of projects at the adoption level. We believe that the network effect will play a significantly higher role than speculative coin holding in the wallet. Cardano enables coin staking. This is a great advantage as coin holders directly receive a proportionate share of the fees collected. This kind of passive income is very interesting from a speculation point of view. In addition, the coins are linked to the governance of the project. Thus, the coin holders have decision-making rights.

It doesn‚Äôt matter which horse you bet on. Either way, betting against technology is very tricky. No one is able to predict what technology will be developed and what it will bring us. So betting on the team may seem like a good choice. Success will ultimately be measured by the social and financial impact of the technology. This is not easy to predict in advance.",cryptocurrency

# The network effect is the key to success

Would it be an email service useful if only you could use it and nobody else had no idea what that is? Definitely not and you would not probably care much about it as well. If you could write an email to your friends and family then the utility of the service would be significantly better. What if you could write to whomever you wish? Then the email service would become one of the most important services in the world. As you probably know, it happened. To exchange information quickly and cheaply on longer distances is a commonality nowadays but it was a revolution a few decades ago. People started to use electronic email communication and basically left the traditional mailing services that became slow, unreliable, and expensive.

Is email the predominant service today? Hard to say. The email service has a lot of competitors like chat services or social networks. Some people are daily on Facebook or Twitter but check their inbox once a week. It can be faster to send a direct message via a messenger than to send an email. People can choose from many different services based on their preferences. There is no ultimate winner. Evolution is a mother of progress. There will probably never be a single winner for a longer period of time.

Once we mastered sending information via many different protocols and added security features to ensure private communication between counterparties, we were able to transfer value in a digital manner as well. Money was digitized, or in the jargon of cryptocurrencies, tokenized. We do not need to use physical banknotes or coins. We are able to pay electronically. Hence, we can exchange digital value for physical goods. We have digitized not only money but many other assets. You can own gold digitally. In the case you trust a third party you can own and spend gold or Tesla shares via the Internet.

Adoption of technologies takes time. Users must trust new technology and they need to learn how to use it. Sometimes, there are some economical barriers. The best technology is such that it is for free and easy to use. A few early adopters start using technology and when it shows up that it is useful and beneficial others gradually join the group of users.

The network effect is a phenomenon whereby the increasing number of users has a direct impact on the growth and the utility of the service or product. When the network effect grows then also the financial and social value grows. A given user derives more value from service as other users join the same network. Especially in the case of a network aimed at communication between participants, every new user increases the value of the network for all others.

Cardano is a distributed network that provides decentralized services to users. Likewise to email service, the value of blockchain services will grow with the number of users. For example, you can wish to send ADA to your neighbor but it is possible only in the case that he or she has installed a Cardano wallet and is able to provide you with a Cardano address for the deposit.

The majority of people in the developed countries have a bank account. You can be nearly sure that your neighbor has one and you can send him fiat money. At the moment, the adoption of cryptocurrencies, in general, is very low. It can take a decade then at least half of the population will have installed a cryptocurrency wallet. It can be said that the network effect of Cardano and all other major networks is low. It is ok. Blockchain technology must mature similarly to many internet services that also needed to mature before mass adoption. The ultimate goal is to increase the network effect of Cardano.

# Scalability is needed to increase the network effect

The majority of users perceive services as a set of qualities that might be useful for them. The very basic service of blockchain technology is a Peer-to-Peer transactional network. Users are able to exchange value in a decentralized way. As we said, the utility of the service will grow with the number of entities that are able to accept the value. The network effect is important but it is not the only metric that matters when it comes to adoption. The quality of service is also important.

When too many people start using a service, congestion of the network can occur. Having too many users on the same network service can slow the speed of the network and decrease the benefit for users. The adoption depends primarily on the network effect and the network effect depends on the scalability of the network. It must be ensured that capacity can be increased sufficiently to accommodate all users. In the case of a decentralized network, it is a challenge. The current major blockchain networks face scalability issues. Transaction settlements are not only slow but users have to pay a lot for them. This is not definitely a service that would be ready for mass adoption.

Cardano, like many other blockchain projects, is naturally a global network. A public blockchain is not like a local service for a limited number of users. It is a global network where literally everyone on the planet can become a user. The population of our planet is nearly 8 billion. If only 1% of the population wanted to use Cardano for making at least 1 transaction a day then the network would have to process 80 million transactions every day. To serve 1% of the population, Cardano would need to process approximately 1000 transactions per second. The problem is that 1% of the population is a very low number of users. The network effect would be also low and thus, also the value of the network. It is needed to realize that 80 million is a lot of people if they all were in one place. The adopters of cryptocurrencies are scattered everywhere on the planet. Hence, if the adoption of cryptocurrencies in your country is 1% then only 1 person from 100 will be probably willing to accept ADA. 20% adoption in one country or city would start to be interesting from the network effect point of view. However, it would mean that Cardano would have to process approximately 20,000 transactions per second. It is likely that once the adoption reaches 16%, it will continue to grow since the early majority is the next group on the adoption curve. This group makes 34% of the population. The higher adoption will be beneficial for the network effect but it will also make high demands on the qualities of the blockchain networks.

It is obvious that we will need to develop second-layer solutions to handle such a big amount of transactions. Hydra is the second layer solution for Cardano. Hydra will be able to take over not only transactions but also the execution of smart contracts. Teams of every major blockchain network build something similar. It must be noted that second layers will never be the ultimate scalability solution. The scalability of the first layers must be also high as it is the major settlement layer and the highest source of truth.

Currently, we hold cryptocurrencies mostly for trading and speculations and we use centralized services. The mission of Cardano is to start using blockchain for real economic activities. That is why scalability is such an important topic. Building a network that is global from the beginning is challenging since it is hard to estimate the network traffic and it is technologically difficult to design the network in a way that it can handle it. Network effect and scalability will go hand in hand. If we really want to send Peer-to-Peer transactions to our neighbors, scalability is the key. In other words, a given service that runs upon a global network must succeed in a local context.

It means that the adoption rate might not be the same globally in given countries or geographical regions. For example, Cardano can massively succeed in one country in Africa for a locally specific reason and the adoption can be let‚Äôs say 50%. In other countries, it can be 5%. A nice example of that is the adoption of Cardano in Ethiopia. The government decided to adopt Cardano to improve the education sector. It is probably just the beginning. If the project succeeds then it is highly probable that surrounding countries will naturally adopt the same network. The Cardano infrastructure is available everywhere so adoption can be relatively fast. Once services work in one country it will be easy to use the same in other countries. It is the advantage of a global network.

Local economic activities can benefit from a global network that is unstoppable and the ledger is immutable. The utility of that can differ in a given local context and developing countries will probably be the early adopters. Cardano can be a trusted entity for many local contexts basically everywhere. As a benefit, all local activities are naturally available around the planet. For example, if you have a decentralized ID (DID) created via Atala PRISM, you will have the ID everywhere in the world. The same money. You can have your country currency in a wallet and quickly swap it for other currency that you need when you travel.

Among other topics, scalability is topic number one regarding adoption. New users will be judging the speed and price of transactions. The second layer solutions will probably be the major players when it comes to increasing the network effect. Overall, users will judge the quality of services and not the level of security or decentralization. These qualities are too abstract and hard to understand for the majority of users. Moreover, they take them for granted. End-users will want to easily install wallets and reliably consume services.

# More services mean more utility

The transaction service with native tokens is not the only service that blockchain can offer. At least, in the case of Cardano, you can expect much more. Besides ADA coins, users can issue and transact with other tokens. It opens the door for many other services and utilities.

Issuing tokens that are globally available and users can really own them similarly as money in their wallets is a powerful tool. We have never had something similar before since client-server architecture is not able to let you really own coins and tokens. We have experienced the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) craze around 2017. After that, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications appeared and now we are in the middle of Non-Fungible Token (NFT) mania. All these concepts are sound. Despite many scams that could be expected in a non-regulated environment, we can perceive it as a success.

Teams were able to collect funds for their ICO projects on a global level. We can name a few problems with the first wave of ICO. Teams bore no accountability for the delivery of promised projects and received the whole funds right away from the collection. Moreover, the team could collect money anonymously. In some cases, it was not necessary to reveal real identity. For the next wave, we will have a solution. Collected funds will stay locked in a smart contract and people will be able to vote about releasing a part of it for the next time period. When the majority of investors will not be satisfied with the results they can get the rest of the fund back. It will be easy to write a more complex smart contract and allow investors to vote on the Cardano platform. Moreover, Atala PRISM can be used to work with verified identities of the team members. It can be expected that the next wave of ICO, or other similar collective funding, will be more trusty, reliable, and protect investors. If the industry faces regulations, it is more probable that this form of ICO will satisfy the requirements.

The DeFi sector has similar problems as ICO. Anonymous individuals or teams can issue functionality via smart contracts with no accountability. The functionality of services is often buggy since it is relatively difficult to write secure and reliable smart contracts. Moreover, many teams test the application right in the production. Hence, many users lost a lot of money. In addition, the current DeFi platforms are clogged and are not able to handle a big amount of transactions. Fees are too high for ordinary users to play with applications. As a result, trust in DeFi application has not crossed the cryptocurrency industry. Cardano has a solution for DeFi as well. Plutus allows developers to write much more reliable smart contracts and test them before going live. Cardano already has Proof-of-Stake consensus and is more scalable than the current major platforms. Once Hydra is rolled out it will probably take over a significant part of transactions and execution of smart contracts.

The NFT industry is booming but it is questionable whether it is successful or not. Issuers mostly create digital images and link them with tokens. They then sell the tokens that represent the images. Buyers become owners of tokens but are they really owners of the images? Owners can use the images in their profiles or as wallpapers. If people download an image they can use it without a token. The NFT industry needs some improvements. For now, it is quite ok that people play with NFT and learn how to use the infrastructure and wallets.

In our view, the NFT industry needs to be bonded with the legal system to protect owners and ensure copyrights. Then, it will have the sense to have a token that will represent physical arts, or buy digital arts or items. In the digital world, NFT needs some additional infrastructure that will allow the consumption of digital art. For example, we can imagine a platform that allows users to play a song or video for a small payment. The platform will automatically send all payments to owners of tokens that represent digital art. An author of a song, Alice, can tokenize it. Alice will also be the first owner of the token and offer the song via a decentralized platform. Users will pay for listening to the song and Alice will receive payments. When Alice sells the tokens to Bob, Bob will receive the payments. Alice can sell only half of the token. Thus, Alice and Bob will receive half of the payments.

People can steal the song and replay it over and over for free. It usually happens nowadays and blockchain is not a solution for stealing digital arts. Some people are willing to pay authors and some not. The willingness can differ from country to country. Anyway, the legal system should prevent offering the song on other pirate platforms. What blockchain can do, is the decentralization of the service and avoid the middleman that would own the platform and take profit from authors and listeners. In theory, if the platform would be for free, then authors could receive 100% of payments. In reality, the authors of the platform will probably charge minor profits for usage. However, it can be cheaper than it usually is. Let‚Äôs add that it is generally hard to compete with existing services but it is another story. We just wanted to predict how the NFT industry could look like in the future.

What is important for our article, all mentioned sectors succeeded regarding network effect. It can be expected that these sectors will be transformed and they have the potential to be even more successful in the future. In every case, they are not going to disappear. It should be said that the adoption of cryptocurrencies is in general very low so many ideas and services failed not because they are conceptually bad but because they were not adopted or used by a sufficient number of users. Teams tried to offer brand new decentralized services but sectors lacked demand.

We can observe that for the very basic service of cryptocurrencies. As we said, it is the payment. Let‚Äôs quietly assume that the volatility of cryptocurrencies is not a problem. If a local merchant accepts payment by cryptocurrencies then probably not more than 1% of customers will use it. You can imagine how difficult it is for a team to push through other services. With a higher adoption and awareness about cryptocurrencies and other services, the number of users will also naturally rise. It will go hand in hand with maturing of technology.

They are services for which a global context is good. For example, offering a song globally via a decentralized platform is a good idea and it does not matter that service is used mostly by teenagers that are scattered around the world. There are other services, for which a local context with an overlap to a global context is important. Ethiopia decided to create identities of students via Cardano and Atala PRISM. One day, the majority of Ethiopians can have such an identity. They will use it in the local context, in Ethiopia, but they can travel and use their digital ID (DID) elsewhere in the world. They can use the identity for other services that Cardano can offer. Citizens can collectively fund a repair of a church and use real identities. Farmers can offer their products on a global market and buyers from westerns countries can verify that they are real farmers. The loan business can work without excessive collateral and it will be possible to fund the business of Ethiopians from western countries. Do not forget the payment industry. If a local currency was issued on Cardano as well then all payments in Ethiopia would go through blockchain and Hydra.

# Building and replacement of the old infrastructure

We need more pieces of Lego to build other blockchain services. Every new piece will bring new utility and thus also higher security and reliability. Regulations and involvement of the legal systems within the local contexts will also help. The financial nature of cryptocurrencies and social context cannot be separated. Thus, it is not possible to separate for example payments and the legal system.

Imagine the following scenario. Alice promises to do some physical work once Bob pays in advance. What should Bob do when he has paid and Alice refuses to do the work? The blockchain transaction is settled and it is correct from the digital point of view. What about the social context? Only the legal system can probably remedy the situation in the case Alice does not care about her reputation and Bob does not want to fight with her.

Notice that the legal system would need to resolve the situation regardless of whether the traditional bank system or blockchain is used. Alice will have to do the promised work or send money back to Bob. In general, all services built on blockchain will work better when the digital and social contexts will be more interconnected. It is often argued that for many services a database would be a better option. That can be true. However, if we want to build decentralized services we need to replicate the current services. Let‚Äôs do not suppose that we can fully avoid the social context in the decentralized world. Smart contracts are able to prevent some frauds in the digital world but it is probably impossible when the physical world is involved.

Similar issues will occur regardless of whether a database or blockchain is used. We should as to whether blockchain can bring us some benefits over a database. If yes then it is a comparable or better solution. It is not a worse solution. Cardano uses PoS and will have Hydra in order to provide similar services like a database. It does not mean that user data will be in the blockchain. Blockchain will always be only a layer ensuring immutability and serving as a base layer for additional services. We will benefit from every piece of human work that can be reliably automated in order to avoid censorship, corruption, and fraud. Cardano allows us to build a decentralized infrastructure exactly for that. In places where corruption and frauds are common, the usage of Cardano is a good idea since there is no need to use any local infrastructure that can be easily compromised. As we said, even if it is not 100% reliable and individuals can misuse their position, it can be better than using a database. For example, all records will be immutably protected by the blockchain so when a crime has been committed the proof cannot be deleted. Even if the digital record is not correct the legal system can act. Even the representatives of the legal system cannot change or delete the record.

The first PoW networks are slow and as it is often said, expensive. That is true but let‚Äôs do not forget that technology can always be improved. People are actually good at pushing the limits and innovating technologies. More than 10 years have passed since the launch of Bitcoin. In the next decade, the crypto industry will be completely different.

# It is all about economic activities

It is a paradox that holding cryptocurrencies in a wallet and waiting for the possible future rise of the price is the most spread usage of them. The narrative ‚Äúhodling is using‚Äù is used to excuse the fact that nobody is willing to use cryptocurrencies for real economic activities.

Cryptocurrencies are treated as digital gold. When we have a look at the real-world analogy, we will find that only around 12% of people in the USA hold gold. Gold is only a subset of the financial system. Is a part that is useful only for rich people. The majority of people are part of the financial systems without the need to own gold. Real economic activities are independent of the existence of gold. On the other hand, money, which is used on a daily basis, is a necessity.

Do you know why the U.S. left the gold standard? The government was not able to resolve the economic crisis in 1933. Faced with mounting unemployment and spiraling deflation, the U.S. government found it could do little to stimulate the economy. To deter people from cashing in deposits and depleting the gold supply, the U.S. and other governments had to keep interest rates high, but that made it too expensive for people and businesses to borrow. So in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt cut the dollar‚Äôs ties with gold, allowing the government to pump money into the economy and lower interest rates. Notice that the U.S. is arguably one of the most developed and democratic countries in the world and the government does not directly need a scarce resource.

Our society and the financial markets are based on transactions and contractual agreements among people, companies, banks, states, etc. The exchange of value is a very important part of society. One is able to produce something that the other needs and is willing to pay for it. That is a very basic pillar of the economy. Money became the means of payment. Money is exchanged for things that have similar value. There might be more complex exchanges of value between two parties that require making a contract. A contract is a record with the agreement details and conditions. Transactions and contracts are drivers of the economy and society.

Now, let‚Äôs ask a question. Have we already replicated the financial system? Definitely not. We suppose we have replicated gold and we have a digital form of it. Really? At least a few percent of people on the planet think so. The usual narrative is that once a higher number of people adopt volatile cryptocurrencies the price will stabilize and we will use them more often for payments. That is why we just hold them and wait for what is going to happen next.

As we have explained above, it is difficult to achieve a higher network effect in the global context. A globally famous company can accept cryptocurrencies as a payment method but the majority of people will still use fiat money. Probably even the cryptocurrency holders.

Stable coins and all tokens that are issued are very important since people learn how to use wallets and transact. People might be willing to experiment but not everyone is willing to face volatility. Issuing fun tokens that are for free and you can send them to your friends nearly for free is actually a big thing for further adoption. Cardano will allow users to pay fees directly in the tokens that are being sent. Users will not need to own ADA coins to use tokens.

Once we remove the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies people can use coins and tokens for real economic activities. Only a part of the population is interested in speculation. The majority of us do not care much about it or do not understand the topic well. This group of people cannot be omitted from the decentralized economy. Stable coins solve the issue nicely. In our view, further adoption of cryptocurrencies and decentralized services will depend on stable coins. It does not depend on issuers of stable coins. They will be many of them and the key is to ensure seamless interoperability among platforms. More complex decentralized services will be adopted once the speculative aspect will be completely removed.

Let‚Äôs ask a tricky question. Can decentralized services be used with centrally issued or controlled digital currencies? Why not. Some people might think that we need 100% decentralized money to build a decentralized economy. Well, but what if we are not able to ensure the stability of fully decentralized cryptocurrencies? Decentralization is about the ability to avoid middlemen. The issue is that when regular people should decide between decentralization and stability they will choose stability. Hence, we need to strive for both, services that will satisfy requirements for stability and decentralization. Using Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) in decentralized financial services is also a significant step towards decentralization. In the ideal case, it would be great if we could create algorithmic stable coins that would be independent of a central issuer. We believe that we will be able to do so one day.

Real economic activities require stability and as time has shown the volatility prevents real usage of decentralized services including payment. We have already found the solution and once the blockchain technology matures a new wave of adopters will join the sector. Cardano will probably be one of the platforms that will be ready for mass adoption. There are two important reasons to think so. The technological advancement and strong community.

Moreover, Cardano is the first project that has been adopted on a national level. Ethiopia is the first adopter and we will probably see others. As we have explained in the article, adoption in the local context is also very important. It is naive to think that the whole planet will switch from traditional services to decentralized ones in one moment. It will happen somehow gradually. To see one country that reliably uses blockchain in real sectors of the economy is a necessary prerequisite for further adoption. Let‚Äôs hope that Cardano succeeds in Ethiopia and will provide the first proof that it is possible. Without that, do not expect that the whole planet will use cryptocurrencies.

# Conclusion

Currently, we use cryptocurrencies mostly for trading and speculations. Some people use centralized services for holding cryptocurrencies. The mission of Cardano is to let people use blockchain technologies for real economic activities. It is a challenge from the technological and adoption points of view. Like it or not, the further adoption of blockchain technologies needs innovations. It is not only the second layer solution but many other parts of the infrastructure. In the article, we have talked about ICO, DeFi, and NFT sectors. We expect that we will see other new sectors. Cardano has added another piece of Lego. It is Atala PRISM which is the identity management solution. It is another important piece of infrastructure that will interconnect the digital and physical worlds. The blockchain has big potential and we believe that Cardano will push the adoption one level up.",cryptocurrency
cardano,Building a new economy on CardanoBuilding a new economy on Cardano,"Cryptocurrency fans believe that blockchain has the potential to disrupt banks and create a new form of sound money. There is a close relationship between national currencies and governments. The reality is that it is not possible to replace national currencies without having technologies that will substitute the functionalities of governments or help to build a new form of government. Let‚Äôs dive into the topic.

# National currencies and tools for keeping their stability

A national currency is a legal tender issued by a country‚Äôs central bank or monetary authority. National authorities guarantee the acceptance of the currency as a means of exchange. Thus, national currencies are also used as official units of accounts. Currencies are used for purchasing goods and services and it is also used for the collection of taxes. Trust to currencies is backed by the faith and credit of people in governments. Trust is not a constant and it can change over time. Trust in currencies or governments can decrease during domestic economic turbulences and global financial crises. Central monetary banks and governments try to achieve monetary stability and overcome financial crises. It is one of the most important goals of national authorities. Trust is kept when authorities succeed. If they are not then people might begin to revolt.

A nation‚Äôs economic activity is usually influenced by two major tools. It is monetary policy and fiscal policy. Monetary policy and fiscal policy are typical tools that are used to influence a nation‚Äôs economy. The focus of the monetary policy is interest rates and the total supply of money in circulation. It is usually the responsibility of the central banks to drive monetary policy. Fiscal policy is a tool that is used by governments to collect taxes and spending management.

Monetary policy is a tool that can stimulate an economy. Individuals and businesses can be either incentivized to borrow and spend money or the spending can be restricted what leads to saving money. Monetary policy can either spur the economy or limit its growth. By that, it is possible to drive the level of inflation.

The Fiscal policy addresses taxation and government spending. Governments target the taxation level, the total level of spending, and the composition of spending. It is done via a legislation process. A government needs to collect taxes to be able to effectively spend. The collection of taxes pulls money out of the economy. It can slow business activity when taxes are too high. Governments might also lower taxes or offer tax rebates in an effort to encourage economic growth. Another fiscal tool of governments for spurring economic activity is stimulus spending. Governments can decide which sectors need to be stimulated to support economic growth. If there is not enough money for spending, it is necessary to borrow money by issuing debt securities. This is referred to as deficit spending. It is expected that debts will be paid off later.

The fiscal policy usually changes relatively often. Governments decide about tax policy and spending. Specific communities, businesses, industries, investments, and commodities are targeted by governments to either favor or discourage economic activity. It is necessary to mention that not only economic considerations are taken into account when changes in fiscal policy are made. Governments have to consider long-term prosperity, peace, healths, science, security, political situation, environmental issues, and many other aspects that touch the daily lives of people.

There are always people that are accountable for monetary and fiscal policy. Hence, their decisions are hotly debated by other people.

# Monetary and fiscal policies in the context of cryptocurrencies

In the context of cryptocurrencies, national currencies are often criticized for their worse abilities regarding usage as a store of value. National currencies are nearly always inflationary. It means that they lose value over time and the level of degradation differs from currency to currency. Inflation does not matter so much from the short-term perspective if it is predictable and moderate. However, it is not the case in some nations and then it can be a real problem as people are not able to save money to be well prepared for the future.

The monetary policy of cryptocurrencies is fixed and rigid. In most cases, it is set in the beginning and it is expected that it will never change. The majority of cryptocurrencies have set the maximum number of coins that are gradually released by the protocol. Alternatively, fixed never-ending inflation of coins is set. As a result, cryptocurrencies are generally very volatile. There is no authority that would be responsible for the stabilization of the price. The price is influenced only by supply and demand on the market. This property can be good for the creation of scarce resources. The high demand for a scarce resource can keep the value of coins at a high level in the long term. As a store of value, cryptocurrencies can be very good. However, they are bad as means of exchange or units of account.

The crux of decentralization is about being independent of the decisions that would be made by individuals or authorities. Nobody can centrally influence the monetary policy of cryptocurrencies. Trust in currencies, in the context of means of exchange and units of account, is related to price stability. The degree of trust in fiat currencies is high, in comparison with cryptocurrencies. Notice that people trust fiat currencies despite their centralization and the authorities that make decisions. It could be even said that people might not fully trust the authorities but they still trust national currencies. Trust in currencies is related to price stability since it allows people to pay for goods, invest, save money, etc. When inflation is low and compensated in a way that people feel relatively wealthy then it can be considered a stable economic environment.

Price stability or the economy as a whole is not the only factor that matters. The happiness of people cannot be measured only economically but it is mostly the economy that can ensure happiness in a given location. In other words, people expect that they are able to find a job, buy high-quality food, are able to send kids to a good school, live in beautiful green cities with developed infrastructures. It must be true not only for you but also for your neighbors. Not only for the city you live in but also for other cities nearby. When it is not like that you can expect troubles. To ensure the happiness of people or at least to secure the best possible conditions, there must be a mechanism that takes care of all that. On the national level, we get back to fiscal policy. Tax collection and wise spending have been for long years the best solution on how to establish stable environments and relatively happy populations.

So far, we have talked only about the rigid monetary policy in the context of cryptocurrencies. When we insist on full decentralization of cryptocurrencies regarding monetary policy, we are able to create only a rigid version of that. Moreover, there is nothing like fiscal policy in the world of cryptocurrencies. At the moment, cryptocurrencies are not able to respond to economic turbulences, crises, natural disasters, or even wars. In addition, there is no way on how to spur the economy. The reasons are obvious. The current generation of cryptocurrencies is not designed to solve these issues. No nation or state has adopted cryptocurrencies to use them to solve these types of issues.

Decentralization basically means that only rigid rules of the protocols are followed and the decisions of individuals are not taken into account. It is not even expected. Protocols know nothing about the economical situation of people, politics, or the environment. Protocols have no way how to observe our world and thus they do have not any opinions. Protocols cannot make any decision that would help to resolve a potential problem. The blind following of protocol rules is only beneficial for the creation of a digital scarce resource. It is questionable whether it is a good attribute for monetary policy. It is probably a bad attribute for fiscal policy.

Currently, making monetary and fiscal decisions on the national level is mostly related to a certain level of centralization. Authorities are accountable for making observations, evaluating them, and making appropriate decisions. We have two worlds that stand against each other. The centralized world of fiat currencies and a new world of cryptocurrencies. These two worlds are going to meet. It is a question of whether it will be positive or negative.

Would it be possible to connect cryptocurrencies with national monetary and fiscal policies? Could we technologically substitute the role of authorities or make their decisions more decentralized? Let‚Äôs go to discuss that.

# Can blockchain be used for building a new financial system?

Economists debate for years about the current financial system and they do not know whether it is the best possible one. Fiscal policy often faces criticism for the need to work with debt and the inability to pay it off. It is not the goal of this article to resolve the tough questions to which economists are not able to answer. We do not want to debate much about the current situation. We will focus more on the future.

People can have different opinions on the national monetary and fiscal policies but one thing is certain. The scope of the functionalities behind it is bigger than what the rigid monetary policy of cryptocurrencies can do. The very first question would be whether we really need it. Do we need a complex fiscal policy and could it be sufficient to have only the rigid monetary policy that cryptocurrencies can offer? Could we exist without the collection of taxes or making reserves for worse times? The answer is no. It is natural that bad times occur from time to time and we need to be prepared for that.

Cryptocurrencies lack three critical functions that stable monetary regimes are expected to fulfill: protection against the risk of structural deflation, the ability to respond flexibly to temporary shocks to money demand and thus smooth the business cycle, and the ability to function as a lender of last resort.

It would be impossible to overcome troubles of any sort on the national level without the ability to either have sufficient reserve or issue new coins. Every reserve can be depleted one day so what should be done in cases that troubles sustain? When the fiscal policy fails then the monetary policy could save the situation. Debt could also be a solution but it depends on the willingness of lenders to provide loans. It seems that the ability to work with debts is also an important requirement of the real economy.

Notice that it is not only about surviving turbulent times. People, as individuals, use public services and infrastructure. It is financed collectively. Authorities are responsible for the collection of taxes to have finance for these services. It is possible to change the financial infrastructure but this type of mechanism must be preserved.

How could that all work in the blockchain world? To create a reserve, there must be some smart mechanism that will regularly collect money from people based on defined rules. We call it taxation in the fiscal policy. Alternatively, there could be some protocol mechanism that would subtract a given amount of coins from all addresses in the case of urgent need or regularly. However, it would be the same as issuing new coins. Issuing coins is actually a better solution. The only question is who would be responsible for making decisions related to changes in monetary policy or in the protocol rules. Could it be developer teams with cooperation with miners or stakeholders? It would not be the best possible solution from the point of trust. People can trust the system only if they agree with the rules and feel they can participate in decisions.

To whom should we actually trust when we start using blockchain technologies? Does it mean that there will be no central authority? Then how could we survive turbulent times or ensure the prosperity of a given region? Using blockchain technologies definitely does not mean that we can get rid of the ability to make critical decisions. A serious social or natural problem can occur and only a sufficient amount of money can be a remedy. Nowadays, our world rotates around money in all aspects of our lives. It is smarter to accept moderate inflation than have riots on the streets. The question remains. Who should make decisions and how in the world where blockchain will become the financial backbone?

Another tough question appeared. It is a free decision of individuals to join or leave a global decentralized network. You might be a fan of cryptocurrencies but what about your neighbors? Your neighbors might either like different blockchain projects than you or do not like them at all. They can prefer fiat currency. When there is a need to have a flexible monetary and fiscal policy in a given location, people are expected to use one currency. It does not matter much whether it is fiat currency or cryptocurrency. However, it is rather more about a set of rules than only about the currency. People must agree with rules and they must be followed by everybody in a given location. It can never work in a way that people using fiat currency will be obliged to pay taxes and cryptocurrency users not. People living in a given area are members of the community and they have the responsibility not only for their lives but also for the prosperity of the community and location.

In our view, people can be allowed to use different currencies but they need to follow the same rules on the national level. It can be said that rules are more important than currency. In the current setup, governments dictate rules and are responsible for fiscal policy. The issue is that cryptocurrencies and their monetary policies are decentralized and global while we have many domestic fiscal policies that are centralized. Is it possible to merge these two worlds together?

We presented a few tough questions regarding the usage of blockchain on the national level. A nation is a large group of people who inhabit a specific territory and are connected by history, culture, or another commonality. We provided a few reasons why we think that nations need some sort of set of rules for monetary and fiscal policies. There are close relations between a nation, economy, and government. The nation definitely needs to have a working economy. It is hard to achieve that without government. It is a question how a modern government should or could look like.

The adoption of cryptocurrencies on the national level is inevitably related to governments. Governments use fiat currencies mainly for taxation reasons since it is a part of fiscal policy. Moreover, central banks use the same currency as the government to manage the monetary policy. In both cases, it is about the control that central banks and governments have on fiat currencies. Government must ensure that taxes are collected and it is hard to achieve that with cryptocurrencies that are out of its control.

Having control is about making decisions. We are getting back to the problem we faced in the whole section. Which rules should be decentralized and out of control and which one should be controlled? Who or what should have the control and how to make collective decisions?

# How to build a more decentralized economy

It seems that the rigid monetary policy of cryptocurrencies is not capable of substituting the current national monetary and fiscal policies. Luckily, Cardano is designed to become a global social and financial operating system. Thus, appropriate capabilities will be available to substitute or complement necessary functionalities of national policies. The key features of Cardano will be the ability to issue tokens, use smart contracts, work with real identities of people, and have an embedded voting system. In the future, abilities to use artificial intelligence could also be handy. Let‚Äôs explore what we could do with that.

Cardano has limited inflation risk because the supply of ADA coins is limited. As we said, a limited number of coins is great for the creation of a scarce resource but it does not mean that it is a good attribute for the national monetary policy. ADA coins could be used as collateral to a currency in which price or issuance would be algorithmically adjusted. It would be possible to create something like algorithmically driven central banking. In the distant future, the issuance rules of coins could be driven by artificial intelligence.

Some people often argue that the volatility of cryptocurrencies will stabilize in the future. Even if that could happen the problem is that we need to create a currency that would work fine in a domestic context. The monetary policy of ADA will probably never change. If it changes then it will be a decision that will be made in the global context. All stakeholders would be affected by the change. A domestic community could propose a change in the monetary policy of Cardano to resolve domestic difficulties but the issue is that stakeholders are spread around the world and they would not probably agree with the change. Domestic needs at a given time can be different from the global context. It seems that it is smart to issue tokens on Cardano that will be used locally as currency. Thus, domestic changes in monetary policy do not influence the global monetary policy of Cardano. It will be possible to resolve domestic difficulties and ADA will remain a scarce resource.

The domestic economy needs to have its own currency to be ensured that monetary and fiscal policy is effective and able to solve domestic problems. Moreover, a nation is considered autonomous when it has the currency under its own control. Having one currency for the whole world seems to be an impossible goal at least at the moment in the context of nations. Imagine that the wealth of a nation would be determined by the amount of possession of a global currency. If it was Bitcoin then a few whales would be richer than many nations. Nations need to keep their sovereignty and the right to issue their own currency is one of the symbols of sovereignty.

The current dollarization in some developing economies provides an analogy. When a large part of the domestic financial system operates with a foreign currency, monetary policy for the domestic currency becomes disconnected from the domestic economy. Imagine that there is a hyper-inflation and people start using dollars instead of the domestic currency. People benefit from a more stable currency in the short term but in the long term, the nation can collapse. The reason is that fiscal policy cannot work well when monetary policy does not work. Government cannot fund public services and the maintenance of infrastructure. It is a matter of time when the absence of critical services and infrastructure lead to collapse.

Would it be useful to have global supranational cryptocurrencies? We think that it still makes sense and Bitcoin could be a good candidate. For example, these currencies could be used as partial collateral to domestic currencies. Rich people could use it as a store of value. It is definitely useful to have global monetary policies that never change. By separating global and national currencies, we can achieve monetary flexibility in domestic contexts but have a stable global monetary policy.

Global decentralized networks will be important for the future. For example, cross-border payments are still a big problem for the traditional banking system. Cardano is a better settlement layer in that respect. Cardano settlement layer can treat all issued tokens in the same way as ADA coins. Tokens issued on Cardano can be sent to the other end of the world in a few seconds. Thus, stocks, bonds, debt, assets, and everything that can be tokenized can be transferred easily, fast, and cheaply. Moreover, it will be an easy and fast process to change one token for another. Smart contracts allow us to create decentralized exchanges.

Thanks to Cardano, domestic economies can easily be globally available. It can be expected that through tokenization the majority of economic activities will move to blockchain networks. Currently, there are many information silos in the economy and financial systems are not well interconnected. Global networks will nicely solve this inefficiency. The usage is, however, a matter of regulations. It is not solely a matter of people‚Äôs choice.

In the previous section, we faced many questions about making decisions. Cardano will also have the answer for that. Cardano will have an embedded voting system. Together with Atala Prysm, the decentralized identity management, it will be easy to establish a voting system in both global and domestic contexts. The Catalyst project is a nice working example. ADA stakeholders can vote about projects that will be funded from the Cardano project treasury. The idea can be easily replicated and it can be used in the domestic context. It can be even better in the domestic context since the voting rights might not be connected with the holding of coins but with the real identity. Any kind of hierarchy could be possibly created.

Cardano is not built with the intention to necessarily replace the current structures. It can help to improve current structures and make them more effective, transparent, secure, reliable, cheaper, decentralized, etc. The adoption of blockchain technologies will be a gradual process. It does not happen in one moment. It is even possible that developing countries will adopt it sooner than the developed countries. The team behind Cardano has an adoption strategy for Africa. There is a high probability that it will succeed. This approach is very important since the Cardano technology will be used in the whole state by the majority of people.

Governments and regulators can have an open approach to cryptocurrencies but it does not mean that the majority of the population will adopt them and use them. Moreover, the adoption of cryptocurrencies does not mean that governments will not be needed. It seems that governments must actively participate in the adoption of blockchain technologies in order to ensure people will use them as the predominant and preferred infrastructure. It is probable that central banks and governments will want to keep control of the monetary and fiscal policies despite the fact that Cardano will be used to issue domestic currencies. Cardano is a platform and the issuer can keep control of issued currencies. The advantage is that it will be easy to change it or adjust it in the future. Control is something that can be more decentralized in the future. It can be needed to adjust interest rates and people might have many opinions about it. What is more important, though, is who will decide about the rates and possibly about other conditions related to the adjustment. Making the decisions can have many forms in the future and they can significantly differ from the current form. We can imagine the situation that the control of monetary and fiscal policies will be distributed to trusted entities and transparent voting will be the main driver of changes.

# Conclusion

Many people do not realize that in many countries a payment for goods might be a subject of taxation. Thus, payments are part of the fiscal policy. The same tax must be paid regardless of currency and the mechanism must work in the same way for all payers. Payers usually do not care about it and just pay the price of the goods but merchants have to care about it. Luckily, it is not a difficult technological problem and it is possible to pay by cryptocurrencies. Taxation is a more complex topic in the context of cryptocurrencies. It cannot be said that we can avoid taxation just because we start using cryptocurrencies. It would basically mean that we are going to get rid of fiscal policy or even the government.

It would be a pity if cryptocurrency remains just a speculative asset and payments would be attractive only for those who have multiplied the wealth. Let‚Äôs do not mix the financial freedom of lucky individuals with the role of national economies and the needs of the population. These are two different things. The adoption of volatile cryptocurrencies would probably be on the level of gold and it would have no transformative impact on governments. Even if the adoption would be higher, the question would still be here: what governments should do with cryptocurrencies or what people should do with governments. Blockchain technology together with smart contracts and other decentralized infrastructure can become the backbone of the financial world. We believe that with further innovations it will be technologically possible and the usage will be advantageous for governments. Nations need some form of monetary and fiscal policy. We can debate about the level of decentralization, decision-making, etc.

We expect that with the further development of blockchain technologies the governments can start thinking about the usage for monetary and fiscal policy. It could have an influence on the quality of governments if it would be implemented in the right way. We expect that it can take tens of years to get to the point when it becomes reality and it is hard to predict what it will look like. On the other hand, the adoption can be faster in the developing countries and we hope that Africa could be a nice example. Cardano will probably be the leader of innovations and the teams discuss with representatives of businesses, industries, and governments about deployment. It does not mean that Cardano is less decentralized just because people debate about usage. At the moment, there are people that are members of governments and are accountable for changes in the financial infrastructure on national levels. It is not going to magically change overnight. It will always be about discussions.",cryptocurrency
cardano,People will decide about the future of Cardano,"The future of all cryptocurrencies is open. Narratives change, technological capabilities are improved every day, big investors come and are interested in investments. Despite all these positives, it is difficult to anticipate what the future will look like. We will have a look at Satoshi‚Äôs vision and put it into context with Cardano. 

 

# Legacy of Satoshi

Satoshi Nakamoto is a famous pseudonym of a man or a team that put together and launched Bitcoin in 2009. Satoshi quietly abandoned the community and left behind a few other things. Besides the running Bitcoin network, we can read about the reasons why Satoshi created Bitcoin and what is the mission of the project. In the beginning, the mission was clear and Bitcoin was a means on how to reach the goal. We can read about the Bitcoin mission in the white paper or Bitcoin-Talk. The mission, that was envisioned by Satoshi, and the reality might not be fully in conformity. Why? There are several reasons for that.

* Satoshi left and thus he cannot drive the adoption and keep the mission on track. The project has no leader and the role was taken by several self-appointed people. A group of new influential leaders might pursue their interests and goals which might be different from what Satoshi wanted. They can express their opinions that might be in direct contrast with Satoshi‚Äôs vision. Who are these people? It can be nearly everybody. Members of the core team, YouTubers, rich investors, publishers, people that are active on social media.
* Satoshi‚Äôs mission can be understood differently. Influencers can interpret it to other people differently and it might cause confusion or even disagreements. As a consequence, we could see a split of the chain into two chains. Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. It would probably never happen if Satoshi showed the right direction. We can observe disagreements not only on the protocol level but also on the mission level. For example, communities discuss whether Bitcoin failed if it is not used as digital cash. The narrative about a digital store of value prevails but Satoshi did not mention that in the white paper. Can it be considered a failure? The white paper is obsolete and there is nobody who would rewrite it or show a new direction. Is it an advantage or disadvantage? Is the current evolution the best for the future of Bitcoin?
* Price speculation is the main driver of adoption. It is not the mission of the project any longer. Bitcoin attracted banks and funds that buy Bitcoin for their customers. Some big companies decided to buy Bitcoin. It attracts retail investors to jump on the wave and earn some money. It is both good or bad. It is definitely very positive for the adoption of Bitcoin. On the other hand, it can be perceived positively only in the case that buyers will follow Satoshi‚Äôs vision. Users must be able to use cryptocurrencies as an alternative that allows them to get rid of bank accounts.

Price speculation is not the legacy of Satoshi. Satoshi stopped trusting central and commercial banks. Let‚Äôs have a look at Satoshi‚Äôs vision and try to compare it with the nowaday‚Äôs reality. The very first sentence of Satoshi‚Äôs white paper is this.

*‚ÄúA purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.‚Äù*

Satoshi wanted to build a system that will be able to process payments without the involvement of other financial institutions or third parties. This is mainly about the capabilities of the transaction system. Satoshi obviously perceived Bitcoin as a competitor to Internet banking. It can be said that it is the ultimate mission of Bitcoin. From other texts, we can see that Satoshi also considered central banks as untrusted third parties.

*‚ÄúThe root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that‚Äôs required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.‚Äù*

Besides peer-to-peer payments, Satoshi also wanted to create sound money. Regarding privacy, the reality is that the majority of people buy cryptocurrencies on centralized exchanges and are willing to provide KYC/AML data. They are willing to pay fees to centralized services. The majority of Bitcoin holders still use bank accounts and thus, basically support the existence of the traditional financial system. People do not care about privacy. Regulators and not going to ban cryptocurrencies. They are going to regulate them and make it harder to own them without providing KYC/AML. People love stacking Sats but are not willing to get rid of bank accounts. The majority of people basically speculate on the rise of the price.

*‚ÄúBitcoin is a digital currency using cryptography and a distributed network to replace the need for a trusted central server. Escape the arbitrary inflation risk of centrally managed currencies! Bitcoin‚Äôs total circulation is limited to 21 million coins. The coins are gradually released to the network‚Äôs nodes based on the CPU power they contribute, so you can get a share of them by contributing your idle CPU time.‚Äù*

It is probably the explanation why centralized exchanges have found such a good business. People are not able to earn bitcoins by mining. Mining is a big business nowadays available only for big investors that are located in countries with cheap electricity. As a side effect, people are not able to mine and thus they are not able to vote about changes to the protocol. Thus, owners of mining halls have the most rights in the ecosystem and they will not obviously vote for changes that would go against their economic interests.

*‚Äú When that runs out* *\[network subsidy decreasing by halving\], the system can support transaction fees if needed. It‚Äôs based on open market competition, and there will probably always be nodes willing to process transactions for free.‚Äù*

Satoshi cared about the transaction fees. He probably knew transaction fees will play a major role regarding the security budget. On the other hand, he expected that it would be possible to send transactions for free. The reality is that major PoW networks Bitcoin and Ethereum are often clogged. Pool operators select transactions based on the size of fees. Thus, transaction fees rise and currently, you need to pay a few tens of dollars to be able to transact. There are only a few major pool operators in the Bitcoin ecosystem and none of them is willing to insert transactions to a new block if they have zero fees.

Satoshi was aware of the fact that it is difficult to establish trust between seller and buyer on the internet. Satoshi obviously did not want to rely on the current authorities to resolve disputes and wanted to create a digital mechanism that would be able to substitute authorities. Many Bitcoiners can be surprised by the fact that Satoshi wanted to create something like smart contracts. We know that tokens and smart contracts can significantly help with establishing trust between sellers and buyers. Let‚Äôs have a look at what Satoshi wrote.

*‚Äú Here‚Äôs an outline of the kind of escrow transaction that‚Äôs possible in software. This is not implemented and I probably won‚Äôt have time to implement it soon, but just to let you know what‚Äôs possible.*

*The basic escrow: The buyer commits a payment to escrow. The seller receives a transaction with the money in escrow, but he can‚Äôt spend it until the buyer unlocks it. The buyer can release the payment at any time after that, which could be never. This does not allow the buyer to take the money back, but it does give him the option to burn the money out of spite by never releasing it. The seller has the option to release the money back to the buyer.*

*While this system does not guarantee the parties against loss, it takes the profit out of cheating.*

*If the seller doesn‚Äôt send the goods, he doesn‚Äôt get paid. The buyer would still be out the money, but at least the seller has no monetary motivation to stiff him.*

*The buyer can‚Äôt benefit by failing to pay. He can‚Äôt get the escrow money back. He can‚Äôt fail to pay due to a lack of funds. The seller can see that the funds are committed to his key and can‚Äôt be sent to anyone else.‚Äù*

Can we say that Bitcoin failed since so many ideals that Satoshi envisioned are not fulfilled? We definitely could but it would not be fair. Every revolutionary change needs its time and it is hard to predict which direction evolution takes. Satoshi could not predict how fast the adoption will be or how fast the infrastructure will be built. Is the current tempo slow or fast? We can just speculate since Satoshi will not tell us more about that. We can compare the vision and the reality and judge it. We can even try to find the reasons why the reality is as it is. Then, we can try to think about ways on how to reach Satoshi‚Äôs vision.

# Bitcoin maximalism

Bitcoin maximalism does not belong to Satoshi‚Äôs legacy. Bitcoin maximalism appeared somewhere in 2014 and completely twisted Satoshi‚Äôs vision. It was the reaction of new Bitcoin heroes to the appearance of alternative projects. They completely refuse alternatives and do not consider them as viable. Often without obvious reasons. It must be noted that it was not Satoshi who refused alternatives. Nowadays, alternatives can be closer to Satoshi‚Äôs vision than Bitcoin itself. Cardano definitely belongs to that category. If Satoshi could say something about Cardano we believe that it would be very positive. Do you think we are not right? Well, it might be that we understand Satoshi‚Äôs vision differently than you.

Many people would argue that Satoshi‚Äôs vision is directly linked to Bitcoin and it is not possible to separate them. We do not think so. We know the history of money and we know how it evolved. A quick overview would look like this: barter system, shells, minted coins, gold standard, fiat money (banknotes), internet banking (plastic money), cryptocurrency. It is naive to think that evolution can stop. Evolution will naturally continue. At the moment, we are definitely not in the cryptocurrency stage yet. The adoption is too low and the majority of people use fiat money. Bitcoin started the revolution of cryptocurrencies but it does not mean that it will be the only winner. The readiness for mass adoption, ability to become a real usable alternative to fiat money, adoption, and many other factors will decide about the future.

Let‚Äôs provide an analogy that will explain what we mean. The development of cars started as early as the 17th century with the invention of the first steam-powered vehicle, which led to the creation of the first steam-powered automobile capable of human transportation, built by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot in 1769. On January 29, 1886, Carl Benz applied for a patent for his ‚Äúvehicle powered by a gas engine‚Äù. It is regarded as the birth year of modern cars. Who knows the first engineers of cars? Who knows what the first car looks like? Which car would you like to have? An old one or rather a newer one? The reality is that the majority of people would rather use the modern car with low consumption, fast, reliable, secure, and nice-looking. Is it fair to compare cars with money? Let‚Äôs put aside the debate about government and non-government money. Modern money, including cryptocurrencies, is about technology.

Bitcoin is not gold. Gold would become beautiful sound money but the days when it would be possible are passed. Modern society needs to have everything on the Internet. Bitcoin is a network protocol. It is a piece of software. The source code of open cryptocurrencies itself has probably no value. You can download it for free. The only valuable thing about Bitcoin is trust and adoption. This is reflected by market capitalization.

Satoshi had a vision but it does not mean that Bitcoin will be the only implementation of that vision. It is the same as with cars. You can choose the best car for you and you do not need to care about who has invented the first car. Cryptocurrencies are not dependent on governments. Nobody will tell you that you need to use a particular cryptocurrency. How can we know whether there will be only one cryptocurrency for the whole world? How can we know whether everybody will want to use the PoW network if they can use the PoS network? It will be about personal preferences and the vast majority of the population has not yet chosen. Everything is still ahead of us.

# How Cardano can achieve Satoshi‚Äôs vision

In the first place, Satoshi‚Äôs vision is mainly about technology. When Bitcoin was launched, bank fees were high and it was a very long process to send money to the other part of the world. It has changed. In many countries, bank fees are close to zero, and settlement time has also improved. Now, we can say that the fees of Bitcoin transactions are more expensive than Bank fees. At the time of writing, it is recommended to set a $20 fee. It was $30 a few days ago. Hard to say, how much it will be next week. As the network can get clogged relatively quickly, it is usual that settlement can take hours or even a few days. Newcomers are confused and surprised that they had to pay such a lot of money for a transaction and it takes so much time. This is not technology that is close to Satoshi‚Äôs vision. The Bitcoin network is basically unusable for anything else than buying and holding bitcoins. For another usage including payments, third parties are necessary. It is a sad reality and it makes no sense to claim that it is ok.

At the time of writing, Cardano has surpassed Bitcoin in many aspects. Block time of Bitcoin is set to 10 minutes. Cardano is able to create a new block every 20 seconds. If you explore Cardano blocks you can find those transaction fees are usually set from 0,16 to 0,20 ADA. It is approximately $0,20. Transaction fees rise when the network does not manage to insert all available transactions into a block. Thus, they are put aside to be processed a bit later. It can happen that more and more transactions are put aside when the demand for sending transactions grows. We are talking about scalability. Bitcoin is not able to process more than 10 transactions per second. Cardano is able to process a few hundred transactions per second. Moreover, Ouroboros PoS will be improved in the future so we can imagine numbers around a few thousand per second. Decentralization of Bitcoin stands on ten major pools and a few marginal ones. You can find over 2200 registered pools in the Cardano network. Approximately 1000 pools regularly produce blocks. You can find entities that own more pools but still, the number of independent entities is higher than what we can observe in the Bitcoin network. At the time of writing, the Binance exchange operates with 13,2 % of the hash-rate in the Bitcoin ecosystem. In the Cardano ecosystem, the stake of Binance is 12,4 %. 22 % of the stake is owned by single pool operators. Comparing the energy consumption, Cardano needs 6 GWh while Bitcoin needs 45 TWh. It is expected that with the rising price of bitcoins the energy consumption could reach 128 TWh at the end of 2021.

From Satoshi‚Äôs vision perspective, Cardano is a more suitable network for mass adoption than Bitcoin. Cardano can process more transactions than Bitcoin, faster, cheaply, in a more decentralized way and it consumes significantly less energy. Bitcoin has been running for over a decade. Thus, we know that the PoW consensus mechanism is secure. As the current leader, Bitcoin has the biggest network effect. Demand for bitcoins is also significant. These are the only advantages of Bitcoin. Cardano will need a few years to persuade people that Ouroboros PoS is a viable and secure consensus mechanism. Higher adoption is also only a matter of time. The Cardano Shelley main-net will celebrate one year of existence in 2021. In a few years, Cardano can have more users than Bitcoin. We mean users that will send transactions on a daily basis, not holders of coins that make a single transaction per month.

So far, we have compared the transaction networks of Cardano and Bitcoin. As we have mentioned above, Satoshi was aware of the inability of Bitcoin to establish trust between seller and buyer on the Internet. Satoshi did not have enough time to come up with a solution. The IOHK team researched smart contracts well and Cardano will be well prepared for establishing trust on the Internet. People will be able to change the value on the internet without the need to ask authorities for help when it comes to disputes between participants.

Satoshi often wrote about third parties in the context of monetary policy and privacy that is directly linked to the daily usage of money. The world of the internet is full of middlemen that misuse their positions. We can find them not only in the financial sector but also in the social media and business sectors. We could be even more dare and say that governments are also groups of people that can be considered as middlemen. People are generally losing trust in middlemen. It does not matter whether we talk about central banks, payment networks, the lending industry, or big IT giants.

Smart contracts can be the tool that will allow substitute middlemen in many places. It will not happen without the adoption of new decentralized services. One thing is to have the appropriate tool to facilitate changes in society. The other thing is whether society will be interested. It does not matter whether we talk about Bitcoin, Cardano, or anything else. Society will decide about its future.

# Only people can decide about a future

Fulfilling Satoshi‚Äôs vision is not only about technology. Technology itself cannot influence the adoption. Protocols can only directly economically motivate miners or stakeholders to maintain the network. Bitcoin and Cardano protocols are only technical implementations of the vision. The vision is a goal and the goal can be reached via many paths. The biggest challenge of cryptocurrencies as an industry is adoption. There is no way on how to make a revolution without the active participation of people. People must choose a path and it is the only way how the goal can be reached. In our case, people can reach the same goal via different protocols.

The perception of cryptocurrencies is broad. It begins by a scam or Ponzi scheme, continues by trading or speculative opportunities, transfer of value and utility, by the store of value or a new form of money, and ends by the new paradigm of new forms of governments. Even if we have reached a certain level of adoption, it cannot be said that every crypto-asset holder believes that we are at the beginning of a new era. It must be changed and it can happen only via public education, awareness about the potential of cryptocurrencies, and adoption. People need to install wallets and begin to send transactions. It is a necessary prerequisite.

Cryptocurrency must be a viable and reliable substitution for the traditional banking system. People must be able to get rid of a bank account and migrate to the blockchain. We are not yet there technologically but we need to continue with innovations. The real adoption of cryptocurrencies should be counted by the number of people that fully migrated to the blockchain. All other metrics are meaningless. Only people can decide whether they want to migrate to blockchain technologies. Protocols do not care about the decisions of people. Individuals will not do it if they feel they are alone. Crypto communities will be key drivers of adoption.

Bottom-up adoption requires strong communities that will help newcomers to understand the mission of a given project and help to overcome technical difficulties. Qualities of communities will directly influence the tempo of adoption. Cryptocurrencies are open ecosystems. Everybody can freely join or leave. It has many positives, but also a few negatives. New leaders will arise and their personalities and abilities will determine the destinies of communities. There might be global leaders and many other local leaders. Maybe a leader is not the appropriate word at the moment. They are members of core development teams, miners and pool operators, stake-holders, YouTubers, people active on Twitter, Facebook admins, famous faces that speak about cryptocurrencies.

In the case of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson is definitely a very influential person. However, he is not the only one. You can find many Cardano ambassadors that help with adoption via the creation of educational content and building communities. Project Catalyst is the way how stakeholders can decide about the projects that will be funded from the project treasury. IOHK, Cardano Foundation, and Emurgo are entities that can help with adoption on the business and government levels.

Bitcoin does not have a single obvious leader like Charles Hoskinson but it does not mean that none does exist. We have tried to google the most influential Bitcoin influencers and to our surprise, they are not often directly linked to Bitcoin. Very often, crypto influencers are leaders of other projects. To name a few influencers by the number of followers on[ Twitter in 2020](https://news.bitcoin.com/35-most-influential-bitcoin-crypto-twitter/), you can find these people: Justin Sun, John McAfee, Vitalik Buterin, Charlie Lee, Marc Andreessen, Roger Ver, Andreas Antonopoulos, Brian Armstrong, Anthony Pompliano, Nick Szabo, Max Keiser, Jameson Lopp, Tone Vays, Adam Back, Gavin Andersen, Michael Novogratz, etc.

Besides others, you can find these people in the list of recommended[ Bitcoin and crypto influencers](https://coinbound.io/best-crypto-influencers-on-twitter/): Anthony Pompliano, Erik Voorhees, CryptoCobain, Ty Daniel Smith, Girl Gone Crypto, David Gokhshtein, Ivan on Tech, BitBoy Crypto, Dan Held, Peter McCormack.

Every Bitcoiner can pick its own hero. The problem is that newcomers can find so many influencers and they have different opinions. You can find traders, toxic bitcoin maximalists, crypto opportunists, and others. None of them is Satoshi Nakamoto and none of them is able to interpret Satoshi‚Äôs vision to people. Maybe Andreas Antonopoulos could do that in the best way but the Bitcoin community has rejected him since he started to be interested in Ethereum. As a result, members of the crypto community do not have a focus on the mission. It is not necessary for all members to have the same opinion. On the other hand, members should understand the vision and help to achieve it.

As we said, we do not think that Bitcoin maximalism belongs to Satoshi‚Äôs legacy. Unfortunately, maximalism is slowly spreading in the communities and we do not think that it is healthy. Some people like it, some do not. Bitcoin maximalism is like a new form of religion and no religion has global dominance. Maximalism of any form will always be only for minorities. Bitcoin maximalists basically refuse all other paths that lead to Satoshi‚Äôs vision. It is simply a very stupid approach.

Money is not religion. Money is means of exchange, units of account, and a store of value. We use fiat money that is linked with the states in which we live. In many countries, it has nothing to do with religion. It has many to do with governments, social structures, and politics. Cryptocurrencies can be perceived as a technological revolution in the world of finance that has the potential to disrupt governments. It is very naive to think that we can disrupt the world of finance via maximalism. The majority of the population would simply reject it. We need a pragmatic approach and appropriate technological solutions.

People will be an inevitable part of the cryptocurrency revolution. Only people can decide whether cryptocurrencies will be only speculative assets or whether they can bring us a significant change in society. We have probably reached the point where crypto-assets are considered as speculative assets or maybe a hedge against the system. It can remain like this forever. Satoshi‚Äôs vision is still far away. To make another step is much more difficult than people think. Only people‚Äôs desire for change can get us closer and for that, we need healthy communities and maybe appropriate leaders.

# Conclusion

Society loses trust in institutions and money. Blockchain, as a trust machine, can be a remedy. However, it will not happen somehow accidentally. Disruption does not mean that we need to destroy the current structures and completely replace them. Maybe it will be sufficient to modernize them. Fiat money will probably stay here but it is not an obstacle. Decentralization is an alternative and people will decide whether they utilize it or not and also how they utilize it.

Satoshi‚Äôs vision is about decentralization and innovations in this area. We definitely need more scalable protocols and we also need smart contracts. At least, Satoshi thought that it was needed and possible to achieve. Cardano can realize Satoshi‚Äôs vision. ADA can even be sound money. No government can decide about it. Satoshi will not tell us. It is about the individual decision of every person on the planet.",cryptocurrency
cardano,Cardano will allow us to be bankless,"The narrative of crypto can be summarized by the following statement: Unbank the banked and bank the unbanked. Well, let‚Äôs have a realistic look at the topic.

# Power goes hand in hand with controlling money

Historically, governments have the biggest power in their countries. Countries usually have central banks and a lot of commercial banks. Central banks are responsible for monetary policy while commercial banks serve people and businesses. Governments and banks should be to some extent independent. There are always people in leadership positions of institutions and they naturally strive to have power. Within the last few decades, new influential players slowly appeared. Due to the internet and many technological advancements, big IT companies have become very strong international entities. Companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Alibaba, and many others are international and have more information about people than governments have. How did it happen? Well, the fact that the internet is a global network allowed locally successful companies to become global players quite fast. While the decision power of governments is mostly limited to their countries, big IT companies have begun to control literally the whole world. As you could probably hear, information is the gold of the new era. These companies know well how to commercialize information. Now, we are in a situation when social media are accused of influencing the election of the US president, they can legally censor tweets of politicians, or even try to create their own global currencies. Facebook still works on the Libra project and it is possible that we will see it in some form. We can observe a quiet struggle for power between governments, banks, and big IT companies.

The most important message from the previous paragraph is that technological advancement can blunt the power of governments and give advantages to owners of technologies. Cryptocurrencies can be perceived as a technological invention that stepped in into the struggle for power. In contrast to governments, banks, and big IT companies, cryptocurrencies are naturally decentralized. We stated in the beginning, that power goes hand in hand with controlling money. Does it mean that when we begin to use decentralized money then nobody will have power? No. Some people and entities will always struggle to usurp power. Thus, when they want to usurp power, they will need to somehow control cryptocurrencies. Banks are definitely entities that will struggle to control money regardless of whether it is fiat money, Central bank digital currency (CBDC), or cryptocurrencies.

 

# Are currently commercial banks really threatened by cryptocurrencies?

Let‚Äôs have a look at the current situation. The most adopted cryptocurrency is Bitcoin. Commercial banks decided to resell Bitcoin to big investors. It means that they have created cryptocurrency custody services. For banks, Bitcoin is just a new business and also investment opportunity. Is it good or bad? Both. It is great that big companies buy bitcoins as a hedge against printing money. The narrative about a new digital gold slowly becomes the reality and it can be expected that others will join the club. There is one negative aspect of that, though. Rich players buy bitcoins to ensure that they will stay rich. A very small group of early adopters that holds bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies now can maybe become rich as well. The negative aspect is that bitcoins will become very expensive for the majority of people on the planet if they are not expensive already. Thus, the majority will have basically no reason to join the club. People generally do not care about hedging. They do not buy gold since many of them do not understand the mechanics behind scarcity and demand in turbulent times. By some research, approximately only 15 % of the population in the USA holds gold. Gold is not a currency and it is not even used to back fiat currencies. In the case that Bitcoin will become a new publicly accepted digital gold, it can remain a digital hedge forever without the ability to become a stable global currency. It is actually difficult if not impossible to have a scarce resource and currency in one single asset. Let‚Äôs have a look into the past. The U.S. effectively abandoned the gold standard in 1933 as the Great Depression hit. Faced with mounting unemployment and spiraling deflation, the U.S. government found that it is unable to stimulate the economy. To deter people from cashing in deposits and depleting the gold supply, the U.S. and other governments had to keep interest rates high, but that made it too expensive for people and businesses to borrow. So in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt cut the dollar‚Äôs ties with gold, allowing the government to pump money into the economy and lower interest rates. The United States followed the gold standard until August 15, 1971, when President Richard Nixon announced that the government would no longer convert dollars to gold at a fixed value. Thus the gold standard was completely abandoned. Some events require radical solutions and the U.S. was not probably has a better chance to solve it differently. Currency needs to be stable and it is hard to predict whether the volatility of Bitcoin will be similarly stable as current currencies. We are rather skeptical for a variety of reasons. It is difficult to predict the future but one thing is certain. Cryptocurrencies will bring changes in society and it is already visible. Attempts to create CBDC are just a first step in searching for solutions to the current situation. Anyway, if you believe in the collapse of fiat currencies then you need to realize that the economies of many countries will be collapsing as well and all cryptocurrencies can be extremely volatile for a long time. Bitcoin, together with all other cryptocurrencies, is not able to solve the global economic collapse that would come within let‚Äôs say within 5 years. It is great to see that people and even big investors perceive Bitcoin as a hedge in bad times. On the other hand, there will come good times when it is smart to sell gold or bitcoins and invest money at the beginning of a new cycle. If you have a look at the past you will find that gold is volatile and respects economic cycles. It is very probable that Bitcoin will behave similarly in the future.

Commercial banks are not threatened by the existence of gold so we can conclude that they are not threatened by Bitcoin as well. It is not going to change until the majority of people will start using alternatives to fiat currencies. Such an alternative must be stable. The business of commercial banks is about the currency that is used by the majority. A commercial bank can offer you many services like opening a standard or business account, opening a savings account, taking different types of loans (short-term, long-term, or business loans), you can insure yourself or your property. Cryptocurrency must be able to disrupt these services to compete with banks. The stability of currencies is simply the most important attribute of the current fiat currencies from the point of people. Other important attributes are the settlement time and transaction fees. People are used to paying by payment cards. It is fast and cheap. Moreover, paying by card provides higher privacy than Bitcoin. Merchants are not able to see how much payees have on their accounts. Currently, some people use payment cards that allow them to pay by crypto. In reality, however, fiat currencies are used. Card providers just offer a kind of custody service for users‚Äô cryptocurrencies. Users basically pay by fiat currencies and the provider charges them later via slow crypto transactions. This, again, does not threaten banks. It is probable that they will offer similar crypto payment cards to people if it goes mainstream. So it is rather a new business opportunity for them. The advantage would be that it would be nice protection against printing money. On the other hand, decentralization would suffer a lot regarding the censorship-resistance ability and as we said, the major problem is the volatility. Cryptocurrencies will never succeed in competing with commercial banks if the same or better abilities like current currencies are not delivered. It would be nice to have money that does not suffer from inflation but it is a secondary requirement for the majority of people. Usage in the real-life will always be in the first place.

# How can commercial banks be substituted realistically?

The reality is that commercial banks can only be threatened by the decisions of people. People must decide to close their accounts and do not use bank services. The change is not actually about banks but about people. It is necessary to have alternatives that would be able to substitute fiat currencies and bank services. Moreover, there must be significant and visible advantages that persuade people to use it. The only possible way is to create stable coins, scalable decentralized networks, global service for identity management, and allow people to make a contract.

Bitcoin can be understood as a global central bank since the strongest feature is the fixed and unchangeable monetary policy. The Bitcoin transaction network is not able to compete with traditional payment solutions and even if it was the case then it would be a competitor only to these payment networks but not to banks. Luckily, the ability to create a monetary system with predefined features and attributes is not a privilege of Bitcoin. Cardano can have it as well as other projects. It does not matter whether we have 21M bitcoins or 45B ADA coins. Technologically, they are just numbers and we do not even know whether it is smart to have forever capped the maximum coins that will be emitted. It would be another topic for another article. What really matters, is the building of alternatives that will be attractive to users. Only higher adoption can cause a major change in society. Cryptocurrencies in the hands of minorities or big investors are nice but with low transformative power.

To compete with traditional banks, we need to surround the digital monetary policy systems with the abilities of payment systems and commercial banks. In other words, we need to surround Bitcoin and/or Cardano with abilities like fast and cheap transaction systems, the stability of the means of exchange, systems for identity management, loaning, insurance, ‚Äòreading‚Äô the real world (Oracles), etc. We need innovations in all these areas. The Conservative approach to innovations, as we can see in the case of Bitcoin development, is premature. As we said, it is a great and unique monetary system but unfortunately nothing else. Without a decentralized infrastructure, it can be easily surrounded by traditional banks and it is what we actually see. The real economy needs transactions and bank services. Cardano is better positioned to provide these abilities than Bitcoin. The team behind Cardano is big, experienced, and strong. They will innovate and build the infrastructure until the ultimate goal is delivered. It is exactly what we needed. We are not at the point that we could say that we have done it. The opposite is true. We will always need to innovate and maintain a high level of decentralization.

To put it simply, only the combination of stable coins and smart contracts can actually compete with traditional commercial banks. We will need more services like Oracles to interconnect the digital and physical worlds and a system for identity management. The most important thing is actually a stable currency. We can already observe that USDT (Tether) is a very successful project. We need something like that but without the need to collateralize it by physical US dollars. We rather need something like an algorithmic digital currency that is collateralized by other digital assets. As we have already mentioned, Facebook works on the Libra project. Libra should be collateralized by a basket of global currencies and maybe other assets like stocks or bonds. Thus, stability could be achieved even during money printing. It would be really nice to create a digital stable currency that would be collateralized only by digital assets like BTC or ADA. Maybe other tokenized assets could be used. There are basically two questions regarding stable coins. Which assets to use as collateral and what to use to stabilize the currency. Cryptocurrencies are fully digitalized assets so they are great candidates for collateralization. They are volatile and priced by fiat currencies. Thus, they cannot be used directly 1:1. It is necessary to involve some stabilization mechanism. Should it be a basket of stable global currencies as in the case of Libra? Should it rather be some value deduced from the ability to buy the same amount of goods over time? Or, can it be a combination of more inputs? These are tough questions and we will probably see many attempts in the future.

Once we have a stable digital currency the rest will be much easier. It will be relatively easy to create modern bank services via Cardano smart contracts. Bank services are basically about conditions between a bank and people that are written and signed in a paper contract. Replacing the paper contract with a digital smart contract is a relatively easy task. Loaning and insurance industries can be easily disrupted. Cardano will be connected with Atala Prism which is a system developed by IOG for working with digital identity. People can have a global decentralized digital identity. Oracles try to resolve connections between the real world and the digital world. Information about the world is nowadays mostly in databases anyway so the connection between Cardano and databases, or replacing traditional databases with private/public blockchain solutions, is a simple task.

The digitalization of the world is a continuous process. Some people are skeptical of the idea that it is possible to connect these two worlds. In our view, we need to continue with innovations if we want to use digital currencies. The only reason why gold is not able to provide the same service as it could in the past is the fact that the world is more globalized and digitized. Gold is still scarce and you can buy it to hedge against economic turbulences. Gold has not changed and it is the same for thousands of years. What has actually changed are the needs of humans and the ability to create digital scarcity. The advantage of cryptocurrencies is the fact that it is more suitable for usage in the digital world. That is the only reason why gold can possibly be less relevant in the future. Digital scarcity can be easily replicated. Why is the digital scarcity of Bitcoin more relevant than the scarcity of Cardano? It is just about adoption and the adoption is about real usage within the digital world. If Cardano is able to substitute commercial banks then the ADA scarcity will be naturally relevant. Can we digitize a paper agreement between a bank and a people? If yes then we will improve the abilities of the digital world and at the same time, make paper agreements obsolete. In other words, we will improve digitalization.

# Conclusion

The fastest way to disrupt banks would be to connect the effort of all teams in the crypto space. The goal is the same for all projects. We want to decentralize the monetary system, bank services, and also other digital services. It is a pity that we can see toxicity and rivalry between crypto projects. The joined effort would make more sense. Bitcoin as a monetary system, with other PoS networks like Cardano providing necessary functionalities and services that would increase usability, would be a big win. Anyway, Cardano can provide abilities for the substitution of both central and commercial banks. It does not mean that traditional banks will disappear. People will have to choose what they want and we all know that their opinion is shaped by governments and social media. The existence of a better alternative does not mean that the alternative is adopted by the majority. Banks already know that the change is coming and CBDC can be perceived as the reaction of central banks to cryptocurrencies. It means that cryptocurrencies have already succeeded and their influence will just rise. Many crypto projects are already too big to fail. Now, it is not about one single winner that will take all. There will definitely be more winners and we can just guess which functionalities and services will be required by people. In our view, Cardano has the best prerequisites to allow us to be bankless.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,5 Promising BSC Projects to Kick Off 2021,"With the growth of DeFi and NFT, a pressing need for efficient blockchains has developed. That‚Äôs because blockchain like Ethereum is not efficient and scalable enough. Since 2017, the Ethereum network has faced network congestions, record-high gas fees, and similar issues time and again. As a result, users, developers, and platform operators have started seeking alternatives like Binance Smart Chain (BSC) - faster and cheaper than Ethereum.   


Here are some of the more underrated projects on this platform that have either been launched already or are yet to launch:  

1) DeFi yield protocol: The DeFi Yield Protocol (DYP) is a unique platform that offers solutions for yield farming, staking, NFTs, and enabling users to leverage the advanced trading tools of the DYP. The core feature of the DYP is the decentralized tool dashboard. It provides advanced features, such as Decentralized Score, Unique Community Trust Vote System, DYP Locker, Yield Farm Data, and LaunchPad, allowing investors to make informed decisions that maximize yields and reduce risks.  

2) Pancake Bunny: PancakeBunny is a decentralized finance (DeFi) yield aggregator and optimizer for the Binance Smart Chain, which is used for PancakeSwap (CAKE) and Venus (XVS), and will soon launch on Polygon (MATIC). The PancakeBunny protocol gives farmers the opportunity to reap the benefits of auto compounding. PancakeBunny is one of the largest yield aggregators across ETH and BSC, in terms of TVL.   

3) Pledger: Unlike most available lending protocols, Pledge won‚Äôt be focused on crypto traders borrowing digital assets in real-time for day trading. Instead, Pledge answers the need for longer-term financing, mainly serving crypto-asset holders to diversify their portfolio with non-crypto assets, e.g. real estate, without the friction of portfolio rebalancing. By reducing the exposure to interest rate volatility for borrowers/lenders, Pledge resolves the missing, core component in the existing DeFi world thus creates a decentralized lending market that will accelerate the adoption of DeFi apps in people‚Äôs daily financial activities. This yet-to-launch platform is one of the most anticipated one on BSC.  

4) Cryptoblades: CryptoBlades is an NFT crafting game that runs on BSC. It is web-based and users need to play the game on the official CryptoBlades website. Players employ powerful weapons to defeat opponents and collect SKILL tokens, which can be used for upgrades and to level up characters. The game's roadmap also includes an NFT marketplace, where players can advertise their manufactured products for sale and increase their profits even more significantly. This is also powered by SKILL and adds more functionality to the token's capabilities.   

5) Landshare: Landshare is designed to combine the power of DeFi and real estate investment into one platform. Earn DeFi yield farming rewards with the BUSD Property Vault and Landshare Token staking, or use our upcoming real estate investment features to gain direct exposure to assets on chain. Fully integrated into the Binance Smart Chain, all of Landshare's features work seamlessly with the ecosystem at large. Whether you're looking for DeFi returns or a direct real estate investment on the blockchain, it's all available on a single platform.

This might have unexpected (bad) implications on the real economy, and also serve as a catalyst for further Bitcoin adoption

BTW: this is written taking the EU as an example. Unfortunately, today we have the same situation everywhere in the world

Source: [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/09/business/economy/european-central-bank-meeting.html](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2021%2F09%2F09%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Feuropean-central-bank-meeting.html&amp;data=04%7C01%7CAlvaro.DeLaPenaGallo%40tuvsud.com%7Cf22390595e0c421821dc08d97450459e%7Ca110956708154e1f88afe23555482aaa%7C0%7C0%7C637668710375523789%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=XJ5IuIfo2V3socxL7vWUsfw5%2FxTKpEjqVZoCRGCovdw%3D&amp;reserved=0)

This is my read about all this:

Our dear Christine is worried about inflation in the EU (currently sitting around 3% YoY). Statistics don't show it (yet) to be as high as in the US, but everyone knows official inflation and real inflation are two different things, and with the current levels of interest rates, together with the current debt/GDP ratios , there is no monetary policy left to do. 

What can happen?

Option ""Christine saved by the bell"": 

1. They successfully reduce the QE pace. 
2. With the slower increase of money supply, they achieve their 2% inflation goal over the long term (no one said anything about the short term? Did they forget?). 
3. Markets have confidence in the economic outlook of the EU and take over that demand of bonds that the ECB is currently purchasing, so that governments can continue with what they already budgeted for
4. New bond owners like it to have a zero or close to zero nominal interest rate (real negative yield), because of whatever inexplicable reason
5. Due to the above-mentioned point, the ECB does not have to increase interest rates, for the bonds to be placed in the market
6. Since interest rates don't increase, Europeans (people, companies, and governments) can still fulfill their interest payments on the already acquired debt obligations (only the government debt, without corporations or individuals, is over 90% over GDP in the EU), so the debt bubble does not pop, but indeed continues growing, because the cost of money remains zero

There are multiple other options, by which Christine's plan fails: either the plan fails in point 2 (a sharp increase of inflation obliges to cut QE and reduce money supply), or it fails in point 3, or it fails in point 4, or in 5, or in 6. 

I tend to see many aspects of life as a decision tree: possible outcomes, and probability of happening. Based on that, you set your expectations. I do really think that all 6 points of Christine's plan, together, don't have more than 5-10% chance of happening. 

I believe it is inevitable that we will see higher-than-expected inflation across the board (so, for starters, less purchasing power for people like you and me). That will induce Central Banks to further reduce QE and money supply, so interest rates will rise. With that rise, we can see the debt bubble popping (either at a global level, or at an industry level like in 2008, or at a personal or local level). None of this outcomes is positive for the real people, quite on the contrary. 

Despite the fact that I'm already sorry for all of us who will suffer from this (many will be severely affected), I see no reason why this would not be a catalyst for further BTC adoption: first people, and then companies, will want to have (to own!) the only sound money

Bearish on the economy, bullish on Bitcoin. I really have mixed-feelings wrapping my head around all this mess",cryptocurrency

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open higher this morning after we saw a somewhat choppy session yesterday. After the 4th day of consecutive losses in the market, we are seeing strength in premarket trading today. We'll see if that strength lasts, or if we continue to see some selling off. We should be getting some inflation data in, and this could be an important factor in determining if the Fed steps in yet or not. We could see some more choppiness today, just make sure you stay disciplined in your trading.

SPY is trading a bit under 451. I'll be watching action around the SMA(9), which is around 451.50. If we cannot get back up to that level, we could see some more selling off back towards 448, or further. DIA is trading a bit under 351. It's back up above the SMA(200) after dropping below it during yesterday's trading, but I'll be watching price action around that 350 support level. QQQ¬†is¬†trading right around 381, and I'll be watching the 380 support level. If it holds up, it could see more strength. Gold and silver are trading slightly in the red this morning, while crude oil is up. Crude oil looks to test that resistance level of $70 per barrel. B\*\*coin is currently trading around 46,400 and could see some more weakness today. I'll be watching to see if we break down below 45,000 or hold up. Cr\*\*to-related stocks are trading slightly higher in premarket trading. Airlines and cruise stocks¬†saw some strength yesterday, and look to break out of their consolidation in the near future. We will likely test resistance levels in today's trading, and will be worth following into next week. I still have doubts surrounding recovery plays given the state of things, but the charts are looking decent from a technical analysis standpoint. Meme stocks will be worth keeping an eye on. GME was down over 10% during intraday trading yesterday, but managed to finish green on the day. AMC is currently looking like it could break out on the daily chart, I'll be watching.

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)",finance
personalfinance,"Discover Secured Card, Credit Line Increase concerns","Secured to Unsecured Credit line increase, returned payment concern

I have had the Discover It Secured Card for 3 billing cycles, soon to be 4. I really jacked up my credit resulting in me declaring bankruptcy back in 2017. I am just now able to rebuild my credit and chose discover because I have a bad reputable with Cap one, Paypal Credit, Navy Federal and USAA concerning the  debts I discharged with them.

Anyway, I have been using my Discover Credit for majority of my purchases and paying it off throughout the billing cycle. During the first month my account was frozen so I could verify my identity. Long story short I ended up having three payments returned but Discover was nice enough to refund two of them. I have since never submitted a payment without being 101% sure that life won‚Äôt happen and it will go through‚Ä¶

personalfinance,Home sale proceeds - suggestions?,"First off, yes I did search for this topic and read the prime directive, so I have some ideas. But please humor me if you would.

Background:

* Annual income is ~$200k. 
* No debt besides ~$6k left on low interest car loan (2-ish yrs left).
* Already have emergency fund of $30k cash sitting in bank.
* Already maxing all our retirement accounts _before_ we sold the house (IRAs/401k/HSA)

Home transaction information:

* Wife and I selling current house for at least $400k (currently picking best offer)
* Owe $185k on mortgage
* Paying 3.5% total commission to our agent + buyer's agent.
* Buying a new house for $500k with 20% down ($100k)

Rough math shows we'll net **~$205k** from the sale, and after the $100k down payment on the house, we'll be left with **~$105k** when the dust clears. Give or take a few grand due to misc costs.

Current options are:

* Pay off car loan
* Make an principal-only payment to new mortgage
* Recast mortgage w/ additional money to lower monthly payment but keep same payoff date.
* College fund?
* Market?

What's interesting is my wife is an independent contractor and only works part time. We have a traditional IRA for her currently. However I am looking into SEP/SIMPLE/solo-401k accounts for her - might be a way to boost retirement savings.

I've always had a neutral opinion of college funds and would rather save for retirement instead (you can always borrow money for school, but not for retirement, yadda yadda). However since we're going to be maxed out this year it may be a good tax-advantaged option?

To me, it seems like making a principal payment or recasting the mortgage is a bit inefficient considering the interest rate is only 2.85%. Not only does the money become illiquid, but even with conservative positive returns elsewhere, that rate can be beat. Of course that isn't guaranteed though.

CryptoCurrency,I just realized: Stable coins are a totally risk free investment if you are from a country with a higher inflation rate than the US,"This thought just randomly crossed my mind: according to Google the USD current inflation is 5.4% anually, there are plenty of countries from all over the world whose inflation rate is much higher. 

Citizens of these countries could effectively act against the inflation or ""invest"" their money by purchasing stable coins (and maybe even staking them! There are some great interest rates in DeFi and on some exchanges out there). This seems like a great secure investment for some people as it works like fiat currency exchanges but **without the banks.**

CryptoCurrency,"Despite a modest start, the tokenized real estate market might reach $1.4 trillion.","Tokenized property remains niche, largely due to its relative novelty and remaining regulatory uncertainties. Yet a new report has noted that even if just 0.5% of the total global property market were to be tokenized in the next five years, it would be on track to become a $1.4 trillion market

In recent years, the total value of the global real estate market has hit a staggering $280 trillion, eclipsing most other major asset classes and on par with the value of total global debt accrued by 2020.¬†Moore Global, a London-born international advisory and accountancy network, has published a report collating expert opinions worldwide on the potential of tokenization for this thriving, if traditionally illiquid, asset class.

For Dan Natale, Moore Global‚Äôs real estate and construction leader and a managing partner of Segal LLP in Toronto, blockchain's key benefit to the sector is a boost to liquidity by providing efficient, disintermediated infrastructure to underpin new secondary markets. David Walker, a managing partner of Moore Cayman who works as an auditor specializing in digital assets, has for his part claimed that the transparency and security of the technology also offer evident advantages from an auditor‚Äôs perspective.

Until now, the expansion of real estate tokenization has fallen short of expectations, due in part to institutional investors‚Äô hesitancy and the absence of established secondary markets for security token trading. This, however, may be gradually changing, with the United Kingdom‚Äôs Financial Conduct Authority granting an operational license to digital security exchange Archaz in August of last year. One year prior, Germany‚Äôs Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) had approved its first blockchain-based real estate bond, issued on Ethereum.

Andrew Baum, director of the Future of Real Estate Initiative at Oxford University‚Äôs Said Business School, thinks that tokenization in real estate could finally take off if there is evidence of investor demand for fractional ownership ‚Äì something that advocates of tokenization have championed since 2017.¬†

Last summer, a security token representing fractional ownership in the luxury St. Regis Aspen Resort in Colorado went live on Overstock‚Äôs regulated tZERO exchange, attracting record trading volumes. Within less than a month, however, with the token seeing a relatively flat performance amid the coronavirus slowdown, investors were being offered major discounts on their stays at the resort to help boost the token sales. tZERO has nonetheless recently¬†struck a partnership to tokenize $18 million worth of shares in NYCE Group ‚Äì a platform hyped as a potential ‚ÄúRobinhood of real estate investing.‚Äù

Lantm√§teriet is a Swedish government real estate agency that‚Äôs working with blockchain technology. At present, it‚Äôs working on a new solution that will facilitate its land registry process. More so, it will also get rid of any discrepancies and make the process more seamless.

* **JLL**

JLL is also working on blockchain real estate projects. Using the technology, they are going for Spanish commercial real estate valuation. More so, they believe that they can use it to construct and finance projects as well.

* **Coldwell Banker**

Coldwell Banker is one of the real estate giants that is working on blockchain-based solutions. In reality, they are using blockchain for listing out agents, sellers and offering transaction processes. Also, they want to streamline their transactions and contracts from a single platform.

* **Landshare**

Landshare brings the dream of real estate investment to the masses. Featuring asset-based stablecoin vaults, a utility token, house flipping pools, and a governance protocol, Landshare offers a full-fledged Defi platform based on US real estate assets.

**Conclusion**

Blockchain for real estate is a field that needs more exposure in the world. This sector is full of corruption and criminal activities. However, the importance of this sector is all-time high now. So, without proper guidelines in place, there is no way this sector can bloom effectively and get rid of the corruption for good.

CryptoCurrency,Unpopular Opinion: Ofc the SEC is going after Coinbase,"So, it's important to note that I think the SEC is a dinosaur, and they're definitely uselessly panicking in the rapids when it comes to crypto.  That having been said, what else were they going to do? Coinbase is acting a bit stupid here, and it's super gaggy that they'd pretend this move from the SEC wasn't their desired reaction.

Coinbase is trying to make a big show out of not having clear guidance, but there is tons of clear guidance already available. I would think that a first year economics student would understand that what Coinbase wants to do is definitely an unregulated savings account. Yes, other exchanges already provide interest yielding accounts, but Coinbase is a US company.  That fact has definitely helped them become arguably the biggest name, but ya know, US law.

Coinbase literally says in all their promotional material, ""an accessible alternative to savings accounts,"" yet they didn't bother to get the FDIC involved. The SEC doesn't need to make special proclamations about every company that breaks their rules... It's obvious.

Shitty rules are still clear rules. Savings accounts are super regulated and backed up by federal insurance because if a savings institution were to default it's very close to the US public.... Potentially instant economic depression. With Coinbase's proposed savings accounts, you won't have to worry able the FDIC guaranteeing your family's savings, it's guaranteed by... Coinbase itself?

Even taking out the idea of USDC (which I would pretty much view as a clear attack on my sovereignty if I were the big bad SEC), it's just a savings account. 

When you look at it from an outside perspective, it's an unregulated savings account, backed up by a private company with no transparency, administered in their personal currency that's equivocally in every way to USD, except that is not USD. 

I'm not saying that I feel the regulation is correct, but was clearly obvious to Coinbase. Ironically, they're trying to accuse the SEC of regulating through litigation, but that's kinda exactly what CB is doing, unless they have a 7 year old running their legal strategy.

**Tldr**: CB tried to open a savings account without the required regulatory steps. The SEC's rules may be confusing af, but a 10-year-old should have been able to tell them that was illegal in the US.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,The hidden cost of 15year-mortgage,"You will often hear people recommending a 15year mortgage over a 30yar because it cheaper. But that perspective often ignores opportunity cost and the fact you are utilization more resources to make it cheaper.

The alternative is to use a longer mortgage and use the same resources to grow faster than the debt and you will most often outperform financially on the 30year mortgage.

The results in most cases a 30year mortgage you can pay back faster and cheaper than a 15year mortgage

This is called opportunity cost. You lost out an opportunity on the extra monthly payments you are using on the 15year loan.

The premise is simply. You use the same amount of money every month as you would with your 15year mortgage but instead of it all going to the mortgage. with the 30y mortgage you use the different in monthly payments to invest.

Aka instead of $1200 going to mortgage on a 15 year mortgage, you do $800 to mortgage and $400 to retirement/investments.

This also have the benefits that in slim years you would be draining your EF slower as you are only responsible for a smaller monthly payment

I will be using two simply calculator for these examples

This is usually where people would say ‚ÄúSee the 30y mortgage is 50k more expensive‚Äù ‚Ä¶And yes it is, but it over 30years now let looks into what we can make in those 30 years.

The monthly difference is 1,334.68 - 822.51 = 512.17 you can invest monthly all 30 years in the 30year mortgage

In both cases we used the monthly payments of 1,334.68 over 30 years so the ""cost"" is the same in both situations for that we got 1 house and either 531,795.20 in our investments or 1,056,526.46 in our investments

Choosing the 15year mortgage highly reduce our financial situation

In the end we lost in the 15 year mortgage

1,056,526.46 - 531,795.20= 524,731.26

The 15year mortgage cost you half a million dollars in hidden opportunity cost. Or over twice the starting loan amount.

Bottom line is you need to consider the entire impact on your finances when doing a mortgage and not just the impact on the cost of the house.

if not, you might just cheat yourself from a lot of money

&amp;#x200B;

Investment are not a sure thing which is why averages was calculated. you might value a stable growth more than and unstable growth. My thumb of rules is  that stable growth is twice as good as unstable averages. so any  with and interest rate above  half the average in investments  could  be prioritized above investments

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: 15year loans with today low interest rates will in average hinder your finical growth tremendously and/or increase the time to pay of the mortgage**

**ON RISK**

it seems that alot of people are not understanding what averages are doing and claiming stock market risk was not calculated in the picture. 

It was. that is how averaging something does. it take bot the high and low and gives you an number of what it all sort outs to. it was clearly indicated tha the average used for the stock market was taken from look at the performance over  50, 30 and 10 years on the stock-markets. THIS INCLUDES THE RISK ON THE BAD YEARS

&amp;#x200B;

Now on loosing your jobs. let me reiterate.

if you have lost you income the worst thing you can do is have a high expense. with a 15y mortgage you have a higher expense so you are saddle tighter.  Your drain your EF faster you are running a higher risk of defaulting and being hit bit all the bad stuff that comes with that

on a 30y mortgage you can stop putting in funds in your investments decreasing your monthly expense directly, straddling you less  tight, Reducing the strain on your EF.

**30y mortgage makes it EASIER to ride out a bad time.**

and that is not calculating the fact that you have a big chunk of liquidity in your investments for easy access that is not only EASIER to acceas than the equity in your home. but also BIGGER.

personalfinance,I will owe federal income tax at the end of this year. Should I start deducting more tax withholdings or increase my 401K/IRA contributions to offset?,"I haven't been deducting enough federal taxes so I will owe about $5000 to $6000 at the end of 2021.  As a knee jerk reaction to this I changed my W4 to take an additional $600 per month in federal taxes from my check.  Then it hit me that I might be able to offset some of this tax burden by contributing more to my 401K or an IRA.  Here's what I currently have available to me:

* **Company provided 401K**.  I'm contributing 6% which is the ""max"" the company will match.
* **Company provided Roth 401K (edited ).**  I contribute zero to this.
* **Traditional IRA** held elsewhere (not through my company).  It has a decent amount of money in it that has been growing for years on its own but I've never contributed anything to it other than the initial deposit which was made in 2008.

So I was thinking I could pay $600 or more dollars per month to either of these three options to try to offset my 2021 tax burden.  Is this a better plan than simply paying more federal taxes per month?

Looking for advice here and I'm not a savy investor.

EDIT:   To be clear, I am basing this on what I paid in taxes last year.  For example, lets say I owed $15000 in taxes but only paid in $10,000 throughout 2020 so I owed $5000 when I filed.  I'm predicting the same thing to happen for 2021.  I haven't received a bill yet.  I'm not sure what I will owe yet because I won't file until next year like everyone else.  Just trying to reduce my taxes so I won't owe as much when I do file.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Think crypto is getting overbought? Why this bull cycle probably isn't over in three quick facts.,"I was getting concerned that the crypto market has become too frothy and overbought and the start of a bear market may be impending. However, three important facts (IMO) made me strongly reconsider:



1. The entire crypto currency market cap of around $2 trillion is still less than the market cap of Apple, just a single company, which currently has a $2.5 trillion market cap. Granted, Apple is one of the world's largest corporations, but the fact that the entire crypto industry is still valued at less than a single company is incredible.
&amp;nbsp;


2. Continuing Central bank money printing. Almost all of the world's central banks are currently continuing to debase their currencies through quantitative easing (for those that don't know, this is just a fancy name for creating money out of thin air). The US Federal Reserve is currently adding approximately $120 BILLION every month to the currency. That's $1.44 trillion a year. And this is just one central bank. The combined currency creation of all central banks in the world is much, much higher. During the last crypto bull of 2016-17, this element was not in play. In fact, back then the Federal Reserve had stopped QE and was increasing interest rates.
&amp;nbsp;

3. Institutional interest in crypto. It's not a secret that since quantitative easing money printing began in 2009, a large proportion of that newly created money has flown into the stock market, which is why stocks are in a raging bull market even during a pandemic. Now that institutions are paying more attention to crypto, that money will also flow here. 
&amp;nbsp;

So yes, while the astronomical increases in almost all coins since 2019 may make it seem like you're late to the party, it's IMO very possible that this bull market has a lot further to go.",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,Food for Thought - Bitcoin is Inevitable,"The modern financial system is based on fiat currencies that derive their value from supply and demand, and the trust people have in the issuing government. A fiat currency's supply function is unkown as a central authority (the central bank) has the power to change the supply at any given time; there is no scarcity. Fiat's total supply continues to increase over time, devaluing the currency in the long run, and history proves this repeatedly. It is only a matter of when and not if a fiat system fails. The problem for the layman is that their purchasing power decreases year after year unless their annual wage increase is higher than annual inflation, which is not the case for the majority‚Äîthe value stored in fiat continuously declines in purchasing power and the layman's standard of living declines year after year.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin attempts to remedy the aforementioned problem. Bitcoin's supply function is predefined in its source code; there will be 21 million Bitcoin in total; currently, 900 new Bitcoin are issued (mined) per day, and this number halves every four years, until all 21M Bitcoin are mined. As fiat currencies devalue themselves over time, a rational person is assumed to seek a better store of value, ideally a scarce asset that is truly independent (a property enabled by Bitcoin's decentralization). Thus, it seems inevitable for value to shift from fiat-based derivates to Bitcoin in the long run as one continues to devalue itself while the other does not. 

&amp;#x200B;

A counterargument would be that other assets can achieve similar results, for example, bonds, commodities, stocks, or real estate; let us take a closer look at each of these. Bonds currently yield negative interest rates, and there is counter-party risk as you trust the government and its fiat currency. Commodities like gold are expensive to divide, move, and secure; you cannot easily divide a gold bar, gold is also heavy and expensive to move around, and finally, it is expensive to secure. If the cost to secure gold is low or free, it cannot really be considered secure as a thief could steal it; truly securing gold is exponentially more expensive based on the quantity, think Fort Knox with all the equipment, space, and guards. Stocks expose the investor to counter-party risk; if the company goes bankrupt, the investor loses the majority of their investment, stocks are also artificially inflated by the fiat system; for example, current interest rates for savings accounts are low, meaning there is no incentive to store money in the bank; thus a lot of money is stored in the stock market, the value of shares in terms of fiat may be increasing, but the real value of the company is likely fluctuating at a different rate than shown by indexes. Finally, real estate has historically been a great store of value; however, it does suffer from some shortcomings such as maintenance and upkeep costs, it is relatively illiquid, it is poorly divisible, and it is immobile. Bitcoin solves a lot of these problems as it requires no maintenance, is relatively liquid, one Bitcoin is divisible into 100 million single units of value called Satoshis, and it can be moved easily by either storing it on a small physical device (USB Stick or Computer) or sending it digitally, it can thus escape changing legislation and move freely to favorable tax areas.",cryptocurrency

cardano,Minting NFTs to share your personal data with corporations?,"Hey folks, love this community and how we manage to stay clear of pricing discussions and rather focus on real value :)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not technically versed when it comes to Crypto or Cardano, but do have an IT background overall. I've worked on implementing one of Europe's first GDPR compliant solutions for anonymization of Personally Indentifyable Information (PII) and the topic of Data Protection has stuck with me ever since.

&amp;#x200B;

**Would it be possible to use smart contracts + NFT minting to truly remain in control of our own personal data?** 

&amp;#x200B;

My line of thought goes like this:

We need to hand out our data to every company under the sun that we want to do business with. Every newsletter asks for our email address, everyone delivery service wants our phone number.

I don't really trust them to ""delete"" my data once I ask them to. And some even sell them to other companies for a quick extra buck.

&amp;#x200B;

What if I package my PII into NFTs and bind the ownership to **ME** via a smart contract? Given the existing infrastructure and willingness of people to support such an ecosystem, I would be able to remain in control of all my data. I no longer want Fedex to have my number on file? Revoke the contract and automatically have that data be deleted from their system. I don't trust Google with my data? I could invalidate access to my data via the previously specified contract.

&amp;#x200B;

Would something like this be theoretically possible? 

I know that it would need wide-range adoption obviously, but the technology seems to be there.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Dismissing Ethereum FUD,"1. **Fees are too high and that will ultimately ruin Ethereum**

\- First off, the only reason ETH fees are that high is because Ethereum's network is being used the most by a large margin. I can bet if half of these other smart contract platforms like ADA or whatever got up to Ethereum's usage they would bottleneck too if not worse than Ethereum. And besides Layer 2 solutions are already out and many platforms like UNI or AAVE are switching over so that will lower fees on the base protocol anyways. Ethereum is also in the process of switching over to sharding which will further scale Ethereum. 

**2. Ethereum is centralized as the team can do whatever they want**

\- People often say this when referring to the DAO hack in 2016 and how devs ""rolled back"" the blockchain. This wasn't Ethereum's vulnerability firstly. The DAO was built on Ethereum but had it's own contract that was taken advantage of. Second, the community decided to roll-back as they saw this is the best course of action for the ecosystem. No one was forced to roll-back. The majority of nodes thought it was in the best-interest and did though. Same goes with ETH 2.0. They still need consensus with the nodes they can't just change shit willy-nilly. 

\- Ethereum, next to Bitcoin, is by far the most decentralized platform out there. ETH 2.0 has over 200,000 validators so far and the thing hasn't even reached it's final form. Know how much Solana has? 1000. Polkadot? Capped at 1000. This is what so many people fail to realize- decentralization is arguably the most important aspect of a blockchain. All these other chains have such low usage and are so much more centralized they ""perform better"" in the short-term forgetting that network-effect and decentralization are the most important aspects. 

**3. Ethereum is 70% premined** 

\- Ethereum started out with 72 million ETH premined. This is true. 60 million were sold at ICO and 12 million were given to the foundation. But, anyone could have taken place in this ICO and bought back then (not much different from how anyone could mine Bitcoin and farm a shit ton of coins in 2010). They also needed the money so they could continue to fund and work on the ecosystem into the future -- unlike Bitcoin which has struggled to change anything. Also, no one person/group could buy more than 12.5% of the available ICO at the time. The 70% number came from the amount of ETH is circulation back in the day. Now that number is lower (61%) and will continue to fall. 

\- The foundation had 12 million ETH but most of that was already spent. Take a look at their address: 

[https://www.blockchain.com/eth/address/0xde0B295669a9FD93d5F28D9Ec85E40f4cb697BAe](https://www.blockchain.com/eth/address/0xde0B295669a9FD93d5F28D9Ec85E40f4cb697BAe) 

\- They only have 393,868 ETH left there. 

\- You can also see for yourself how much ETH Vitalik owns:

[https://www.blockchain.com/eth/address/0xab5801a7d398351b8be11c439e05c5b3259aec9b?view=internal](https://www.blockchain.com/eth/address/0xab5801a7d398351b8be11c439e05c5b3259aec9b?view=internal)

\- Even Satoshi owns \~5% of all Bitcoin (way more than Vitalik owns of ETH). 

\- Also, take a look at the Ethereum rich list: 

[https://etherscan.io/accounts](https://etherscan.io/accounts)

\- Other projects are significantly more skewed/ more concentrated in the hands of a few holders (look up their rich list if you want to know). Especially with people moving to proof of stake this is a much bigger issue.

\- This is also what other projects fail in. The creators / VCs own such a large chunk of the project that they can still just dump on retail investors/ continue to get richer off staking / control governance. Most of the OG Ethereum has been dispersed back into the market. 

**4. Because of inflation, ETH can never be sound money or a store of value**

\- While this used to be true the protocol changes have fixed this issue. The past two years it was averaging \~4 or 5% inflation. The whole point of inflation to start with in these block-chain platforms  is to encourage people to help secure the network. Because Ethereum is now so big it is no longer necessary to have a high rate of inflation. Changes to the monetary policy like EIP-1559 and ETH 2.0 are coming as a result-- which again the nodes have to agree to do this. With EIP-1559 the inflation rate fell to around 2.6%. After the merge and ETH 2.0 rolls out there is a good chance this number becomes \~0.5% or negative.

\- As a reference gold has an inflation rate of \~1.5 to 2% a year. Bitcoin has an inflation rate of \~1.77%. ETH 2.0 will be lower than these thus potentially making it a better store of value. 

In fact, I'd argue Ethereum will be the best asset in the world for being the only thing to exist in all three asset classes at once (capital asset, store of value, and consumable asset)

Now I'm not saying Ethereum has 0 issues or all other projects are trash but considering all these factors, Ethereum is ahead of other projects and will continue to be an extremely good bet into the future.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Since the News is Full of it: Everything you Need to Know about CBDCs!,"*Before i get downvoted to oblivion because I talk about banks, it is an interesting read in my opinion because the word CBDC appears every 2 articles nowadays.*

# What are Central Bank Digital Currencies?

In their most powerful iteration, Central Bank Digital Currencies will allow individuals, businesses and almost everyone in the private sector to have a digital wallet or bank account directly with their central bank. This in itself is significant, as within our existing financial system it is only commercial banks who are able to account directly with central banks in the form of central bank reserves. In the United States, it is though this channel the Federal Reserve conducts its quantitative easing (QE); they purchase assets from the commercial banks in exchange for central bank reserves. Without going too much into the dynamic of how QE works, it is via the commercial banking system where true money creation occurs for the real economy. Allowing individuals to have a direct CBDC account with the Fed would allow the central bank to stimulate and interact directly with the individuals, something that cannot be achieved in the present system.

This direct interaction with individuals is being purported as one of the main reasons behind the development of CBDCs. The bypassing of the commercial banking system offers policy makers a completely new toolkit in how they are able to conduct monetary policy. No longer will central bankers' stimulative measures be constrained by the wills of commercial banks and private sector credit creation. Rather than relying on bank profitability, regulation and demand for credit to influence the money supply in the real economy, the Fed would be able to inject liquidity directly to individual consumers and businesses themselves. Such a form of a Central Bank Digital Currency would truly transition the central banks from the lenders of last resort to the spenders of last (or first) resort. With such a potentially powerful tool comes great responsibility and equally great consequences, as I will endeavor to detail below.

**Almost every central bank in the world** has, at the very least, begun preliminary research into the development of their own form of government digital currency.

# Types of CBDCs and how they work

**There are numerous different forms of CBDCs being developed**, and as such, within this section I will attempt to best summarize these different proposals, along with the potential uses and utility of each.

# Retail vs. wholesale

Firstly, CBDCs will either be in a **retail or wholesale form**. A **retail CBDC** would be designed for use by the wider population and consumers themselves. This would allow central banks the tools to directly interact with consumers, and thus provide policy makers the greatest amount of stimulative or restrictive measures and data gathering capabilities. A retail iteration of a CBDC represents the most significant change to the monetary system of today and it is through this iteration that money itself will be completely redefined.

**A wholesale CBDC** on the other hand would be introduced for use within the commercial bank interbank market and other selected institutional and shadow-bank participants. The goal of a wholesale CBDC would be to increase the efficiency and ease of transaction within these wholesale markets. However, compared to a retail CBDC where direct interaction with consumers provides the mechanisms of stimulus and intervention the central banks truly desire, the benefits of a wholesale CBDC do not appear overly significant. Indeed, from a payments infrastructure perspective in the United States, ""there appears to be no need for a CBDC in wholesale payments in the United States"", as the existing wholesale payments infrastructure allows efficient wholesale transactions to be processed with ""infinitesimal operational costs and zero demands for collateral or liquidity"".

# Direct vs. indirect

**A direct model** represents the likely iteration of a retail CBDC described above. A direct model would allow consumers to have a direct relationship with their central bank, who would then need to provide many, if not all, the banking and payment services whose responsibility currently falls to the commercial banking system. For a CBDC to have any meaningful stimulative ability by central bankers, a direct model would be required as this would eliminate the need for intermediaries in the money creation process. Simply, a direct model would allow consumers to have a bank account directly with the Fed, in which they hold their Central Bank Digital Currencies. The central bank would then have complete autonomy over every CBDC held by the private sector within their CBDC account.

There are both significant benefits and consequences associated with a direct iteration of a CBDC. Most notably and meaningful is the role of commercial banks in a world of direct central bank money. Such an environment would completely alter the responsibilities and requirements of the central banks as well as the commercial banks. Whilst costly for central banks and significant in scope, some permutations of CBDCs could result in the central bank completely intermediating the commercial banking system and taking complete control over the roles and responsibilities commercial banks provide. Everything from banking to lending. This is a significant development in which I go into further detail later.

**An indirect** (or two-tier model) of a CBDC would allow consumers to hold their CBDCs directly with a commercial bank, similar to how deposits are used today, with the commercial banks continuing to act as the intermediary between the central bank and consumers. The commercial banks would be required and obliged to provide the CBDC to consumers on demand, of which the commercial banks themselves will hold on reserve with the central banks. This is similar to how central bank reserves work today, and may not necessarily be a meaningful change to the financial plumbing currently in place.

# Token-based vs. account-based

**A token-based CBDC** would be akin to digital cash in a similar manner to the currencies of today, the difference being cash would be completely digital and a physical alternative redundant. A token-based CBDC would make all units of the CBDC fungible and would be a bearer instrument, fully transactable by the holder.

**An account-based CBDC** differs on the other hand, as it is through this version of a CBDC whereby the policy maker's toolkit becomes immense. In an account-based CBDC system, ownership of a CBDC is demonstrated through ownership of an individual account that holds the CBDC. One would demonstrate ownership of a CBDC account and all of the currency within. The individual CBDCs themselves would not be fungible nor would they be a bearer instrument.

An account-based form of a CBDC is perhaps better categorized as an identity-based form of money. One's identity would be imbed in their CBDC account, and thus their identify embedded within their money itself. By embedding ones identify within ones currency, an account-based or identify-based CBDC could be manipulated for both good and bad based on the individuals status in society or their spending habits as a means to implement monetary ""stimulus"".

Associating an individual's money with their identity is one of the most important and impactful considerations associated with Central Bank Digital Currencies; herein lies the association with money as digital surveillance and the dangerous path this can ultimately lead for society as a whole.

# Privacy concerns &amp; government power

**Two major concerns** associated with Central Bank Digital Currencies, which are perhaps more so philosophical, are the effects their introduction would have on personal privacy and enhancing government power.

Beginning with **privacy concerns**, an account-based or identity-based CBDC inherently connects individuals to money and removes the fungibility of money in order to enhance government's control of said money. By default, such a form of money requires individuals to give up their freedom and ability to transact anonymously.

By removing the fungibility and token-based nature of conventional currency, a version of a CBDC which does not embody these characteristics creates a vast array of ethical and philosophical responsibilities for its issuer. We as a society must decide who we entrust with our personal data. An account-based CBDC would allow its issuer to gain access to all of our spending habits; what we buy, how much we spend, what we invest in and what we save. Would we rather entrust this information to the government, a central authority who are notoriously successful at misallocating capital as political agenda is what drives decision making. Targeted stimulus based around such data would ultimately be conducted on a political basis, as it is done so today. With identity-based money, individuals and policy makers must consider how much monetary and personal information is attached to their CBDC, and, individuals must be able to trust their policy makers with such information and that it is used for the right reasons.

**Under almost any CBDC design, the central bankers and policy makers would gain extraordinary power.** Without these powers, the benefits of CBDCs for the economy in most developed nations are likely to be limited. To be beneficial, or at least attempt to be beneficial in democratic countries, CBDCs will place more and more responsibility in the hands of the state at the expense the private sector. As this would only serve to give more power to the central banks, their political ""independence"" would become more important than ever. I can't imagine it wise to give entities such as the central banks whose independence is already in question greater responsibility.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, Sept 10, 2021. Have a great weekend everyone!!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, September 10, 2021**

Stocks extended their streak of underperformance, with the three major indexes falling once again for the fifth consecutive day of losses, one of the worst weeks for equities all year. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.78% down, closing out the week 1.57% down. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) also closed the day 0.78% down, closing the week out 1.3%. The Dow Jones (DIA), which primarily weights financial, industrial, and energy stocks, closed the day 0.75%, closing the week 1.91% lower. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued its roughly year-long streak of underperformance, falling 0.97% and closing the week 2.53% lower. All year, IWM has been trading between a range of $210 and $235, unable to break out, compared to the more than 15% year-to-date gain by the SPY. Market participants remain concerned with the surge in the coronavirus Delta variant and the potential negative impact it could cause the economy.

First off, in geopolitical news, President Biden spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time in months. Afterward, Bloomberg reported that the Biden administration was considering investigating Chinese subsidies and their effect on the US economy. Marc Chandler, Chief Market Strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said ‚ÄúThe Sino-America relationship is in disrepair and today‚Äôs call does not seem to change this. The US appears to list actions it wants China to take, while China‚Äôs demands seem minimalist, quit demonizing it and respect its red lines. Yet its red lines strike at the very heart of international order, such as its claims on most of the South China Sea and its aggressive provocative actions in the region.‚Äù This also comes amid extremely intense regulatory pressures by the CCP on Chinese tech stocks, many of which have an American listing.

In other news, new economic data showed that prices paid by producers for materials once again rose last month, once again highlighting the strain that stills exists as supply-side pressures and labor market shortages once again push inflationary readings higher. This report shows that, despite the pandemic surging once again, demand by consumers remains red-hot and continues to outstrip manufacturing capacity, causing shortages, which, as basic economics shows, pushes prices higher. The producer price index for final demand rose 0.7% last month after two straight monthly increases of 1.0%, the Labor Department said. The gain was led by a 0.7% advance in services following a 1.1% jump in July. A 1.5% increase in trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, accounted for two-thirds of the broad rise in services. Goods prices jumped 1.0% after climbing 0.6% in July, with food rebounding 2.9%. In the 12 months through August, the PPI accelerated 8.3%, the biggest year-on-year advance since November 2010, though one has to take into account this number is inflated due to easy comparisons to last year, given the absolute collapse of prices during the height of the pandemic before the vaccine existed. Economists had forecast a rise of 0.6% on a monthly basis and 8.2% on a yearly basis, basically in line with reality. 

Mike Loewengart, Managing Director at E-Trade Financial, said of the PPI, ‚ÄúAnyone who has bought pretty much everything recently knows that supply chain issues are widespread and inflation is real, so this won‚Äôt be too much of a surprise for the market. Keep in mind we‚Äôre still in the transitory period where the Fed is not inclined to budge of easy money policies.‚Äù

Now, this is absolutely massive news and will have huge consequences in the market moving forward, especially for companies who derive a large percentage of their revenue through the Apple Store. Today,  a judge in California sided with Epic Games and issued Apple a permanent injunction against their App Store policies. This move opens the door for developers to offer customers third-party payment options that do not force developers to pay Apple‚Äôs 15-30% commission. Stocks like Roblox (RBLX), Bumble (BMBL), Zynga (ZNGA), and Spotify (SPOT) sharply gapped up after the announcement. I cannot stress how big this is, in 2020 Apple made $73 billion in revenue from the commission on App purchases.

Unfortunately, a summer that began with plunging coronavirus cases nationwide and real hope that the worst of the pandemic was behind us as the effective vaccination drive began is instead drawing to a close with the US firmly in throes of the pandemic once again, due to the highly contagious Delta variant. 

This weekend, hospitalizations were roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people traveled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention‚Äôs recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling.

CryptoCurrency,Here is why both BTC and ETH can go x100 from here.,"1. What Is a Derivative? A derivative is a contract between two or more parties whose value is based on an agreed-upon underlying financial asset (like a security) or set of assets (like an index). Common underlying instruments include bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, market indexes, and stocks. 

2. The derivatives market is, in a word, gigantic‚Äîoften estimated at over $1 quadrillion (!!!) on the high end. How can that be? Largely because there are numerous derivatives in existence, available on virtually every possible type of investment asset, including equities, commodities, bonds, and currency. Some market analysts even place the size of the market at more than 10 times that of the total world gross domestic product (GDP). However, other researchers challenge these estimates, arguing the size of the derivatives market is vastly overstated.

3. You have great store of value - BTC and you have great smart contract - ETH. How high are the chances that those two will reconstruct and modernize derivatives market? Pretty damn high if you ask me!

personalfinance,Nurse trying to refinance private student loans. HELP!,"I am completely clueless about where to begin on paying off my student debt. My ONLY option to go to nursing school was to attend private school, requiring a large number of private student loans at an ABSURD interest rate. I am a daughter of immigrants so I'm not very financially literate.

Some background information:I live in NYC and got my first job at 100k! I am really thankful to have a good living situation where I only have to pay $800 in rent. Phone, car, insurance, utilities amount to around $1800 including rent.

What is the best way to tackle my student loans?My current debt is from 4 private student loans totaling at 108k all averaging at a \~12% interest rate.

After doing a search online, it says I prequaliy to refinance for 3.66% (wow, sounds amazing against my INSANE 12%).Payments would be $991/month (ok, sounds reasonable), for 15 years (oof that is longer than I'd like), with a total interest of 41k (YIKES!)  


Another option is I prequalify to refinance for 3.23% at a minimum of $2,477/month (That's a whole damn paycheck) but it will be paid of in 5 years (rather than 15) and I'd only pay 12k in interest (sounds a hell of a lot better than 41k)

&amp;#x200B;

Could/should I take this 3.66%, pay the minimum of $991/month, and then over the next few years, throw more towards it and pay it off faster and thus pay less in interest? Is 3.66% considered a good rate?

It also confuses me how I'm ever going to qualify/afford to buy a home or start a family with all this debt on my back :(

personalfinance,Temporary personal loan or line of credit for auto loan down payment?,"This is a really unorthodox idea from face value but I‚Äôll explain why I‚Äôm asking this.

I just sold my car that‚Äôs under a lean private party (to an **neighboring state** dealership, ironically) for my asking price (more than I bought it for new). Their process is they pay off the loan first by mailing the loan buyout check to my credit union, and once the dealership receives the title in-hand, they will overnight me a second check for the remainder I‚Äôm owed.

The first step has already been completed and my loan shows a $0 balance. It was relatively quick since they overnighted the check Thursday, it was received today at noon and processed immediately. They just picked my car up Thursday.

I‚Äôm trying tooth and nail to get an expedited title from my DMV in-person to bring to the dealership myself and get my money ASAP, which has to be done the same day my credit union releases the title, which is not something that has been done yet (all of this has been communicated with the dealership). However, this is proving to be extremely cumbersome. I‚Äôm told even if I get written permission to be able to pick up the title it may not be possible. The DMV takes a whopping 2-4 weeks just to mail out the title.

The new vehicle I‚Äôm purchasing *has* to be paid in the next two weeks, as I‚Äôm picking it up on a specific date. This involves a new loan that I‚Äôll be applying for along with a 20-25% down payment, which is around the amount I‚Äôm receiving in that second check.

I simply don‚Äôt have this amount of cash on hand, but if I let the process move forward normally, I‚Äôll have it in 4-5 weeks max.

Do I have any options here, including potentially using a personal loan or line of credit from my CU to cover the down payment? Even a cash advance on one of my credit cards for most of the amount, using some of my on-hand cash to cover the rest. I don‚Äôt mind paying a couple hundred in interest if it means getting this money in time. Obviously it would get paid off within a month, if that.

I know for a home mortgage this wouldn‚Äôt work as you aren‚Äôt supposed to take out additional lines of credit during the process, as it will result in denial even if you‚Äôre initially approved, but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs as stringent with auto loans. Keep in mind I would get auto loan approval first, then get the personal loan/line of credit last minute to prevent it from impacting the interest rate of the former. I can pay the down payment as late as around the day I pick up the new car.

This is a last resort and I‚Äôm going to look into other routes where I can get this money first before proceeding with something like this. If I decline pickup of the new car it‚Äôll take weeks or months to wait for another to show up, which is an even bigger gamble.",finance

personalfinance,Insight on negotiating with credit card companies?,"Hello good folks of personal finance, does anyone have any advice on negotiating with cc companies?

My Dad has $10,000 to pay down cc debt and I'm hoping he can get something of a bonus for that size payment - much lower interest, maybe forgiving some of it?

Details:

Dad's credit score is 618, low only because of the amount of debt. He doesn't have any derogatory marks, pays on time every month, etc. Hoping that relieving his debt burden will boost his credit score significantly.

Citi: $23k @ 21%
Discover: $16k @ 21%

He called Citi several months back and asked if they could lower his interest rate bc he's a good customer and they did! From 25% to 21%.

Everything I've been able to find on the internet says that cc companies won't negotiate unless you're behind on payments/not in good standing. Since he's timely - albeit always paying near minimum - he's in good standing. Will they work with us? My thinking is that they'd rather have that money now, since a 65 year old making min payments isn't a boost to the bottom line. 

I also tried to read more about lump-sum settlements (couldn't find much particular info, unfortunately) but what I could find seemed to indicate that doing that will crush your credit score. Does anyone have experience with this? Is that always the case?

He wants to keep the account open bc it's 35 years old but I think he'd rather be closer to debt-free than have that account. (Lmk if you think keeping it open is super important.) 

We plan to call the cc companies tomorrow. He's supremely nervous about it - I wish I could talk to them in his stead. 

Extra info: the $10k is from a loan I took out at 8.24% because I have a much better credit score. He's going to make the payments (but I could handle if necessary). I make $30k and he makes $53k per year. My thinking here is that by alleviating his debt ratio, his score will go up, and he can get a loan @ 8.24% (for example) to pay off the 21% credit cards. Even if he can't, $10k @ 8% is a lot better than $10k @ 21% with compounding interest.",finance
personalfinance,First time home buyer - Pre-approved through five lenders - VA Loan,"So I have been pre-approved through multiple lenders and was wondering, when I get a contract with the sellers, are there fees applied with the lenders for letting them run a Closing Cost Details page for the Loan Estimate to get their rates/fees/figures, or do I only pay those fees if I accept through the one particular lender I decide to go with?

Or is this something I can just email the lender about and they are obligated to tell me?

Also, when it comes to haggling for the best rate and fees, should I let each lender give me their best rate and if they aren't matching or beating another lender, tell them how low they need to go to get the best deal? Are lenders forced into the current market rate or can they go lower?

When it comes to fees, is a lender going to waive the \~$2k origination fees to sign with me or is that something they can't do? One lender told me that if they waived the fees it would just increase my interest rate. These lenders will fight for my business over $2k fees while not raising my rate, right?",finance
CryptoCurrency,A tale of ye Land of se Germans! Bitcoin is coming (maybe)!,"While we talk a lot about coins here and tokens there, I want to have a look at the populus that decides what coin will be used. In Germany (yada yada, funny second World war remark that you think we still care about while we dont), we are close to the next election. And the goverment does decide if we can or cannot use crypto. And how our laws will be changed in favour or against it.

Maybe, I should include a short description of the current status of cryptocurrencies in Germany here. At the moment (insert funny disclaimer here that I am not a financial advisor, while giving financial advice, you can buy any cryptocurrency in Germany. But no business has to accept it. It is not a legal tender. But if you hold it a year, any increase in value (when selling is tax free. So it has the same status like Gold in Germany already. Beyond that, tax lawyers will soon attack the 'not a legal tender' status in Germany, due to the adoption in El Salvador. Altogether, Germany is a great country for Cryptos. You can buy Bitcoin and if you wait at least a year, you do not have to pay any taxes. The only other country in Europe with similarly beneficial laws is (I think) Portugal. But enough of this. Let s cut to the chase!)

**On the 26th of September 2021 a new government will be elected.** We are allowed to vote (thanks again for removing that annoying dictatorship, yes, we are thankful...). And there are many parties that want to be elected.

In short, and realistically, there is the conservatives, the social democrats, the greens, the liberals and the fascists (woopsy, some of us dont learn from history).

The conservatives (CDU) and social democrats (SPD) will get around 22 +/- % of votes.The green party (B90/die Gr√ºnen), caring mostly about climate change stuff was doing quite well but more realistically get around 18 +/- of votes.The fascists (AFD) will get around 12 +/- % of votes. But before you start bombing us, wait! Nobody will go in a coalition with them. They have no chance to govern.Some of the surveys: [https://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/](https://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/)

What is interesting is that we have a so called liberal party (FDP) that is back at around 13 +/- % of votes. This party can basically get into a coalition with the conservatives and or the social democrates. They are quite versatile, because they mostly care about money stuff. Why should you care? Well they are the only party in Germany that is not only a bit into crypto but has a real opinion on crypto and **wants the precious!** They have described their opinion on cryptocurrencies in their election manifesto!

CryptoMarkets,Follow up: Bitcoin 50k Covered Call 29 Oct 2021 Expiry Trade,"^(Preamble: Before I go on I just wanted to clarify that I am not trying to encourage anyone to trade options or derivatives. In fact, I strongly discourage most people to use derivatives as they are leveraged investments and can easily go against you and result in losses that go beyond what you have in your trading account. The risk is even greater with highly volatile investments like bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. Furthermore, derivatives require a very active management and quickly become time consuming. Studies have shown that simple buy and hold - HODL! - strategies have systematically outperformed derivative investments and I strongly recommend that this is what the majority of people should do. However, even if one is not investing in options, they can be really useful tools to interpret what the market may or may not do and the idea here is to exchange views and opinions and these interpretations. I‚Äôm also writing this just as much for myself as for anyone else as it helps me keep track of my investment process and gain valuable insight from others‚Äô opinions. If this might be of interest read on. If not please skip this post and rest assured that HODLing is much safer and more lucrative than trading options.)

**Follow up**

I posted a couple of days ago a trade idea which you can read about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/pj9und/option_trade_idea_sell_bitcoin_50k_covered_call/). I wanted to put on this trade because my feeling was that we had reached a ceiling with the 52k level and while I still wanted to benefit from some upside if we kept on rallying I also wanted to protect my BTC investment from a pullback which I felt could come from some negative regulatory scrutiny. My target trading range was 45k / 55k.

Low and behold BTC took a severe beating a few hours later due to the negative news from the SEC taking interest in the Coinbase lending program. Luck must have been on my side because I couldn‚Äôt have possibly timed this if I had wanted to - in fact that‚Äôs why I chose a medium term 60 DTE maturity for the trade as I didn‚Äôt expect the correction to come so soon.

By selling the 50k BTC Oct21 Calls on Wednesday we collected 0.15 btc ($7.8k) of premium and at time of writing they are trading around 0.1 ($4.5k) therefore locking in a 0.05 ($2.3k) unrealized profit from the decrease in the value of the option. However, since this is a delta neutral trade the long delta hedge 0.5 btc per option has cost us around 0.06 btc ($3k) due to the 10% drop in the value of btc from 52k to 46k.

As intended this trade has mitigated our losses from the correction as the decrease in the value of the option has more or less compensated for the drop in the price of the underlying.

**What now?**

There is still a fair amount of premium in the option therefore we are going to hold the position since the general consensus is that the market will not bounce back quickly and we are looking at a trading range of 40k / 50k for the weeks to come which means that theta decay will chip away at the value of the option netting us some additional profit.

Since we remain bullish it might be a good time to purchase some additional spot since this will enable us to buy some ‚Äúcheap‚Äù btc so we don‚Äôt miss out on the next rally while also counteracting the increase in premium of our short call position if the market does move up. That being said macro news may weigh on btc and crypto in general with Fed starts tapering in Q4 so we will be cautious in our btc spot purchase by averaging our buying.

**Was this the best trade or would there have been better trades?**

In the initial post u/LoudOrganization6 suggested selling a 65k strike instead of the 50k. This would have been more suitable for someone more bullish than me and would have captured only 0.05 ($2.6k) btc of premium by selling the 65k call strike for the same expiry. The idea was to maximize the premium income which is why we opted for a slightly ITM call to match our short term bearish outlook.

Another combo by u/LoudOrganization6 would have been to sell a 60k strike Call (0.08 btc) and buy a 45k Put (0.7 btc) which is essentially a Collar. The sale of the Call would have paid for the purchase of the Put. At time of writing the 60k Call is now worth 0.04 btc and the Put 0.12 btc. With hindsight this would have been a much better trade than the Covered Call trade although it would have hurt a bit more in the short term if the market had kept on rallying with the increase in the premium of the call and the collected premium having been used up to pay for the long put.

# **Markets brace for hot consumer inflation report in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/10/markets-brace-for-hot-consumer-inflation-report-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Investors are paying close attention to any reading on inflation these days, and the consumer price index will be the big one to watch in the coming week.
*****
&gt; The latest snapshot of the economy comes just a week before the Federal Reserve‚Äôs important September meeting. At that meeting, the Fed is expected to discuss more details about its plan to taper down its bond buying program, or quantitative easing.
*****
&gt; Market professionals say a hotter inflation reading could speed up the Fed‚Äôs plans to slow the $120 billion a month in bond purchases. The paring back of its asset purchase program would be the Fed‚Äôs first major step away from the easy policy it put in place to combat the pandemic.
*****
&gt; The consumer price index is expected Tuesday, and there is retail sales data is released Thursday. They are expected to show consumer prices jumped at a 5.3% annual pace in August, according to the consensus estimate from FactSet, while the consumer continued to pull back from the high spending levels of earlier in the year.
*****
&gt; # Hot CPI
&gt; ‚ÄúIf the CPI is hotter than expected, it could make the difference between a September announcement for tapering or waiting to November,‚Äù Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said.
*****
&gt; Economists expect CPI to rise at a 0.4% pace month over month. The report comes after August‚Äôs producer price index ‚Äî which was released Friday ‚Äî showed a jump of 8.3% year over year, due in part to supply chain constraints.
*****
https://i.imgur.com/3ia6fMl.png
*****
&gt; The Fed‚Äôs formal announcement about tapering its bond-buying program, also called QE, is widely expected in November or December. Many of those who had expected a September announcement pushed back their time frame to later in the year after August‚Äôs employment report showed just 235,000 jobs added, about 500,000 less than expected.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúCertainly the trend has been for the inflation number to come in above expectations. I think if that happens again, it will feed the narrative that high inflation is going to stick. Obviously, it‚Äôs an issue for the bond market if it‚Äôs viewed at all as accelerating the timing of the QE tapering, and or accelerating the timing of the first rate hike,‚Äù CIBC Private Wealth U.S. chief investment officer David Donabedian said. That would be a negative for stocks.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIf markets have an inflation mutiny here and there‚Äôs volatility as a result, they could move it up to September,‚Äù Donabedian said of the Fed‚Äôs taper announcement. ‚ÄúBut I think there‚Äôs kind of a one in four likelihood in my view.‚Äù
*****
&gt; # Stagflation?
&gt; That combination of higher inflation and slower spending, particularly after August‚Äôs weaker jobs report, has spurred talk about the threat of stagflation. Those worries have also increased as economists ratchet back growth forecasts for the third quarter to a still high level just above 5%, from above 6%.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI‚Äôm more about the ‚Äòflation‚Äô side of it than the ‚Äòstag.‚Äô I think the economy is going to perform fine right through next year,‚Äù Donabedian said. He said the slowdown in consumer spending after stimulus checks had boosted retail sales earlier in the year is not surprising and may be just a ‚Äúshort-term warning.‚Äù
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe had this explosive growth in retail sales early in the year as a direct result of stimulus payments and vaccines coming and a burst of consumer optimism. It‚Äôs really settled down now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere was an enormous amount of liquidity and saving and they spent what they spent out of that extra amount of savings and you‚Äôre going through a bit of a retracement here, which is why you‚Äôre seeing economists mark down their third quarter estimates. Consumer fundamentals are pretty good.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said he expects the CPI report to show that inflation is peaking, just as the Fed has said. But he says the slowing trend is not just an issue for consumer spending. It is also showing up in business spending and housing.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWith where labor markets are, August was a bit of an egg. But growth in employment has been solid on average, very robust over the course of the year,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEven though employment disappointed in August, hours and and earnings were still pretty good. There‚Äôs income there for consumers to spend. We‚Äôre looking at this as a short-term hiccup.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Gapen said third-quarter economic growth may be somewhat slower than expected. However, he said some of the lost growth could show up in the fourth quarter.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIt has some characteristics of stagflation, but true stagflation is rising unemployment and rising inflation. We don‚Äôt have that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThese are bottlenecks that are kind of constraining the pace of the recovery and lead to higher inflation. Demand isn‚Äôt the problem right now. Supply is. The unemployment rate is still coming down and employment is improving. It has the whiff but I wouldn‚Äôt call it stagflation.‚Äù
*****
https://i.imgur.com/tjC3emB.png
*****
&gt; Donabedian expects higher prices and shortages to continue into next year, as supply chains keep getting disrupted. Some companies, including PPG and General Electric, have already commented on how they see issues with supplies stretching into 2022. Donabedian expects to see more warnings ahead of the third-quarter earnings season.
*****
&gt; Stocks were lower this week, with the S&amp;P 500 losing 1.7% to 4,458. The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield has held above 1.3% and was at 1.33% on Friday.
*****
&gt; A number of strategists expect to see the stock market pullback during the typically choppy September and October period. Some say the Fed‚Äôs September meeting could be a catalyst, especially if the central bank sounds particularly hawkish.
*****
https://i.imgur.com/IP5Vq9T.png
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre up over 30% in 2019, over 18% last year and over 21% in the first months of this year,‚Äù Donabedian said. ‚ÄúThese are unsustainable rates or return. ...Our takeaway is it‚Äôs going to get tougher from here. Valuations are somewhat extended and this whole incredibly supportive policy framework is going to get a little less friendly.‚Äù
*****
&gt; # Now watch Congress
&gt; Donabedian said it will be important to watch discussions in Congress as it begins to put details around the infrastructure spending and what type of tax increases will be proposed to pay for it.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to start to fill in the blanks on where the money is going to be spent and what taxes and tax rates are going to be written into the legislation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the overall corporate tax rate, it‚Äôs the tax on foreign earned income, capital gains rates and dividend tax rate. These are big investor related issues.‚Äù
*****
&gt; He said the market has been ignoring the tax issue. ‚ÄúThose sort of issues went quiet over the summer but it‚Äôs back full bore over the next two weeks. It will get a lot of attention.‚Äù
*****
&gt; The tax decisions could have big implications for corporate earnings, which have been a big driver of the stock market‚Äôs gains. ‚ÄúOne very direct way that could go wrong is if you get a large set of tax increases that go into effect in 2022. That‚Äôs a direct hair cut,‚Äù he said.

&gt; # Beige Book Decelerates As Delta Impact Widens

&gt; Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve updated its twice-quarterly qualitative assessment of the economy based on conversations with business contacts across the twelve regional districts. For each Beige Book release, we apply a natural language processing algorithm to assess the relative frequency of positive versus negative words, giving us a quantitative comparison of Beige Books over time. As shown in the chart below, our index of Beige Book activity has fallen from record levels recorded back in June to elevated but much more modest levels in September. That's consistent with the Fed's description of ""moderate"" growth thanks to the impact of the Delta variant.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/091021-Beige.png))**

&gt; In the second chart below, we show the relationship between GDP growth and our Beige Book Index from above. As shown, the current reading of our index equates to GDP growth of a bit less than 4% YoY. But keep in mind that extreme base effects are still driving wild YoY GDP readings. With that in mind, the Beige Book Index appears to be showing above-trend but decelerating growth, when accounting for base effects of the extremely low GDP reading from Q2 of 2020.

&gt; # Most Heavily Shorted Stocks

&gt; Over the course of 2021, we have seen some aggressive short squeezes, resulting in turmoil for certain financial institutions and millions in profits for some retail traders. The ""reddit army"" has gone after multiple stocks, most notably Game Stop (GME) and AMC (AMC). Let's dive into the 25 companies in the Russell 3,000 currently with the highest short interest as a percentage of float. Of these 25 companies, only 8 have experienced positive returns in 2021, and 6 have seen their share price half. Since GameStop peaked in late January, 20 of the companies on this list have lost value, and 9 have seen their equity trade down by 50%. Since AMC's peak in early June, 7 companies have seen price appreciation, and zero have seen their value decrease by 50%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Russell-3000-Highest-SIPF.png))**

&gt; The average short interest as a percentage of float for the entirety of the Russell 3,000 is 3.46%, but certain sectors have much higher proportional short interest than others. Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, and Real Estate have the highest, while Utilities, Financials, and Consumer Staples have the lowest. High levels of short interest is a sign of negative investor sentiment, but certain sectors will consistently have higher figures due to the riskiness of their business models.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/R3000-Sector-Short-interest.png))**

&gt; To dive deeper, let's look at the average short interest in each industry. Retail, Pharma &amp; Biotech, and Consumer Services have the highest levels, while Banks, Tech Hardware, and Utilities have the lowest levels. The average short interest in the retailing industry is more than three times higher than that of banks for companies in the Russell 3,000.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Industry-avg-SIPF-Russell-3000.png))**

&gt; Although there are many exceptions to the rule, in 2021 equities with higher short interest have generally underperformed the remainder of the Russell 3,000. The average return for equities with short interest between zero and ten percent were higher than that of equities with 33%+ short interest.

&gt; To support this, let's undergo a decile analysis. The stocks in the top 20% in terms of short interest have significantly underperformed the rest of the Russell 3,000 since GME hit its highs. While the equities in the bottom 20% of short interest have averaged a 22.23% return since January 27th (GameStop's top), the top 20% of most heavily shorted stocks have declined by 1.40% on average.

&gt; # Largest 25 Stocks in the S&amp;P 500, Now vs 20 Years Ago

&gt; Yesterday, we took a look at the makeup of the S&amp;P 500's largest 25 companies in 2021 and compared it to that of 10 years ago. Today, we will be extending the study to 2001, twenty years ago right before the 9/11 attacks. On the day before 9/11, the sectors with the largest number of components in the top 25 in terms of market cap were Consumer Staples, Health Care, Technology, Financials, and Communication Services. While all of these sectors still hold a spot in the current top 25 list, the makeup has shifted substantially. Energy and Industrials, which each accounted for 8% of the top 25 companies in 2001, now have zero representation in today's list. Consumer Staples also reduced its count from five to two.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/sector-breakdown-top-25-stocks-now-vs-2001-v2.png))**

&gt; Only four companies that made up the list of top 25 names in September 2001 remain on the list today. Those four companies are Microsoft (MSFT), J&amp;J (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Pfizer (PFE). The average return of these four equities, excluding dividends, is 221.81% with a median of 129.58%. While the turnover of this list has been high over the last 20 years, every member of this list is still in operation today, but two have been undergone mergers (Time Warner &amp; Royal Dutch Petroleum). Interestingly enough, the members of this list have approximately the same proportionate makeup of the S&amp;P 500, with only a 1.89% increase in the weightings of the top 25 stocks now relative to September 2001.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/2001-vs-2021-biggest-comps-SP500.png))**

&gt; The US economy today is far different than it was in 2001. As it has changed, some companies have adapted and experienced massive growth, while others have been left in the dust. Apart from the two companies that are no longer independently publicly traded, the average return of the 25 largest companies from 2001 is 92.94% with a median return of 49.08%. Over that same period, the S&amp;P 500 has returned 310.61%.

&gt; # September Seasonal Pattern: Weakness After Mid-Month

&gt; September is the final month of the third quarter and historically it is essentially tied with August as worst month of the year. Since 1950, September is ranked last for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have fared slightly better, but historical average performance is still negative. Over the last 21 years, September has generally opened tepidly with mixed performance depending on index with Russell 2000 often rising the most through mid-month. However after mid-month, any gains have tended to fade quickly and turn into losses by month‚Äôs end. Sizable losses in 2001, 2002, 2008 and 2011 weigh heavily on average performance.

&gt; # September quarterly option expiration week: S&amp;P 500 up 13 of last 18

&gt; September‚Äôs option expiration week is up 59.0% of the time for S&amp;P 500 since 1982. DJIA and NASDAQ have slightly weaker track records with gains 53.8% of the time and 56.4% of the time respectively. However, the week has suffered several sizable losses. The worst loss followed the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. In the last eighteen years, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are tied for best record during September‚Äôs option expiration week, up thirteen times. Friday had been firm with all three indices advancing every year 2004 to 2011, but S&amp;P 500 has been down eight of the last nine since.

&gt; # What Could Happen The Rest of the Year to Stocks and Bonds?

&gt; This week in the latest LPL Market Signals podcast, Ryan Detrick and Lawrence Gillum discussed global central bank policy, recently weakening economic data, and where stocks and bonds could go the remainder of this year.

&gt; In today‚Äôs blog we will focus on their discussion on stocks and bonds.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index was up more than 20% by the end of August for the first time since 1997 and it has made a new high every single month this year so far (9 for 9). Incredibly, it made 53 new highs before August was over, the most ever. Any way you slice it, this year is historic for the bulls.

&gt; The catch (and there‚Äôs always a catch) is the S&amp;P 500 hasn‚Äôt pulled back 5% all year, with the last 5% pullback last October. Not to mention September is the worst month for stocks the past 10 years, 20 years, and since 1950.

&gt; But history says that great starts to a year tend to see continued strength the final four months. ‚ÄúLooking at the previous top 10 starts to a year ever, the final four months have gained eight times,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúSo should we see any seasonal weakness, we‚Äôd use it as an opportunity to buy before likely continued strength.‚Äù

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 2021 ranks as the 6th best start to a year ever. The previous top 10 best starts to a year averaged a return of 4.0% the rest of the year, with a very solid median return 5.4%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.8.21-Blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Turning to bonds, we continue to expect higher yields due to the growth and inflation outlook, with a target of 1.75% on the 10-year treasury yield by year end. This of course could pressure bonds, as they trade inversely with yields.

&gt; From a portfolio point of view, we would keep overall interest rate sensitivity muted and favor mortgage-backed securities and short- to intermediate-maturity investment grade corporates. As a result of our higher rates call, we suggest being underweight longer maturity high grade corporates or long-term treasuries, which are more sensitive to rising rates. So sum it up, taking a more of a defensive posture as it relates to interest rate sensitivity makes a lot of sense the remainder of 2021.

&gt; Also, the potential this week for a European Central Bank (ECB) announcement on tapering could push European yields higher, which in turn could push U.S. yields higher as well.

investing,What does interest rates do to bond yields? I‚Äôm not sure I understand it all.,"Ok, so if bond prices fall, the value of bond ETF‚Äôs that hold those bonds also falls. If I buy bonds I want a high yield, right? Yield is the return I‚Äôm getting on that bond. So if I buy a $10,000 bond with a coupon rate of 10%, yearly coupon is $1,000 interest income. But I also want to buy this $10,000 bond for a discounted price. Let‚Äôs say $6,000 discount bond price.  So my yield is ($1000/$6,000) = .1666666. 

If I bought the bond at a premium, let‚Äôs say $10,300. My yield is lower. ($1000/$10300) = .097

So if interest rates are expected to rise due to inflation, bond prices are going to drop? Thus bond yields will go up?

And if interest rates go down, bond prices rise, and yields decrease?

Anyone please correct me. Thanks üôè",finance

CryptoCurrency,New book about DeFi and a tiny failed experiment.,"I tried posting about a new book about DeFi when I first picked it up and hadn't read any of it, but it got rejected for being too short.

[https://www.wiley.com/en-us/DeFi+and+the+Future+of+Finance-p-9781119836025](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/DeFi+and+the+Future+of+Finance-p-9781119836025)

It's very short, the body of the text not much more than 150 pages.  Vitalik wrote the preface.

So the sections are an introduction about five problems of centralized finance, a general history of finance, the elements of DeFi infrastructure, the primitives or basic functions and elements of DeFi, a deep dive looking at several DeFi platforms and tokens, risks of the sector, and a conclusion.

I'm in the deep dive section now which looks at MakerDAO, both the governance token MKR and the DAI stablecoin, Compound, Aave, Uniswap, Yield Protocol, dYdX, Synthetix, Set Protocol, and Wrapped Bitcoin.  While reading this last night, I kept looking at the websites for some of the major DeFi tokens and the rates paid on different assets.

I've posted many times here about my skepticism of DeFi, even though I own a few of the major tokens.  But reading this made me excited and wanting to try this out on a small scale.  Just browsing on the sites, eventually there would be a point where they would ask to connect a wallet.  I didn't attempt that until now and felt a little scared because as far as I can tell, the public blockchain only shows isolated little subwallets when generating new addresses or creating separate subaccounts.  I didn't go as far as creating a brand new wallet with new seed words.  Connecting to the site, it was a bit shocking that it listed all the subaccounts, not just the tiny one I intended to use.  Logging out again, I went to a centralized exchange and purchased a very small amount of a DeFi token to deposit at a high interest rate.  By very small, it was only 33 dollars worth.  Going back to the site, I reconnected and selected the small subaccount with the token.  The box above the ""continue"" button had fine print that said the estimated ETH gas fees would be 71 dollars.  So far DeFi turned out to be as stupid as I feared and I didn't proceed with that transaction.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Home refinance process questions and advice,"Hi r/personalfinance, I had a quick question about refinancing my home. I bought it last year literally the week COVID lockdowns started. I had minimal money for a down payment so the loan was financed with an 80% 10/1 arm at 3.75% and a 20% home equity adjustable home equity loan pinned to the PRIME rate with a minimum interest rate of 3.5%, which it is at now. I bought the home for $212,000 and my principal on both combined is currently $202,000. Due to the market the home value sites currently place my home somewhere between $230,000 and $275,000. I‚Äôve also done a considerable amount of work to the home (installed gutters that were absent on the whole house, built in pantry shelving, replaced fiberglass trailer steps at my back door with concrete ones, insulated attic and encapsulated crawl space, replaced both heat pumps, and installed heat pump hot water heater). I would like to refinance to a 30 year fixed rate. My credit score is somewhere between 750-780 according to Credit Karma and Chase‚Äôs scores.

My question is what is my next step? Do I contact lenders? Do I order an independent appraisal to see if they think it will appraise for the ~$250,000 I‚Äôd need it to appraise for to avoid PMI? Should I worry much about it coming in slightly under ~250,000 and having to pay a year or two of PMI to get it to a fixed rate?

dogecoin,"It's west coast time, this is when we're at our strongest. How would you feel about if we attacked btc one more time. It's near 45k this would be a very good opportunity to break the 4k floor.","You can take all the time you need to prepare then tell me when you're ready. The wc crew. As predicted are doing an amazing job keeping it steady. (love the Golden rectangles) I wish we had more support around Hawaii. It'd kind of a gaping hole.

http://imgur.com/a/N390rSh

Yesterday the Hawaii time zone, the weakest of our support, but also generally the most easy to attack since the block of time is pretty much a game of solitaire vs AI bots. (hint to Hawaii you have pretty much full control of an entire flock of time. I'm sure you can figure out how to leverage your efforts. Everything is a computer. M

Right now we have the support of the wc crew. It seems like the wc crew are gonna lead for now until everyone else catches up. It's awkward with the ""great wall"" I know. We can work around it. Or take advantage of the fact that its pretty much s training training zone. 

This can happen tomorrow too but tonight would be ideal. (there was concern that this post was a pump and dump so it was delayed) 

If we strike while the irons hot we can get btc to break the 45k floor. With the support of the wc team it should help protect doge from btc's leeching but I suspect it'll at least flat line and then heal form there. The ratio of btc:doge should keep tipping. I don't think I have to say that or course I am aiming for doge to rise steady and naturally and will do whatever possible to shield it while btc will throw its tantrums every time it falls. 

Yesterday it swept 3 percent from each of the top and things have been held steady since as btc continues to drift down toward 45k. 

You can treat it as a discount. But we can break the myth of btc dominance for good. Btc is our competition. This war of attrition versus btc is meant to discourage those from investing in something I think they everyone knows is not good for at the very least crypto, but obviously it's malicious effects are much broader than crypto. The ability for btc to be used as leverage is proportional to how high it gets with 50k being a particular danger zone. 

If btc goes the way of AOL doge can supplant it as it should. And it's really a good time to get El Salvador to reconsider adopting a crypto with such a bloody history where all its ever done is facilitate all the worse things you can imagine you can do with the ability to transfer billions anonymously. There is nothing wrong with having more than one currency. I personally don't even think of doge as a currency replacement so much as a token of gratitude that we would like to give over crass cash, or overtly sketchy btc. Gifting someone 50 doge feels a lot better than 0.00004 btc. Never under estimate the power of an idea that stands for something that happened to become what it's become through a series of unlikely events.

The core demographic of btc is the same core demographic that has always been bombarded with doomsday propaganda. They have YouTube channels where their charlatans literaly dress in military gear. The same market has always been targeted to the point where the same anti science snake oil was the template to the botted or otherwise adnews picture of a pretty girl / picture of a 16 year old in a suit too big with the caption ""Karen / Ken says he lost 50 lbs / is now a millionaire / in just 6 months / 2 years because he/she bought herbaslim/btc."" 

Its value was only as it is because it ran mock auction simulations that simulated human interest and transactions while sketchy journalists were bribed into it no different than the new York times ""selling an NFT"" of one of its news papers thereby giving it the air of legitimacy all the while there was a clear conflict of interest since open sea obviously paid them for the publicity. 

Once the auctions began to allow people to take part it was already well beyond any reasonable numbers and people had to buy it through the same exact means you'd send money to a Nigerian prince with ""too much money issues""

And you remember how many or those sites happened to get hacked or just went dark stealing everyone's money. I'd love to see a follow up of the 16 year old millionaire who or course was quoted as a hodler and see if he ever actually managed to cash out.

Palmer the CO creator of doge finally (but well needed) put out a statement about how crypto had been a hyper capitalist scam from the start. It's by definition a cartel no different than de beers or opec with the artificial scarcity angle. No currency has ever needed a max cap in fact there being a max cap is just a ploy while 88 percent of it is in the hands of 0.5% ""people"" who mostly use it as little wallets for bots to leverage the massive price value against anything they could get their hands on and in the process was devouring our economy. 

Think of what would happen if eBay accepted btc and didn't have any policy against bidding your own item up. What if bots could buy and sell things without it even changing hands thereby just driving the price up or down depending on what it wanted people to believe was valuable for reasons as thin as the pixels that are spit out to explain anything. What if it could do so several times a microsecond. How easy would it be for some random atari game to seem to fly over night as if it truly generated demand and you missed out after an incredible 2000 percent gain. Maybe you should buy cowboy shootem when it ""dips"" ""down"" to $5000? 

Something goes up. It's because they'res some good news that the news bots scraped up from past articles then updated the time and assigned it to the editor of the WSJ. If it goes down due to good news it's ""sell the news"". Btc day collapsing in a 5 minute straight line is clearly not a human sell off and plenty of other commentators have cried foul.

We witnessed the same exact thing on btc day as on Snl for doge and on doge day. 

https://youtu.be/IWeqJohwkfo

common sense. If you wanted to liquidate an asset for whatever reason would you sell it as fast as you can quietly to maximize your profit? Or would you use technology to precision trickle your asset aiming below the highest bid over and over again at blazing speeds only bots would be able to orchestrate while buying it back up in stacks of 25k over and over again? 

The same exact thing happened on doge day, on Snl and on btc day. The reasons don't seem to matter anymore than China having a black out was supposedly a reason why everyone's btc sense would suddenly agree that btc was actually worth 20 percent less in the span of 5 minutes

I've covered in the past that when btc crashes it takes the economy with it and I mean literally. It TAKES anything it can to maintain its price leverage. And produces nothing but crashes that its mighty generous with, and laundering / sponsoring terrorism coups while any ""journalists"" who got a hand full early on continue to write news that would promote fud and fomo all day since they literally work for the btc they have in storage like it's ""their precious"" and they are more incentived to spin any story to cause more strife while pretending btc is a great store of wealth.

A bunch of Atari ET cartridges would be more reliable a store of wealth than btc which only DOESN'T take down the economy with it, even after its been looting from our economies 24 7. Investing in btc is literally investing against your own economy. It doesn't even have the basic utility doge has as a gift currency that's fast and efficient enough I can buy boba tea and Vietnamese food with it down the street. 

It's so cold and awkward everyone thinks it's a stock for a company that literally just MAKES money which if you think about it that way it sounds pretty bad in itself. 

It's already 88 percent monopolized and we're supposed to fight over thr remaining amount that hasn't been lost? Or made some stupid ad news about how ""sherry says she could have been a millionaire if she only had the password to her btc account."" so with its max cap what happens when it reaches its maximum supply? We end up with a fixed hierarchy where the 88 percent if allowed, if no one stopped them, would not only be a fixed immutable caste but would have a command economy at their disposal where they determine what we should value by manipulating the prices. We are already having our ability to vote manipulated. 148 million IDs were stolen during the equifax hack including Socs so our very identities are vulnerable to manipulation which was exactly what the btc bots needed to be like little colluding hive minded people. 

These same bots are taking away our very ability to even choose what is and what isn't valuable and therefore where resources go I e. Who's dreams are fulfilled and who has to live in a twisted dream where NFTs of just nothing are worth millions. Meanwhile VR drone space tourism with 5g satellites? Something possible right now? No it is obviously not valued. Look at the price! It drops whenever it is about to get anywhere. That must mean it's us who's not interested.... 

Space tourism with rockets they can't even control is surely smarter. We could share 5g gsat drones and all explore space no matter your age or condition. Vr space drones are so inevitable it's as retarded as how pge won't bury their dang lines and also install fiber since they can literally do that right now and make a fortune. But nope. Money for nft for what? For money for nft. 

Or money for game stop. I love games but gimme a break, it's not like we don't need a lot of other things too. But you know what needs game stock and other ""meme stocks?"" why they exist? Why so many stocks seem to now behave as if infected by cryptoitis?

Btc steals from the economy like harvesting our chance of an awesome future and putting it in cold storage expecting everyone to die off before it's withdrawn and maybe spent? 

http://imgur.com/a/4L57LrX

That's the bots stealing from mp, the only REE mine in the western hemisphere. Any chance we have of not being lied into another war would be to expose the truth. Sustainable energy is what is being fought. That's the enemy. Iran / Persia wants nuclear power. Nope. Oil. Sustainable mechanical frictionless batteries we literally farm in the arctic. The undulation of waves, geo thermal energy. Nope lithium.

Antarctica has enough space for a mag lev propulsion circuit that can flings satellites even just the size of drones into space at any angle from down there all powered by the arctic wind, the pressure of ice expanding when it crystallizes, the literal wobble of the earth down there would allow for us to simply tap energy from pendulums if we wanted. We could drop deep sea UV strobes to create a 5g network and finally explore the depths of the ocean with vr and even harvest resources.

The world has so much to offer... We can have all this now but instead money is just shuffled around by an AI poker based bot net that has destroyed our sense of value versus price to the point where anything goes. 

So why does game stop and amc need all they money? It doesn't.

http://imgur.com/a/4L57LrX there is an example of the bots stealing from mp, the crucial ore that were all fighting over now. Why we have an electronic components shortage. Why Myanmar was seized to cut off China's source as they are desperately running out and we have the richest deposits of even higher grade ore could be refined to make everything we want possible. All that's inevitable we wouldn't have to be patient for. We'd be able to bring the future to the present rather than bringing the present to the past yet again. 

The bottom picture are two consecutive days of backflushing btc and unlooting our economy from btc. 

How do get btc to fall and backflush it's funds? It's a funny thing that happens when you keep doge stable. 

The bots can't fulfill their programing and so they reverse and just kinda wait. 

Which is what presents us with this chance. We can take down BTC. 

Were prepared. But I'd like to talk the the community about it. In the past when it was necessary to sabotage a pump we issued warning.

How do you guys feel about this? How long would it take for you to be ready to knock down btc? How long would it take for the info the spread of what btc really is and how much harm it causes and how we can take it down. 

Half of the equation is education. We have to absolutely debunk the concept of btc dominance. We can demonstrate it live if you'd like. Perhaps it'd be a good idea. People who are fans of btc should know how vulnerable it is since it never really had the demand and just skipped ahead to being valued because it's price is artificially inflated. It's like the campaign to defend blood diamonds since synthetic diamonds which are the same thing and can be mass produced now, just like btc, it's just dust that's been compressed into a token. Debeers took what was considered the most boring gem and created the first nft, a token they're use Madison Ave to turn into a token of marriage when before all other gems that are beautiful and aren't just confused for glass like opals, look them up, or musks legacy sapphire and emerald. The mines in his case. But sapphires and emeralds are just pretty much like diamonds except actually beautiful.

Right now amc and gme are investment sinks and just store wealth because they work as pump and dumps when necessary no matter what value they're at, when btc needs a bump it'll run a pump and dump the meme stocks. 

http://imgur.com/gallery/uDzqkDy

That's why when btc is attacked things don't just sink as if somehow people losing interest in btc just automatically causes them to lose interest in everything, other cryptos and the economy like how btc day's crash also caused a crash in the market.

Clearly that makes no sense. Say what you want about maybe everyone for some reason loving btc and hating it instantly and simultaneously causing symmetrical hatred for all other cryptos... Like the same way whenever I hate one song or game my hatred just proportionately increases for all of them. In a flash that we all feel like how a yawn is contagious. And doesn't just spread, that'd take time, the very absence of air itself from the simultaneous yawn reduces the density of the atmosphere causing everything to go haywire. Like the inversion of the buttery effect. We flap that wing in unison!

So we prepared for btc day by hosting a live demo to begin to counter and hopefully lead to a world full of master bot tamers. 

All the excuses given for el Salvador seem almost like a public bs test. To see how many people would be fooled 3 times and accept different explanations every time when we've seen this happen the same exact way 3 times.

We don't need a different news story for every time a bunch of people ""suddenly"" wear disguises and go candy begging.... We call that Halloween. 

It causes the demand for candy to soar which of course collapses the candy industry every year. Black Friday and Xmas cause giant depression from all the increased demand and shortages. Man why do we even have Christmas when clearly everything follows the logic were being fed and remember whenever there were any issues on black friday and the economy collapsed? Or just black friday itself or cyber Monday, the increased demand just crashes every thing.

Everyone was told to buy 30 btc for El Salvador, it's legitimized by a nation which like having the dollar become the petro currency totally just crashed the dollar. All that increased demand. 

Tldr:

Fufher warning that the war of attrition against btc will go on. I'd like to be public and transparent. I've never sold any doge. I'm still always doing anything I can conceive of to blunt BTC's impact on doge or aid in its recovery. Before it was hard to say something public due to the nature of saying something public would obviously lead to others anticipating our actions.

But at this point with our numbers I don't think that's an issue anymore. The rise of volume was an intentional rise of noise. No leaders, just helpful controlled little bursts of chaos to keep things honest. That's why for the first time btc did fall before Bch yesterday. Typically the fact that btc follows anything but had the closest correlation to BCH is why Bch was used.

For those who read this. Dm me if you want warnings. It seems like the block listing is ended which is weird.

Otherwise you can try commenting. In the past it did cause block listing though.  But I don't think that's happening anymore.",cryptocurrency

1. Here‚Äôs the tweet with the link for the Alonzo smart contract launch watch party tomorrow (Sept 12) at 21:30 UTC. This is going to be fun!  Enjoy it, guys! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1436325831199141888](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1436325831199141888)
2. A Weiss Crypto analyst calls the smart contract launch an alleged event and also doesn‚Äôt realize we already have NFTS.  The Cardano community was quick to correct the analyst. Weiss was then also quick to apologize. [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436369016545857566](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436369016545857566) [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436402039085576193](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436402039085576193)
3. Even before having smart contracts, Cardano transaction volumes are looking fantastic!

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Cardano has been listed by Bitpoint in Japan! [https://www.bitpoint.co.jp/news/info/info-2021080301/](https://www.bitpoint.co.jp/news/info/info-2021080301/)
2. Senators Wyden and Toomey are trying to fix the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill! [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/crypto-rules-in-infrastructure-bill-eyed-for-bipartisan-rewrite](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/crypto-rules-in-infrastructure-bill-eyed-for-bipartisan-rewrite)
3. SEC Chair Gensler gave another speech strongly signaling that a lot of stablecoins, lending platforms, synthetics platforms, and other DeFi projects are probably non-compliant in the eyes of the SEC. I would heed this warning very carefully if I were one of those projects. [https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tusQLLCgrDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tusQLLCgrDs)
4. The Yoroi Wallet is already making improvements in preparation for the dApp Connector release! [https://twitter.com/YoroiWallet/status/1422905221793996809](https://twitter.com/YoroiWallet/status/1422905221793996809)
5. We‚Äôre now up to 5 different states that are getting after BlockFi for their crypto lending activities. Reportedly, this includes New Jersey, Vermont, Alabama, Kentucky, &amp; Texas. Probably relevant for those building lending solutions on Cardano. [https://www.coindesk.com/blockfi-receives-fifth-cease-and-desist-from-kentucky-financial-regulator](https://www.coindesk.com/blockfi-receives-fifth-cease-and-desist-from-kentucky-financial-regulator)
6. Charles dropped an update to let us know that Light Purple Alonzo will come next week. That will bring in exchange partners. Mid-month there will be an update with official dates given for a primary date and a fallback date for triggering the hardfork combinator event. The fallback date will likely be one epoch (five days later). Part of this depends on how the exchange partners are doing with their integrations. Charles says it looks like late August or the first week of September. There will be a live HFC party where they will deploy ‚Äúsome things‚Äù minutes after the HFC. The Plutus Application Backend (PAB) might be integrated on something like September 10th. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261\_eImsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y261_eImsE)
7. Cardano‚Äôs closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it‚Äôs EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We‚Äôll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano‚Äôs deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system. [https://twitter.com/Birdson64827145/status/1423324771303972867](https://twitter.com/Birdson64827145/status/1423324771303972867)
8. Senators Toomey, Wyden, &amp; Lummis took to the Senate Floor to plead for a vote on their amendment which would fix the overly broad crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423381402905726983](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423381402905726983) [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423413806634577922](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423413806634577922)
9. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements. This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry! Please call your Senators and ask them to support the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis Amendment! [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423429377459736577](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423429377459736577) [https://twitter.com/WardDPatrick/status/1423464991441702912](https://twitter.com/WardDPatrick/status/1423464991441702912)

13. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. Both revisions were good for Cardano since they included proof-of-stake implicitly and then explicitly. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424040216961114112](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424040216961114112) [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424074177770921992](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424074177770921992)

18. Charles is already planning a strategy for dealing with the bill once it‚Äôs in the House of Representatives. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1424561446973628421](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1424561446973628421)
19. Very action packed day today (Aug 9). The Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema came together and proposed a compromise amendment to the crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. They were not able to include any section for exclusion of developers from the ‚Äúbroker‚Äù definition but did cover the previous progress on transaction validators and wallet sellers. [https://twitter.com/SenToomey/status/1424777137500864513](https://twitter.com/SenToomey/status/1424777137500864513)
20. Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema sought the required unanimous consent, but their attempt was thwarted by a disagreement over $50 billion in defense spending. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424832132204138503](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424832132204138503)
21. Several co-chairs of the Blockchain Caucus have already written a letter to all the members of the House of Representatives letting them know of the dire need to fix these crypto provisions once the bill hits the House. [https://twitter.com/RepTomEmmer/status/1424845416697323522](https://twitter.com/RepTomEmmer/status/1424845416697323522)

23. The Biggest Lobster Trap Harvest ever!!! A hacker decided to harvest over $600 million from the Polynetwork Bridge. We learned this lesson in the 2016 DAO Hack, but it‚Äôs really time that people stop giving up custody of their coins.

24. Senator Shelby laughably tried to claim he actually supported the crypto amendment in a tweet. The derision from the crypto community flowed like water out of the Amazon. [https://twitter.com/SenShelby/status/1425142857199980550](https://twitter.com/SenShelby/status/1425142857199980550)

52. Coinbase is going to invest $500M into crypto and 10% of all profit going forward (probably increasing with time) according to Brian Armstrong.

CryptoCurrency,Is blockchain the technology that paves the future of education?,"The big question is whether universities/schools can remain relevant to such a fast-moving industry. Many in crypto are suspicious of institutions and credentialism, favoring self-education, online innovation and community-based approaches. Universities themselves have to come to grips with¬†this¬†decentralization of information. Let‚Äôs see how well¬†they‚Äôre¬†up to the test.

Blockchain tech has gone a long way from cryptos. We now get more features from it. These include smart contracts and  (NFTs).  It‚Äôs not just for financial services anymore. For example, it‚Äôs making food supply chains more efficient than ever. 

In my opinion, universities should focus more on blockchain technology.

CryptoCurrency,Banks violated over $332B in Penalties Since 2000 ‚Äî Crypto Is necessity for the People,"# Banks have been fined more than $332 billion since 2000 for violating the rules

The current system requires that we can have blind trust in these institutions, but history has shown us that they never cease to violate this trust.

Since 2000, banks around the world have had to pay more than $332 billion in penalties for violations of rules in the financial services world. The reasons for these violations are varied:

* Mortgage abuses.
* Fraud.
* Toxic securities abuses.
* Investor protection violation.
* Economic sanction violation.
* Consumer protection violation
* Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
* Anti-money-laundering deficiencies.
* Banking violation.
* False Claims Act and related.
* Foreign exchange market manipulation.
* Price-fixing or anti-competitive practices.
* Interest rate benchmark manipulation.
* Tax violations.

I‚Äôll stop here, but I assure you that the list is long. To get a better idea, I invite you to discover for yourself [**the Violation Tracker maintained by the Good Jobs First website**](https://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/industry/financial%20services).

# The opacity of the banking system facilitates the human penchant for corruption

As you can see, bankers do not hesitate to act illegally in many areas: corruption, money laundering, abuse of home loans, fraud, and so on!

In the top 10 of banks most sanctioned for these practices against the interests of their clients, we find Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup:

# Crypto is a necessity for a better future

So the situation is clearly dire with the banking system. Its opacity is at the root of all these ills. Bitcoin is an incredible game-changer because of the transparency and the decentralization of its network. Bitcoin is the people‚Äôs currency backed by the people.

Crypto is a necessity to stop these illicit practices in the banking system. To understand this, you have to go beyond what the powerful in the current system constantly tell you. You have to dare to step out of your comfort zone to understand that another way is possible: that of Bitcoin.

The success of Bitcoin and Crypto is therefore clearly inevitable. It is only a matter of time.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Ive looked over Bitcoin far too long. It was about time,"The year was 2019 and I've seen the bitcoin and it's mysteries on the media but I never really noticed it per say. It never got my intention or focus until a friend at work told me about how his friend with a lavish lifestyle traveling the states made a great sum of money buying bitcoin very early. Ive never really heard anyone talk about Bitcoin before this, at least not that I could remember. A guy working close to us in his 60s just scoffed and said there was no use for it and how we were getting scammed but It didn't sway me. I was hooked. Into crypto anyway.. I didn't however buy into Bitcoin, at first. It was a coin here and a different coin there that I bought into the crazy hype. I've traded for other coins on the rise and may have made some money here and there but its unclear 2 years later. Things have changed and I've found a winner of a coin to shill to you. Possibly maybe you to me. Nobody has ever lost money in Bitcoin over a certain timeframe, maybe 4 years or so. I feel secured. I feel great.

CryptoCurrency,"Why Hex, the Newest Coin in the Top charts, is actually Worthless","CoinMarketCap has recently updated their listings to show Hex with a market capitalization of $71 billion. Even though this coin may seem like a great investment at first glance, a deeper inspection reveals this coin‚Äôs ulterior motives and lack of true value.

Here users can choose to lock their HEX for between 1 and 5555 days, and earn interest on that deposit which averages to a 40% APY. Up until now, HEX‚Äôs price has seen monumental growth. Since its initial release, the price of HEX has increased over 10,287x, meaning that anyone who invested $100 at the start of the project is now a millionaire.

# Reasons

* **No Fundamental Value** \- It hopes to be like Bitcoin, in the sense that people think it has value thus it increases in price. However, unlike Bitcoin, it is not established and does not have its own blockchain but instead runs on Ethereum. Many other coins have tried and failed to be the next Bitcoin, and there is no reason that Hex is different. Without any demand for the token, it can offer whatever interest rate it wants, and it still does not gain any value.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Heavy advertisement -** They heavily advertise their coin to the general public and always use wording about how much the coin has increased since its release. There is not a single legitimate project that brags about its earnings as a way to get investors interested in the project, whether in the cryptocurrency or traditional market.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Leveraging FOMO -** Their tactic is simply trying to get the average investor to feel FOMO, fear of missing out, about future increases in HEX price. However, the opposite is more likely to be true, as now that HEX is a massive cryptocurrency it is nearly impossible for it to see a 10,000x, or even a 10x, gain.

&amp;#x200B;

* **No project showcase-** Hex‚Äôs website has an entire section dedicated to dismissing the idea that HEX is a scam. Talk about self-awareness, right? There is not a single project that is not a scam that has to convince people otherwise.

[HEX going defensive on their own website](https://preview.redd.it/msx6tlltzum71.png?width=1165&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0d27d54b1f38b5f661189ba0e9ac49f18f15f82)

# Verdict

Crypto investors may want to stay away from HEX, as it has characteristics of a scam cryptocurrency like BitConnect. Though it may not explicitly be a scam in the sense of taking money from investors, it does not have any fundamental value, and will likely fall into obscurity over the coming years.",cryptocurrency

I would like to see if she can decrease her term and monthly payments? Or at least decrease the overall amount she has to pay to clear out this mortgage payment.

And if she refinances, what terms would you suggest she ask for?

CryptoCurrency,My new gas station just got a Bitcoin machine!,"As I was looking at it in awe, it was there that I had my epiphany: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to sell my crypto‚Äù.

So as exciting as this was for me, that two gas different gas stations within half a mile of each other both have two different types of Bitcoin machines, most people with crypto will probably be reluctant to use them for anything except deposits. 

And it was there that I started asking myself: ‚Äúwhy would I not want to spend my crypto?‚Äù

What it all comes down to is that the US tax laws are arbitrary and perhaps that is all by design. Now, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong; but all sales of crypto in the US are taxed as capital gains income. So quite simply I don‚Äôt want to be charged sales tax on top of capital gains tax for simply buying a soda at the gas station.

And unless these tax laws change, people (most familiar with crypto) in the US will be reluctant to use crypto as a currency‚Ä¶ and then it got me thinking, maybe that‚Äôs the intent? To eliminate any competition with the US dollar.

I‚Äôm all for paying your taxes, but I think the current laws in the US are trying to shove a round peg in a square hole.

Now I‚Äôm no financial advisor and this is not financial advice, but perhaps we need to create a new system meant to regulate crypto than say the SEC or Federal Reserve etc.

Because the reality is, some people do use it as a ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù, and others want to use it as as a currency. But simply put, what we currently have in the US doesn‚Äôt work, and it makes you think; maybe that‚Äôs the point?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,How often should you refinance your car?,"I financed a car about a year ago through a credit rebuilding company (RightWay if it matters). The interest rate was a horrible 20%, but I continued to make my payments and roughly 6 months later I was able to refinance down to a 14% through a different company. The process was a pain in the butt, but overall it lowered my payment and didn't extend my payoff time. This was about 3 months ago.

I have just started rebuilding my credit and have been getting rate offers from different companies. And was recently approved for a 7% interest rate without extending my loan period.

Would it be worth it to go through the refinance process again?

Or since I'm actively building credit, should I wait a bit and hope for an even lower rate?",finance

So, I could pay $30K cash for my car, or I could get a low rate loan, and then take that $30K and put it in to an S&amp;P index fund, for example, and make more than the car interest rate.

So then paying off the car loan.. do people just sell the monthly loan amount every month, and use that to pay the loan? Obviously you would need to pay taxes on the gains.

Or is there some other process to it?",finance
CryptoCurrency,Unpopular opinion: Bitcoin will never manage to become world currency but it may become useful in a different way.,"**1)** Bitcoin may potentially have **21million** tokens in total. Right now, all the money in the world are about **40 trillion** U.S. dollars. The total population of the world is around 8 billion. Right now, there is an average of 40000/8 =  **5000 USD** wealth per person in the globe. If we do the same with BTC, 0.021/8 = **0.0026 BTC** (for the sake of price, that's 90USD right now) per person in the globe.

I live in Europe, where average salary is around 1000 USD. If BTC was the world currency, my monthly payment would be around **0.00026BTC,** making 1 whole BTC cost around 19 million USD. 

Apparently, you see where this is going. Someone owning 52 BTC would be a todays billionaire. 

Having around many speculators who own Bitcoin and are expecting for world domination, there are many accounts owning a large amount of BTC. Basically, the wealth allocation of BTC is a bit random. Even a miner back in the days, could turn out to be a billionaire. In fact, due to its anonymity, we cannot know who that billion is, in the real world.

You may say YES! This is what we want, the average joe may now become rich! 

I believe you are wrong. If the average joe were to become billionaire, the world economy would most likely collapse, and that person would probably die from cocaine overdose.

Worse than that, I'd rather have Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos billionaires in the world I'm living, than anonymous drug cartels. At least now, there is some transparency into what these billionaires are doing with their money. (You may disagree, but I understand your frustration).

Until adoption, the allocation of BTC is rather random, whoever gets more now, will become rich. There are many people out there who are working instead of speculating. These people won't accept BTC and the currency will collapse, since most people won't accept it as a real currency.

**2)** No government may practice monetary policy on BTC. 

You may say, YES! This is what we wanted from the beginning. A completely decentralized currency. 

Those who know economics may understand the importance of monetary policies, but I won't stick to it, since the topic is rather complicated. If you want to understand more on monetary policy, check this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dq7mMort9o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dq7mMort9o)

However, I ask you the following: What will happen when somebody's wallet gets lost and cannot be retrieved? Obviously the total amount of tokens available in the market will decrease, making the other tokens more expensive. Basically, whenever a wallets gets lost, all prices in the world will have to adapt to the new standard. If the wallet contained 1 BTC, now the average wage would be 0.020999999/8. 

Monetary policy is useful for that reason too. 

**3)** The transition between all currencies in the world into BTC, would bring the whole world into collapse. I'm not taking about the downfall of USD or EUR, I'm taking about the downfall of all the companies in the world. 

People would stop caring about selling products, and will start caring about buying BTC. Since everybody would be bull on BTC, companies will not have a reason into producing. All they will have to do is buy BTC now, not move these money and become filthy rich.

The problem with this, is that it rewards **passivity**. This brings **deflation** in the world and the BTC will be useless, because what is important in an economy, is not the currency, but the means of production. Money means nothing if you cannot buy anything with it.

All the aforementioned apply to all cryptocurrencies.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Requesting Advice On What To Do With Excess Money Per Month To Set My Future Self Up For Success,"Hi All,

My family and friends are not comfortable talking about money, so I've had to learn everything I know from reading the wiki, books, and most of your posts. I'd like to make sure I'm making the right financial decisions and wondering what you may do if you were in my shoes. I'm in my mid 20s.

Income: I'm at about 120k ($6,800 per month after taxes/medical) in a MCOL area

Expenses: I'm spending about $2,600 per month (this includes rent, utilities, food, gas, subscriptions, phone, internet, insurance)

Investments: $30,000 in a rollover IRA from my previous employer and $3,600 in a Roth IRA that I started late 2021 (planning on maxing this out by EOY and is not included in the above expenses). I do know it may be better to contribute instead to a Traditional IRA at my income level but I haven't had a chance to look into it a whole bunch, so this is probably one area where advice could be necessary.

I don't have a 401k plan with my current employer and won't until early 2022. Once I'm in that plan, I plan on maxing yearly contributions (excluding employer match). This would bring my income down to $5,800 per month.

Debt: $15,000 in student loans at 4% with the Fed (payments not included in expenses as payments

Savings: $5,000 emergency fund (2 months of expenses as I could trim some stuff from my monthly expenses)

This would bring me down to $4,200 in available money per month before the 401k plan and $3,200 after to do with as I please.

I'm planning on putting $600 per month for the next 4 months towards the Roth IRA, then $500 per month starting with my 2022 contributions. I'm not entirely sure what else to do with the other $2,700 - $3,600 per month as I'm happy renting right now so don't need to prep for a downpayment on a house.

I've thought about investing some of the money in ETFs on a taxable account but wasn't sure how much I should throw in there or if I even should. I could also put it towards student loans for now but not sure what I'd do after that once they're paid off. I'd appreciate any and all advice!",finance

personalfinance,College Senior Having a Panic Moment,"Just gonna swallow my embarrassment because I did this and I don't feel like making a throw away. Please be kind in your replies- I've had NO financial education beyond the little I've learned already, and my parents are not good fiscal examples. I'm panicking quite a bit because I'm scared that my student loans are going to keep me in the place I live currently, and I'd like to move to a different state ASAP.

21F. Senior in college. I'm gonna throw out a breakdown of my month to month expenses, then my student loans, then my income info. Please give me any and all tips to cut back on spending and start saving more than I've already tried to. It's my goal to be able to move from the midwest down to Florida before next winter, but if it takes until Spring of 2023 I'll be sad but fully understand that my financial situation is my own fault. I'm hoping to buy a house down there so I can pay an actual mortgage, and not just the rent equivalent. I don't think I'll have anyone else to help me pay for that at that point.

**Bills:**

* Rent - $615/Month + $8.95 withdrawal ""convenience fee""
* Apartment Utilities - $25(ish)/Month
* City Electric - $65(ish)/month
* Internet Services + Leasing their router($12) - $94.92
* Care Credit - $29/month, three months left to $0 balance
* Capital One Student Card - Minimum $50/month, current balance is $1000ish. I pay more than $50/month
* Car (Gas) - $15/month in a typical month
* Car (Coolant) $15/month
* Mental Health Meds - $25/month
* Grocery Store Stuff: $100/month
* Mental Health Dopamine Spending - $200/month (I'm trying to get better about this one. It's an uphill battle)

A note on the CapOne card- I moved at the tail end of July, and racked up about $875 on that card in the process because I thought I was fiscally prepared and was wrong. In a normal year that card's balance is less than $100, and it gets paid off every single month.

**Income Streams:**

* $15/hr x 39hrs per week, I.T. Apprenticeship
* $12/hr x 16hrs per weekend, temp staffing gigs
* I also donate plasma when I'm able to, two appointments a week without bonuses is usually $90-$120 dollars. (Next week I'll make bare minimum $600 off of it thanks to a promo thing happening)

My apprenticeship is *supposed* to turn into an actual salaried contract at the end of it, which should be in the next three months. Glassdoor is ballpark estimating 77K per year, but I'm not sure how much I trust that estimate. 

**Student Loans:**

I've been thinking about using the avalanche method because I think it's going to be the most effective and satisfying route, but I'm open to suggestions. Also, I realized I f'd up by using Sallie Mae for five semesters- I no longer use them to finance anything. I just didn't know any better.

* EdFinancial (FAFSA) - $1,966.09 - 5.05% interest rate
* EdFinancial (FAFSA) - $3,500 - 5.05% interest rate (Subsidized)
* EdFinancial (FAFSA) - $6,601.57 - 4.530% interest rate
* EdFinancial (FAFSA) - $3,250 - 2.750% interest rate
* EdFinancial (FAFSA) - $1,750 - 3.730% interest rate (Subsidized)
* Edfinancial (FAFSA) - $1,000 - 3.730% Interest Rate
* Sallie Mae - $8,8898.86 - 11.75% Interest Rate
* Sallie Mae - $8,779.48 - 12% Interest Rate
* Sallie Mae - $7,409.95 - 9.375% Interest Rate
* Salle Mae - $3,383.03 - 9.375% Interest Rate

Although I do think that it may be better to try and consolidate the Sallie Mae loans at least through a local Credit Union. I have a good relationship with them (have had and paid off loans in the past, and am currently attempting to finance a new-to-me car through them). My questions are should I look into refinancing SM loans so I can get lower interest rates, if so what rates should I aim for, and what repayment method might work best? Also if there are any other streams of income I should look into please let me know! I'm on Rover but don't have any income from it yet. Also, any big financial roadblocks or things I should save up for for a multi-state (US) move?

**TL;DR: I'm panicking over all of these really big numbers and don't have anyone close to me who can give me good, practical advice on how to handle this without working myself to death**",finance

personalfinance,Should I take out a loan to cover my Mortgage Payment?,"Hello, 

I (26m) have a remaining mortgage of $340,000 with a 2.75% interest rate under the VA loan and the value of my house has risen to $430,000-$450,000 within two years. My Father has been living and taking care of house, while I am stationed across the country. The house is in a very rural area, somewhat close to a major military base, but unfortunately it is not a favorable location for renting. Most people in the area buy houses instead of rent.   
   
 

I contacted a realtor, and they listed the house for sale at $450,000. The house has been on the market for two weeks and it has had about 8 showings and 0 offers. If I continue to receive no offers, I am going to lower the price to 430,000 or 415,000. 

My Dad is about to move out in mid-November, but his last payment on the house will be this September. I am considering taking out a General Loan from my TSP (Military Retirement Fund) to cover the monthly payments and maintenance in case I don‚Äôt sell in time ‚Äì which is about two months. The loan is 10,000 at a 1.25% interest rate and the monthly payments are about $173 for 5 years. I only have about $2500 saved up, and it will make one more house payment before I need financial assistance. 

Another issue is the escrow payment, my insurance company reimbursed me about $2700 to send to the mortgage company because they had to change the insurance policy. If I keep the money, the monthly house payment will increase in November to $2200. And if I send them the money, the house payment will remain around $1900. 

My biggest fear is not being able to sell the house and having to foreclose or filing for a DIL of foreclosure on the house. If it comes down to that then I will own up to my mistakes and take the hit.",finance

personalfinance,Should my wife and I buy our first home right now?,"***UPDATE***

So my wife and I had a long discussion and we have agreed to put at least $2,000 per paycheck on pay day (every 2 weeks) towards her student loans until June of 2022 or until we have decreased her loans to $50,000- whichever comes first. After which we will move into an apartment and continue putting at least $1,000 per paycheck on payday towards her student loans for the next year or until we have $20,000 in student loans (whichever comes first) and putting at least $500 per paycheck into savings on top of the $15,000 that we have currently to help with a down payment when we hit our goals. At that point in time we will start looking to buy our first home regardless of market conditions. We also agreed that we will look at the housing market again in June of 2022 and if prices have stabilized and interest rates are still low we can see about buying our first home then with significantly less debt. 

I also just wanted to say that the issue was never that my wife didn‚Äôt enjoy living here or that she didn‚Äôt want to live with my parents. Yes, she wants her own place - and so do I - but her desire to buy a house right now was coming from a place of ‚Äúkeeping up with the Joneses‚Äù and buying a house just because that‚Äôs what society says we should do. After giving her some concrete numbers and explaining how it could financially hurt us in the long run she agreed that it didn‚Äôt make sense to do it right now and that having a laid out plan/goals to work towards would be beneficial for us to stay disciplined in our savings/paying off debt. We appreciate all of the feedback from everyone! We would not have been able to come to this decision and game plan had it not been for your input. 


‚Ä¶


I am 30 years old, wife is 28, and we have a 9 month old son. My wife just graduated from PT school in May and has been working since July. She is salaried and makes $70,000/year and I make roughly $50,000/year. 

We have been living in my parent‚Äôs master suite that they initially built for my grandparents before they passed away while she has been in grad school for the past 3 years. We have our own small living room, bedroom, and bathroom and the suite is attached to the kitchen. My older brother is also living in the upstairs while his house is being built. There are times when it does feel crowded and where we don‚Äôt have ALL the privacy that we would like, but for the most part my parents are very good about respecting boundaries and giving us our space. 

My wife has really been pushing for us to buy a house by the end of the year. I would love to have our own place as well, but with the way the housing market is right now I don‚Äôt want to over-pay for a small starter house and then be trapped in it or be forced to sell it for a loss if the housing market corrects in the next couple of years when I anticipate our family will grow some more. My wife has expressed that she ‚Äúreally just wants our own place‚Äù and I feel as though she wants to buy a house because that‚Äôs the ‚Äúnext step.‚Äù

The other issue at play is that we have $90,000 in student loans from her undergrad and grad school combined. 

Is it absurd for us to even consider buying a home right now? Would renting be more appropriate? If it were up to me, we would just stay at my parents house for 1 more year and pay off all- or most- of our loans.  But unfortunately I don‚Äôt think that is going to be an option.

Also, for what it is worth- we love in north GA and we have $15,000 in savings and both of our cars are paid off. I contribute $500 a month to my Roth IRA and $600 a month to our HSA. I also have $25,000 in an individual Fidelity account and 6% of my income goes to my work 401k to max employer match.  

Any advice would be much appreciated.",finance

**Generally speaking, you will either incur no tax, income tax, or capital gains tax depending on the transaction type. Also, generally, crypto that you receive as rewards (staking, interest) are taxed as income. Cryptocurrency that you sell will generate capital gains/loss tax.** 

**As of right now, rewards from debit/credit cards are not taxed as income. The IRS views crypto back the same way as it views cash back or airline miles earned  from cards, as a discount on your purchase, not as income.**

##SECTION 1: Excerpts from the ***IRS*** description of cryptocurrency as stated on IRS. GOV

‚ÄúCryptocurrency is a type of virtual currency that uses cryptography to secure transactions¬†that are digitally recorded on a distributed ledger, such as a blockchain.‚Äù\
‚ÄúVirtual currency is a digital representation of value, other than a representation of the U.S. dollar or a foreign currency (‚Äúreal currency‚Äù), that functions as a unit of account, a store of value, and a medium of exchange.‚Äù\
‚ÄúRegardless of the label applied, if a particular asset has the characteristics of virtual currency, it will be treated as virtual currency for Federal income tax purposes.‚Äù\
‚ÄúVirtual currency is treated as property and general tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.‚Äù

##SECTION 2: Types of taxes associated with crypto and their rates

###2A Income Tax

Your ***tax liability*** for certain cryptocurrency transactions (listed and explained in section 3) will be based on one of the seven tax rates that apply to you based on your ***adjusted*** ***gross*** ***income*** and filing status. 

The proceeds you receive from qualifying transactions will be taxed according to your personal income bracket along with the rest of your income. This is a different tax than the tax that‚Äôs levied on the sale of ***capital*** ***assets***. 

The 2021 income tax brackets:

| RATE | SINGLE | MARRIED/JOINT |
|:-|-:|:-:|
| 10% | $0-$9,950 | $0-$19,000 |
| 12% | $9,951-$40,525 | $19,901-$81,050 |
| 22% | $40,526-$86,375 | $81,051-$172,750 | 
| 24% | $86,376-$164,925 | $172,751-$329,850 |
| 32% | $164,296-$209,425 | $329,851-$418,850 |
| 35% | $209,426-$523,600 | $418,851-$628,300 |
| 37% | $523,601 + | $628,301 + |

| RATE | MARRIED/SEPARATE | HEAD OF HOUSE |
|:-|-:|:-:|
| 10% | $0-$9,950 | $0-$14,200 |
| 12% | $9,951-$40,525 | $14,201-$54,200 |
| 22% | $40,526-$86,376 | $54,201-$86,350 |
| 24% | $86,376-$164,925 | $86,351-$164,900 |
| 32% | $164,926-$209,425 | $164,901-$209,400 |
| 35% | $209,426-$314,150 | $209,401-$523,600 |
| 37% | $314,151 + | $523,601 + |

###2B Capital Gains: Short Term

Short term capital gains tax is applied to the ***realized*** ***gains*** from the selling, trading, or ***disposal*** of cryptocurrency that you‚Äôve held for less than one year. 

The tax rate is the same as the rate you‚Äôd pay for ordinary income, based on your personal tax bracket, the same brackets listed above in section 2A. 


###2C Capital Gains: Long Term

Long term capital gains tax is applied to crypto that you hold for more than one year before selling or trading. These rates are typically much lower than ordinary income. 2021 long term capital gains brackets: 

| RATE | SINGLE | MARRIED FILING SEPARATE |
|:-|-:|:-:|
| 0% | $0-$40,000 | $0-$40,000 |
| 15% | $40,401-$445,850 | $40,401-$445,850 |
| 20% | $445,000 + | $445,000 |

| RATE | MARRIED FILING JOINT | HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD |
|:-|-:|:-:|
| 0% | $0-$80,000 | $0-$54,100 |
| 15% | $80,801-$501,600 | $54,101-$473,750 |
| 20% | $501,600 + | $473,751 + |

___

###2C Collectible Capital Gains

The IRS has not issued a definitive guidance on how certain cryptocurrency may be taxed in this way but a growing opinion is that some tokens will fall under the IRS definition of ***collectible*** ***capital*** ***assets***. This tax has a flat rate of 28% We‚Äôll cover these tokens in the next section. Can you guess what‚Äôs in question?

The IRS defines collectible assets broadly. Any work of art, most metals, gems, coins and this super general statement: Any personal property that the IRS determines a collectible under ***IRC*** ***Section*** ***408(m)***. 

**It is important to point out that each block of income is taxed at the rate it corresponds to and capital gains do to push your ordinary income into higher tax bracket. I‚Äôll repeat this again later because it can be quite confusing.**

___


##SECTION 3 Taxable events, corresponding tax rates, non taxable events, and required reporting

The part you‚Äôve been waiting for! Which cryptocurrency transactions trigger a ***taxable*** ***event*** ? How are they taxed? Let‚Äôs explore. 

Examples in **Section 4** for different scenarios. 

###3A 3B 3C Purchasing, Holding and Transferring. 

These are not taxable events. No tax liability of any kind is incurred by these actions alone and you don‚Äôt have to report crypto that you buy and transfer if you don‚Äôt sell or trade it. Even if the value of your crypto rises or falls dramatically, you own no taxes because you have not realized gains. 

**NOTE:** Having a Record of every transaction you make, regardless of tax liability or the current reporting requirement, is very important. 

To be able to properly report when you *do* trigger a taxable event you‚Äôll need to know either your ***cost*** ***basis*** or the ***fair*** ***market*** ***value*** (one of these apply depending on how you acquired it and what you do with it) for each transaction, the amount of fiat spent, the amount of crypto purchased, the date of purchase and any fees you paid.

It‚Äôs also important to note that your cost basis is different than your ***average*** ***cost***. 

###3D Crypt rewards cards: general

Generally, the IRS categorizes credit and debit card rewards as non-taxable. They are treated as rebates or discounts on what you purchased. 

That implies that for now, all those juicy crypto back rewards we get do not trigger any taxable event and no reporting requirements upon receipt (Capital gains, income, or otherwise). 

Selling them will trigger a taxable event though, so you‚Äôll need to know the fair market value at the time you received the rewards and the amount received for each transaction. 
Sounds like a hassle? There are multiple ways to record transactions, I do it manually through Blockfolio (now FTX) but there‚Äôs software that can track *almost* everything. 

**NOTE** If you receive cryptocurrency through rewards, staking, interest or any means other than purchasing (using fiat or crypto) the fair market value (market price) at the time you received them becomes your cost basis for tax purposes. 

Some platforms may send you a ***1099-MISC*** if you go over a certain amount of rewards, but that doesn‚Äôt make it taxable. Whether something is listed on a 1099-MISC and whether it‚Äôs taxable are two different questions. 

  - ###Crypto rewards cards: Fiat Payments

Crypto rewards Cards that are pre-loaded with fiat, or that utilize fiat as the means of payment, do not trigger a taxable event when you make a purchase using the card and receive crypto back because you are paying with the US Dollar, the ***legal*** ***tender*** of The United States. 
   

  - ###Crypto rewards cards: Crypto Payments

Cards that spend your crypto, whether they are rewards cards or not, trigger a taxable event. (stable coins are no exception, but do not incur tax liabilities in *most* cases) When using a card to spend crypto, the card issuing platform is liquidating your crypto to fiat then using the fiat for the purchase via the card, this is a disposal of a capital asset. 

Even if the provider of the goods/service you purchase from accepts crypto, and you actually transfer your crypto to them via a card or any other method, you are triggering a taxable event by trading crypto for goods and services. 


  - ###Crypto rewards cards: Stable coin payments 

Crypto Card issuing platforms that guarantee a 1:1 ratio between US Dollars and the stable coin the card utilizes, will not result in capital gains or losses, but, once again this is the disposal of a capital asset so each transaction is still required to be reported. 

Stable coins are still cryptocurrency and this means that transactions involving stable coins are disposal of capital assets. Although minimal, stable coin prices can fluctuate. If you‚Äôre not guaranteed a 1:1 ratio, you may trigger a taxable event and you‚Äôll need to calculate your profit or loss. 

While using your crypto to pay for goods and services via a pre-loaded card triggers a taxable event, it doesn‚Äôt always result in a capital gain. If the fair market value at the time of your payment to a merchant is lower than your cost basis, you may actually incur a ***capital*** ***loss*** that can be used to offset gains. (With some exceptions)

###3E 3F 3G Staking Rewards, Earning interest, (including Defi) and Airdrops

Each one of these transactions trigger a taxable event. They are viewed by the IRS in the same way as fiat interest in traditional finance. They are required to be reported and are taxed as income at your personal tax rate, not as capital gains‚Ä¶ unless or until you sell. 

What separates these payments from traditional fiat interest is in crypto, for each individual transaction, you need to know the fair market value on the date you received the crypto because upon selling these rewards, the fair market value becomes the cost basis that you must use to calculate your profit/loss and the resulting capital gain or capital loss. 


###3H 3I Selling crypto for fiat and crypto to crypto trades/transactions

These are both taxable events and both result in capital gains/loss tax. Selling crypto, your property as defined by the IRS, is of course a taxable event and profit is taxed the same as stocks, gold, or any other ‚Äúproperty‚Äù. Capital gains apply, either short or long term and according to the bracket you‚Äôre in. 

Trading one crypto to another crypto is taxed exactly the same way. You‚Äôre  disposing of one asset and purchasing another that are both valued in US dollars. 

###3J Cryptocurrency mining and (staking revisited)

Tax calculations based on the receiving of cryptocurrency through mining are taxed similarly to staking and there‚Äôs a lot of debate about this, especially staking rewards. 

According to the IRS, when a taxpayer successfully mines Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency he/she must include it in their gross income after determining the fair market value at the time they receive it. 

There are two ways to report mining rewards on your taxes: as a  ***hobby*** or as a ***business*** as defined by the IRS. In both, much like interest, Airdrops, and staking rewards, the fair market value (at the time you received them) of your mining rewards will be considered income and taxed at your personal tax bracket. 

As a hobby, this will be reported on ***form*** ***1040*** as ‚Äúother income‚Äù. If you run a mining operation as a business, you can fully deduct expenses and the net profit is taxable and reported on ***Schedule*** ***C***. 

###3K Crypto received as payments for goods and services, crypto received as wages and salary and using crypto to pay employees

   - ###Crypto received as payment for goods and services 

Similar to mining, payments received in Cryptocurrency must be converted to their value in US dollars and included as income. Expenses can be deducted if you are a business owner. 

  - ###Crypto received as a form of wage or salary payment, for employees and employers. 

Employers must convert  employee earnings paid in crypto to US dollars on the employees W-2 form. These wages are subject to the same withholdings as payment in US dollars. Employers also incur capital gains tax for disposing of their crypto as payment to employees. 

And again, the fair market value at the time you receive the crypto becomes your cost basis if you trade. 

###3L NFTs

Creating an NFT is not a taxable event, and has no value to report when you create it, (if you paid a network or Gas fee with crypto to mint the NFT, that is a disposal and Capital gains apply as if you sold or traded) however, it is considered a cryptocurrency by the IRS. Trading an NFT for another NFT, disposing of an NFT for a fungible cryptocurrency or US dollars is a taxable event subject to capital gains/losses. 

Many NFTs are considered collectibles and may fall under the IRS definition of a ***collectible*** ***capital*** ***asset***. The IRS has not issued guidance on this so the presumption right now is to use the definition of a standard capital asset. 

Trading cards, for example, are not specifically listed by the IRS as collectible capital assets but have historically been taxed as such and this brings to mind NFTs like the NBA Top Shots series. 

The short term rule applies to collectibles in the same way as regular capital gains tax, it‚Äôs based on your income tax bracket. However, Long term collectible capital gains tax is a flat 28%. That‚Äôs strange to me. 

**I want to reiterate that currently the IRS has not stated that any cryptocurrency is to be taxed as a  collectible capital asset tax. It is not out of the realm of possibility for them to do so and it‚Äôs something to keep in mind.**

There are NFTs that do not fit the definition of a collectible. Take Uniswap V3 as an example. Liquidity positions are not represented by ERC-20 tokens anymore, they are represented by NFTs and are obviously different than NFTs that represent art of any kind.

##SECTION 4 Determining your profit/loss from different transactions and your tax liability with examples of transactions from section 3

You‚Äôre going to basically need a record of every transaction that involves cryptocurrency. You can do it manually with a notes app, excel spreadsheet or a crypto tax software tool that pulls the information from all your exchanges and wallets. Some of these software programs don‚Äôt cover everything though. You‚Äôll get reports from many exchanges and you can find a record of your transactions on these exchanges. 

####INFO YOU‚Äôll NEED
  - cost basis or fair market value
  - how you acquired the crypto (income or purchase)
  - how much crypto you acquired or sold 
  - how much fiat you invested or how much fiat received for the sell
  - the date you acquired or sold the crypto 


###EXAMPLE 1 Determining capital gain and taxes owed on crypto you bought, held, transferred then later sold. 

**NOTE**: Remember to include fees. Fees increase your costs basis which serves to lower your Capital gains, assuming you buy low sell high. 

  - Frank buys 10 ETH  on December 10, 2020. 1 ETH was $1000 and he paid a 0.5% fee - He spent $10,050
  - The transaction fee was 0.5%, or $50
  - $10,000 invested + $50 in fees = $10,050 / 10 ETH = **$1005** cost basis per ETH
 - Frank transfers the 10 ETH to a ledger where he plans to hold it for one year. 

 **NOTE** No fee =  Cost basis is the exact price per coin. Fee = include the fee, $50 in this case, to your total investment, divide total investment by total coins purchased. (If you incur other fees for transfers, those can be included as well.) Cost basis is now $1005 for tax purposes. 

If you incur fees when you sale, deduct those fees from your total proceeds. 

  - On December 11, 2021 (over 1 year later) Frank transfers back to an exchange and sells 5 of his 10 ETH when Ethereum his $10,000. He pays $250 in fees. Remember that he paid $1005 per ETH when he made his purchase. 

  - 5 ETH X $10,000 per ETH = $50,000 - $250 fee = **$49,750** net proceeds 
  - The next step is to deduct your cost basis from your proceeds from the sale. 
  - **$1005** cost basis X 5 ETH = **$5025** total cost basis
   - Net proceeds $49,750 - $5025 cost basis is **$44,725** long term capital gain. 
   - Frank is married and they file jointly, she has a boyfriend but that doesn‚Äôt affect taxes. Their ordinary taxable income (not including the crypto proceeds) is $90,000 which puts them in the 15% long term capital gains bracket. 

**NOTE** capital gains cannot push your ordinary income into a higher tax bracket. 

   - $44,725 capital gain X 0.15 (taxed at 15%) capital gain tax rate = **$6,708.75** owed in capital gains tax

### EXAMPLE 2 Expanding on the above scenario to illustrate the FIFO (first in first out) method of tax reporting. 
 

  - Frank also purchased 2 more ETH in March 2021 (we‚Äôll assume no fees this time for simplicity). Ethereum was $2,500. His cost basis for these 2 ETH is $2,500 each. 
  - We know from the first example that Frank sold 5 ETH from the original 10 he purchased. He now has 7 ETH. 5 left with a cost basis of **$1005** and 2 with a cost basis of **$2,500**
  - On January 1, 2022 Ethereum drops to $2000 and He sells 6 ETH
  - 6 ETH X $2000 = **$12,000** net proceeds 

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Since Frank has two different cost basis for Ethereum and his sale was for more ETH than he owns at the first cost basis of $1005, the sell needs to be split into two transactions when figuring taxes. 

FULL TRANSACTION
6 ETH sold at $2,000 ETH = $12,000 


TAX TRANSACTION ONE
  - He has 5 ETH from 2020 with a cost basis of $1005 per ETH They were purchased first, they sell first. FIFO
   - 5 ETH @ $1005 cost basis = $5025 cost basis, sold for $2000 per ETH or $10,000 total proceeds 
   - $10,000 proceeds  - $5025 cost basis  = **$4,975 LONG TERM NET GAIN on these 5 ETH**

TAX TRANSACTION TWO
   - He has 2 ETH that he purchased for $2,500 and sold one of them (he sold 6 total, the 5 left from his original purchase plus 1 from his latest purchase = 6)
 - All 10 of the original ETH he bought have been sold. He must now use 1 of the 2 he recently purchased to determine his tax liability on this 6 ETH sale. 
   - 1 ETH @ $2,500 cost basis sold for $2,000 total
   - $2,000 proceeds - $2,500 cost basis  = **$500 SHORT TERM NET LOSS**

  - Frank has two taxable situations here that resulted from one sale. A **$4,975 long term capital gain** that he owes 15% tax on ($746.25) and a **$500 Capital loss** that he can claim. 

**NOTE** Capital losses are first used to offset gains of the same type. So, short term losses are first deducted from short term gains and long term against long term. Losses of either type that are higher than gains of the same type can then be used to deduct against the other kind of gain. 

###If you have an overall net capital loss for a tax year, you can deduct up to $3,000 of that loss against your income. Any capital loss in excess of $3,000 can be carried over to subsequent years and deducted against capital gains first then other kinds of income. Married filing separate is $1,500 for these scenarios. 

###EXAMPLE 3 crypto received as staking or interest payments. Claiming them as income. 

Karen has  10,000 ADA that she wants to stake. She staked and received rewards in February. 

| REWARD/DATE | ADA FMV | REWARD VALUE | 
|:-|-:|:-:|
| 6.124 FEB 5 | $0.44 | $2.69 |
| 6.654 FEB 10 | $0.93 | $4.26 |
| 5.976 FEB 15 | $0.86 | $3.53 |
| 6.612 FEB 20 | $1.12 | $7.41 |
| 6.489 FEB 25 | $1.08 | $7.01 |

  *FMV in the table is Fair Market Value, the price 1 ADA was trading for at the time rewards were received. 
- Karen earned 31.855 ADA 
  - Each of these rewards has a different fair market value( $.44 $.93 $.86 $1.12 $1.08 per ADA) and, as shown, represent income of $2.69 + $4.26 + $3.53 + $7.41 + $7.01 each for a total of **$24.90 of income**.     
  - This $24.90 will simply be added together with the rest of Karen‚Äôs taxable income. 
 - Karen is single and has an adjustment gross income of $35,020 which includes the staking income. 
 - $35,020 puts her in the 12% bracket, with the first $9,950 is taxed at the 10% rate. 
 - Karen‚Äôs owes 10% on the first $9,950 = $995
 - The remaining $25,070 is taxed at 12% = $3008.40

###EXAMPLE 4 Expanding on staking rewards. Selling them and using FIFO

We know that our staking and interest rewards are considered income and taxed according to our personal tax bracket. This changes when you sell your staking reward. You‚Äôll owe capital gains tax. 

In a different scenario, instead of just holding the rewards and claiming them as income, she sold the rewards. 

**NOTE** **If you sell the rewards in the same calendar year that you receive them then you will not claim them as income and claim capital gains, only capital gains. You will use the fair market value to determine your cost basis (same info in the previous table) and short term capital gain.** 

Let‚Äôs say Karen sold those first 10,000 and just has the staking rewards left to illustrate. 

 - Karen decides to sell the rest of her ADA and all she has left are staking rewards. 
 - Karen received these ADA as rewards so she‚Äôll have to know the fair market value at the time she received them. 

*same table from above

| REWARD/DATE | ADA FMV | REWARD VALUE | 
|:-|-:|:-:|
| 6.124 FEB 5 | $0.44 | $2.69 |
| 6.654 FEB 10 | $0.93 | $4.26 |
| 5.976 FEB 15 | $0.86 | $3.53 |
| 6.612 FEB 20 | $1.12 | $7.41 |
| 6.489 FEB 25 | $1.08 | $7.01 |



 - She sells 18 ADA at $3.00. Assuming these were next on the list to be sold using FIFO, she uses ADA from her first 3 rewards dates. 
 - This is one sell but remember that we have several different cost basis so we‚Äôll have to break it down. 
 - First out of her 18 total sell is the 6.124 ADA she received on February 5th, ADA was trading at $0.44 that day, $0.44 is the fair market value and now becomes her Cost basis.  
 - 6.124 ADA X $0.44 Cost basis = $2.69 total cost
 - 6.124 ADA X $3.00 ADA sell price = $18.37 total proceeds
 - $18.37 total proceeds - $2.69 total cost = **$15.68 short term capital gain**
 - The second part of the 18 ADA transaction will use the 6.654 ADA she received on February 10th with a fair market value, now her cost basis, of $0.93
 - 6.654 ADA X $0.93 cost basis = $5.72 total cost. 
 - 6.654 ADA X $3.00 ADA sell price = $19.96 proceeds 
 - $19.96 proceeds - $5.72 = **$14.24 short term capital gain.** 
 - The third part of the transaction will use 5.222 (6.124 + 6.654 + 5.222 = 18) out of the 5.976 ADA she received on February 15th with a cost basis of $0.86
 - 5.222 ADA X $0.86 cost basis = $4.49 total cost
 - 5.222 ADA X $3.00 ADA sale price = $15.67 proceeds 
 - $15.67 proceeds - $4.49 total cost = **$11.18 short term Capital gains.** 
 - Now we add each part of the transaction. 
 - $15.68 + $14.24 + $11.18 = **$41.11 total short term capital gains** from the sale of 18 ADA received as staking rewards. 
 - Karen is married in this scenario and they had a combined income of $90,000 which puts the top end of their income and the short term gains in the 24% tax bracket. 
 - Karen and Kevin will owe $9.87 in short term Capital gains tax on the sale of the 18 ADA at $3.00

###EXAMPLE 5 Crypto to Crypto trades

  - Kevin wants to buy TRAC but can only find it with a BTC pair. 
   - He buys $250 worth of Bitcoin at $50,000
  - $250 investment / $50,000 BITCOIN = .005 BTC purchased
  - He trades his .005 BTC for 650 TRAC at $0.40 - Bitcoin had risen to $52,000 at the time of his TRAC trade. 
  - When you trade crypto to crypto, you‚Äôre essentially selling one crypto to fiat and buying another crypto. The IRS views this as a disposal of one capital asset and the purchase of another. 
   - .005 BTC X 52K = $260 / $.40 TRAC = 650 TRAC
  - His cost basis for BTC was $50,000 ($250) and when he disposed of it for TRAC the price had risen to $52,000 ($260)
  - $260 proceeds - $250 cost = $10 short term capital gain. 
  - Kevin incurred a capital gain on his BTC to TRAC trade. 

###Ways to minimize taxes owed. 

  - Monitor your holding period. Try to turn short term gains into long term gains. 
  - Use losses to offset gains and wash sales are currently allowed but be careful because the IRS has a clause called ***The Economic Substance Doctrine***
  - Keep records of all of the fees that you pay for everything
  - Donate to charity
  - Gift crypto to family members 
  - Consider a crypto self directed retirement account 
  - If you mine, deduct every expense possible. 
  - Use every deduction or credit available to lower your taxable income

This post was born from my research into tax law and code due to my disagreements with the way newly mined or minted coins are taxed.

___

TLDR: If you purchase crypto, you pay capital gains/loss when you sell. If it‚Äôs a reward (except from crypto back cards) from interest, staking or mining, you owe income tax on it and if you sell it then you owe capital gains tax. 

Any crypto you trade/sell/dispose of is subject to Capital gains tax.

___ 



###Edit: There is software that can compile most of your trading, staking, etc for you. Koinly, CrytoTrader,Tax and CoinTracker are highly recommended.

###Edit: You don‚Äôt have to use FIFO, that‚Äôs just a common method and most preferred. It‚Äôs easier to keep up with in my opinion but that‚Äôs your choice.

###Edit: It‚Äôs important to note that long term Capital gains will not push your ordinary income into a higher tax bracket. Your ordinary income is taxed first.",cryptocurrency

Forex,Weekly Breakdown of What's Going on in the Markets,"Since this Subreddit has seen a large influx of people who want to post about high leverage and news trading I thought I would switch it up a bit and give you a little rundown of some news regarding the market that came out over the past trading week to just keep in the back of your mind as you continue to trade. I'm not going to be telling you what to do or what side of the market you should be on or of any setups so if you're looking for that kind of information then probably best for you to click off this post right now.

**The Feds**

How could we talk about the market without talking about our good old friend: the Federal Reserve. If we take a look at the daily chart for the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 we can pretty clearly see that we're sitting at some peaks. However, if you weren't paying attention you may have missed that two of the Fed Presidents are selling their stocks over 'ethics concerns' ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/09/feds-rosengren-to-sell-individual-stock-portfolio-to-address-ethics-concerns.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/09/feds-rosengren-to-sell-individual-stock-portfolio-to-address-ethics-concerns.html)). Is it really ""ethics concerns"" or are they selling at the top of the market due to the potential tapering which may not be too far off? Might be a coincidence but who can say.

**Seasonality**

If you keep up with seasonality then you should know that historically September is a pretty bad month for the stock market.

&amp;#x200B;

[Seasonality](https://preview.redd.it/podqv6nxyym71.jpg?width=1389&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f382538c3f7bb5bf4bb338ab5b43ea535b85c47)

The back half of September is often the time of the month where we see the most amount of loss historically speaking so keep that in the back of your mind as we enter the back half of September.

**The Feds aren't the only ones looking to Taper**

Analysts believe that the Bank of Canada will begin to resuming tapering their asset purchases in October. The Bank of Canada has mentioned that they plan to hike their interest rates before reducing their bond holdings. This is probably something we won't see play out for a while but just keep it in the back of your mind that this is coming in the foreseeable future.

October to November is going to be an interesting time in the tapering world as BoC is expected to continue tapering in October and November is a very feasible start time for the Fed to begin tapering as they appear to want to start tapering before the year's end. However, September's employments numbers are probably going to play a big part on whether it gets pushed back to December so better to keep your eye on the next NFP report as well especially with how divided the voting members currently are.

After tapering we can keep our eye on when the Feds will decide it's time for an interest rate hike which they don't seem to be in any kind of hurry to do so we got some time until that happens.

**Producer Price Index and Inflation**

If you took a look at the PPI news that came out a couple days ago you would saw that we received a value of 0.7%. If we take a look at that in terms of a year-over-year basis that's a 8.3% rise which is the highest year-over-year rise we've seen since November of 2010. As you can see, inflation issues looks like they're going to remain to persist despite the Feds claiming that inflationary pressures will decrease throughout the year. Doesn't look it's really getting under control but let's wait till next month to see if we produce another year-over-year high or if we can start to bring down the year-over-year values over the next couple months which would signal that inflationary pressures aren't as high.

That's just a brief rundown of things that happened over the course of this week. Most of the info is from later in the week since not much really happened early last week.",finance
vet,"8 week puppy &amp; new dog owner: is my puppy just very chill, sick or have anxiety/loneliness?!","Hi there

So i just got a 8 week old puppy yesterday. He flew (2hr flight) thru cargo and when we picked him up, he was whining, etc like a normal puppy. We fed him the food the breeder provided us with a very small addition to his new kibble and he had some soft stool through the night. He would whine and wake us up every hour and go do his business. Ive never had a puppy before so i thought this is normal. The breeder said him and his littermates would go 3 hrs at night and 1 hr isnt what hes used to. 

This morning, we fed him his food and pooped a coin sized blood with some poop on i. We took him to the vet and the nurse checked his vitals and told us that he seemed normal and was probably just adjusting. We took him home with canned food the vet gave us (Royal Canine Gastrointestinal in a can) and was told to feed him this every two hours until its gone (we got 2 cans). 

We got home and followed the vet instructions but he wouldnt eat his food unless we mix it with a little of his breeders  kibble. His stool got a bit better (not too soft anymore) and he slept a lot during the day. He would eat his food slowly too. 

One thing we noticed though is that he isnt as crazy playful as he was the night we got himz Earlier through the evening, he would not play or not eat his food at all. We also noticed he would go to the corner where we dont have a pad on his play pen. And he would put his snot on the crevices like he's hiding.

Iv never had a dog. Im not sure how i should reahim can someone help me?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Is my retirement strategy sensible?,"Hi--I'm an early 30s male living in the US. I'm a software engineer making around 130k a year. I'd like to outline my retirement approach and get feedback:

\-I have a 401k with my employer. ~~I am allowed a max contribution of 6%, and I am putting in 6% of my salary in it. My employer matches.~~ EDIT: I'm permitted a max total contribution of 19,500. I am currently maxing this out.

\-I previously worked for the federal govt. I have Thrift Savings Plan with them. Again, I put in 5% and the govt fully matched it. I did not rollover into a traditional IRA. To me, my TSP is just another retirement account I periodically check in on.

\-I never opened an IRA (big mistake, I know) but plan on opening a Roth IRA in a few weeks and maxing out the contribution (\~6k?) while I still qualify.

\-No credit card debit. No student loan debt. Right now my expenses are minimal. I moved out of the city and have been living with family since March 2020. I work, take care of my parents, and do a lot of childcare for my my sister and brother-in-law. Just a lot of family time I guess. I haven't made any decision as to whether I plan to buy a house or move back into the city. No decision on kids yet. GF and I have discussed getting married but that's it at the moment. My retirement goals are vague: have a modest income, take an occasional trip, and have a rainy day fund.

\-big issue: I have around 400k in savings, but it's just sitting there. What should I do with it? If I understand the general advice on this subreddit, I should: 1) keep 6-12 months of expenses totally liquid and 2) max out my retirement accounts (401k, IRA, etc). and 3) open a brokerage account.

My bank (PNC) offers an investment/brokerage account. Should I open with them? Or should I look into a brokerage firm like Charles Schwab, Fidelity, Ameritrade, etc? What are the tradeoffs? I need to make some use of all this money that's currently sitting in my savings.

Thanks in advance. I'm a financial novice so I appreciate all the advice.",finance
personalfinance,Pension roll over to Roth IRA,"In August I rolled over my pension to a Roth IRA. I asked to have state and federal taxes withheld but $0 was withheld. Will I have to pay a penalty at tax time? 

Rollover amount $8,563.18

I'm usually in the 12% tax bracket.  And I have my withholdings single 0 for state and federal. 

Should I have my employer withhold additional taxes?",finance
personalfinance,"Besides the potential loss of value, what are the downsides to investing short term in an index fund vs. saving","Is it a bad idea to invest money into an index fund rather than keep it in a savings account if I *might* sell my shares in less than year for a down payment on a home if a good opportunity presents itself? (I might have to win a housing lottery for the chance to buy, and not all the cost information is available yet.)

The only downside I've been able to come up with on my own is that I might have to sell my shares at a loss if the market is down compared to now by the time I'd need to sell. If the drop is very dramatic, I'm fine with holding on to them and waiting for another opportunity even in a less- but still-desirable location that isn't further along yet. If it's modest, I might be wiling to take the hit.

Are there any other downsides vs. keeping that money in a savings account with a paltry 0.03 percent interest rate? I tried looking for more downsides but couldn't find any. I'm also not an expert and I don't think my inability to find or recognize more downsides means there aren't more. The extent of my knowledge on this subject is that index funds are better for most people than picking stocks and people should max out their annual Roth IRA contributions.

Stocks vs. property in terms of which is more valuable long term isn't a factor for this. The higher capital gains tax rate compared to a long term investment also isn't a factor, since this is index fund vs. savings with 0.03 percent interest. If I make money short term, I'm not going to wish I instead got that 0.03 percent interest. (Unless I would for some reason that's unknown to me?) And I already have emergency savings and am all set for maxing out my annual retirement contribution.

Thanks.",finance
cardano,"Cardano Rumor Rundown September 12, 2021","Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. Today is Alonzo smart contract launch day (Sept 12).  Here‚Äôs the link to the IOHK watch party at 21:30 UTC! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1436325831199141888](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1436325831199141888)
2. Now is a great time to get one last look at Cardano‚Äôs pre-smart contract numbers via Cardano Blockchain Insights. [https://datastudio.google.com/s/iNMezSBM\_CU](https://datastudio.google.com/s/iNMezSBM_CU)
3. There is still the mystery of the lobster.  Will it end up being connected to a fun smart contract to be launched tomorrow by IOHK?  [https://twitter.com/crypto\_reflect/status/1435738017608740866](https://twitter.com/crypto_reflect/status/1435738017608740866) 

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Cardano‚Äôs closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it‚Äôs EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We‚Äôll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano‚Äôs deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system. [https://twitter.com/Birdson64827145/status/1423324771303972867](https://twitter.com/Birdson64827145/status/1423324771303972867)
2. Senators Toomey, Wyden, &amp; Lummis took to the Senate Floor to plead for a vote on their amendment which would fix the overly broad crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423381402905726983](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423381402905726983) [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423413806634577922](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423413806634577922)
3. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements. This terrible competing amendment was then immediately endorsed by the White House. This is a serious danger to our industry! Please call your Senators and ask them to support the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis Amendment!

7. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. Both revisions were good for Cardano since they included proof-of-stake implicitly and then explicitly.

13. Very action packed day today (Aug 9). The Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema came together and proposed a compromise amendment to the crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. They were not able to include any section for exclusion of developers from the ‚Äúbroker‚Äù definition but did cover the previous progress on transaction validators and wallet sellers.

14. Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema sought the required unanimous consent, but their attempt was thwarted by a disagreement over $50 billion in defense spending. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424832132204138503](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424832132204138503)

CryptoCurrency,Suggestions for crypto app on cell phone (Android),Was looking for some input on what app is good to use for crypto investing and trading. Originally I used Robinhood but got fed up with it awhile back after doge coin hit it's all time high and Robinhood failed it's users forcing me to make less money than I could have if I would've been on a different app that supported doge at the time. Have since put much thought into it and am in a stable financial situation moving me to get invested for the long run this time around but I don't know what app I should trust to do so. Any input is welcome and appreciated! Thanks in advance!,cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Cryptocurrencies are not just the ‚Äòstocks and shares‚Äô of new technologies - The blockchain is the very foundation of these new emerging infrastructures,"###When we invest in cryptocurrencies we are not just buying a coin or token, which will be used as a currency, we are investing in the very infrastructure of the internet, industry, business and banking itself. 

In a world where fraud and security incidents are becoming more and more commonplace, blockchains are the technologies that can provide businesses with a very secure way to work with customers, suppliers and partners.

**Micro-payments** - The ability to make thousands of individual payments, cheaply and securely is going to revolutionize payments online. On social media, games, or music streaming services.

**Distributed storage** - Storing digital information across decentralized networks. 

**Health care** ‚Äì Securing health and medical records and reducing the potential for fraud.

**Legal industry** ‚Äì Critical documents like wills, powers of attorney and corporate records, not to mention the creation of smart contracts.

**Real estate** ‚Äì When recording land transfers and real estate transactions while reducing the potential for fraudulent sales, these smart contracts can be a huge benefit. 

**Supply chains** ‚Äì Walmart is already using blockchain to track some products back to their manufacturing roots, and UPS and FedEx have started using blockchain in their operations.

**Raising capital**‚Äì Initial coin offerings or ICOs are raising money for businesses and being used to support crowdfunding projects. (see also IDOs Initial Decentralized Exchange Offerings)

**Education**‚Äì Student IDs, transcripts, test result records and more could benefit from blockchain‚Äôs immutability and security. (The basis of a partnership with Cardano and the Ethiopian government).

**Digital ownership** - The ability to create uniqueness from essentially infinitely copiable assets

To name just a few example use cases, with many more we haven‚Äôt even imagined yet.

CryptoCurrency,Here is why both BTC and ETH can go x100 from here (P2),"Legal tender - There is 195 countries in the world and only 1 adopted BTC as legal tender.  BTC is Nr. 14 world currency by market capitalization right now and that‚Äôs 41,5 times smaller then Chinese yuan which is current Nr. 1(!!!) 

Store of value - There is only bunch of companies that decided to use BTC as inflation hedge and store of value but the number is growing rapidly. All the legacy investment firms, banks, hedge funds are going to start buying and selling BTC (as well as other cryptocurrencies) on behalf of their customers taking full custody of those digital assets. Reason why this is not happening right now is purely lack of regulations and infrastructure. Market capitalization of gold (preferable store of value but not the only one) is 10T with Bitcoin being only 5 times smaller then that. 

BTC to replace bonds - Cathie Wood, Ray Dalio, Michael Saylor and other respected investors suppose that BTC can be better investment then bonds.  As of 2021, the size of the bond market (total debt outstanding) is estimated to be at $119 trillion worldwide and $46 trillion for the US market, according to Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA)

What are the chances that countries, corporations and businesses will stop to adopt BTC? We are clearly only in the beginning of one of the greatest paradigm shift. Almost exactly 100 years ago monarchies where separated from the political power and same happened to church. Today we experiencing the monopoly to create/print money being separated from the government. This. Is. Uuuuuuuuuuuge. 

How does all mentioned above apply to ETH? It‚Äôs simple - Derivatives market being one of the biggest examples. 

1. A derivative is a contract between two or more parties whose value is based on an agreed-upon underlying financial asset (like a security) or set of assets (like an index). Common underlying instruments include bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, market indexes, and stocks. 

2. The derivatives market is, in a word, gigantic‚Äîoften estimated at over $1 quadrillion on the high end. (But can be way less then that) 

Well now you have smart contract to modernize the market, make it more transparent, accessible and fair for everyone. 

Derivatives is one fucking huge example but the question is how big can leading, decentralized, global computing power be market capitalization wise? Clearly way more then it is now.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Why we need crypto adoption also in first world countries,"I live in Germany (so sorry for my english). Inflation rate in August 2021 increased to 3,9% here in Germany and to around 2% in Europe. Yesterday I received a letter from my bank that my monthly account management fees will increase to 6‚Ç¨ ($7). That's right I need to pay my bank 6‚Ç¨ while getting 0% interest. The bank can use my money invest in whatever they want and I still need to pay for this.
If I would not invest in anything which most of my older relatives do being afraid to lose money, inflation and fees would eat up all my savings.

Thus we need adoption. Crypto needs to be accessible more easily. People need to learn how to create interest with DeFi e.g. through staking and lending. Even with stable coins you can generate nice interest rates if you are afraid of the volatility of cryptocurrencies.

Here in Germany especially in the rural area I live in we are as far as we could be from adoption. People 40+ mostly don't even invest in stocks, yet alone in crypto. The lose their money be saving and leaving it in their bank accounts.
How is it in your countries? Do you think people will accept crypto if they learn about it?
Is adoption possible?",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,Do you recognise this system?,"Q: &lt;Insert name here&gt; is a real-time gross settlement funds transfer system that allows the electronic transfer of funds between its participants. Transfers can only be initiated by the sender once they receive the proper receiving address. These instructions include: the receiver's address and amount being transferred. Once the instructions are received and processed, the service transfers funds from the sending account and credits the receiving account. Transfers are usually completed the same day, with many being completed near-instantly.

The system has grown since its inception, seeing growth in both number of transfers and total transaction dollar value. In 2016, roughly 148.1 million transfers were valued at $766.7 trillion.

A: If you said bitcoin or SWIFT etc. you'd be wrong. This is adapted from Wikipedia's description of FedWire. Bitcoin is basically FedWire with a few improvements, namely:

It's open to everyone
It's censorship free
It doesn't keep banking hours
It's capable of level 2 upgrades

What's the significance of this? Currently bitcoin has an annual turnover of $2 trillion so there's an upside potential of 300x to 400x for BTC demand, based on existing demand for FedWire. (That's 30,000% not 300%). If you factor in the additional utility of BTC plus a bit extra for Western Union then I'd say 500x is being conservative. That's just using it as a settlement system, it doesn't start to take in the value of it being a worldwide money. Because price is demand/scarcity times utility, that implies a price of $20MM a bitcoin.

So apart from some more up-to-date figures where's the flaw in this logic?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Synchrony Zero Interest Scam,"I bought an item which was almost exactly $4K out the door back in October 2020. I could have paid for it outright but was offered ""zero interest for 36 months"" and thought, ""sure, why not"". The credit company is called Syncrony. I set up the whole thing, they keep taking my monthly payments I can see the first few months its set up correctly and and I don't think much of it. Recently I log into the portal because I'm thinking about paying off the balance since I have some extra cash and I now owe $4,500. Of course I'm thinking WTF?!?!?! I look at the statements and for the first few months (as I had initially seen) my balance had been going down, but then after 5 months they charged me $1,547 in ""Deferred Interest"". That's like a 92% annual interest rate. Is that even fucking legal?!?!? I'm making their suggested payment and after 5 months of making payments I owe 20% more than my initial purchase  (according to my 5th monthly statement)

This was COMPLETELY MISREPRESENTED at the time of purchase. I was told this was zero interest. Instead they've got some sneaky fine print which I still don't understand and I'm being charged insane rates. Shame on me for not looking into it sooner but I can't believe how ripped off I've been.

Is there anything I can do about this? I want this debt gone and will pay it off but I also want to see if something can be done since I was so badly lied to during the sale process.

UPDATE: I called them and they confirmed no late payment and said that my promotion period was for 12 months, not 36, but they are submitting a request for this to be corrected (apparently I had bought the item 7 months earlier, but they don't show statements that far back. In my panic I didn't immediately recognize the purchase date was off). They aren't guaranteeing this will fix my issue but will be able to reply to my concerns in ""1 to 2 billing cycles."" I'll call the store and see if they can send something in on their end as well.",finance

There are many different kinds of cryptocurrencies. The first one was called Bitcoin. Bitcoin was created in 2009. Since then, other kinds of cryptocurrencies have been made. These are called Altcoins. Altcoins are cryptocurrencies that are different than Bitcoin. The reason why cryptocurrencies are so popular is that they are an alternative to the regular banking system.

**2. The best cryptocurrencies for investment?**

Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Ether, BitConnect, SafeMoon, are all types of money. Bitcoin is the most popular type of money. Bitcoin is the oldest type of money, but now there are many different types of money. Bitcoin is the most valuable type of money, but other types of money are also valuable.

**3. Cryptocurrency Trading: How to buy and sell cryptocurrencies?**

1) Go to coinbase.com

2) Put money into your account

3) Buy ethereum

4) Wait for the price of ethereum to go up

5) Sell ethereum

6) Buy a lamborghini

**4. Where to buy cryptocurrencies?**

Cryptocurrencies are a type of money that you can use to buy things and also invest in. There are a lot of different cryptocurrencies out there and you can buy them on crypto exchanges. A crypto exchange is a website that you can use to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. There are many different crypto exchanges to choose from. The most popular ones are Bittrex, Kraken, Poloniex, GDAX, Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Binance, and Coinbase.

**5. The Future of Cryptocurrency**

If you have ever asked yourself how you can invest in cryptocurrencies or what the future of cryptocurrencies are, you have come to the right place. Cryptocurrencies are a form of money that are created on the internet. Cryptocurrencies are very new. They are not like regular money that you can hold in your hand. They are made on computers.

Someone help me understand the difference between taxes and retirement versus now (broad level).

I get a standard deduction and now, I‚Äôm married filing joint. 93k a year, max 401k and 5k in HSA. So that should be ~69k AGI, then 25k standard deduction puts us at 44k taxable income. 12% bracket but an effective tax rate of like 6% federally if my math is correct?

Let‚Äôs say when I retire and I push off my SS benefits until I‚Äôm 70, it says on the SS site that my wife and I could get 79k a year (3316/mo)..if I couple that with say a RMD on my 401k of 60k. I‚Äôm at 149k, but I don‚Äôt know how the SS money plays into that, is it half of it that‚Äôs taxed? So 70k + (.5 SS) 40 for a total of 111k AGI?

‚Ä¶so confused, reason I‚Äôm looking at it is to figure out if I need to start contributing to my Roth instead of my Traditional 401k. 33 with 160k in traditional, if I keep maxing it out I‚Äôm going to have RMDs that are higher than what I make now lol",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Today will feel like a destination. Yet a new, exciting journey begins... The Alonzo upgrade is an epochal moment in the birth of a new Cardano ecosystem","Later today, we'll deploy Plutus smart contract capabilities  onto the Cardano mainnet via an HFC (hard fork combinator) protocol  upgrade event.

The *Alonzo* upgrade will bring highly  anticipated capabilities to Cardano through the integration of Plutus  scripts onto the blockchain. These will allow the implementation of  smart contracts on Cardano, enabling a host of new use cases for  decentralized applications (DApps) for the very first time.  

It‚Äôs  only just the beginning. But this is still a moment for celebration. As  a community, we have been on an incredible journey together. Rightly,  we should allow ourselves to acknowledge the tremendous efforts made by  so many to get here. This will also be a time for reflection on the  challenges we've collectively overcome.  

While we might allow  ourselves some brief downtime, this is no moment to rest up. And there  is certainly no room for hubris. This is where the mission truly begins  as we ‚Äì the whole community ‚Äì start delivering on the vision we have all  been working towards for so long. Building a decentralized system that  extends economic identity and opportunity to everyone, everywhere.

## The road to here

While many years of research and development have prepared the ground, it was the [Byron reboot](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/03/30/what-the-byron-reboot-means-for-cardano/)  in March 2020 that truly laid the foundations for the network we have  today, by providing a robust and scalable code base on which to build.  In July the same year, the [Shelley upgrade](https://cryptoslate.com/cardano-has-launched-the-shelley-mainnet-heres-what-you-need-to-know/) shifted Cardano from a federated model towards a decentralized one.

Since the end of March 2021, when we adjusted the network decentralization parameter to D=0, every block has been produced by a [decentralized network](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/31/decentralization-to-d-0-day-and-beyond/) from a community of 2,868 stake pools.

It‚Äôs a remarkable staking ecosystem that continues to grow rapidly. According to statistics from Cardano data aggregation tool [Pooltool](https://pooltool.io/),  the number of ada staking wallets today stands at 825,755. This  represents an increase of 35%+ since June. At the time of writing, the  total ada delegated to stake pools is valued at $ 59.86 billion,  accounting for 71.4% percent of total ada supply ($ 83.9b).

March‚Äôs [Mary](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/04/native-tokens-to-bring-new-utility-to-life-on-cardano/)  upgrade created a multi-asset network and introduced native tokens. As  well as providing an alternative to the ERC20-type model, Mary released a  Cambrian Explosion of creativity. With low minting and transaction fees  and, uniquely, no need for smart contracts for Cardano NFTs, we have  seen the blooming of an incredible NFT ecosystem. According to data from  [pool.pm](https://pool.pm/tokens)  (powered by Smaug pool), Cardano has seen 780,436 tokens minted to date  and 19,419 policies. All without the need for smart contracts.

## Enter Alonzo

The Alonzo upgrade (named after the pioneering American mathematician [Alonzo Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church)), will build on this success. Deployed using the same [HFC technology](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/05/07/combinator-makes-easy-work-of-shelley-hard-fork/)  used in previous upgrades, this will mark the beginning of a fresh  period of rapid growth. By allowing Plutus scripts to be written and  executed on-chain, we‚Äôll have the backbone for a new decentralized  application platform, enabling numerous DApp and decentralized finance  (DeFi) use cases ‚Äì from simple swap type apps to decentralized exchanges  (DEXs), and more complex computational programs such as Oracles and  crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoins.

So, we have one of the most  decentralized, sustainable, robust, and advanced blockchain platforms  in the world, run by a skilled community of stake pool operators (SPOs).  We enjoy an informed and passionate community of delegators. We have a  thriving NFT ecosystem, attracted by the ease and low-cost of minting.  Oh, and a roadmap for future governance through *Voltaire* and ultimate scalability through *Basho* and Hydra scaling. The future is bright and stretches far; we‚Äôll continue to travel the long road together.

## The birth of a new developer ecosystem

All  the core building blocks are in place. Platform. Vision. Mission.  Community. It is still very early days for smart contracts and DeFi, yet  we have made great progress already.

Thousands of developers have been taking part in the [Plutus Pioneers course](https://testnets.cardano.org/en/plutus-pioneer-program/),  learning the fundamentals of Cardano‚Äôs native development framework.  Scores of projects have already started developing in Plutus and are at  various stages of expertise and readiness. Hundreds of projects have  been actively working on the various Cardano testnets and  privately-hosted solutions. Some 150 projects are developing their ideas  via Cardano‚Äôs [Project Catalyst](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/12/our-million-dollar-baby-project-catalyst/)  innovation program, the world‚Äôs largest decentralized innovation fund.  In the latest round, 800 ‚Äì yes, 800 ‚Äì projects applied for $4m-worth of  funding. With a treasury now worth well north of $1bn at today‚Äôs values,  and [33k+ members](https://cardano.ideascale.com/), the future for building on Cardano couldn‚Äôt be brighter.

For a snapshot of just how many projects and organizations comprise the ecosystem, visit our [Essential Cardano](https://github.com/input-output-hk/essential-cardano/blob/main/essential-cardano-list.md)  repo. Or check out the various excellent ecosystem maps (these are  representative, though none are comprehensive) out there like those from  the [Cardians](https://twitter.com/Cardians_/status/1432534228890124294?s=20) (see Figure 1). These don‚Äôt represent what projects will be visible right away. But they offer a beautiful vista.

 We look forward to seeing these projects evolve as they head  towards deployment. Some are close to the launch pad, others further  off. Following the release of our first full public testnet earlier this  month, and now the mainnet, we expect to see many start to ramp up  their development activity.

## We are still early

Let us be  clear. There will be bumps in the road. Early user experiences might not  be perfect. Some early DApps will have issues. We'll see some great  development teams and some poor ones. This is a permissionless,  decentralized blockchain, so this is inevitable. And a few DApps may  prove insecure. Cardano‚Äôs secure layer 1 platform offers robustness and  high assurance ‚Äì and Plutus is designed to minimize the potential for  exploits. But poor coding practice can always introduce risks for DApp  users. Inevitably too, we can expect bad actors looking to take  advantage via hacks, exploits, and the likes. 

As a community, we  need to be vigilant as our ecosystem matures. In fact, we believe that  to mature across the industry as a whole, certification needs to be  taken more seriously. At the [summit](https://summit.cardano.org/),  we‚Äôll announce plans on how ‚Äì along with a number of strategic partners  ‚Äì we‚Äôll be supporting the creation of new stand solutions.

## Do Your Own Research

As  ever, we encourage everyone to do your own research (DYOR). Look to  your fellow community members for ‚Äòcrowdsourced due diligence‚Äô and  provide your own contributions. Look for projects with a positive  history of open and transparent communication, properly maintained  social channels/websites, and technical track records. Be sensible out  there, especially in these early days. Alongside confidence in DApp  security and project intent, DApp discovery will also be key to the  healthy growth of the Cardano ecosystem. So expect to hear more on that  at the summit, too.

The summit will also be a time for  celebration, although there will be those who will seek to sour this.  While our community is always open to being challenged in good faith, we  have grown too used to Twitter‚Äôs and Reddit‚Äôs fear, uncertainty, and  doubt (FUD) ‚Äì from the biased and the willfully ignorant. Every project  receives its share of this toxicity, and a greater degree is inevitable  around major releases.

This is a disappointing element of our  immature industry. We need to do better if we want to accelerate wider  adoption. The FUD has been particularly virulent this past week. For me,  it's a daily part of the job. Fortunately, most of my colleagues focus  on building and don't concern themselves too much with CryptoTwitter‚Ñ¢. 

We  shall see plenty more FUD and nonsense over the weeks ahead. Things  will likely get uglier before they get better. Whatever. This will only  strengthen our resolve to prove the naysayers wrong. We also have a  vibrant and passionate community that never fails to support the project  and respond with facts and courtesy. That continues to make everyone  working on Cardano exceptionally proud. Thank you.

## We are still early

Let‚Äôs  remain steadfast through the storm. And focus instead on a bright  horizon. We expect to see the first simple smart contract scripts  deployed on Cardano within hours of the HFC event. It will take a while  longer for more sophisticated DApps to start rolling out via the public  testnet. With hundreds of projects building behind the scenes, we expect  to see projects deploy through September and October, and accelerate  through Q4. Especially with launchpads, tools and frameworks, including  the Plutus Application Backend (PAB), and community-created APIs  becoming available.

There are high expectations resting on this  upgrade. Some unreasonably so. Cardano watchers may be expecting a  sophisticated ecosystem of consumer-ready DApps available immediately  after the upgrade. Expectations need to be managed here. We should  remember that another [well-known blockchain project](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/07/31/ethereum-history-in-5-charts/)  which launched in July 2015 had to wait over two years before its first  DApp (something to do with cats?) gained real user traction.

## Steady iteration and improvements

Over  the coming months, we‚Äôll continue our cadence of fortnightly releases  of new code, regular maintenance upgrades, and major HFC events each  quarter. We shall continue to tune and optimize the platform, adjust  performance, and refine pricing parameters as we track and monitor usage  patterns. Only real usage will reveal how we need to adjust our  flexible and scalable platform over the months of growth ahead. We shall  also be looking to the growing developer community and the Cardano  Improvement Proposal (CIP) process to bring further capability based on  key requirements and needs.

The Alonzo HFC event will deploy  Plutus 1.0, the core platform which itself will continue to evolve and  bring more functionality over the coming months. Plutus is our native  language, but of course, it is only the beginning here too. New bridges,  sidechains, and other layer 2 solutions will bring in fresh options and  an ever wider developer base. Future upgrades stemming from the work  being done on Hydra will add further capability. Research papers like  stablecoins, Babel coins, and stable fees will also in time start moving  toward the prototype phase, bringing further innovation to the  longer-term roadmap.

So, while we remain focused on continuing to  research and develop longer-term utility for the platform, the ecosystem  will evolve fast over the coming months. It's going to be quite a ride,  with a huge amount of activity within the community. 

## Exciting times ahead

The  Alonzo upgrade is a transformational network upgrade that will catalyze  a blossoming ecosystem of developers, creators, and innovators. Later  this month, we‚Äôll have the [Cardano summit](https://summit.cardano.org/).  This week, we finalized the sessions. With over 100 sessions and more  than 40 hours of content spread over multiple tracks across two full  days, this will be the most significant event in Cardano‚Äôs history. It  will be a celebration across virtual worlds and real-life meetups, a  showcase of where we are today, and a forum to talk about where we‚Äôre  heading. A reflection of a budding ecosystem that, while young, has  always shown great maturity of purpose. And a platform for exciting new  announcements.

So as we pass the epoch boundary today, let's take  that moment. We can allow ourselves a celebratory whisky or two (even if  it's just a cheeky splash in our morning coffee for our friends in Asia  and the Southern hemisphere).

Let‚Äôs be proud of what we have achieved. But this is where the real work begins.

Let‚Äôs go.

Having listened to the leaked audio recording of Hank speaking about 'Rugging' investors via Exchange Liquidity Pools, I encourage each of you to submit a tcr to the SEC. Hank being as simple as he is, he likely overlooked the fact that making knowingly misleading comments about a company, company reports or financial statements is a Felony. Given the nature of the recording (which has now been fully transcribed), Hank has actually admitted to harbouring an intention to mislead for the purposes of financial gain (fraud). As of 18th March 2021, SafeMoon was a registered company - a legal entity - and that is why the SEC will gladly take a close look at Hank and what he has done. DeFi space or not, this is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE and Hank will be held to account.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone in the US, please file this with local, state and federal regulators.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I would strongly encourage everyone to complete the TCR here:

&gt;Report: False or misleading statements about a company and intent to deceive, re Henry 'Hank' Wyatt.

&amp;#x200B;

Message:

&gt;Dear Sirs,  
&gt;  
&gt;I write to file an official complaint about Henry 'Hank' Wyatt of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, United States.  
&gt;  
&gt;My Wyatt explicitly and intentionally set out to deceive investors in a Decentralised Finance Ponzi Scheme named 'Piggy Bank token'. ([https://piggybanktoken.com/](https://piggybanktoken.com/))  
&gt;  
&gt;A link to the original post of the audio recording: [https://twitter.com/de\_crypto\_mole/status/1436952213335707649](https://twitter.com/de_crypto_mole/status/1436952213335707649)  
&gt;  
&gt;Please pay particular attention to the following statement by Mr Wyatt in the recording:  
&gt;  
&gt;*""We're going to be able to give up contract ownership, but would still maintain it, so we won't be able to rug the liquidity when we give up contract ownership, but we will be able to exempt exchanges so we can put it everywhere.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Moreover, someone who was present at the recorded meeting has confirmed that they would testify in a Court of Law as to the intent of Mr Wyatt. Please see: [https://twitter.com/skyelovescrypto/status/1436980936269172743?s=20](https://twitter.com/skyelovescrypto/status/1436980936269172743?s=20)  
&gt;  
&gt;I hope you will take the above allegations seriously and bring the force of the Law to bear on Mr Wyatt.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yours sincerely,  
&gt;  
&gt;A Concerned Investor.

personalfinance,Should I request limit increases?,"I recently did a debt consolidation loan at almost 12 points lower interest rates than the credit cards and am paying off that loan at almost 1.75x the monthly minimum. My payments with interest on the cards were almost double the loan with higher interest rates.

My question is my fico score went from 630 up to almost 725 in the 45 days or so after paying off all the credit cards.  

Is it appropriate to try and increase my credit limits on these cards now? Would that be a good thing for my credit score or would that be a bad thing?",finance
wallstreet,The FED IS TAKING BIG ACTION!! AMC STOCK,,finance
CryptoCurrency,I don‚Äôt think we are going to get to $100k BTC this bull run and I could be totally wrong but I think institutional investment will be the reason why believe it or not. At least have a read before you downvote me.,"Firstly I just think the wider economic back drop will hold us back. Some people will call it fud, but fundamentally at some point, the fed (or for me, the bank of england) will have to do something to cool inflation. Raising interest seems unlikely in short term, but reducing bond purchases could easily spook the market, which aside from march 2020 has enjoyed a long bull run itself and objectively when you look at PE ration v historic, suggests it‚Äôs over priced. 

Secondly, thanks to stimulus, a lot of the impacts of covid have not been felt but we now have eviction rules coming back, reduced support and high inflation. At some point this will impact the economy which I think will impact crypto.

Lastly, big institutions don‚Äôt typically fomo in to anything. Their corporate governance prevents it. Instead they‚Äôll have fairly well defined entry and exit points based on their own statistical analysis. $100k is such a huge psychological point, it seems like educated money will see an inevitable crash, well before we get there. Now some will say ‚Äúit‚Äôll just shake out the weak hands‚Äù but when those ‚Äúweak handles‚Äù hold $bn it seems like there will at least be a big setback before we get there and I think the first 2 points will bite before that happens.

CryptoCurrency,Warren's Response to contacting her about the infrastructure bill,"My senator never got back to me, but I asked my family to also use Coinbase's site to send a letter to their senators. Here was the response one of them received from Warren. Barely mentions crypto. Not that I expected much, but still disappointed.

Thank you for contacting me about Wall Street regulation and the financial industry. Because of the large number of letters, emails, and calls regarding coronavirus, it‚Äôs possible that my response to your message will be delayed. I know this is a difficult time for everyone in Massachusetts. I am working every day to get our state necessary resources for the health and economic security of every family. As our country navigates this challenging moment, I am fighting for you, all the way. For more information about the coronavirus outbreak, please visit my website or the Center for Disease Control and Prevention‚Äôs COVID-19 summary page.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) included the strongest set of financial reforms since the Great Depression. The Dodd-Frank Act imposed tough new rules on big banks and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). But our financial system still has significant vulnerabilities - and we need to do much more to rein in Wall Street and stop another financial crisis.

That is why I support a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act to separate traditional banks that offer federally insured savings and checking accounts from riskier financial services such as investment banking, insurance, hedge fund, and private equity activities. I also support reforming the bank merger review process to put an end to the banking agencies‚Äô rubber-stamping of giant financial institutions gobbling up community banks. We also need to ensure our financial regulators use their existing authorities to address the increasing complexity of today's financial markets and the heightened risk posed by complex financial products that did not exist when Glass-Steagall was originally passed. The wild swings in the price of stocks like GameStop earlier this year highlighted the need a level set of rules and a transparent and open market for everyone, including the giant hedge funds and Wall Street institutions that have been treating the market like a casino for years. I recognize the potential of digital currencies and believe that a stable, secure, and universally accepted central bank digital currency could help the 33 million Americans locked out of the traditional banking system as well as the millions who have been gouged by predatory fees by big banks. I also have serious concerns that unregulated cryptocurrencies present unique risks to consumers, investors, and the environment. I believe Congress and federal regulators need to work together to close existing regulatory gaps and crack down on abuses in these marketplaces to ensure that cryptocurrency market operates in a fair and transparent manner.

I have also introduced the Ending Too Big to Jail Act, which would help ensure that Wall Street executives go to jail when they break the law, just like anyone else. The bill would create a new investigative unit dedicated to uncovering financial fraud and require big bank executives to personally certify that there is no financial fraud at their companies - a certification that can be used against them if fraud is later found by authorities.

And I have introduced legislation to compensate victims of the Equifax hack and to ensure that similar hacks don't happen again, including the Freedom from Equifax Exploitation (FREE) Act, which would allow people to freeze and unfreeze their credit files for free and bars credit bureaus from selling someone's information during a freeze. I have also introduced the Data Breach Prevention and Compensation Act, which would impose large automatic penalties on credit bureaus when they allow personal information to get accessed or stolen.

I also believe that we need to protect the CFPB.¬† The Bureau's mission is protect consumers and hold financial institutions accountable if they mislead or defraud their customers. It includes an Office of Servicemember Affairs, which looks out for servicemembers, veterans, and their families who are too often the targets of predatory lenders and financial scams. Since the CFPB began operations in 2011, the agency has returned more than $12 billion to consumers who were cheated on mortgages, credit cards, and other financial products, established commonsense rules that have made the markets for financial products safer and more consumer-friendly, and created a complaint hotline that has fielded nearly three million consumer complaints and helped thousands of customers resolve issues with their financial services providers.

To help return to the era when American corporations produced broad-based growth that helped workers and shareholders alike, I have introduced the Accountable Capitalism Act. In the early 1980s, America's biggest companies dedicated less than half of their profits to shareholders and reinvested the rest in the company. But over the last decades there has been a fundamental shift towards rewarding shareholders at all costs. Big American companies now dedicate 93% of their earnings to shareholders. As a result, companies are offering less to their employees and underinvesting in long-term growth. By requiring large businesses to obtain a federal charter obligating them to consider the interests of all stakeholders, empowering company employees to elect at least 40% of the Board of Directors, requiring company executives to hold company shares for at least five years, and requiring 75% of the company's Board and shareholders to approve any political spending, my bill would help reorient big American corporations so workers get more of the record profits they've helped produce.

My Stop Wall Street Looting Act would fundamentally reform the private equity industry and level the playing field by forcing private equity firms to take responsibility for the outcomes of companies that they take over, empower workers, and protect investors. For far too long, Washington has looked the other way while private equity firms take over companies, load them with debt, strip them of their wealth, and extract exorbitant fees - leaving workers, consumers, and whole communities to pick up the pieces. My bill would close loopholes that allow private equity firms to capture all the rewards of their investments while insulating themselves from risk.

I believe that efforts by Trump-appointed financial regulators have made our financial system weaker and should be reversed by President Biden‚Äôs appointees. I will continue to support policies that hold financial institutions accountable, reduce the risk of another taxpayer bailout, protect consumers, and level the playing field for working families in Massachusetts and around the nation. I appreciate your reaching out to me about this issue, and please do not hesitate to contact me in the future about issues of importance to you.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Thoughts on Market by #Guy,"Things are looking a bit shaky on the charts right now, and this is for a few reasons...

First, there's [the news](https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/Yq54N7ukbd7P8o0L5iFUI3-lljAfrkzKzl1oZGx49Xruhl1E43O_i1k3Hhg1R0h5nk_UceY5YMgWR7KLqFC5Y2ENenUJxg76_eKayfLq85fMgqJ5uGXRs_RML3Sj4WGbjhTe-IqJPO1XhnNJ5Kr4QSNJ9tCrcfLsX3cM6DvoUtbMYWya1xvvIXV8XUtCZznePR6hUGAbbRD5EyZbIQLZH1AORUNAPODEY5HmBiJQaKZhSv7g4s-F9MtHis_Oa0ulotF_g8RLDQRaWaofcxZIXnbH77Wu--J9pg4v2s7YEIMZQK96W9lnAwUmvXcs3KqIC-iSPgT5VFjdrSn2ckiE8hqGa-bP06Blcg) that the US Treasury Department will soon be taking its first actions against stablecoin issuers, starting with Tether (USDT). This comes on the heels [of the news](https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/WdUUoVQgLAU1vF-Vcr5YN2P3wrXJRSsQDWfNr2KxpUUNhhODSmLawGDM27a82yUd0MfjHJYeNkPWaXsB1UO002OFawTXPGFmcZy50kk1g9PMuOlN1ersjks2IC6vT1mDmajoTh9qnTjk4JAetFto7vkf7tMLzvAuG5Qh_IO5WWsSm3URGylwVwHwI6Jwpe5FsiKMLV7Bgd2am_5ur3ZPIUdoYJlTrSxTj0_159HcNtyrEHBps38P81g-bV4tKE2CHbcD30k32tGS2W0QJj7J-XPiRFO3w39Q_1SNhA_wspsilLlcMcXDogJxa_hJl2EWr4YMmk_VT0MZZyT6rDeDRqPW4k0) that the Bank of International Settlements is pushing central banks to begin developing their own central bank digital currencies as a response to stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. Any punitive action against a stablecoin like Tether could have massive implications for the crypto space.

Luckily it looks like one crypto project is already stepping in to take on the role as crypto's top stablecoin. Terra's LUNA coin has been pumping even while the rest of the market slumps, and that's because LUNA is used to collateralize the UST stablecoin.

When demand for UST rises, the price of LUNA responds in kind. If you pop open CoinMarketCap for UST, you can see its market cap has risen sharply, meaning boatloads of UST are being minted. If this confuses you, don't worry. I'll be doing an update about Terra this week and it will explain everything, including whether Terra could replace Tether and other stablecoins.

Second, US politicians are set to reveal the entirety of their upcoming [3.5 trillion human infrastructure](https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sNhDcL4r8auPVeHrQ_LSPZRjGT1e4fB5D75bPP72AFcqCAdTaaBVluF2izCB0_qylcxYiEEIrykleCWL2kFYAOkPEB8-TO9aEzVDj3xjjAAbqWoLKs-XGj-hixtqlCmYlFSL-fSous2x73wsF8A_M16OU5VuZeJVmfTni9njONj4Mj7waqbNLEiwAc9wcYwdZ4QLrs5loic7maSD46u2_fcuvYdA7suUIVjKKFT9udctJoVgoUoeFLcfbdvYC-U0bIVKmWvpSZnDxgdr6AafZtgQRpu0ipwrORFBRyjTtpRjm2yojANKkiIQ8fWvsrG-K9G9LvNBcUuruInzzjAIkeDu) bill. This is a different bill than the 1 trillion dollar infrastructure bill which contains that controversial tax reporting clause which could be damaging to crypto.

Besides the fact that the Treasury Department is also trying to sneak some anti crypto provisions into the second infrastructure bill, capital gains taxes [could be doubled](https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/Kh9Hk4ylWf5bnE8UgiftXOWZYFXTz3Uhl1mRDqVz7Rr88daoSAlHtJdwNWROJPQxGe4nDs0gBLax9eNlw2qTMLKUG3-I2ICLRoBz97KhNeGDqS5b9WGmwxeDZ9h8xJf6H6xK6vo_TP5pV57wVOu4s-xmhJyEYzwIOPzS1AseSbe4lqKjYcjbryjsUcfzS4RFIw7v2iPyk10uuoA-kiKhniMXD1nFgJppiroHRJ8SqTvzfvJd3RWCIRpnZJB3l1pLzlTfgR_jSLL0OFnYzs6k9ThhhS_uaEO4pzOzPQ75egocoL5GWLOiQMi-MfWavaaHOwU1Lh5I_KDZCeq43BwG55sjlX2BbIvx7uOcea7JLVWKRcnw9U_y22iOGqZRGZTcly3zPaU) from 20% to 39% for wealthy Americans. Naturally, the practical effects of this would be a massive sell off across the board, and we're already seeing the cracks starting to form in the stock market.

This brings me to the third point, and that's the stock market. Some of you might have [seen the news](https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/ZAU9PrWFjQtNpTG84DlKKFEs6q_yFiv4NMs1iSHkKI-Vu0wnKfGM88JUXdJh3nlKorh1vBX8unfbrR0PJ2xshe4eWFfs3t1I85Y3UNnF6gCo1HlvtOWNMG2KB9DjteKXrMxgFUCrtwjvDkQM8Nyw7R9RkC25k_gQUjX00RB97wZ6za3DyDF9rtJvYs9WuyfFhH7WHuPBdA7UYdpd-9wm8B6VofY7cCn3nJKFNKjksRefFgZPN_DoemklKxNMkx0PUbA7sBjsxt4AyL2p6iQ25iMX3Zy_1Ih0C3L-HWWQQyF2fd9wS6PNOLCJ1hRiq4kruWOJ4WdrTsV5bfaFbsAVmJmiO3ooPw) that Federal Reserve officials are planning on selling their stocks by the end of the month to ""avoid a conflict of interest"".

This is of course in reference to the fact that the FED's monetary policy has a massive effect on the stock market, and it seems that a few FED officials have been taking advantage of that to their gain.

As far as I can tell, a lot of traders are taking this as a sign that the Top is in for the stock market. I reckon that's not a farfetched assumption to make. As we know, cryptocurrencies have become highly correlated with stocks and they would likely follow the stock market lower should we see a global crash.

While this may be disconcerting to many, it‚Äôs not all bad news. I‚Äôm particularly excited about Cardano which will be shipping its highly anticipated smart contract upgrade in a few hours. This will unlock the same DeFi features we find on Ethereum, Solana, and other cryptocurrencies.

ADA is probably rallying as you read this, but I do have a word of caution for anyone holding ADA...

As Charles Hoskinson himself noted, this release is more like an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), and there will likely be a few bugs and issues. So, don't set your expectations too high. Don't be discouraged by these shortcomings either. They will be addressed in future hard forks, as well as by the dApp developers themselves. I'll be going over a few of the top projects building on Cardano this week, so stay tuned for that.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Has SEC lost it's marbles? Lets see what Guy says about that.,"Last week we got the news that the SEC was investigating Uniswap. However this week, we learned that they had far bigger targets in mind with [their intention](https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/HVfkPUv_ayg8cUTdolxK3S30ubY2YJCBD-Nj9vhD9Smhkh6ZL2kOtQ-iEiPgXsH_gdViqX3bqa2JDWepIjEVCl7phwiogCEA3OfCnPUTb34aRMo2pGZs0eDd_e_Zu8mTySsX22BFaAawJZ8ihI_TjICvn_akNII8gJvxZ0TXUCSlyW6rYBjsv82gyLBYXWps0sd5hbwT3KV081PglVhxlYaVRV3DbHserMSPb5s79wmdRybwFO89ORWn4Q119aLsQazBo9mHMnZ0HUcOo5bWI47BMblzOBFUbgCivMMVedEcoUOOwjbpJYT0Bxs5U8pbD0jt2yhpkbalukVBchGsWAsE3ZmoYwaKlaabZvWz-K8) to sue Coinbase over their Coinbase Lend feature.

Now, despite what you think of Coinbase, the actions taken by the SEC here are really disappointing. This is because of the manner in which it was done. According to [this blog post](https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/7WuTBjC9YsQhzKA7tkJlusRWXsQA1ff0Ek0PlcdP1_SFaMoRfJfuDtp6HBnSBxevM6IIwGVLMWarP2K48aRm-LT1EGQAXi80F_XBZcq2YS6jEVSopF4JCshRBFRyZmBXQVxhrV9FbR0nnVvnd8aeIRvXyrp3NK7nSYj8-XD5bdArZ3_BNtrKk6Rf5q2SHXrKhY9FvNK5J_D7BU9SKgDdA9yF6dSQ2k73Gh-gCqTeXtxrSsUcrCaI2-Hhioxm9E-i6kP5MrUgZwDeV9i1HQvuH3Ti33-3lYEnCMM6nd5vle9yVowECT0RJFeCXNa8cF2f0StBx7RzMQUPEl8U) by their Chief Legal Officer, they have no idea why they are being sued - this despite their repeated efforts to engage with the SEC.

From the announcement, it appears that the SEC is viewing Coinbase Lend as offering unregistered securities. While the CLO of Coinbase makes a case for why it is not a security, the SEC is applying decades old cases (Howey &amp; Reves) in order to come to that conclusion. I have talked about the Howey test on many occasions on my channel but it could be construed that products like Lend can be classified as securities. However, nothing can be done by Coinbase as the SEC is refusing to talk to them about it at all.

It‚Äôs quite unfortunate to hear this. Especially when Gary Gensler was himself [asking those](https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/OChBiCxyUKAaLXsLVwP9u6KqA4wyn8JTC_GReEhDxRh78cYyfdfdlwIVilVSkiXil0eysPS2cS_Q4Xz5W_5OfNQfvKl9FKUw1fjVg5JM-X-dnA2s_QjBdw9o4d46Su3gWbLLa3bhdT6-YY_kGq87K6r8mxrYUdjJULakEGvPbRj-23iMjSBWehfthADKyEIrb4JWmsLM0pwLqyKwXkMp4kz6FYCHTrxQjPvVoQyqiX6rgsDFpX7atDodXlh4yw9h_9Y8m5HOfHZN6OsyWPk2we_d) in the crypto space to come and engage with them. Moreover, given Gary‚Äôs background in teaching blockchain tech at MIT, one would have thought that he would have been more reasonable (or at least more engaged) with the community.

What I find most frustrating about this is that it seems as if these actions go against the explicit mission of the SEC and that is to protect retail investors. The Coinbase Lend feature would have given users the ability to safely earn 4% on their USDC. By restricting these users from earning that interest, they are forcing them to invest in money markets [and bonds](https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/d91FAzaIolru3iiDAbdX5_5lMdGSnaTDJwszhZBNYSRKOyKkaHAmr6QioPYC0nVas5MaWHWEWimlDH03p0_GElQi-4rx2j9IuuGwwzxKH3uPsQOkEpJBt-S3s5CaHQlhesaX-UKSkSQssO8Zvet-kdUPWUqFzSvXbYde3bAk7Saw8sdNOaMYsdP2wFEcgHHf9IDleOk0D6bC7yh6s4k5_NKXuhrgSxKVZ_MdrOeZMyqTAZ7OJ-DDRu_8Dn1tj3Rx6BB_evj2PjLQyc-QSqQ9SS8ljpmOKF0jSte9xjk) which have interest rates near zero - pathetic when you consider inflation.

It‚Äôs not just crypto lending that is a target. DeFi protocols have become increasingly wary of stepping on the toes of the SEC - so much so that they are excluding US users all together. We saw this recently with the DYDX airdrop that I talked about in my [post here.](https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/-8ZWa_UFJj1jZ9L5eXCSnivFhRINmFNB4tYjRwchDT2WsZBqaz20xxpnYWDb8P3KJiWMducN30SULLYCYKmjb-C3kmqLJ_J5j9KG8lhkB_n7Q16bzLbBtPKhsTr8pyMUjkiLx5YxOSHnwdNw1-uoBYFHn4vs1y46QbWxid-owv-A_1UDUz-y5ZLXRXyc-PRaSLUbSiAgligXRnSR-O2IF5S60AMu6CUgkTNTEShJMg)

That was an airdrop. It was free crypto that users could have earned for using the protocol. Retail DeFi users in the US were not allowed to partake. However, those large VC funds and ‚Äúaccredited investors‚Äù sure did fill their pockets with the token allocation to the initial investors.

Was the SEC really protecting the retail investors? And, if they are merely following the law without consideration to consequences, should they really be applying an 80 year old case to it?

It will be interesting to see where we go from here. Coinbase seems like they intend to take the fight to the SEC. This could be a great outcome according to [Mark Cuban](https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/Sk3vQT4J5pygd1H52nr1IxJAGcYo6he2nguXQAPPyusKXGN5lNnOXC8fwQ95qMGwIoZGJXH4RlZiSgTH8PlhdUbeFQh15Sx-FZpPxvgD7VuezJmHJV5y-UwtMA5J-U_enGcjKuLDU_zrSIkLv5pPwRU1uzPYoBtOtlQ2HO9v33bLxtFI5Z_EXaeyuDJbk_RuIvj5v6JxQvQ_AsC1Wc2eqIT5NTjsYz-Un0eljFK7A1RUldyXt6w5QNhyW-SBS5b5x9dXm-xWZOWMW20) as they have the resources and heft to do so. Smaller Defi builders and protocols don‚Äôt.

I also think that we have not seen the last of these lawsuits. Other centralised lending platforms in the US like BlockFi could be the next target (they have already [been restricted](https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/r8nBPX52HQAhI0zWzGtsT43IBe5NMtSFmbFXaijAnizdMGG1EDourh8Sugmwq9VEZsmkFZFLTDh-SLSYj7wvuN1vXQSKuiMTX8WSDnyTAlAoaw-p1hSlAaujKJiGWyfOpGrAzzPzO8i6-V8jG1NOYYs934TiklWVG5_88-JDx59Ihz7vahybHNuhH2PgkV3z3IHfHIsm9xHgkjJqHQYcYG3_g0AnqYg91ptSsrd3W7ZBFG2QzuS3elrDNzgnW-0Zajmat0rvUFBuoLq56YSjsAxibA) in some states). The SEC could go after more Defi builders and lending platforms as well.

personalfinance,"Discover closed my account, do I still pay the card?","Mobile formatting preface.

I‚Äôve has my Discover card for 9 years and it was one of my first cards. Over the years I accrued 10k-ish debt on the card and was making a little more than minimum payments. I did the account freeze option which would lower the interest rate in exchange of not using the card. I moved back in with my parents after the pandemic started so I could aggressively pay my debt. In a short while my debt got down to 6K.

personalfinance,Timing of I Bond purchase,"It's my understanding that, although the I-Bond interest rate is reset every May and November, the actual rate applied to any given I-Bond is updated depending on when the bond was purchased.  The rate stays the same for 6 months and then switches to the rate that is then currently in effect.

So, for example, an I-Bond purchased in September will apply the May-October rate for the first six months; it will not change to the November-April rate in November but instead will do so in March.

Right now the I-Bond rate is 3.54%.  Assume that, based on current inflation predictions, it gets reset to 6% in November.

By my calculations, a $10,000 I-Bond purchase in September will return $177 in interest by the end of February ($29.5 for each month).  But a $10,000 I-Bond purchase in November will return $200 in interest by the end of February ($0 for Sept/Oct but $50 for the following four months).

Obviously timing the stock market is a fool's errand.  But given the pre-set timing of I-Bond rate changes, and the somewhat predictable process by which the rate is calculated, it seems to me that timing an I-Bond purchase -- at least in the current circumstances, near the end of a rate cycle and where all indications point to a rate increase -- is more reasonable.

devops,What can I expect in adding a CI solution to my already in production application?,"I run an application that currently doesn't use CI. It runs on a VPS and is containerized with docker/docker-compose. My usual deploying process is to `git pull --rebase` and `docker exec` into the web ~~and DB~~ containers to pull new dependencies and run any DB migrations. It works _okay_ but I'd like to automate it because there have been a couple times where I've goofed up and not updated dependencies or something like that. Plus it'd be nice to automatically run my test suite when I push new code to the repo.

It has users so its not something I want to have significant downtime on due to messing around with getting CI setup. I've worked on projects that used CI pipelines at jobs (Drone) but have never set one up myself. What can I expect when implementing a CI solution for my already in-production project?",technology

personalfinance,Question about paying off a mortgage with 4 person (2 party) joint ownership situation (Canada),"We are 4 people (2 parties) entering into a joint ownership agreement to purchase land. 
Our mortgage allows for an additional 20% of direct principal payment each year to pay it offer sooner. Let's say the loan is for $275,000, interest rate 3%, 15 year term. 
What would happen if only 1 party exercised the right to pay down extra each year? How do you calculate when their ""share"" of the loan is paid? Does it make sense to do up two separate amortization schedules with the loan divided in half, 1 reflects no extra payments and the other reflects the payments? And then go by date? Just not sure how to properly calculate this.
Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,"I earn what I think is a very comfortable salary, so why does it feel like I'm unable to save for a house/grad school, afford to live on my own, or really spend money to enjoy life?","I'll get right to the point. I'm in a medium cost of living city in the US, and I earn $82,000 annually, so $6,800/month. This is the breakdown of my expenses:

|Monthly Salary        |$6,833.33||
:--|--:|:--|
|- Taxes|$2,000.00|federal/FICA, state, local/city|
|- Roth 401(k)|$1,625.00|maxed out|

|- Miscellaneous|$150.00|entertainment and caring for parents mostly|
|**Remainder**|**$473.33**|

For background the ""caring for parents"" is mostly just buying or sending my mom stuff (after passed years ago) because she's in a nursing home in a different state so I don't see her in person much anymore. Just things like snacks or letters or flowers or stuff like that. With covid I can't see her in person. I don't want to end up in a place like the care home she's in so I prioritize saving for retirement. I always hit my healthcare deductible because I have some underlying health conditions. 

After all of this, it doesn't feel like I have much wiggle room to save for a house or for grad school (which could potentially increase my salary). It would be nice to live on my own in a few years (I'm 31) but apartments in my city run around $1200 so that would burn through most of my surplus. Down payment for a house? Forget about it.

I like to think I live somewhat frugally, and $82,000 is a **great** salary. Am I saving too much for retirement? As the title says, why does it feel like even with this fantastic salary, I'm only able to set aside a couple of thousand a year, I can't afford to live on my own, etc.",finance

personalfinance,questions about bond funds,"I am looking for a bond fund to invest some money relatively short-term. My wife and I are interested in buying a vacation home, but also not in that much of a rush. We're watching the market, waiting for the right house to pop up. It might pop up quick, or it might not for another year, or we might shop around for a bit and give up on the idea - hard to say.

The source of this money is mostly from a cash-out refinance that we are in the process of doing, as well as $5k from savings that I normally would have invested in the same stock-based mutual fund that I have in my taxable account (nominally intended for early retirement or a future sabbatical). I have not been contributing to that for the past few months, pending deciding on how to pay for the cabin. Additional income (~$1k-$2k/month) will also go into the fund.

Our accounts are with Vanguard. The $72k we get from the cash-out will go in our shared account, and the rest in my personal account - same fund, different accounts. 

We're OK with some risk, but want something less volatile than stocks. 

I was initially looking at short-term bond indexes. Am I right in thinking that these are the safest option, while longer-term bond indexes carry more risk because there is more chance that interest rates will rise before the maturity date of the bonds, which will cause the bonds' resale value to decline?

""Short-term"" refers to the underlying bonds, not the amount of time that you intend to hold the mutual fund, correct? So if I want a short-term investment but am OK with more risk than you take on with a short-term bond index, I could invest in a long-term bond index and hold it for a short period of time?",finance

personalfinance,How can I reduce my MAGI to below the Roth IRA income limit?,"Hello! This is my first year trying to max out my accounts. I have contributed $12,000 to my Roth IRA ($6,000 for least year, $6,000 this year). I am currently making contributions to my traditional 401k (though Roth 401k is available), and plan to max it out at $19,500 by end of 2021. I'm 27, single, full-time employee.

However, I have a unique problem that seems to no longer be the hypothetical we see on this sub from time to time. I have a variable income, based on traveling, hours, OT, etc. I meticulously track it and I am on track to make $149,569 this year, though I won't know until literally my last stub. If I understand this correctly, I will be $9,569 over the Roth IRA income limit and as-is, would need to recharacterize. I am having trouble calculating my MAGI. Please correct the following assumptions if they're wrong  

So of that $9569, about $6600 can be deducted from the MAGI from remaining *traditional 401k* contributions for 2021. Another $912 can be deducted due to remaining FSA payments for the year. Another $572 can be deducted for health care premiums. This leaves me at $141,485, and still over the Roth IRA limit. Are there other things I'm not considering that can be deducted from MAGI so I don't have to recharacterize? I'm assuming taxes have no impact on MAGI, at lease from the paycheck seen below, in my circumstance.

My last paycheck:
* Regular Pay: $3502
* Overtime: $229.82
* Auto Reimbursement: $150.00 (excluded from MAGI)
* On Call: $1450.00
* Shift Differential: $318.00

Deductions:
* Medical: $71.50
* 401(k): $836.00
* FSA: $114.58
* Roth 401(k): $0.00

Taxes: 
* Federal: $728.85
* Medicare: $77.05
* SS: $329.45
* State: $235.56

Edit: more or less solved! Backdoor Roth IRA. If anyone has the answer to my MAGI question still, I'd appreciate it. I am still curious of ways to lower my tax burden. Also one thing I've learned since posting this, is that even if I got to $139,999, it wouldn't help me because the Roth IRA limits are phased out between $125k and $140k. So I wasn't even close to making the cutoff.",finance

personalfinance,Unusual financial situation and mortgage opportunities,"Howdy, throwaway account here. Long story short, I'm looking at upsizing my house, but I'm in a bizarre financial situation from a lender viewpoint and wanted to get some perspectives, especially from mortgage and lending professionals. I live in the US. In short, due to recently deceased family I will soon have about 280k in cash. I'm in my mid 20s. I have a house I own in full and bought with cash a few years ago, valuated at ~240k. I own my cars, have no debt but about $15k in accessible credit from a variety of cards. My credit score is ~805. I have no college degree and am working on going back to school for Cyber Security soon. I am currently employed in a flexible position hours-wise I've held for 6 years, but due to low expenses (owning my house) I've only been making about $15-20k a year. I have a girlfriend who makes about the same, who I've been with for around 7 years.

Currently, I am looking at houses in the 380-420k range and would like to buy with ~25% down, and then rent out my existing home for ~1500 a month to pay my mortgage. I would invest ~120k of my remaining cash in something like Vanguard once I have secured a mortgage, and keep the remainder as reserves. I am not worried about spending my money frivolously; I don't vacation, drink, smoke, do drugs etc and my only leisure activity is video games - so I know *I* can make my mortgage payments ad infinitum.

My questions are as follows:
As a lender, am I an attractive prospective mortgage client? With 180k or so in cash reserves after my ~25% down payment, I look secure IMO but my low income may be spooky. My debt to income ratio and credit score hopefully help here. 

If I am not instantly attractive to some lenders, are there any potential recommendations on certain types I should pursue? 

Can I leverage the potential rental income of my current house or atleast its value in securing a mortgage with a good interest rate?

Can I secure a mortgage/title with just my name on it, without relying on my girlfriends income? I love her but generally it's simpler if things are just in my name, as a precaution.


I have other options on the table, like selling my house and buying in cash, but interest rates are very attractive right now to help offset recent housing inflation, while inflation in the housing market makes cash feel not as attractive.

The third dimension to this is whether it's worth to wait a year, suffer the increased interest rates, but have the potential to scoop up low stocks via my liquidity in a potential doomsday crash scenario like the doomers are predicting between supply shortages, the Evergrande situation in China and the generally stubborn, overpriced housing market + cooling housing demand over the past couple months with the mortgage forbearance phasing out in September.",finance

Sadly due to some life experiences the last 8 years of my life have been a nightmare.I was kicked out of home at 16 by an abusive father while I was studying IT. I didn't finish my studies and instead jumped into work to help my partner through her studies by paying the bills, food and rent so we could live.Shortly after we moved in with each other we became homeless, Couch surfed for a little bit and found another place with some friends. This didn't go so well and again we became homeless, Eventually I moved into another flat. By this point I was fed up with life, Became a drug addict and couldn't hold down a job.By this point my partner had finished studying and got a job, So she paid my way for a little.Again the flatting situation didn't go well and we moved into our own place.Shortly after this I had a motorcycle accident (Went head first into a concrete slab at 100ks) I was knocked out on impact and got sever concussion. As a result I had to take some time off to recover, Unfortunately my drug addiction got out of hand during this time and I ended up being out of work for three years. During this tho I did however complete my carpentry pre-trade.

I have now been off drugs for 8 months and have no intention of ever going back, I lost track of who I was and who I wanted to be and wasted a tone of money, Enough money to buy myself a house (or better yet start a business) I blew it all on drugs. This has been a hard thing to accept but I have accepted it. And started working towards a better life for both me and my partner.

I  have 2k invested, and 1k in my bank account.I save a good amount of my income and am about to pay off the remainder of my motorcycle loan (Feels good, Extra money each week to save and invest)

I guess, This is a bit of a vent. I feel hell bent, I've been diagnosed with PTSD. I had my first job at 12 so I could pay for the groceries, Father also couldn't hold down a job. My entire life I have been passionate about finance and business (told my father in 2011 to buy BTC, He did not but regrets it) but for some reason did not follow my brain and fell into traps. I feel like I have nothing to my name, and the thought of having poor financial health for the rest of my life haunts me.

I guess I just have massive regret for what could have been and am not focusing enough on what could be. Does anyone have any life advice or words of encouragement?

Sorry for the long post, Much respect fellow redditors. 

TL;DR:Kicked out of home at 16 by abusive father, Become drug addicted and had a motorcycle crash that resulted in sever concussion, Took 3 years off after that and am now 24 and 8 months clean from drugs. Have 2k invested and 1k saved but feel like I could be doing better in life and am haunted by the fact. Need some words of encouragement and/or life advice.",finance

* ASAN
* LYFT
* DELL
* AMC
* RGNX

Gapping DOWN:

* BABA
* BILI
* AVTR
* UVXY

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open higher after another choppy trading session on Friday. Fears over regulatory scrutiny in China continue, as the Financial Times reported that Beijing was looking to break up financial tech company Alipay. BABA and other Chinese stocks are trading lower in premarket, as a result. We should be getting more inflation numbers in this week, and this will be important to monitor, as it could affect how/when the Fed steps in. The August consumer price index (CPI) should be reported on Tuesday. We have been seeing some supply chain issues around the world, and this will likely apply upwards pressure on inflation numbers, at least in the short-term. Retail sales are expected to drop once again, we'll see if they're in line with analyst estimates. I think we could see some more volatility in the coming days.¬†

SPY is trading right around 448, and we could be in for another choppiness today. If we can't hold up over 448 support, we could see some more selling off. DIA is trading a bit under 349. 348 will be a support level to watch, but we could hold up after a bounce off the SMA(100) in Friday's trading. I'll be watching price action around that level. QQQ¬†is¬†trading a bit over 378 and is hovering between support and resistance. If we continue to see weakness, it could test 375 as support. If it sees strength, it could test 380 as resistance. Gold is trading flat, silver is slightly in the red, and crude oil is up and back over $70/barrel. B\*\*coin saw some more weakness over the weekend and is currently trading around 44,700. Things are looking bearish at the moment, but that could always change. Cr\*\*to-related stocks are trading a bit lower in premarket trading. Airlines and cruise stocks saw choppy sessions on Friday, and are looking bearish unless we see some strength in the near future. Meme stocks are up a bit in premarket trading, worth keeping an eye on. AMC's daily chart in particular looks good, I'll be watching for more strength.¬†

I submitted a Hardship Application as the forbearance came to an end &amp; have just been approved for a deferment..  everything owed during the forbearance is pushed to the end of the mortgage.  I have not yet accepted the deferral &amp; need to make a decision this week.  My mortgage is federally backed &amp; the remaining principal is about $80k.

After being unemployed for a long period I recently started a new job &amp; it‚Äôs gone very well &amp; I‚Äôm happy &amp; secure with it.  It doesn‚Äôt pay nearly as much as I used to make though.  My mortgage is a little over $2k/month.  I can only afford about half that with my new salary.

In requesting the hardship I made it clear that I need to pay less monthly aka a loan modification.  In speaking with the bank they said that at this stage only the deferral was considered &amp; that now I have to resubmit to have a modification specifically considered.

So, I need to decide if I should go ahead &amp; submit a new application this week for a loan modification or go ahead &amp; accept the deferral &amp; then explore other options.

First question then is, would there be any reason not to apply for the modification, accept the deferral &amp; then try to refinance?

Another thing is, my parents want to help.  I‚Äôm of course reticent to involve them in my financial problems but am still considering it.  They would need to use some kind of financial instrument to get enough money to be able to significantly assist though.. a home equity loan or similar.  They own their home &amp; are debt free.  If they were to help out I of course would pay them monthly as if paying my mortgage.  I‚Äôm gathering that getting a significant amount of money from a relative is pretty problematic as far as gift taxes go, though?  I originally thought I may sell my home to them for the amount I owe (the assumption being that they could easily get approved for a $80k mortgage).  From what I‚Äôm reading though, that sounds like I‚Äôm being pretty naive as it would be very problematic with the IRS since my home is worth significantly more.  But if there are other takes on that I would love to hear them.

So, I know that my most likely way forward is to not accept the deferral &amp; submit the Loan Modification request in the next few days but still wanted to post out here &amp; see what advice you peeps might have.  Thanks in advance!",finance

personalfinance,Advice on Paying off Solar Loan Amortization vs Student Loan Debt,"Hi All, I'm trying to decide the pros and cons of a debt payment approach.

My family is in the ""Paying of Moderate Interest debt"" phase of the Flowchart. Low 6 figure yearly income. Single Income (mine) with wife working full time taking care of our kids.

My wife has student loans, balance around 26k, 5% rate, 14 years left on the payment plan. The loan is held with one of the Federal loan processors (not privately.) Payment was around $250 a month prior to Pandemic pause, which should start again in January 2022. No early payoff penalty.

We've also got a solar loan about to start with the total of 32,328, 20 years, 1.5% interest. The loan is structure such that you can re-amortize in the first seventeen months in the total of $8400 (the Federal Tax Refund.) If I re-amortize in this time period, the monthly payment would be 116.80, as opposed to $160.80 if I did not re-amortize. No early payoff penalty.

I'm considering **not** re-amortizing the solar loan, and just using the anticipated Federal refund to pay down the balance of the student loans. We'll be pouring extra cash into the Student loans monthly since it is our last moderate interest debt, hoping to pay them off within the next year. I understand that there is a possibility of some sort of Federal loan forgiveness, but it's not something I want to plan financial decisions hoping for.

CryptoCurrency,Self directed IRA for tax free crypto investments,"So I know the benefits of a typical ROTH IRA, using taxed money for investments leads to tax free gains. I then stumbled upon self directed IRAs, seeing that some people use these to invest in real estate and other non typical investments. The question is could this be a good solution for a tax break and saving you from having to pay taxes on your crypto gains? 
Hypothetically - say you make 100k gross, you have an employee 401k that you Max out every year (19,500) and you also claim your crypto investments in an IRA and deduct them as well (6,000). This just bumped you down a tax bracket and instead of paying 24% now you are paying 22%! On top of you not having to pay any long term capital gains on your crypto either since it is considered an IRA.
Am I on to something here?

investing,How to hedge against inflation Michael Burry style. Part 2.,"This is the second installment to a post I made back in May that documented some of my inflation DD from researching Michael Burry/Scion's 13F plays. People on other subs found the information in part 1 useful so I thought I'd make a part 2 specifically for the broader audience on r/Investing.

By my estimate, 28.4% of Scion's Q2 2021 portfolio is currently hedging against inflation. I arrived at this number by going through the individual positions of Scion's Q2 2021 13F, using the ""Think Back"" function in ThinkOrSwim to estimate options contracts prices, and summing the resulting positions together.

# US 20+ year Treasury ETFs (7.6% of Scion's Q2 2021 portfolio)

Burry's treasury instrument of choice is the 20+ year bond. This is a direct play on inflation where he's essentially concluding that the Fed will eventually need to raise interest rates which will lead to an increase in bond yields thereby causing their prices to fall. TLT is tied to the bond price itself. TBT is tied to the inverse of the yield (so when the yield falls, TBT goes up 2x that rate (in theory)).

He has positions in both TLT and TBT (see below for descriptions). It should be noted that both of these positions first appeared in Scion's 13F in Q1 2021. It should also be noted that he reduced his TBT position and increased his TLT position in Q2 2021. His TLT position is the third largest position in his Q2 2021 portfolio (which, in my opinion, says something about which ETF he prefers).

**Put Options on** [Ishares 20+ year treasury bond etf (TLT)](https://investopedia.com/articles/investing/031915/overview-tlt-etf.asp) **- 7.2% of current holdings**

Probable Burry thesis: rising inflation over the mid- to long-term will lead to the need to increase interest rates, leading to increased yields and making these 20 year bonds less attractive.

Some context: The U.S. Treasury announced plans to start issuing 20-year treasury bonds in January 2020. The benefits to 20 year treasury bonds are that they're relatively safe, their value could increase if interest rates drop, and they're relatively liquid. The cons are that they're over a 20 year period (meaning you lock in very low interest rates at which you get paid), inflation may occur over that 20 year period and lead to an increase in interest rates that you'll miss out on, and rising interest rates in general hurt the value of these bonds (link).

**Call Options on** [Proshares trust ultrashort lehment 20+ year treas etf (TBT)](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/TBT/profile) **- 0.4% of holdings**

Probable Burry thesis: this is the same 20+ year treasury bond mentioned above so the strategy is likely the same. The difference here is that it's a call on a 2x inverse bond ETF.

Context: The ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses that correspond to two times the inverse of the daily performance of the ICE U.S. Treasury 20+ Year Bond Index. (from Zacks article linked above).

# Energy, Commodities, and Transport (11% of current holdings)

Commodities are a fairly traditional inflation play. This [article](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/020816/importance-commodity-pricing-understanding-inflation.asp) on investopedia gets into some of the details regarding the relationship between commodities and inflation. The challenge with each of these companies is determining whether the company is an explicit hedge against inflation or whether it‚Äôs a value investing play.

[Ovintiv Inc.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ovintiv-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-and-operating-results-301342593.html) **(Pan Canadian Energy - Encana Corp.) (OVV) - 4.06% of current holdings**

This is the 6th largest Scion position and the 2nd largest shares-only position (i.e., no options contracts).

Probable Thesis: First, it's an oil &amp; gas company (meaning the commodities checkbox is checked on this one). Second, it's arguably a riskier investment at the moment. They have very little cash on the balance sheet (enough for 1 day of operations). They are currently redirecting their cash flow towards paying down long-term debt which in itself is another positive for inflationary times (one group that does particularly well during inflation is debtors as the debt inflates itself away).

[Scorpio Tankers](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4438157-scorpio-tankers-has-more-upside) **(STNG), SunCoke Energy (SXC), and** [Golden Ocean Group Limited](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOGL) **(GOGL) - 2.9%, 2.4%, and 1.7%**

I grouped these positions together as they each clock in below 3% of the overall portfolio. Each of these was also an existing position that Burry added to in Q2 2021.

***Scorpio Tankers and Golden Ocean Group***

These two are likely plays on ocean freight/transport inflation. Scorpio is tied to oil transport and is a proxy play on any boost to oil demand that occurs at the global level. Golden Ocean Group looks similar but tied specifically to dry bulk goods.

***SunCoke Energy***

This is the one that I'm leaning more towards ""value investing play"" and less towards inflation (but I could be wrong). The arguments in favor of it being an inflation play are that it‚Äôs a commodity company (coal), it just recently started paying a dividend, and its been working towards deleveraging (at least that was the case earlier in the year). These are themes that you'll see in other investments such as CVS Health below.

# Revenue Mammoths (9.8% of current holdings)

The final group of companies are the revenue mammoths. They hail from the retail, grocery, and pharmacy sectors. All four of these organizations are in the top 31 companies in the world by revenue. They have some combination of pharmaceutical distribution and retail/grocery. They offer dividends with two of them being dividend aristocrats.

**CVS Health (Call Options and Shares) - 4.7% of portfolio**

Interestingly, CVS Health is the only stock where Burry is currently holding both shares and call options. They are the [7th largest company in the world by revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_by_revenue) (hence the revenue mammoth term).

The characteristics that make CVS an interesting potential inflation play are:

‚Ä¢ They have a large pharmaceutical distribution presence

‚Ä¢ They have a large health insurance segment

‚Ä¢ They have a sizeable retail store segment

‚Ä¢ They froze their dividend in 2018 to pay down debt related to their Aetna acquisition

What makes these intriguing characteristics from the inflation perspective?

Healthcare and pharmaceuticals have consistently beaten inflation over the past several decades. Pharmaceutical drugs continue to trend up. CVS owns a pharmacy benefits manager which, as a business, is incentivized through proportional rebates to push pricier drugs where they can.

From the retail perspective, their ""front"" stores are essentially baskets of goods which can pass on the costs of inflation to the consumer.

Lastly, the most intriguing reason (in my opinion) is their current strategy to pay down long-term debt. Their stock price is arguably depressed due to the massive $69 billion acquisition of Aetna they made in 2018. They had been increasing dividends every year for almost 2 decades before this acquisition, at which point they froze the dividend and put the money towards their debt. They estimate that they'll hit their debt-to-capitalization ratio in Spring of next year (I personally think it will be summer or fall of next year). At that point, it is anticipated that they will resume dividend hikes and share buybacks as they've done historically.

With CVS, you have a potential case where the 7th largest company in the world by revenue is undervalued due to a large amount of debt that they are slowly and steadily paying off in an advantageous inflationary environment with a predicted return to hiking their dividends in 2022 (and they appear to be largely inflation-proof).

**The Opioid Twins: McKesson Corp. and Cardinal Health (Call Options only) - 2.9% of portfolio**

Two more pharmaceutical revenue mammoths: McKesson clocks in at #12 on the largest companies by revenue list and is the largest pharmaceutical distributor in the United States. They also own a chain of 4000 pharmacy stores. Cardinal Health clocks in at 14th by revenue and is in the top 5 largest pharmaceutical distributors with McKesson. Both offer similar inflation characteristics to the ones listed for CVS Health with the difference being that CVS owns a health insurance plan on top of their pharmacy retail/PBM businesses.

Another key difference between CVS Health and the duo of McKesson and Cardinal is that McKesson and Cardinal Health were penalized in July of 2021 for their role in the Opioid crisis. Cardinal Health [expects to pay $6.4 billion over 18 years](https://www.dispatch.com/story/business/2021/07/22/cardinal-health-pay-6-4-billion-part-opioid-settlement/8053626002/) for its share of a $26 billion opioid settlement. It's possible that this legislation is currently a drag on these two stocks.

**Walmart (Call Options only) - 1% of portfolio**

Walmart is an interesting case because, at first glance, it appears to make more sense as an inflation play than the rest of this mammoth revenue group. Walmart is the largest company on Earth by yearly revenue. They have a strong pharmaceutical presence like the other companies in this category though over half of their revenue is actually from their grocery segment.

What makes them an interesting inflation play is that their stores are literally giant baskets of goods. They have a large breadth of products which allows them to keep the prices of various product categories lower than their competitors. They also own the basket that the goods live in (along with the land around the basket). Real Estate is a well-known inflation hedge.

personalfinance,How much should our first mortgage be?,"Good afternoon! I recently got engaged and my fianc√© and I would like to purchase a house next year. Obviously, it is a terrible time to buy, but it doesn't seem like it is going to get any better anytime soon. With that in mind, we are planning on looking in January and hopefully buying one by July (when our lease is up). I make 74k and am debt free. She makes almost 60k and has about 150k in student loans. She doesn't have much of a savings, like 6k. I have 40k in savings, and about 70k in investments.

After the forbearance ends, her parents are giving her 60k to put towards the student loans. We don't know what any of the interest rates are and there are 3 loans. One is 28k, one is 48k, and one is 77k. The great lakes site doesn't show what the old interest rate was as it just shows 0 due to the forbearance. A question we had was what to do with the 60k from her parents. We could either pay off 1 and take a chunk out of the mid size or largest loan. Or just take a big chunk out of the biggest loan. My uncle suggested calling them and asking if they would forgive the interest on the loans if we could pay off the principle. I don't know how likely that'd be, but worth a shot nonetheless. Side note, the interest rates on these loans must be terrible. She graduated late 2016 and the combined interest accrued on the bigger loans are 36k in not quite 5 years. Sigh. Side note Side note, she hasn't put any money towards the loans aside as we are waiting to see what they are doing with student loan cancellation. I honestly can't imagine anything happening that will be that impactful with the amount that she owns though. 

Now onto the mortgage. Considering we make over 120k combined, I thought a mortgage of 250k would be solid. I don't want to go too high considering we'll still have to tackle her loans. Frankly, there aren't many solid contenders that I've seen so far in the 250k range. All the ones that we've really liked were in the 300-350k range but that seems high for our first home. 

Essentially, I want to know what is a reasonable budget considering our existing debt and our combined salaries and my savings/investments; and also what to do with her loans and the 60k we are receiving for them. We fortunately do not have any kids yet and her student loans are the only debt that we have. I can't think of any other details that people would like but feel free to ask!",finance

personalfinance,Suggestions for credit debt relief companies. Good idea?,"Might be a dumb question. I'll try to make this quick. I was laid off due to covid from June 2020 to March 2021. In that amount of time, I accrued about $25k in CC debt caring for myself and another loved one. Unemployment barely paid my rent. I have a good job now and can pay off the debt in time but I'm also accruing 15.99% interest per month. I am currently applying $2500/month to pay off the CC bill but will still be using the CC so it'll probably take me about 12 months to pay off the initial debt and whatever I continue to accrue and get back to a position where I can pay off the entire card every month no problem. (I put my bills on the CC to get the rewards, plus other purchases)

Both Mint.com and creditkarma have suggested companies like upstart for a loan at about 3%-5% interest and pay off the debt entirely and I just pay them in lower monthly payments like $500-$600 for 2-3 years (not exact figures), but I'll probably pay more than the minimum to pay more on the principle and give them less interest in the end. Common sense tells me 3% interest is better than 15.99% of course, but I've never used any of these companies for a loan for credit debt.

Has anyone ever done this and recommend an institution? Or is there a chance I can just call my CC company and ask them for a lower interest rate? The reason I haven't pulled the trigger is that the last time I took out a loan was when I financed my car but it was with BofA, not some other company I haven't heard of until now. I'm sure Upstart is credible but I have never done anything like this.",finance

For reference, I just bought a house for $700k. I put down $70k and got a HELOC for the remainder. The HELOC is 3.5% interest fixed for 5 years, and then variable.

Any input or comments are very appreciated. My specific questions are--

&amp;#x200B;

1. I am pretty healthy. My understanding is if you don't anticipate many regular health expenses, the HSA is a better bet than conventional health insurance bc I can invest that money into the market and deduct it pre-tax? Is that correct? I don't have regular health expenses other than annual checkups etc.
2. So the minimum monthly payment for my house is $2,621 as mentioned above. However I can easily pay more than that. There is no pre-payment penalty on my HELOC. So how do I decide how quickly to pay down the house? Based on my budget, I have roughly $13,400 per month after taxes and expenses- is there a formula or guide for how much above the minimum one should pay off the principal on the mortgage? The HELOC is fixed 3.5% for 5 years and then variable. I assume I should at least try to refinance in that time so pay off the principal until it gets below a conventional mortgage (\~540,000) and then refinance at a locked in low rate (if rates are low by then). I went with a HELOC because a jumbo mortgage required 20% down which I didn't have for a rate of 3.25%, and I'm in the second hottest housing market in the country, so the price of the house could easily have gone up tremendously in the time it took me to save the remaining deposit.
3. What are good strategies to invest some of that leftover money? Some of it is going to go to expenses etc, but in addition in investing in the market &amp; paying off the house, do y'all recommend anything else?

My ultimate goal is to be able to retire if I wanted to by 50-55. I'm currently 35. I know a lot of physicians who are bad with money and have to work in their 70s, because your income has nothing to do with your wealth, and I do not want to happen to me.",finance

personalfinance,Need urgent advice with Loan,"Hello everyone, 

I've recently started reading about the world of Personal Finance through you guys for a couple of months now and I've been learning about how to manage my money and my spending habits along with gathering information about credit scores, investing, etc. I had opened up a secured credit card and had made a couple of payments and I started building my credit. I used the credit card quite a bit so my utilization was high and I stopped using it because I learned the interest was going to eat away at the payments.

However, right around the same time, I received a letter in the mail for a personal loan from a local company, ""Western Finance""(Pictures provided). I figured even though the interest rate was bad, I could pay back the money anyways in the next couple of months as long as I saved up properly and wasn't spending anything I didn't need to since I'm currently working nearby and living at home with my family. I was a little skeptical because the back of the letter mentioned a ""Jury Trial Waiver"" but at first glance online the company seemed fine. I'm currently an undergrad student at a nearby college and I needed the money for some expenses I had coming up so I decided to take the loan. 

The issue is, I filled out the slip that was at the bottom of the letter, went to my bank and deposited the slip but I didn't receive a call from the issuer of the loan or the company or anyone for that matter. I called last Friday and no one picked up. I called today again since It's been exactly 30 days so I figured they'd send me an email or some kind of notification about my first payment sooner or later but they didn't. (I realize now they didn't even have an email from me). I called today again and spoke with the desklady and now she's claiming that I'm not in their system and that her manager is going to be in tomorrow so they can sort this out or that I can go to the office with a screenshot that my bank gave me when I deposited the slip and they can register me that way. My concern, especially after spending more time learning about fraudulent schemes where people get scammed out of their money is that this could be some kind of scam since the slip I deposited had my date of birth, social security AND phone number. The company seems legitimate since they have multiple locations across my state (Texas) and have some kind of online presence but I'm starting to wonder if I made a mistake and it's making me extremely paranoid. I hope this turns out to be just some expensive loan I have to pay and not anything worse that could affect me in the long run, which is why I'm posting here to see if anyone could potentially understand what's going on. Is this some kind of mistake on someone's end? Should I be worried that someone has all my personal info and is going to use my identity? or am I just going to have to payback a loan with bad interest? 

Any help/advice/suggestions are more than welcome. Thanks guys.

investing,The market is strong: correcting some common misconceptions about the market being unstable,"Hi everyone, there's been a whole lot of talk about a market crash on reddit lately. Most of that chatter comes from WSB and not this sub but there is still some talk of it on this sub. I wanted to give my 2 cents on the issue and start a discussion on the topic. I usually see people talking about market crashes on reddit referring to 3 key issues: the price of equities, inflation, and reverse repo. I am going to address all of those here.

**The price of equities**

Many people are worried about the soaring prices of stocks right now. If you take a look at the SPX or NDX or really any index, the RSI will say that it's oversold. Additionally, the market hasn't had a 5% correction since October of LAST YEAR. Even more, the market is making new all time highs almost every single month and it seems like the stock market just keeps going up and won't stop. Despite all of this, I am not sold in the least bit on this being a cause for a market crash. First, if you take a look at the SPX historically, we've had bull runs last longer and gain more on a percentage basis than this current one (I plan on doing a DD on that in the near future). Additionally, it makes sense for the market to be at these levels - earnings are consistency out of the park for most companies. Most importantly, however, is the FED's actions. The FED's QE policies can be described in no way but aggressive. The FED has been purchasing bonds and such since the 2008 recession, but has aggressively picked this up because of covid. The effect that this has is it makes bond prices go extremely high, which is why yields are so low. When yields are that low and inflation fears are persistent, investors can only put their money in the stock market if they want to make returns that outpace inflation. This is even more evident if you simply google ""SPX FED balance sheet."" Doing this will show you pictures of how the SPX moves directly proportional to the size of the FED's balance sheet. In conclusion, I believe that it makes complete and total sense that the market is at this current level. Are we due for a pullback in the near future? Probably. But is a giant looming correction coming? I don't think so in the least bit.

**Inflation**

Many people also say that inflation is what will destroy the stock market. I am not going to discuss whether I believe inflation is transitory or not because that will take up way too much time and is another issue in its own right. To analyze why I don't believe inflation would cause a market crash, let's look at several factors. First, let's look at history. The greatest inflation in the US was in the 1970's and 1980's. We didn't see a market crash in the least bit in the 1970's and in the 1980's we saw a very strong bull market. Next, lets assume for a minute that inflation does get a bit out of hand. If prices get out of control, the idea is that the economy will slow down because consumer spending will decrease, which will lead to lower earnings and fewer jobs. However, I don't believe this will happen because of the FED. The FED has shown us time and time again that it is here to support the stock market. If we see inflation, yes, maybe the FED will raise rates but the stock market has grown so accustomed to QE policies, I don't think the FED will just end them to stop inflation. Instead, I think that the FED will do something to stimulate the market in a different way - perhaps through more targeted bond purchases or something in that nature. The point is, I see absolutely no scenario where the FED just says ""sorry baby"" to the market to stop inflation.

**Reverse Repo**

Seeing people talk about how RRP transaction amounts being at records is an indication that the economy is going to crash is something that really annoys me because it shows an absolute and total misunderstanding of the subject. People who say this see that RRP total overnight transactions have been hitting records basically every week - this is completely correct, they have been getting into the trillions lately. People see this and immediately think MARKET CRASH. However, this shows a complete and total misunderstanding of RRP. The only time that RRP stats are a cause for concern is when the RATE goes up. When the rate goes up, it means that institutions see overnight lending as risky and want more compensation for it - we saw this in 2019 and the FED quickly addressed it. The current reason why RRP total transactions are rising because the FED is trying to put more liquidity into the system in order to spur economic growth - this is exactly what the FED wants to happen. The FED wants excess liquidity to be in the system. Economic crises often start when there is a credit crunch - i.e. large institutions are hesitant to lend because of some systemic risk or downturn. Reverse repo numbers show the exact opposite - they show that there is excess lending activity in the system.

**Conclusion**

Thanks for listening to my rant. I think that the economy is completely fine right now. Yes, there will probably be a slight correction in the near future due to delta concerns or just the general market cycle but I do not in the slightest bit believe that there will be a market crash in the foreseeable future. If you found this useful share it with friends, family, enemies, whoever. Happy investing.",finance
personalfinance,Not sure where to start with planning for the future,"My fianc√© and I are getting married in June (wedding funded mostly by family) and are working on the best way to handle our student/other debt. We are making decent money (combined around $165k) but we are having trouble figuring out the best way to handle his student debt. 

Other info:

My student debt \~ 7k in 0% loan with family- paying $350/month

We both have car payments- my interest rate is 2.9% and his interest rate is 6.19% (at the time he bought the car he was not making as much money and credit score was lower)

My credit score: 762 His credit score:715

I own a house and we pay \~ $1500 for the mortgage each month. 

His student loans are all federal (stafford unsub and direct unsub) totaling about $38k- no interest until February. The interest rate on the majority of the loan is 6.8%. There is $5720 @ 3.8%

I have about 20k in savings and another 3k in a checking account.

Financial planners/advisors seem really expensive but maybe worth it to help make the best decisions? I'm wondering if it is smart for me to pay off some of his student debt even though it is a federal loan? Should we try and refinance his auto loan? If so, should I cosign?  Should I take out a personal loan if I can get a lower interest rate and pay off his student loans? 

Any advice appreciated or if you know of an online financial advising company who would be helpful in this situation. Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,How is ARM mortgage amortization calculated?,"I'm trying to model out a SOFR 7/6 ARM, SOFR 10/6 ARM, and 30-year fixed mortgage options to see where the breakeven is between interest paid over time. Obviously with today's interest rates the 30-year fixed is clearly sensible, but odds are we wouldn't stay in the house for more than 10-12 years anyway so the ARM options represent some fairly attractive savings.

Is the principal portion of ARM payments calculated as if it's a 30-year fixed loan using the **intro** rate (e.g. using the PPMT function in Excel/GSheets)? Or is it more complicated than that? I assume the monthly interest portion will always be the outstanding balance on the loan √ó the interest rate √∑ 12.",finance
personalfinance,Which student loan do I pay off first?,"Over the past 2 years, I've created a spreadsheet to crush all my debt to dust. üí®And it's working! I'm down to my last 4 student loans.üò§

Though I noticed something, yesterday, with my (2) largest loans.I'm not paying the balance, but the ***interest*** that has accrued up over the years (!!!).When I saw what the original loan balance was vs. what it is now - my reaction was üòµü•¥ü§¢ü§Æüò≠

This is messing with my mind so much, it's making me want to readjust my payoffs a bit.So this is what I got:

* Student loan // $4500 @ 3.25% (this is my lowest, interest all paid up)
* Student loan // $15K @ 5.13% (with over $500 of unpaid interest)
* Student loan // $20K @ 5.13% (with over $700 of unpaid interest)
* There's a 4th student loan, but don't worry about that one

I was originally going to do The Snowball Method.Focus my attention on the $4500 student loan, first, and then work on the others.

But now I'm thinking that I need to nip these unpaid interest rates in the bud, FIRST, and THEN go back to snowballing the $4500 loan. And I'll continue to pay over the ""asked amount"" (they don't ask for payment until January 2022) to make sure that interest rate doesn't creep back out of control again.

Am I thinking about this right?Thoughts?

***UPDATE:*** *Thank you so much everyone for your thoughts on this! I read through all your comments and, just to wrap this up, this is how I'm gonna play it. And let me preface it by saying, that it's a mix between my emotions (or ""warm, fuzzy feelings"" as someone said down below*üòÖ*) &amp; strategy.*  
*I agree with Annabelle (down in the comments), that I should pay off the accrued interest on those (2) large loans first - because that rollover interest (unbeknownst to me) has been helping that debt get out of control. So, I'll reel that in first, making sure all the interest has been paid off from this year.*

*Then, I'll focus my efforts on paying off the $4500 loan. Why? Because my dad is a co-signer on that loan. This is the last loan he's tethered to, and I want it done &amp; over with for the both of us. Plus, his &amp; my credit score will go up after it's paid off - if not even by a few points.* üëçüèæ

*Next, if I go off of everyones advice, I'll go after the 4th loan I didn't mention. Why? Because THAT ONE has the highest interest rate of 6.8%, but it's only around $4500. So I wasn't too worried about it. Now, I think I shouldn't take it so lightly.* üòä

*These two loans can be paid off by the end of this year, or at least, the first quarter of next year.*   
*I'm REALLY looking forward to that relief.*

*Last, I'll go after those two large loans. Most likely setting up an automatic payment, with a LARGE amount, that'll pay the loans month-to-month without me having to worry about it (except 1-2x/month to make sure everything is okay with ALL my finances).*

*The end.*   
*Again, thank you for all your comments. It really helped me come up with this strategy moving forward.*",finance

After being negative through most of the day, the three major indexes reversed in the last hour of the market in order to snap a five-day consecutive losing streak, the longest since February. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.25% up, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed even while the Dow Jones (DIA) broke its recent streak of relative underperformance to close 0.74% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed 0.58% higher. 

Last week, new economic data showed that prices paid by producers for materials once again rose last month, once again highlighting the strain that stills exists as supply-side pressures and labor market shortages once again push inflationary readings higher. This report shows that, despite the pandemic surging once again, demand by consumers remains red-hot and continues to outstrip manufacturing capacity, causing shortages, which, as basic economics shows, pushes prices higher. The producer price index for final demand rose 0.7% last month after two straight monthly increases of 1.0%, the Labor Department said. The gain was led by a 0.7% advance in services following a 1.1% jump in July. A 1.5% increase in trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, accounted for two-thirds of the broad rise in services. Goods prices jumped 1.0% after climbing 0.6% in July, with food rebounding 2.9%. In the 12 months through August, the PPI accelerated 8.3%, the biggest year-on-year advance since November 2010, though one has to take into account this number is inflated due to easy comparisons to last year, given the absolute collapse of prices during the height of the pandemic before the vaccine existed. Economists had forecast a rise of 0.6% on a monthly basis and 8.2% on a yearly basis, basically in line with reality. 

Mike Loewengart, Managing Director at E-Trade Financial, said of the PPI, ‚ÄúAnyone who has bought pretty much everything recently knows that supply chain issues are widespread and inflation is real, so this won‚Äôt be too much of a surprise for the market. Keep in mind we‚Äôre still in the transitory period where the Fed is not inclined to budge of easy money policies.‚Äù

In positive news, there are signs that the wave of coronavirus Delta variant cases in the US may be cresting. The seven-day average of daily Covid cases is about 144,300 as of Sept. 12, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. That figure is down 12% over the past week and 14% from the most recent peak in case counts on Sept. 1, when the country was reporting an average of roughly 167,600 cases per day. Dr. Arturo Casadevall, Chair of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at Johns Hopkins University said, This is good news. It could represent that we have reached a peak and we are now on the way down.‚Äù  As of Sept 12, 54.4% of the US population is fully vaccinated while 63.8% have received at least one dose of either Pfizer (PFE) or Moderna (MRNA). 

Shares of Chinese companies were broadly lower again as the regulatory crackdown by the CCP continues. According to a report by the Financial Times, the CCP intends to break up Alipay, the financial super-app owned by Jack Ma‚Äôs Ant Group that has more than $1 billion users, and force the creation of a new entity for the company‚Äôs lending unit. The plan will also see Ant turn over user data that underpins its data decision to a new credit scoring joint-venture which will be partly state-owned.[ https://www.ft.com/content/01b7c7ca-71ad-4baa-bddf-a4d5e65c5d79](https://www.ft.com/content/01b7c7ca-71ad-4baa-bddf-a4d5e65c5d79)

Looking ahead, market participants are closely eyeing new reports on inflation and consumer spending set to be released next week. The former will be monitored to signal whether upward price pressures during the recovery have extended further and whether the Federal Reserve may need to step in sooner rather than later to stave off a lasting jump in inflation. Consensus economists expect Tuesday's consumer price index (CPI) to rise by 5.3% in August over last year, pulling back from July's more than a decade-high annual rise of 5.4%. 

The new data on August retail sales out from the Commerce Department later this week will also offer a look at how consumer spending has held up amid concerns over the Delta variant and rising prices. Overall retail sales are expected to drop by 0.8% in August in Thursday's report, extending July's 1.1% decline. As a reminder, consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP. 

**Highlights**

* House Democrats released details of a plan that intends to help pay for the $3.5 trillion 2021 spending bill currently in consideration. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., on Monday released details of plan that includes increasing the top corporate tax rate to 26.5%, up from the current rate of 21%, and restoring the top rate to 39.6% for individuals earning over $400,000 and married couples earning over $450,000. In order for the bill to pass and avoid the filibuster, Democrats are using special budget rules but need all 50 Democratic Senators and virtually all other House Democrats to agree. 
* In more news coming out of China, regulators ordered the largest internet companies to stop blocking links from rivals on their apps, another step designed to increase competition among tech companies.

personalfinance,Forbearance Leads to Double Charge?,"With the full 18 month forbearance period on a mortgage coming up, I was presented with a number of choices by my lender which seem to converge on what appears to lead to being charged twice for 18 months worth of deferred payments. I'm hoping someone might have gone through this process and can shine some light on the options and where there might be something I'm missing.

For simplicity's sake, suppose I'm in year 29 of a 30 year mortgage, so 1 year left, with $12k principal, 0% interest rate, and $1k payments per month which go directly into principal.

In a non forbearance scenario, I continue payments in Jan 2020, and by paying $1k in principal/month, the entire loan will have been paid off by Dec 2020.

Instead, in Jan 2020 I go into forbearance and I make no payments for the year. At the end of 2020, I have:

* $12k remaining principal
* $12k in deferred payments

In 202**1** I go off forbearance and tack the 12 missed payments to the end of my mortgage and resume making my regular $1k payments. By Dec 2021, there is $0 residual principal as expected, but I'm told I still have $12k in payments that were deferred. I've now got to spend 202**2** making those deferred payments.

In effect, I'll have paid $24k total on $12k of principal. This can't possibly be right is it?

I've also been presented an option to roll the missed payments into the principal and get that principal refinanced. Fundamentally this option also suffers from the same issue in that the deferred payments are being assessed, but the pre-forebearance principal balance doesn't get reduced by the commensurate amount i.e. I'm being double charged.

personalfinance,Qualifying Events for Early Withdrawal - Roth IRA,"State: Texas  
Age: 48  
Scenario: I was a victim of the 2021 winter storm and my condo was destroyed.  Everything was removed including all walls, ceilings, floors and AC ducts.  I am fighting the HOA insurance for payment, but they are taking their sweet time.  I've gotten one payment that hasn't even covered half of the damages.  It has been 7 months.  I am at a place where I won't be able to move onto the next phase because of lack of funds.  The event was considered a Federal Disaster.  

Question:  Would withdrawing money for the repairs from my rollover Roth IRA account count as a qualifying event, like a new home purchase or other such events?

Additional Info:

- I haven't been at my current job long enough to have adequate funds in my 401k for a loan.

- I don't qualify for FEMA or other goverment assistance because I make too much money and pay my taxes and bills and have insurance and good credit.

- I can't get a home equity loan or HELOC because my contractor suggested I talk to my bank and defer my mortgage payments due to COVID hardship.  I was paying a mortgage and hotel (out of pocket after about 4 months) and I deferred and now can't qualify for a loan until I have made 3 continuous months of payments, which won't be until November/December.

I have one year of college credits that I'm hoping will all transfer, so I should have 3 years left of school. This would put me at 69k for 3 years of tuition and room and board. I am also thinking of doing summer semesters to finish in 2 years and make up for the time I lost taking 2 years off of school. That'd be about 30k a year, putting me at 60k for 2 years. I am wanting to be a teacher, and I know that teachers do not make very much money coming out of school, if ever. I know there are scholarships out there and I am planning on utilizing those, but are there any other ways to come out of school debt-free, or close to it? I'm planning on working while I'm in school as well. Thank you in advance!

Edit: Forgot to add, I am still living at home before I go to school, where I will then live on campus.

CryptoCurrency,Treasury Dept. Declares IRS Will Monitor Transactions of ALL U.S. Accts Over $600 ( including crypto),"Tyrannical move would allow federal government to also snoop on all crypto and cash app transactions in violation of 4th Amendment

Joe Biden‚Äôs Treasury Department has announced Thursday an invasive new initiative tasking the federal government to audit virtually all financial transactions of Americans with bank accounts holding at least $600.

The Treasury document, called ‚ÄúGeneral Explanations of the Administration‚Äôs Fiscal Year 2022 Revenue Proposals,‚Äù outlines how every individual bank account with over $600 will be monitored by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

‚ÄúThis proposal would create a comprehensive financial account information reporting regime. Financial institutions would report data on financial accounts in an information return. The annual return will report gross inflows and outflows with a breakdown for physical cash, transactions with a foreign account, and transfers to and from another account with the same owner,‚Äù the memo states.

‚ÄúThis requirement would apply to all business and personal accounts from financial institutions, including bank, loan, and investment accounts, with the exception of accounts below a low de minimis gross flow threshold of $600 or fair market value of $600.‚Äù

This proposal will also ‚Äúapply to crypto asset exchanges and custodians.‚Äù

Patrick Hedger, vice president of policy at the Taxpayers‚Äô Protection Alliance told the DailyMail the Treasury‚Äôs move blatantly violates the Fourth Amendment, which protects citizens from unreasonable search and seizure.

‚ÄúThe IRS is first and foremost, a law enforcement agency, and the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures in pursuit of, of looking for wrongdoing and criminal actions, so I think this is going to run into severe Fourth Amendment headwinds,‚Äù Hedger said.

Hedger also said this targeting of lower income Americans amounts to the ‚Äúultimate regressive tax.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to push more folks into small cash transactions, you‚Äôre going to push more banking offshore ‚Ä¶ the big fish out there that do have sizable assets that are that are eligible for taxation offshore. This is the ultimate regressive tax,‚Äù Hedger said.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to end up punishing the worst off among us ‚Ä¶ the lower income folks in this country have historically been the targets of aggressive IRS audits because they don‚Äôt have the CPAs and the lawyers to be able to fight back,‚Äù he added.

This tyrannical move comes in tandem with Biden‚Äôs draconian edict requiring businesses to force their employees to get the COVID injection.

I understand the calculation is: `APY = ( 1 + r/N )^N - 1` which is just the sum of return over a number compounding periods but what influences this  `r` (nominal interest rate)?

Does someone choose this or is it determined by the amount of liquidity in the pool or by the automated market maker?

Just some ways of which you can get some free crypto:

\- BRAVE Browser, setting up BRAVE browser and setting up an account (That links directly to gemini) can be a useful way of getting free BAT tokens, what makes this better is that it's actually a really good browser too! It's relatively simple to set up and connect to Gemini / Uphold, you won't get loads of BAT but I usually get between 3-6 on a busy month.  Well worth doing and like i say, the browser is great. 

\- Coinbase Earn, This is a bit more difficult as I know Coinbase has people on a waiting list for this, it's actually the most simple way to earn Crypto ever, once off the waiting list, you scroll to the bottom on Coinbase, answer the quiz (Can get it wrong and still get the crypto, unlimited attempts) easy as that, free crypto.

\- CoinmarketCap Earn, this is similar to the above but is actually less predictable, you must answer all the questions correctly and then link it to your Binance, then a sample of the quiz completers will receive the free Crypto once the lesson is shut. Still, worth the 10 minutes of your time for potential free crypto.

\- Sweatcoin, Pays you for walking, this seems to be extremely early days and i've seen a lot of negative reviews, people can get paid out in crypto but seems to have a lot of flaws, this is something I think will be extremelt relevant in the years to come, can see a new coin coming in and doing this properly. 

\- RedditMoons, everyone in this space knows about reddit moons, so I won't delve deeper into them

\- Staking, This involves placing your coins into a savings account (Binance offer flexible ones with bad interest rates but the money isn't locked away) OR you can stake on a number of different apps with really great interest rates. This will see you literally make money by having your crypto in a certain place, just be certain of the times it needs to be locked away for, is great, especially when the price goes up a lot, I purchased ADA at 10p, staked it and made over 100 from staking it and took profits on some ADA.",cryptocurrency

&gt; **Study says nearly half of defense spending for 9/11 wars went to private contractors**

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/study-says-nearly-half-of-defense-spending-for-9-11-wars-went-to-private-contractors


__________________________

Up to half of the $14 trillion spent by the Pentagon since 9/11 went to for-profit defense contractors, a study released Monday found. While much of this money went to weapons suppliers, the research is the latest to point to the dependence on contractors for war-zone duties as contributing to mission failures in Afghanistan in particular.

In the post-9/11 wars, U.S. corporations contracted by the Defense Department not only handled war-zone logistics like running fuel convoys and staffing chow lines but performed mission-crucial work like training and equipping Afghan security forces ‚Äî security forces that collapsed last month as the Taliban swept the country.

Within weeks, and before the U.S. military had even completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Taliban easily routed an Afghan government and military that Americans had spent 20 years and billions of dollars to stand up. President Joe Biden placed blame squarely on the Afghans themselves. ‚ÄúWe gave them every chance,‚Äù he said last month. ‚ÄúWhat we could not provide them was the will to fight.‚Äù

But William Hartung, the author of Monday‚Äôs study by Brown University‚Äôs Costs of War project and the Center for International Policy, and others say it‚Äôs essential that Americans examine what role the reliance on private contractors played in the post-9/11 wars. In Afghanistan, that included contractors allegedly paying protection money to warlords and the Taliban themselves, and the Defense Department insisting on equipping the Afghan air force with complex Blackhawk helicopters and other aircraft that few but U.S. contractors knew how to maintain.

‚ÄúIf it were only the money, that would be outrageous enough,‚Äù Hartung, the director of the arms and security program at the Center for International Policy, said of instances where the Pentagon‚Äôs reliance on contractors backfired. ‚ÄúBut the fact it undermined the mission and put troops at risk is even more outrageous.‚Äù

At the start of this year, before Biden began the final American withdrawal from Afghanistan, there were far more contractors in Afghanistan and also in Iraq than U.S. troops.

The U.S. saw about 7,000 military members die in all post-9/11 conflicts, and nearly 8,000 contractors, another Costs of War study estimates.

The Professional Services Council, an organization representing businesses contracting with the government, cited a lower figure from the U.S. Department of Labor saying nearly 4,000 federal contractors have been killed since 2001.

A spokeswoman pointed to a statement last month from the organization‚Äôs president, David J. Berteau: ‚ÄúFor almost two decades, government contractors have provided broad and essential support for U.S. and allied forces, for the Afghan military and other elements of the Afghan government, and for humanitarian and economic development assistance.‚Äù

U.S. officials after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks embraced private contractors as an essential part of the U.S. military response.

It started with then-Vice President Dick Cheney, the former CEO of Halliburton. Halliburton received more than $30 billion to help set up and run bases, feed troops and carry out other work in Iraq and Afghanistan by 2008, the study says. Cheney and defense contractors argued that relying on private contractors for work that service members did in previous wars would allow for a trimmer U.S. military, and be more efficient and cost effective.

By 2010, Pentagon spending had surged by more than one-third, as the U.S. fought dual wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In a post-9/11 American, politicians vied to show support for the military in a country grown far more security conscious.

‚ÄúAny member of Congress who doesn‚Äôt vote for the funds we need to defend this country will be looking for a new job after next November,‚Äù the study notes Harry Stonecipher, then the vice president of Boeing, telling The Wall Street Journal the month after the attacks.

And up to a third of the Pentagon contracts went to just five weapons suppliers. Last fiscal year, for example, the money Lockheed Martin alone got from Pentagon contracts was one and a half times the entire budgets of the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, according to the study.

The Pentagon pumped out more contracts than it could oversee, lawmakers and government special investigators said.

For example, a Florida Republican Party official made millions on what lawmakers charged were excess profits when the U.S. granted a one-of-a-kind contract for fuel convoys from Jordan to Iraq, the study notes. The electrocution of at least 18 service members by bad wiring in bases in Iraq, some of it blamed on major contractor Kellogg, Brown and Root, was another of many instances where government investigations pointed to shoddy logistics and reconstruction work.

The stunning Taliban victory last month in Afghanistan is drawing attention now to even graver consequences: the extent to which the U.S. reliance on contractors may have heightened the difficulties of the Afghan security forces.

Jodi Vittori, a former Air Force lieutenant colonel and scholar of corruption and fragile states at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who was not involved in the study, points to the U.S. insistence that the Afghan air force use U.S.-made helicopters. Afghans preferred Russian helicopters, which were easier to fly, could be maintained by Afghans, and were suited to rugged Afghanistan.

When U.S. contractors pulled out with U.S. troops this spring and summer, taking their knowledge of how to maintain U.S.-provided aircraft with them, top Afghan leaders bitterly complained to the U.S. that it had deprived them of one essential advantage over the Taliban.

Hartung, like others, also points to the corruption engendered by the billions of loosely monitored dollars that the U.S. poured into Afghanistan as one central reason that Afghanistan‚Äôs U.S.-backed government lost popular support, and Afghan fighters lost morale.

Hillary Clinton, while secretary of state under President Barack Obama, accused defense contractors at risk in war zones of resorting to payoffs to armed groups, making protection money one of the biggest sources of funding for the Taliban.

The United States also relied, in part, on defense contractors to carry out one of the tasks most central to its hopes of success in Afghanistan ‚Äî helping to set up and train an Afghan military and other security forces that could stand up to extremist groups and to insurgents, including the Taliban.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/study-says-nearly-half-of-defense-spending-for-9-11-wars-went-to-private-contractors

__________________________

Up to half of the $14 trillion spent by the Pentagon since 9/11 went to for-profit defense contractors, a study released Monday found. While much of this money went to weapons suppliers, the research is the latest to point to the dependence on contractors for war-zone duties as contributing to mission failures in Afghanistan in particular.

In the post-9/11 wars, U.S. corporations contracted by the Defense Department not only handled war-zone logistics like running fuel convoys and staffing chow lines but performed mission-crucial work like training and equipping Afghan security forces ‚Äî security forces that collapsed last month as the Taliban swept the country.

Within weeks, and before the U.S. military had even completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Taliban easily routed an Afghan government and military that Americans had spent 20 years and billions of dollars to stand up. President Joe Biden placed blame squarely on the Afghans themselves. ‚ÄúWe gave them every chance,‚Äù he said last month. ‚ÄúWhat we could not provide them was the will to fight.‚Äù

But William Hartung, the author of Monday‚Äôs study by Brown University‚Äôs Costs of War project and the Center for International Policy, and others say it‚Äôs essential that Americans examine what role the reliance on private contractors played in the post-9/11 wars. In Afghanistan, that included contractors allegedly paying protection money to warlords and the Taliban themselves, and the Defense Department insisting on equipping the Afghan air force with complex Blackhawk helicopters and other aircraft that few but U.S. contractors knew how to maintain.

‚ÄúIf it were only the money, that would be outrageous enough,‚Äù Hartung, the director of the arms and security program at the Center for International Policy, said of instances where the Pentagon‚Äôs reliance on contractors backfired. ‚ÄúBut the fact it undermined the mission and put troops at risk is even more outrageous.‚Äù

At the start of this year, before Biden began the final American withdrawal from Afghanistan, there were far more contractors in Afghanistan and also in Iraq than U.S. troops.

The U.S. saw about 7,000 military members die in all post-9/11 conflicts, and nearly 8,000 contractors, another Costs of War study estimates.

The Professional Services Council, an organization representing businesses contracting with the government, cited a lower figure from the U.S. Department of Labor saying nearly 4,000 federal contractors have been killed since 2001.

A spokeswoman pointed to a statement last month from the organization‚Äôs president, David J. Berteau: ‚ÄúFor almost two decades, government contractors have provided broad and essential support for U.S. and allied forces, for the Afghan military and other elements of the Afghan government, and for humanitarian and economic development assistance.‚Äù

U.S. officials after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks embraced private contractors as an essential part of the U.S. military response.

It started with then-Vice President Dick Cheney, the former CEO of Halliburton. Halliburton received more than $30 billion to help set up and run bases, feed troops and carry out other work in Iraq and Afghanistan by 2008, the study says. Cheney and defense contractors argued that relying on private contractors for work that service members did in previous wars would allow for a trimmer U.S. military, and be more efficient and cost effective.

By 2010, Pentagon spending had surged by more than one-third, as the U.S. fought dual wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In a post-9/11 American, politicians vied to show support for the military in a country grown far more security conscious.

‚ÄúAny member of Congress who doesn‚Äôt vote for the funds we need to defend this country will be looking for a new job after next November,‚Äù the study notes Harry Stonecipher, then the vice president of Boeing, telling The Wall Street Journal the month after the attacks.

And up to a third of the Pentagon contracts went to just five weapons suppliers. Last fiscal year, for example, the money Lockheed Martin alone got from Pentagon contracts was one and a half times the entire budgets of the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, according to the study.

The Pentagon pumped out more contracts than it could oversee, lawmakers and government special investigators said.

For example, a Florida Republican Party official made millions on what lawmakers charged were excess profits when the U.S. granted a one-of-a-kind contract for fuel convoys from Jordan to Iraq, the study notes. The electrocution of at least 18 service members by bad wiring in bases in Iraq, some of it blamed on major contractor Kellogg, Brown and Root, was another of many instances where government investigations pointed to shoddy logistics and reconstruction work.

The stunning Taliban victory last month in Afghanistan is drawing attention now to even graver consequences: the extent to which the U.S. reliance on contractors may have heightened the difficulties of the Afghan security forces.

Jodi Vittori, a former Air Force lieutenant colonel and scholar of corruption and fragile states at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who was not involved in the study, points to the U.S. insistence that the Afghan air force use U.S.-made helicopters. Afghans preferred Russian helicopters, which were easier to fly, could be maintained by Afghans, and were suited to rugged Afghanistan.

When U.S. contractors pulled out with U.S. troops this spring and summer, taking their knowledge of how to maintain U.S.-provided aircraft with them, top Afghan leaders bitterly complained to the U.S. that it had deprived them of one essential advantage over the Taliban.

Hartung, like others, also points to the corruption engendered by the billions of loosely monitored dollars that the U.S. poured into Afghanistan as one central reason that Afghanistan‚Äôs U.S.-backed government lost popular support, and Afghan fighters lost morale.

Hillary Clinton, while secretary of state under President Barack Obama, accused defense contractors at risk in war zones of resorting to payoffs to armed groups, making protection money one of the biggest sources of funding for the Taliban.

The United States also relied, in part, on defense contractors to carry out one of the tasks most central to its hopes of success in Afghanistan ‚Äî helping to set up and train an Afghan military and other security forces that could stand up to extremist groups and to insurgents, including the Taliban.

Tellingly, Vittori said, it was Afghan commandos who had consistent training by U.S. special operations forces and others who did most of the fighting against the Taliban last month.

Relying less on private contractors, and more on the U.S. military as in past wars, might have given the U.S. better chances of victory in Afghanistan, Vittori noted. She said that would have meant U.S. presidents accepting the political risks of sending more U.S. troops to Afghanistan, and getting more body bags of U.S. troops back.

CryptoCurrency,Elizabeth Warren just complained about ETH gas fees in Gary Gensler Senate hearing,"Gary Gensler is currently testifying on cryptocurrency regulations before Senate banking committee.

According to Gensler only a small number of cryptocurrencies are not securities. He says even stable coins could be securities and DeFi is mostly decentralized in name only.

The highlight so far has been Elizabeth Warren complaining about exchange outages and ETH fees. This was the full convo between Warren and Gensler.

**Warren** We hear a lot about how crypto is all about financial inclusion. Banks have done a lousy job of it. I want to test out with you if crypto is an improvement. Last Tuesday in a matter of hours 400 billion dollars in market value disappeared. Meanwhile several exchanges like Coinbase had outages which kept customers from making withdrawals or trades. How did that affect people who don't have a lot of money to lose? Was there anything they could have done to get their money out?

**Gensler** Not at a federal agency level because Coinbase hasn't registered with us yet even though they have dozens of tokens that may be securities.

**Warren** That sounds risky. But let's say instead of buying on Coinbase I decided to buy a cool new token called newcoin that was being hyped on Twitter. Newcoin is only available on a DEX. To buy $100 worth of newcoin I have to pay $20 fees. I decide that's ok because Twitter told me newcoin will make me a lot of money. Then the market tanks and I want to sell it. How much would I have had to pay? Another $20 to sell it or more?

**Gensler** You put quotes around DeFi. I think that's useful because they're decentralized in name only. But I don't know what the particular fees would be.

**Warren** Actually we do know some of the fees from last Tuesday. The fee to swap two tokens on Ethereum was more than $500. Obviously way more than the $100 I had to trade with in the first place. In the face of these high unpredictable fees small investors could get jammed and wiped out entirely. Does this sound like a path to financial inclusion? There are many other issues with crypto but high unpredictable fees makes crypto trading really dangerous for people who aren't rich. Regulators need to step up immediately and I expect SEC to take a leading role in getting this done.

Surprisingly there was not much of energy FUD from Warren. She just made a passing mention. I felt her arguments were overall pretty fair.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Could the USA ban Crypto?,"Currently, Crypto is legal in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) having stated that it's not a security, and the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) declared in 2015 that it's a commodity, like gold, and is therefore subject to its regulations. Furthermore, in 2013, the U.S. Treasury Department‚Äôs Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued guidelines stating that it‚Äôs legal to invest in Crypto and to use it as a form of payment, as long as the seller of the goods or services is willing to accept it.

Because of the patchwork of state and federal laws in the U.S., the exact regulations on Crypto differ from state to state; for example, in Hawaii, businesses relating to Crypto and cryptocurrencies are required to apply for a money transmitter license, while Wyoming has granted digital currencies the same legal status as money.

With all that in mind, the risk of a blanket ban on Crypto in the U.S. appears to be minimal. Indeed, billions of dollars have been invested in Crypto by American firms, while speculation still rages about when the United States will establish its first Crypto ETF or exchange-traded fund.

However, there are still some risks, with Crypto coming in for criticism from regulators and some lawmakers. SEC chairman Gary Gensler has said in no uncertain terms that Crypto is a speculative asset, and that cryptocurrencies facilitate crime and do not qualify as money. And Senator Elizabeth Warren has voiced concerns that cryptocurrencies put the financial system ""at the whims of some shadowy, faceless group of super-coders and miners.""

But as most experts agree Crypto is too deeply entrenched in the US financial system to ban.""

personalfinance,An Ambulance Company sent my bill to collections EVEN THOUGH I setup a payment plan with them!!! What to do now?,"Back in August 2020 I had to take an ER trip due to possible appendicitis/kidney stones.

I received the debt for the Hospital, the Doctor's and the Ambulance trip. This sub was fantastic and helped get my debt forgiven. The hospital and Doctor's forgave the debt for me being under the federal poverty line and not having insurance. The ambulance company ""American Medical Response"" though, has been terrible from the start.

First of all: they LOST all the documents I sent to apply for charity care.  


Second: by the time I was more financially well-off, I agreed to set-up a payment plan. I received the documents and sent them all back with a voided check, as requested.

Third: I still kept getting ""pre-collection"" notices and every time I'd call , they told me to ignore the letters that the payment was still being processed. Ok.

TODAY I received a call from a collection agency called [https://credencerm.com/](https://credencerm.com/) ""Credence"" that seemed like a call center from india and offered me a ""discount"" on the bill.

  
I called AMR back and was furious with them. I told them what happened and they said *""you just sent us a voided check without a contract""*. I said **""double-check. I sent you everything you asked for.""**  
I was put on hold and the agent confirmed :

*""yes, sir. It looks like we do have all your information on file. We are sorry. We are going to pull you from collections and start the billing process.""*

What can I do? They literally sent me to collections when I HAD ALREADY ESTABLISHED A PAYMENT PLAN. That just sounds plain illegal.

I've been looking to put some of my USDC into my wallet to earn some interest on it. When I pulled it up last week, it said I could earn like 3.9-8.7%APR. Over the weekend, I looked it was lower, and today the app says 2.4-4.1%. How does that work? What determines the rate you start at? Does it fluctuate on a day to day basis, kind of like savings account rates vary month to month?

I'm also looking at Binance USD that just popped up as the top interest earning option at .93-20.3% APR.  The high end seems like a very large interest rate for a USD tracking coin.  I'd love to get that high an interest rate on anything nowadays, but it seems very high.

personalfinance,Paying it off: what's the best plan?,"Asking for: advice on what to pay off first.  
Currency: CAD

I'm very, very lucky to be in the fortunate position to have this opportunity.

In the new year, after being at my company for a year, I'll be receiving approximately $50,000 (after tax withholdings.) From then on, every 3 months, I'll be additionally receiving approximately $12,000 (after tax withholdings.) These numbers can change if the equities that back these payments increase (or decrease, of course.)

The tax withholdings are at the max rate which is significantly higher than the actual tax rate. I'll receive the remaining money in the following year's tax refund (about $25,000, likely more, for all of the year's payments.)

**What I have:**  
$12,000 student loan (0% interest, permanent)  
$24,000 student loan (0% interest until next year, ~3% interest otherwise)  
$27,000 car loan (4% interest, interest paid up front, car value on market: ~$30,000)  

**By the time I receive that money in the new year, I'll owe:**  
$11,000 student loan (0% interest, permanent)  
$22,000 student loan (0% interest until next year, ~3% interest otherwise)  
$23,000 car loan (4% interest, interest paid up front, car value on market: ~$28,000?)  

**Income:**  
$100,000 base salary  
$100,000 per year RSUs, paid out in USD and converted to CAD, withheld at the max rate.  

**What I'm looking for advice on:**  

I have been waffling back and forth about which item to pay off first. I realize this is probably going to come down to personal financial choice, but I wanted to hear opinions in case there's anything I haven't considered.

Generally, the advice is to pay off the highest interest rate loan first.

In this case, that would suggest the car loan. **However,** because the interest was applied as a lump sum obligation at the start (and has been paid down already), paying it off early won't have the desired effect (saving money on interest.)

Because of the terms I've taken on the car, I'm paying it off more quickly than the depreciation. I bought it CPO/used and took a short term (60 months) specifically to allow this to be the case.

I've considered:  

-	The student loan is ""spent money."" It isn't tied to an asset. With the car, I could sell the car to recover some (or all) of the value. I'm very happy to have spent that money, but I can't sell my education to recover the cost.  
-	If I do decide to pay off the student loan, it may actually be better to put that money into an investment account and withdraw an amount every so often to pay for the loans, rather than lump sum paying it down.  

**My goals:**  
Right now, aside from paying off what is necessary to pay off and building a proper emergency fund, my goals are wealth building and fulfilling the desire to own nice cars (and to buy fun tech.) I'd also like to travel, eventually. I don't plan to have kids, and I have no specific plans to buy property.

**One other thing to consider:**  
Because of the high income for the year, it seems sensible to use some of the funds to lower that effective income for this year by putting into a registered retirement account (called an RRSP here.)

**The question:**  
Does it make more sense to pay off the car, pay off the student loans, or save it all and invest it in something reasonably stable, withdrawing only what I need to cover the cost of the payments? Should I put a chunk of it into RRSP at the end of the next fiscal year for this year?

I'm normally fairly debt averse, but I'm coming around to the idea that it's not always bad to carry debt, and that this income I'm earning is actually real, and won't just disappear into thin air (I grew up poor and spent my early adulthood poor which informs my decision making process, something I've had to fight against my whole life.)

Here is a list of all the places I have checked:

Blockfi: 8%  
Yearn: 4.16%  
Aave: 3.19%  
Compound: 3.1%

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously BlockFi is what I am considering going with. The reason I am not as keen on BlockFi is that it is centralized. But besides this, it takes a number of days to get my USDC back when I decide I want to withdrawal. I keep this money aside for flash crashes and so I want to be able to access it quickly. If I need to wait days for the withdrawal to process I could loose out on the discounts.

Are there any other good defi places that I could consider parking my stablecoins?

Are there any other coins out there that are cheaper to transfer? I don't want to use USDT if it can be avoided as I worry about them suddenly becoming insolvent and I don't want to keep a large sum of cash in USDT if there is a risk that USDT could fail. 

As far as I am aware DAI is also an ERC-20 token right? So going this route would not settle the issue of transfer fees on the ethereum network.

stocks,Psycho Market Recap - Tue Sept 14,"Despite breaking a five-day losing streak yesterday, stocks once again fell today, with the three major indexes and the Russell 2000 (IWM) finishing firmly in the red as market participants digested new economic data and continue monitoring the coronavirus Delta variant situation in the US, which may finally be cresting.
The Labor Department reported that its Consumer price index (CPI), which tracks the price of a weighted average market basket of consumer goods and services purchased, rose at its slowest pace in six months in August, suggesting that while the inflation rate may remain high for a while due to supply-side constraints, it‚Äôs likely the rate of increase has already peaked. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 0.1% last month, the smallest gain since February and below the 0.3% rise in July. On a year-on-year basis, CPI has decreased to 4% from 4.3% in July, an encouraging sign. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the core CPI gaining 0.3% and the overall CPI rising 0.4%. It may not seem like it but this is a large month-to-month change.
The Fed's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% inflation target, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, increased 3.6% in the 12 months through July after a similar gain in June. August's data will be published later this month.
The CPI report comes at a time when the market‚Äôs attention is firmly focused on when the Fed will announce it will start scaling back pandemic-era quantitative easing. Powell has offered no signal beyond saying it ‚Äúcould be this year.‚Äù Other members of the Fed have been more hawkish in their stance. As I have reiterated more times than I can count, I remain unconcerned with tapering talks (see the 2013 Taper Tantrum). I remain bullish until the Fed begins considering interest rate hikes, at which time I will reassess.
In positive news, there are signs that the wave of coronavirus Delta variant cases in the US may be cresting. The seven-day average of daily Covid cases is about 144,300 as of Sept. 12, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. That figure is down 12% over the past week and 14% from the most recent peak in case counts on Sept. 1, when the country was reporting an average of roughly 167,600 cases per day. Dr. Arturo Casadevall, Chair of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at Johns Hopkins University said, This is good news.

 It could represent that we have reached a peak and we are now on the way down.‚Äù As of Sept 12, 54.4% of the US population is fully vaccinated while 63.8% have received at least one dose of either Pfizer (PFE) or Moderna (MRNA).

And I do a lot of research on my ‚Äúwashroom‚Äù breaks 

Why would I poop in my own time 

And reading before I sleep using this Reddit , crypto websites like decrypt and cointelegram and watch guy /bit boy (pump and dump artist) on YouTube 

It seems with the top 5/6 I‚Äôm only making marginal gains and crypto is just becoming a savings account 

Would it be a better idea to just stake my fiat and mine more fiat or defi platforms 

I had a look into nexo for XRP interest but no one has said anything about it 

So conclusion : I will be dead before I retire cause I will probs lose all my crash on when ada doesn‚Äôt release its first smart contract or XRP doesn‚Äôt win",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Looking for low risk, highly liquid, short term investment.","So I am saving up to buy a house in 1-2 years. I have a sizable saving for the down payment already and I do not want to just leave it in a saving, CD or money market fund because the yield negligible. What are some good investment options? I am worry about duration risk and inflation risk when it comes to T-bills and TIPS. I am a relatively new investor who are not really good at reacting to shocks and shifts in sentiment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some ideas I have: 

Robo advisors that are good with fixed income.

High yield corporate bond ETFs.

Tax Lien Certificate. 

&amp;#x200B;

The gist is I want higher yield than saving and money markets, but super low risk so I don't lose a chunk of my savings if there's any shock to the market or interest rate hike.

Any advice is welcome. Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Help with Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) and PSLF Plan,"Context: I am a new grad and just started a permanent, full-time federal job this week.

I have 32k in unsubsidized federal student loans.

I see two routes to apply for an income-driven repayment plan:

One -

1. Use my adjusted gross income (AGI) which is like 12k because I was doing part time work last year.
2. Since it asks if your income has significantly change (primarily if it has decreased, which it has not)... pay very little to nothing for my qualifying payments towards PSLF this year under the IDR plan assigned.
3. When I get my tax return next year, I will then re-calculate or switch IDR plans to whatever will be cheaper for me now that they'll see I'm making more.

Two -

1. Where it asks if your income has significantly change say yes because technically it has since my job now is paying nearly 6x more than last year (annual salary $69.5k)
2. Deal with the $200+ payments a month towards PSLF from the get go 

Another thing to note, based on the loan simulator, income-contingent (ICR) will be the cheapest option while being compatible with PSLF with my current income plugged in.

Please correct me if I'm wrong in any of this or think I have better options -- I feel like a chicken with it's head cut off trying to figure out what the best course of action is and understand any of this.",finance

financialindependence,Two Jobs Retirement Comparison Calculator (Pension Specific),"I made a retirement calculator that allows me to compare two separate jobs, and thought I'd share. It began as a project to see what it would take to replace a pension (federal worker here) and speed up my retirement.

&amp;#x200B;

[Retirement Comparison Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HBgdfYydCs7Pa7bmKXB3HVhOW9CJ5j--/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=104671076620097484854&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true) (You won't be able to edit, just save a copy)

Sheets 1 and 2 work together to create a retirement involving a pension, sheet 3 will allow you to see what it will take to make up the difference. In the case that you don't have a pension, this calculator will still work to simply compare two jobs, just edit it a bit to not worry about whatever total is coming out of the pension sheet (sheet1).

personalfinance,"[US, CA] Homeowner for 18 months. Value is way up. Does it make sense to refinance or too early?","Hi all,

First time homeowner. I bought last March during the early parts of the pandemic really kicking off. The market was already heating up.

The house I ended up buying was around $360k. I put a 10% down payment on it, so I'm still paying partial PMI. Interest rate is around 3.325%

The market has been absolutely crazy since then though. This area keeps going up and up. Houses in my neighborhood are selling same day for over asking. I'm seeing houses smaller than mine (lot size + sq footage) going for $450k. I've seen even higher estimates for my own home, but I imagine a number of those are likely inflated.

As it stands, we've put some work into the house. Not TOO much that was substantial, as it only needed nominal improvements, but we _have_ completely replaced the entire fence (old one was what came with the house in the 80s and was patchwork and rotten). We've upgraded the electrical box, and done a number of smaller improvements in the house (such as replacing all the outlets).

Objectively, the house is in better condition than we bought it, the valuation price is up nearly $100k/25% as it stands, and I've been seeing marketed interest rates around 2.8%. My credit score is also good (good at the time I bought, better now). 

I'm aware that most folks tend to wait longer to refi, but with how crazy things have been and being a first time owner, it's not obvious to me if it's worth what my payment will be reduced by and whether it'll be worth the tax tradeoff.

FWIW, I'm not in any financial hardship. I can afford my loan as it is, and am only seeking this to be proactive and reduce monthly costs. There's no undue stress by carrying the mortgage as it is and I have zero intention of pulling any money out.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Crypto exchange rates of major US exchanges (now with Venmo),"**Results**: https://i.imgur.com/O73fOCJ.png

**Summary**:

- **Top Tier**: Kraken (Pro), Binance US (Pro), Gemini (ActiveTrader)
- **Mid Tier**: Coinbase Pro, Binance US (Lite), BlockFi, Kraken (Instant Buy), Robinhood, Gemini (normal)
- **Bottom Tier**: FTX US, PayPal = Venmo, Coinbase (normal)

------------------

This chart shows how much BTC or ETH you can buy with $20, $100, and $1000. I used the same methodology as with my [previous chart](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ph6f24/i_investigated_how_many_coins_you_can_actually/).

**Changes from the previous test**

- Added Venmo and Binance (Pro)
- Corrected for missing PayPal fees. (sorries)
- Reduced from 7 coins to 2 coins. The results across coins were nearly identical in the previous test, so I only compared BTC and ETH this time.

I've added Venmo because they just announced a $25 bonus to all their customers, so there are probably some people wondering how well they do. (Spoilers: they suck, but not as badly as normal Coinbase)

This chart includes **both fees and the hidden spread**. While fees are usually reported by the platforms, you can only determine the actual spread and spot price by making/simulating a purchase. Some platforms like Kraken state a spread of ""up to"" some number, so testing is the only way.

This post only covers purchasing coins from Fiat and stablecoins. It does not cover swaps and withdrawals, which are a different topic and subject to different fees.

There are 2 tables in the image:

* **1st table**: Amount of coins purchased using $20, $100, $1000 USD (or the platform's stablecoin). Higher is better.
* **2nd table**: Percent fewer coins received compared to the best rate among the listed exchanges. Lower is better.

--------

**Details of each platform**:

* **Kraken (Pro)**, **Binance US (Pro)**, and **Gemini ActiveTrader** had the best rates. However, their normal (Level 1) counterparts had much worse rates. There's such a huge difference that they must be making so much money from casual investors using the non-Pro versions.
* Since **Gemini/Gemini AT** also offers 10 free monthly withdrawals, it often considered the best choice for funding other off-platform accounts. The downside of Gemini is that it has a limited selection of coins. You also have to enable ActiveTrade in the settings to be able to use it. It's very simple to enable and disable ActiveTrade in the settings. Unlike Coinbase Pro, Gemini and Gemini AT share the same account balance. Compared to Coinbase Pro and Kraken, Gemini AT's UI was much easier to use. (Gemini AT was the only platform in my table that didn't include fees within the subtotal, so I had to subtract the coin value of the fees manually.)
* **Kraken (Pro)** is the trading platform version of their product available via their main Trading page and the hidden (trade.kraken.com page). The fees are much, much lower than that of any other platform across the board. I like that both Kraken (Pro) and Kraken (Instant Buy) show the most precision during purchases among all the platforms. In their documentation, Kraken (Pro) states that their taker fees range ""from 0% to 0.26%"", but in reality, it's probably averages closer to 0% based on another comparison I did.
* **Kraken (Instant Buy)** was ok for low-value purchases, but it doesn't get discounts for high-value purchases. You're basically paying the same higher fees no matter the amount. It shares the same balance as Kraken (Pro), so you might as well use Kraken's main trading page instead of Instant Buy.
* **Coinbase Pro** also has excellent rates, but its website is a bit convoluted. One thing I didn't like is that it's the only Level 2 platform in the chart that has separate balances for its normal and Pro versions. You can transfer funds between Coinbase Pro and Coinbase without fees, but I always end up having dust leftover, which is painful for anyone with OCD.
* **Binance US (Lite)** has a minimum of $20 per transaction. Rates were a little worse than Coinbase Pro's. It has a smaller selection of coins and features than its bigger international version, but it's still a big selection. Note that these rates are for their Basic trading platform with 0.5% taker fees, not the Advanced version with 0.1% taker fees.
* **BlockFi** did impressively well considering that it's a lending platform instead of a dedicated exchange. They also offer 1 free stablecoin and 1 free non-stablecoin withdrawal monthly. Its lending interest rates have fallen recently compared to other lending platforms like Celsius, Ledn, Nexo, etc., so a lot of their customers are currently eyeing other lending platforms.
* **Robinhood** offers very few coins (BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC). Ignoring all the drama about storing ""NYKNYC"" crypto on those platforms and how RH treats their customers, their rates are quite good and on par with that of Binance US and Coinbase Pro. However, it is a trap! I lowered their tier because they have a ridiculously up-to-5% spread when selling crypto, so their platform is like a bait and switch.
* **Venmo and PayPal**: In terms of coin selection, fees, and rates, they are completely identical to each other. They both use Paxos Crypto Brokerage for the backend. Their fees do not scale well compared to that of other platforms.
* **FTX US** has the worst website UI among the Level 2 trading platforms I examined. For small purchases, purchasing power was only displayed to 1 significant figure, making it practically useless for determining value. $20 of BTC was showing up as the same as $24 of BTC: 0.0004. It also lacked a lot of alt coins found on Binance US and Coinbase. For small purchases, it had much worse rates than all other Level 2 trading platforms, but it was on par for larger purchases. Their website's search is also broken. And, it takes 15 days to withdrawal Fiat even at Level 2 Identity Verification. I can't recommend them when they have these many issues.
* **Coinbase (normal)** and **Gemini (normal)** were the opposites of their Pro versions and had the highest fees. I'm surprised how big of a difference there was between normal and pro versions. So if you want to avoid fees, don't use the normal versions of their exchange for purchasing coins. There is one thing I really like about Coinbase: you can occasionally earn free coins from taking short 2-4 minute lessons on random coins. But, it's super annoying that Coinbase Pro and Coinbase (normal) are completely separate. Even my statements for taxes are separate.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,BofA business cards will f-- you on autopay,"So when you get a business credit card at bofa, you get TWO accounts:

\- One parent account

\- One child account

I get what they're trying to do - track under an umbrella who spends what.

However, autopay and such looks at ... the child account *only*! Not the parent account. What this means is that if you project a few bad months and set ""pay minimum"", it'll often say ""$0 this month"" (because the balance is on the parent account), so autopay will skip -- then you get charged a late fee, even though autopay is clearly on. However, you can see the mismatch if you hop in as soon as it happens.

Either the worst devs ever or compliments on finding ways to take my money knowing the average person won. Imagine that the developers that made autopay went through numerous phases of QA and approval and to this day, no one fixed this.

Just wanted to share this. I keep reading about bofa horridness and keep thinking ""Eh it's just a grass is always greener situation"". It's not. It's really not... if I had more time, I'd submit this to federal anti-trust depts.

cardano,"Cardano Rumor Rundown September 15, 2021","Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. Over 100 smart contracts are already running on Cardano Mainnet!  [https://twitter.com/IOHKMedia/status/1437821632307994628](https://twitter.com/IOHKMedia/status/1437821632307994628)
2. One of Cardano‚Äôs biggest competitors is once again suffering network problems. This time it started out as just being characterized as (more) ‚Äúinstability‚Äù, then they started saying that something had caused the blockchain to ‚Äústart forking‚Äù. This followed their September 2 ‚Äúinstability‚Äù and ‚Äúperformance degradation‚Äù event. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how well their community tolerates this in the future if it‚Äôs happening with their planned slashing model in effect.

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Cardano‚Äôs closest competitor, Ethereum, carries out it‚Äôs EIP-1559 London Fork which creates a new transaction fee scheme including some burning of fees and a more predictable base fee with an additional tip option on top. While the long term impact is unclear, the immediate aftermath of the fork seems to be even higher fees. We‚Äôll see if this is just due to high transaction volume at the moment. Of course, part of this is already solved by Cardano‚Äôs deterministic fee system enabled by its local state as opposed to the global state in the Ethereum system.

3. The Toomey, Lummis, Wyden Amendment was then challenged by a competing amendment from Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema which only excluded proof-of-work block validators and sellers of wallets from the tax reporting requirements.

ethereum,"A discussion of Technique, Finance, Economics, and Blockchain","**This thread was initially intended for a different subreddit, but it felt appropriate to post here. I also want the opinions of the Ethereum Community.**

**I am going to discuss a fair bit about economics, finance, and how it pertains to technique. This thread is by no means intended to be taken as financial advice.**

To me it is clear that the current financial and economic system we have in place only deprives humanity of dignity and freedom. Can alternatives permanently solve the problem, or will the problem exist as long as technique exists? When I speak about technique, I am using Jacques Ellul's definition in his book ""Technological Society"" ""Technique is the totality of methods, rationally arrived at and having absolute efficiency (for a given stage of development) in every field of human activity"".

The Federal Reserve is looking to create a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). This gives the federal reserve a lot more influence on the consumption habits of Americans who hold USD IE Negative interest rates, inflation. Since your money loses its value over time, it is said that a small inflation rate is actually better for the economy since this encourages consumers to consume sooner rather than later. With the implementation of CBDC's, the Federal reserve will likely implement negative interest rates on those dollars, again further encouraging consumption as you are losing wealth if you do not. There are also major privacy risks involved with CBDC's. CBDC's are already becoming popular in China. I argue that this is an insult to human dignity and freedom.

Alternatives to our traditional banking system currently exist, like Ethereum, a censorship resistant, decentralized, trustless, smart contract blockchain. Ethereum has various applications such as lending pools (pools of assets where you can earn solid interest and borrow from) with decentralized stable coins (coins soft pegged to USD using Ether and other ERC-20 tokens as collateral, governed by MakerDAO holders). It is a very speculative technology, but I believe Ethereum has really matured. The asset Ether recently surpassed Paypal in terms of market cap as well as Ethereum settling more transactions in a quarter than Paypal did in a year. Lending pools like AAVE or Compound host a decentralized stable coin called DAI which offer far more competitive rates than a traditional savings account and especially more than a CBDC.

This technology I have been a passionate advocate for for over a year now regardless of my increasingly anti-technical views, however I often ponder on how this technology may only temporarily solve the issue of centralization in the financial sector, and it by no means solves the issue of technique. A lot of these projects utilize a governance token model, meaning that you vote using your tokens, and the more tokens you have, the more voting power you have. Depending on how these tokens are allocated, on how much early investors hold, or how much money you have, that voting power can be very centralized amongst few people. Popular Decentralized Exchange (Dex) aggregator 1Inch has 41% of all tokens held by one Ethereum wallet owned by popular crypto currency exchange Binance. This gives Binance the ability to swing any 1Inch proposal 41% in their favor instantly. Unfortunately there isn't a good way to remedy this at the moment. There are also issues with these exchange tokens potentially being labeled as securities and being subject to regulation by the SEC. Because of this and many other things it is becoming increasingly clear to me that Ethereum, despite being an improvement to the traditional banking system, is not enough.

Due to the efficiencies of blockchains, I also fear that this technology can be used as a means to coerce. Ethereum after upgrades and rollups is projected to be able to settle up to 100,000 to 150,000 transactions per second. Visa currently settles closer to 20,000-40,000. It should be no surprise that Visa has decided to utilize Ethereum to settle stable coin transactions. I fear that because they are so efficient, they can be utilized as a way to surveil or coerce. There was a blockchain in South Korea used to verify if people were vaccinated. It is not my intention to start a discussion about the covid vaccine, but merely a warning of how blockchain can be used to determine your status. Are you a dissenter? Did you pay your taxes? There is also nothing stopping governments or corporations from creating their own centralized blockchains, likely having more throughput than decentralized chains (with a few exceptions IE Solana) which may end up being the traditional, legal, settlement layer.

Since Ethereum is a public blockchain, anyone can view any transaction you make on the blockchain. This can be a corporation, a government, your neighbor. There are ways to increase your privacy, however I fear that people A. will not care about privacy (you would be surprised about how little people care) or B. that the ability to track on-chain data drastically improves. It is true that Ethereum is not the only blockchain. Monero is an example of a blockchain that allows for private transactions and the inability to search where a transaction is being sent. This asset is heavily regulated however. The only way you can obtain this asset without giving up information is if you buy it locally or if you mine it yourself. There is also limited functionality other than being a private decentralized blockchain.

It has become more apparent to me that these improvements over time degenerate to the very thing it sought to destroy. The United States has undergone numerous radical reforms to prevent corruption i.e. the Jackson Era and the Progressive reforms of 1920. These reforms only had temporary effects. As the movement relaxes, the corruption crept back in. I fear that blockchain is merely a temporary solution, and will resemble what it replaced, with only small practically insignificant differences. Does no solution exist as long as technique exists?

I have my doubts that a popular leftist philosophy taking hold of our society will end up improving the overall freedom and welfare of society. A prominent talking point I have heard from many left wing anarchist types is that AI can be used to decide the best way to allocate resources, including labor. This is an even more blunt manipulation of human behavior. Human beings will progressively let technology and AI make more and more of our decisions and play a bigger role in our lives, however turning it off would amount to suicide. Think of what would happen tomorrow if the internet or electricity was ripped from our society? This means that an industrial technological system would softly take power from all of humanity. One can argue that this already happened. Ellul mentioned in the Technological Society that the electronic brains running automatically has reduced seemingly powerful leaders into mere figureheads who only seem to direct procedures which are so complicated that no human brain could replicate them. Regardless of whatever system is in place, communism, capitalism, socialism, anarchism, etc, as long as there is technique, it will invade every faucet of your life and will continue to regulate your behavior until individual liberty ceases to exist.

I hope to set myself up in such a way where coercive forces have little to no influence in anything I do. I hope others do the same.

I have only briefly begun to mention my concerns regarding finance, economics, and technology. Please feel free to comment on anything that anyone wants to add.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,"Security, Privacy and Autonomy - The natural flow of technology tends to move in the direction of making surveillance easier","In June 1991, Phil Zimmerman sent the first release of Pretty Good Privacy, an e-mail encryption program he developed, to a couple of buddies who uploaded the code to the Internet.

Some folks in powerful positions were not of a similar mind, and a controversy was born as Zimmerman quickly became the subject of a criminal investigation by the U.S. Customs Service. The probe came about because of suspicions that Zimmerman had violated a federal regulation proscribing the illegal export of munitions--even though the code was up there on the Internet for anyone to download.

Simply put, the feeling inside the federal bureaucracy was that PGP was potent enough to be lumped together with rocket-propelled grenades and advanced jet aircraft, and this was just not acceptable.

Calmer voices ultimately prevailed, and the investigation was finally closed without indictment in 1996.

Within a very short time, PGP had been ported to nearly every computer platform out there in many different foreign languages as people latched onto something that would help them maintain their electronic privacy in an ever-more-connected world. PGP is now used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications.

###Fast forward to 2008 

Even before the Bitcoin whitepaper is released, Bitcoin.org is registered. It is assumed that Satoshi Nakamoto used a service like www.anonymousspeech.com to register the domain for the website.

A couple of months later, the Bitcoin whitepaper is released through a cryptography mailing list, connecting back to bitcoin.org 

###‚ÄúI‚Äôve been working on a new electronic cash system that‚Äôs fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party. The proof-of-work for new coin generation also powers the network to prevent double-spending.‚Äù ‚Äì Satoshi Nakamoto

In 2013, an article on ""Zimmermann's Law"" quoted Phil Zimmermann as saying ""The natural flow of technology tends to move in the direction of making surveillance easier‚Ä¶ and the ability of computers to track us doubles every eighteen months"" in reference to Moore's law.

Governments used to execute people who challenged their authority by creating a currency and people are complaining about prices going down a few points and government regulations. 

###""We are literally in a race between our ability to build and deploy technology, and their ability to build and deploy laws and treaties. Neither side is likely to back down or wise up until it has definitively lost the race."" John Gilmore, founder of crypto mailing list

CryptoCurrency,Why your $30 of Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt make the world a better place,"So you bought $30 of Bitcoin and now governments are evil and only Bitcoin will liberate the oppressed masses from the tyranny of government issued fiat currency? Did I get it right?

Sure, there are oppressive governments, but I‚Äôm also going to assume most people here aren‚Äôt from North Korea or Venezuala.

Despite this, pretty much any cryptocurrency post will feature inane, predictable comments like:

&gt;*USD is THE OG shitcoin. Put some respect on that, man*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Money printer go brrr*  
&gt;  
&gt;*This is why inflation is running rampant in this country while our money is just worth less and less every year. This is why we need to put these money into investments such as crypto, real estate, stocks, or even bonds. This way, our money won't just lose value while sitting in our bank accounts that doesn't even have a decent interest rate.*

Most days if feels like everyone in crypto is under the impression that central banks print money for the fun of it, or to use the official party line: ‚Äúto bail out big, meany, evil banks.‚Äù

It seems like the average crypto ‚Äúinvestor‚Äôs‚Äù logic/fantasy looks like this: everyone will buy $30 worth of Bitcoin, which will grow to $1 million--obviously--and everyone will become rich and happy, won‚Äôt have to work, and the banks and Kim Jong Un will be sad because no one invited them to buy Bitcoin.

But in reality, the reason why things are the way they are is because of all of us. Yeah, you included.

The problem is we all want to be rich, but, like, without having to do anything. The best way to do that, is by buying on credit. We all do this. We buy houses we sort-of-kind-of can afford using mortgages, companies build shiny new headquarters using debt, and crypto start-ups promise to start making money at some point if only someone would just gives them a satchel of cash today.

Credit helps us buy more today than we could if we just relied on our savings. The more credit we take on the more we can buy. This has a positive effect in the short-run. Asset prices grow, people earn more money, Wall Street traders do more cocaine. Win-win all around.

But.

It turns out that money needs be repaid at some point. This is where the problem starts. When enough Arts majors aren‚Äôt able to repay their $200k student loans with incomes from their 18th century French-enlightment puppet shows, defaults start to increase. As debt starts coming due and a higher percentage of income goes towards servicing debt instead of new consumption, economic activity decreases. Companies sell less, employees earn less, and since there‚Äôs no incentive to invest asset prices that made you feel rich at one point start to plummet.

Now imagine you‚Äôre the government. All these people are pissed off at you because they‚Äôre broke or don‚Äôt have a job and are expecting YOU to do SOMETHING. What are you going to say? ‚ÄúSorry team, we believe in sound money, so if all of you could just go ahead and die, that would be really helpful in resolving our budget deficit.‚Äù

That‚Äôs not really going to fly, because the people will find an orange or mustaches man to do that something by force.

So to avoid getting into a full-on deflationary spiral, the government‚Äôs central bank needs to have the ability to print money to stabilize against deflationary pressures. This of course does create problems in determining what is a fair deleveraging strategy? Should you aim for 2-5% inflation or deflation? Should you give the money to the banks to be the stewards or give it directly to the people who over-leveraged in the first place?

You can choose to say, I don‚Äôt care, I want to own and transact with an asset that has a finite supply and I know won‚Äôt be inflated by others for unknown reasons. That‚Äôs fair, but know you‚Äôre making the assumption that the hodlers of this coin are better stewards of the needs of the global population than governments are.

So, is that true? Are you sending your crypto to water projects in Africa, low wage earners in rural West Virginia, the unbanked in India, or are you just waiting to get rich?",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Unpopular Opinion: Wallets are a barrier to Crypto adoption for many,"When I started to get into crypto and the concept of Defi I thought it was pretty cool, albeit I have not really had many problems with banks or other financial institutions that make me want to abandon them as badly as some others seem to want to.

However when I start to invest in crypto and then try to protect my crypto by moving it off exchanges (""not your keys, not your coins"" right?) I get a bit miffed with how many wallets I need to setup. 

My current / planned portfolio:

|*Coin*|*Symbol*|*Wallet*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Bitcoin|BTC|Exodus Wallet |
|Ethereum|ETH|Exodus Wallet |
|Cardano|ADA|Exodus Wallet |

|ChainLink|LINK|Exodus Wallet |
|Harmony|ONE|Harmony One Wallet|
|Ergo|ERG|Yoroi¬†Wallet |
|Reddit Moons|MOON|Reddit Vault |
|Brave|BAT|Exodus Wallet|

Ok, so on first glance it does not look that bad, Exodus can cover most of my coins (and yes I know a hardware wallet is more secure, but for now I go the hot wallet route).

However when I get down to it, I need to have four places to monitor, at least periodically as I plan to long term hold, with four passwords and four seed phrases to protect to keep my portfolio safe. 

\+++

Now I consider my fiat investments. My brokerage is also my checking account (with debit card) has my investments including my 401k, Roth IRA as well as taxable accounts all in one place. Since it is a larger institution my fees are also none/minimum. 

While it is possible my account could get hacked and the assets stolen, there is quite a bit of security in place to prevent this (password, 2FA, voice print, email alerts). I am not saying it could not happen, but I feel more or less comfortable with the situation.

\+++

Back to the crypto world and I need to have four different locations to remember and monitor. I can do this and it does not stress me out, but I find it much more inconvenient then how I can keep track of my fiat (centralized) money.

Am I the only one who feels this is not a very convenient, or futuristic, setup we have? I feel this is a downside and the extra effort pushes away the adoption of crypto.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Need advice on Walmart Money Card problem!,"Good morning reddit, I find myself in a bit of a pickle and I'm hoping someone out there will be able to assist me. About a week or two ago I realized my wallet was gone. I went through the proper channels and shut off all my cards and then went to the DMV and had my ID card replaced.  The main account that I use for payment is the Walmart Money card by Green Dot bank.  I've had it now for ten years give or take. I also have another Green Dot card which I found that I was able to send $500 to it from my WMMC. Unfortunately that's the limit and the 24hr mark starts exactly the moment you pull out the cash. I have a few grand in there that I desperately need to pull out of there and the card that I just had mailed to me was returned to sender by FedEx mysteriously and I am starting to feel like pulling money off this card is going to be impossible unless I do it the 500 dollar a time way. Does anyone know how I could maybe use my bank account routing number from the WMMC to wire it same day to myself or my friend so that I could just have the money? I'm really stumped and running out of time any help at all is appreciated!! 

UPDATE: IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW - I finally found the solution and it is to report the card lost or stolen / in the manage my card section of the app you will be given the option to ask for some emergency funds up to 500 I believe and then you get a barcode that when shown to the customer service at Walmart acts like a cash withdrawal for 3$ charge.

He almost sounded guilt trippy hitting me with ""this is what 99% of people do anyway and if the other 1% dont listen then oh well"".

He went on about how much harder it is for them to roll into the TSP (more paperwork) and that the TSP is bad because you dont have a lot of choices and it doesnt grow well.

Obviously, this just sounds like a typical sales pitch. But...would doing this option with say someone with a better reputation like Vanguard be a good idea? Or is it best to play it safe and roll it into the traditional TSP and just let it do its thing?  He did suggest still doing the 5% so you get the govt match.

personalfinance,Retirement or Student Loans?,"Hi all, this is my situation.

**Basic Info**

I am 24. I have a bachelor's degree in economics and a master's degree in international finance. I am currently working in the financial industry.

**Income and Existing Contributions**

I currently make $50k USD a year, rounding to $1,544 for each semi-monthly paycheck. That paycheck accounts for a pre-tax 6% contribution to a matching work 401k, the max match offered.

**Expenses**

I currently live at home rent-free, my expenses are minimal. I pay off my credit cards in full each month according to my budget, my car is paid off, and I have no other debts aside from student loans. I also do not ride the 'float', I pay off bills with existing funds rather than waiting for the next paycheck to come in.

**Budget**

I budget approximately $300 for personal spending, this includes gas, entertainment, dining, etc. Basically everything, the rest of my monthly income I set aside for loan repayment. This is mostly discretionary spending and I could most likely eliminate this and be fine, but I enjoy having some spending money to see the boiz or get some sushi c:

**Debts**

I do not carry credit card, auto or any other type of debt aside from student loans.

My student loan debt is broken down as follows:

$47,340.03 @ 7.08% - Federal DoE Grad Plus loan

$20,613.40 @ 6.08% - Federal DoE Unsubsidized loan

*These are currently accruing 0% interest however, due to the federal student loan suspension until at least January 31, 2022.*

**Savings and Emergency Fund**

I currently have $58,600 in a high yield savings account earning 0.50% APY. I have made a separate emergency fund account along with my Roth IRA, but that is not funded yet, I will be contributing to this with each paycheck.

**Existing Retirement Accounts**

I have a Roth IRA that has \~$12,000 worth of contributions in it - I have contributed the max for 2020 and 2021, held in a target fund.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do I do? The way I see it, I can either continue the way I am saving/working now and be fully paid off by the end of the year, or the first few weeks of January 2022. I could also pay off now by withdrawing some contributions from my IRA or other investments.

Part of me wants to pay off these loans right now and be done with it, but I recognize that this would be foolish since I would be liquidating investments to pay something that is accruing at 0%, especially since I would be fully paid off before the 0% ends. I suppose I'm just looking for some validation that I should wait and stick to the plan rather than selling good investments just to pay it off for paying offs sake.",finance

I bought a condo about a year ago and I'm finding the monthly payments on my mortgage to be a bit much, it makes it difficult for me to save money while having the quality of life that I want.  I'm considering selling the place and moving to something cheaper and I want to know if you guys think it's a bad idea.

I bought my current place for ~225k with 20% down and my monthly costs for housing amount to about $1500.  I spoke to a realtor who would want to list it at 275k and thinks we may get more for it.  My goal would be to roll all that equity into a new (to me) condo in the 150k range.  I'm aware that closing costs and capital gains would eat into my profits, but the way I see it I still come out on top and can cut my monthly housing costs in half to boot.  I could wait another year to avoid capital gains in my state, but who knows what the market and interest rates look like then.

Does this seem reasonable?  Or is there an angle you think I haven't considered?",finance

CryptoCurrency,"History doesn‚Äôt always repeats itself but, if this time does, the Taproot upgrade will be the major catalyst of the next bull run! Thoughts?","If we look back at 4 years ago, within the 3 months preceding the last #BTC network upgrade the price of BTC traded between $930 and $978. As May drew to a close, the price of bitcoin climbed above $2,000 for the first time and surpassed $3,000 just weeks later. Those price milestones were often accompanied by subsequent turbulence, including a drop of $300 within one hour just a day after the $3,000 line was first crossed. üôåüèΩ

By the first week of September - 15 days after the turbulence around the network upgrade (Aug 24th) the global crackdown on unregulated ICOs Bitcoin and the pending closure of China's ""Big Three"" exchanges - Bitcoin exceeded $5,000 and continued its bull run towards $19,783

History doesn‚Äôt always repeats itself, but IMO there‚Äôs a high chance that a similar trend happens before year end. We are seeing increasing long-term Hodlers, an OBV about to reach new ATH, ATL #BTC supply, FED tapering and SEC regulations unlikely to come before 2022 and most importantly the new BTC upgrade coming in November!

If history repeats itself this year we could see #BTC and #Altcoins reaching levels never seen before.

My bet is that BTC will top around $250K, ETH will end up at around $15K and DOT will peak $210

This run will most likely end with a 60-70% crash for BTC and 80% for Altcoins before Q4 ends!

CryptoCurrency,Asset Tokenization and a Case for Being First,"*‚ÄúThere are three ways to make a living in this business: be first, be smarter, or cheat. Well, I don‚Äôt cheat. And although I like to think we have some pretty smart people here in this room*\*\*\*, it sure is a hell of a lot easier to just be first.‚Äù\*\*\*

*‚Äî Margin Call*

I want to take you back in time.  The year is 1984.  It‚Äôs a beautiful sunny Saturday in California ‚Äì it‚Äôs as hot as a taint after a long-distance marathon.  I know some of you are asking; ‚Äúwtf is a taint‚Äù?  It is that little piece of skin between your balls and your butthole ‚Äì the circulation is terribl‚Ä¶ nay, it doesn‚Äôt exist.  It‚Äôs fucking hot‚Ä¶ and unlike 80% of the other people in California, I don‚Äôt have a pool. What I do have is a basement.  Not my basement mind you; my mothers‚Äô basement.  It is generally cool in the basement and it‚Äôs a pretty awesome place to hang out.  I can still picture the Rush posters, my killer stereo, and the best gaming table for DnD that I hand crafted with my dad after he gave up on the idea that I would ever play sports.  The taste of Pepsi and Cheesies still give me nostalgia.

That particular day I invite my friends to seek refuge from the heat and roll some dice.  You know those perfect days?  The 80s were filled of them.  Oil was plenty, energy was cheap, the economy was taking off like a pop rocket, and I had not yet discovered the concept of existential dread.  It was nice, man.  It was really nice.

This day was filled with adventure on the DnD board ‚Äì but we kept getting interrupted by my friend Dave who was unusually enthusiastic about something that was giving him a pop rocket.  His father worked in what is now known as Silicon Valley, and had told him about this company that wanted to get computers in every house in the USA.  We kept shrugging him off of course ‚Äì more interested in whether or not my Paladin could deal some damage to the Zombie hoard.  It was a big deal okay?  Dave however was persistent‚Ä¶ he told us that he put all his money that he had saved for the past 4 summers mowing lawns into buying stock of this company‚Ä¶ and he pressed us to do the same.

‚ÄúSeriously guys! This is going to revolutionize the world!!‚Äù

I bit into my apple; looked at him with dismay and sighed‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúDude you‚Äôre holding up the game, can you roll the fucking dice already?‚Äù

Dave rolled the dice‚Ä¶ and he never worked a day again in his life.

**&gt;&gt;&gt;**

Fast Forward to 2011...  My nephew is visiting from New York ‚Äì he‚Äôs kind of a shit but likeable enough.  I still frequent my basement but DnD has evolved into something else entirely... now we have entire 3D worlds and can interact with NPCs and other characters controlled by real people all over the world, all from the convenience of our personal computers in our own homes (fuck you, Dave). The world was revolutionized.  The 2010s were kind of strange.  Existential dread was starting to set in.  I spent a lot of time on my computer during that time period. I think I was hiding from the real world. I was a cooler person online, still am.

My nephew was one of those typical fratty douchebro types.  He was staying with me while he hunted for work in Silicon Valley  - he has determination I will give him that.  One evening just as I sat down to log onto the server my friends and I frequent ‚Äì he comes home from being out at some kind of networking event for Silicon start-ups.  He‚Äôs drunk, and annoying ‚Äì but he‚Äôs also more enthusiastic than usual.  He starts talking to me about how he just learned about this magical digital money and how it was going to change the world and asked if he could use my computer because he needed to buy some.

‚ÄúI just logged on, man!‚Äù

‚ÄúDude, seriously this is going to revolutionize the world‚Ä¶  let‚Äôs get some together‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever heard‚Ä¶ go play with your phoney bit money somewhere else‚Äù

He‚Äôs still playing with his bitmoney‚Ä¶ except now he lives in Manhattan.  He has a lambo.  He‚Äôs basically the WSB guy if that guy jumped out of the screen Kool-Aid Man style.  This guy fucks and he sucks at the same time.  I‚Äôm a little jealous.

‚ÄúNever again‚Ä¶.‚Äù I tell myself.  ‚ÄúNever again.‚Äù

**&gt;&gt;&gt;**

So fast forward again to the present day, February 2021.  I‚Äôm still hanging out in the basement.  I‚Äôm still on my computer‚Ä¶ but grinding has taken on a whole new meaning.  I‚Äôm relentlessly trading, investing, and researching blockchain and crypto projects.  I‚Äôve been doing well, but the more I work at the trade the more I start reminiscing about Dave and my Nephew and what they had in common ‚Äì **they were first buyers of a first mover that revolutionized the world.**   They were able to identify and predict the future.  They weren‚Äôt just lucky assholes ‚Äì **they got ‚Äúit‚Äù before ‚Äúit‚Äù became mainstream.**

**Which is why I want to talk to you about asset tokenization.**

I was introduced to this concept in February after reading an article about the disruption of blockchain technology within the Real Estate market and how the blockchain was going to revolutionize this multi-trillion dollar industry.  Naturally, I started to research use-case studies and developers who were making strides in the industry.  This eventually became an obsession\*\*, and then I had the eureka moment.\*\*  In a nutshell, the vision of this sector is to bring together smaller investors and owners of illiquid assets through issuance of asset or security backed tokens. This is a revolutionary concept.  I personally feel like it is the next big thing in blockchain technology.

Hear me out: You know how in the old days how your paper money used to represent a stored figure of value (gold) in the federal reserve?  It‚Äôs kind of like that ‚Äì except we‚Äôre not limited to gold as the store of value ‚Äì it could be a commercial apartment building, a piece of art‚Ä¶ the possibilities are endless.   **We are on the verge of unlocking value in appreciating assets that formerly had no liquidity.**   I can‚Äôt understate how big this is.  Think about it. Think about all the small/medium sized businesses that can value from this structure. Think about all the property owners that will be able to leverage this technology for funds.  Think about all those with big Van Goghs or Da Vincis on the walls just gathering dust -  imagine if you could theoretically own a portion of the Mona Lisa.  Take a long hard thought.  This is going to be like the stock market, but bigger and not limited to IPOs and shares of private corporations.  **We are talking a $25+ trillion market place‚Ä¶  and we are talking alternative investment platforms that will finally have an equal footing with big banks.**  Yes, you read that correctly.

So why am I bringing this up now?  Glad you asked.  Ukraine just passed legislation (to be signed into law shortly) that will set new laws into place which will set legal structures around issuance of digital assets in Ukraine.  This bill essentially puts Ukraine at the forefront of digital securities and makes them one of the most crypto friendly countries in the world.  They are trailblazing a crypto-revolution; and not just for Ukraine.  This is going to be a case study for the rest of the world and it bodes very well for those of you interested in mass adoption.

Essentially - among other things, this law opens up the possibility of asset tokenization.  It will allow you to purchase or invest a token or share of an asset on an alternative investment platform.  The issuer will be able to access liquidity from your purchase and you will take possession through the block chain of a fraction of the asset, possibly for a fixed period of time with a fixed APY - let‚Äôs pretend 10% per year over a 5 year period.  Wouldn‚Äôt you love to have that kind of option in a bear market?

It also opens up the possibility to trade these tokenized assets on a secondary market.  **Open up the floodgates because SPLOOSH.**  I personally believe it will be the NFT craze on steroids.  Want to own a fractional share of the Empire State Building or another landmark building ? I firmly believe this will be possible in the not so distant future.  Unfortunately, security tokens are not legalized in the USA - but with countries like Ukraine, Switzerland, Germany, Liechtenstein and others starting to move on this technology and trend - it won‚Äôt be long before the free markets around the globe understand the massive potential. I conservatively give it less than a decade.  We have big things incoming.

In summation: I firmly believe that this is going to revolutionize the world.  I also firmly believe that we are close to a transition shift for real world utilization of block-chain technology.  **There are a few start-ups (DYOR) that are looking to capitalize on this trend right now.**  **This is still very early.**  We are on the verge of history‚Ä¶ and this time?  **This time** **I‚Äôm not going to miss the boat.** It‚Äôs a new era of capital management, ***and*** ***It‚Äôs my time to be first.***

personalfinance,How much house can I afford? Trying to budget with lower-end income but healthy NW,"Hi everyone,

I'm looking at purchasing a first home in the East Bay Area. Prices here are a little insane and I'm not sure how to do the math as my situation feels a little unique.

Relevant info:

* Cash + after-tax brokerage account = $2.1MM
* Income is $130k yearly pretax -- I could likely go get a job in the $250k range and probably will within a couple years, but working with the family business right now and helping parents to sell it. Probably should budget assuming $130k to be safe though.
* Houses that I've been looking at are in the $1.3-2.2MM range. Similar houses rent for 6-8k monthly, and I'm not against renting. I think the homes that are &lt;$1.3MM here tend to require a lot of work, which is something I'd like to stay away from.

Questions:

* What's the best way to think about what to spend, given that I have a lot of cash but a relatively low income (for now)?
* Other expenses are relatively minimal -- food, some travel as things open back up. Mostly focused on work for the near future. I figure $4k per month on the high end, but it's been closer to $2k for the last couple years.
* Tying up 50%+ of NW in a house seems like a lot, so I was thinking about getting a mortgage (have been preapproved in the 700-750k range). If I do, is there any advantage to paying cash up front and getting a mortgage/home equity loan after, vs just getting a loan to buy the house? I understand that paying cash might make offers more attractive, more asking about finances/taxes/interest rates.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, Sept 15, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 15, 2021**

Stocks steadily rose today, shaking off earlier losses and recent, driven mainly by the energy and industrial sectors, as market participants digested new economic numbers and the coronavirus situation in the US. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.83% higher, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.73% higher, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, rose 1.09%. Not surprised by this at all, I have been saying for months I remain bullish and have been buying on every dip until the Fed begins discussing interest rate hikes.

The Labor Department reported that its Consumer price index (CPI), which tracks the price of a weighted average market basket of consumer goods and services purchased, rose at its slowest pace in six months in August, suggesting that while the inflation rate may remain high for a while due to supply-side constraints, it‚Äôs likely the rate of increase has already peaked. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 0.1% last month, the smallest gain since February and below the 0.3% rise in July. On a year-on-year basis, CPI has decreased to 4% from 4.3% in July, an encouraging sign. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the core CPI gaining 0.3% and the overall CPI rising 0.4%. It may not seem like it but this is a large month-to-month change.

The Fed's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% inflation target, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, increased 3.6% in the 12 months through July after a similar gain in June. August's data will be published later this month.

In global news, new economic data coming out of China suggests the recovery in the second-largest economy is losing steam. Retail sales, a key gauge of Chinese consumer consumption rose just 2.5% year-over-year in August, a massive deceleration from the 8.5% YoY growth recorded in July and a sharply missing estimates of 7% growth. Separate data released Wednesday by the statistics bureau showed home sales by value falling by 19.7% in August from a year ago, the largest drop since April 2020‚Äîat the height of the pandemic.

**Highlights**

* Apple (AAPL) released a new generation of products, including the new iPhone 13
* US crude oil prices post rose sharply after the Energy Information Administration report that crude oil inventories declined by 6.4 million barrels last week amid pressure from Hurricane Ida, the lowest level since 2019
* US manufacturing production decelerated in August, likely due to disruption by Hurricane Ida and ongoing supply-side disruptions. The Federal Reserve's latest data showed manufacturing production rose by just 0.2% in August, or half the gain expected, based on Bloomberg consensus data. Production had risen by 1.6% in July. 
* EV-maker Rivian, which is backed by Amazon, hopes to raise as much as $8 billion in an upcoming US IPO.
* One of General Motors Co's China joint ventures said on Wednesday it is developing auto chips and aims to increase use of locally sourced chips in the next five years.
* Whatsapp, which is owned by Facebook (FB), launched a test of an in-app business directory.
* Volvo is also gearing up for a $20 billion IPO in the coming weeks, according to Reuters. 
* Elon Musk-led SpaceX‚Äôs Inspiration4 rocket is scheduled to launch an all-civilian crew of four into orbit for three days on Wednesday, a mission that will be streamed live on Netflix (NFLX)

personalfinance,Question about capital gains taxes and margin loans,"Hello, im a layman so please bear with me. I read a brief description of a strategy that would help eliminate any taxes you'd pay on stock gains. If someone has heard of this strategy or can help me understand, I would appreciate your response here. 

So basically the strategy is to take out a margin loan against your gains instead of selling your stocks/options. The idea is that the interest you pay would amount to much less than the taxes you would pay on those gains if you were to sell. 

While I understand how this may work initially, I cant seem to wrap my head around this long term. I mean, you arent selling your stocks, and youre essentially taking out a loan that must be paid back, right? So where would you get the funds to pay back the loan if you arent selling your stocks at some point? OR is this just a method to be able to keep your stocks long enough to move from short term gains to long term, and thus avoid the *higher* interest rate? 

Another thing I dont understand is, what if your gains are temporary/transient. I mean if you made 50k and then took out a margin loan, but then you lost all those gains on the market soon after. What situation would you be in then? You still have to pay that money back so at that point would it not have been better to simply sell, take your gains and pay tax on them? If you took the margin loan method then you'd have lost your gains but on top of that you have a loan with interest to pay off. So I dont quite understand how this isnt a high-risk strategy. 

I think theres several parts of this story that im probably misunderstanding or just not aware of. Please fill me in if you are more knowledgeable with this stuff. Ive done some research on it but a lot of the terminology is a bit out of my scope so im looking for somewhat of an ELI5.",finance

My layman‚Äôs understanding is that the credit card company would see this large amount of money coming through my card and would increase my limits astronomically (which I see as valuable), would boost my credit score (good thing), I would get 4% cash back for the first year and 2% every year after (no cap on rewards with this card) and have some strong negotiating power for interest rates forever‚Ä¶

Does anyone have experience with this? Is this a good idea or bad idea? Can I get in trouble for this? Am I missing something? How long would it take to be eligible for a $100k limit for example?",finance
personalfinance,Anyone have any luck calling a bank and asking them to float the current rate down as opposed to refinancing?,"I was thinking about refinancing my current loan, but the math doesn't seem to work out.  The broker I was working with brought up the possibility of just asking the bank to float down to a lower rate.  She said she had another client successfully do this.

So, I'm inclined to call the bank and see what they say, but before I do how should I approach the phone call?

Should I go with a strategy of telling them that I'm considering shopping around for refinance quotes but I'd love to stay with them if they can offer something?

Some details:

1.  Jumbo loan
2.  2.875% interest rate
3.  1 year into the loan
4.  Credit score 800+

EDIT:  I just called them.  They said they couldn't offer anything.  In addition, their only refinance offer was 3%!!

I'll try again later to see if I have any luck with another person.",finance

Merging blockchain with drone racing is a bullseye for the league‚Äôs ‚Äútech-setter‚Äù fans, who are early adopters, open-minded to new forms of entertainment, and 40 times more likely to follow and engage with crypto social media than the general population. DRL will unveil blockchain-enabled ticketing, collectables, fan transactions and NFTs on Algorand, and welcome crypto developers, programmers and coders to Algorand hackathon events at DRL races around the world.

Algorand and DRL are recognized as disruptive forces in their industries, pushing the limits of what is possible in sports and advanced technology. The companies share similar DNA - both have visionary founders, both revolutionize their industries with technology others have tried and failed to replicate, and both move at the speed of racing drones. Bringing scalable, fast, and decentralized gaming applications to DRL, Algorand‚Äôs blockchain will be the foundation for the sport of the future.

‚ÄúThe Drone Racing League's global, tech-obsessed fans love that our sport constantly evolves, and blockchain was the next groundbreaking technology in our sights. Algorand shares our values of speed, innovation, and inclusivity. As the largest partnership in DRL‚Äôs history, we have ambitious plans to deliver a unique sports experience in the metaverse. We are incredibly excited about how this partnership will change the game for sports and tech fans and the blockchain community around the world,‚Äù said DRL President Rachel Jacobson.

‚ÄúAlgorand and the Drone Racing League are the most technically advanced, disruptive and visionary organizations in blockchain and sports respectively. We are excited that DRL will leverage Algorand‚Äôs technology to create immersive in-game experiences and introduce millions of technology enthusiasts to the possibilities that blockchain can bring to racing and to sports as we know them today,‚Äù said Steve Kokinos, CEO of Algorand.

Over the next five years, Algorand will have the Title rights of the DRL World Championship circuit, DRL will develop a Digital Drone Racing series built into Algorand‚Äôs blockchain network, and the companies will showcase the power of Algorand blockchain through DRL‚Äôs broadcast, social and gaming channels. Excel Sports Management‚Äôs Properties division helped secure the historic, multi-year deal.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Thought Experiment: Please Contribute your Ideas,"I need help thinking this through:

Pomp Podcast #663 was with a tech entrepreneur named Jeff Booth. The biggest thing Jeff argues is that continued Fed QE will lead to either a massive global depression and/or a revolution. Finally, he states that either event will lead to Bitcoin becoming the primary world reserve currency. Listen here: [https://open.spotify.com/episode/2JrsGPu6sq0UZMwNyVKhq6?si=140aec2e16544cc7](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2JrsGPu6sq0UZMwNyVKhq6?si=140aec2e16544cc7)

That got me thinking: in these two scenarios, what would a fiat to Bitcoin transition look like? Would BTC back currencies or would it replace them? 

If backed, would governments ""buy"" our BTC back, just like the US our great-great grandparent's gold in the 1930s? 

If replaced (BTC as single world currency), how would BTC be distributed?

Either way, these two options suck because of inorganic distribution. Those with Sats won't willingly give them up to those that don't have any; those with power will do their best to stack as many Sats as possible during distribution.

\---------

The last transition (not covered by Booth) is through the Capitalist market. If both companies and consumers find transacting in BTC mutually beneficial, consumers and companies will naturally flow towards mainstream BTC adoption. For example, McDonalds is accepting BTC as a form of payment in El Salvador. If McDonalds can entice consumers to purchase in BTC, then they don't have to pay VISA transaction costs. Provided no monopolies are present within the fast food sector (there's not), equilibrium will be mutually beneficial to both consumers and McDonalds. Naturally, this will signal other consumers and other companies to behave in similar fashion. In sum, Capitalism could drive organic BTC adoption, escape depression, without the need for revolution, in the most equitable way.

personalfinance,Most likely paying off the house,"Hi All,

I plan on paying off our house in a few months. We got the house back In 2017 and wanted to have the financial freedom of having the house paid off. We are invested in stocks, crypto and a brokerage account all which I plan on liquidating to pay off the house.

Our interest rate is around 3.75 % and the last year my investments gained 17% but with the house paid off I would be less risk adverse in the market. 

TLDR:

Invested short term to gain money to payoff the house. Once paid I should be less risk adverse ready to invest long term. 

Any reason why I should not do this other than 3.75 vs a 7-10% return. I can build back the nest egg within 12months. So it‚Äôs a 10k hit maybe. 

I will be saving 150k in intranets by paying the house off early .",finance

CryptoMarkets,Theoretical question about the benefits of using Smartlands vs. traditional refinancing.,"So, this is specifically for real estate. Generally, if you own your (residential, at least) property, you can get an equity based loan at the going rate to get some cash. I know Ukraine rates are higher than the US, but are they that much higher? Pretty sure you can do a home equity loan for like 6%, and I have to assume larger commercial loans are even lower. Plus they could do a full refinance for even lower rates in the 2-3% range. I don't see how tokenizing and effectively selling 40% of your building and forfeiting a percentage of future profits is a better deal than getting a loan from a bank for 40% of the building's value at a 2-6% interest rate... and getting to keep all the profits on top of that. Unless Ukraine interest rates are like 15-20% or something, seems like the bank is a better option. I'm probably just missing something, but my question is what is the draw to bring future properties in? Why would they choose this route over traditional finance?



I definitely get the SME side, but still trying to wrap my head around the benefits for real estate owners. Are they selling portions of the property they still owe money on? That seems quite risky. Maybe I am just not savvy enough on the costs associated with taking cash out of commercial properties. I'm quite excited about this project regardless for the SME side but any clarification on the real estate side would be appreciated.",cryptocurrency

They may have a bit of a point about no definitive evidence linking them but that doesn't mean there is no reason for concern about it.  First whatever commercial papers Tether may be backed by may not be Evergrande but that doesn't mean that whatever companies they hold papers in aren't invested in Evergrande.  Second even if they aren't we don't know what impact Evergrande going under could have on banks.  There could be a cascade effect from those banks to other companies.  Higher interest rates, banks going under (maybe not it's China) .  Even businesses in other countries that Tether is related to could be affected.

personalfinance,Should I refi on a jumbo 6 yrs in? Getting hard pressured by loan officer (predictably),"Throwaway, USA/Chicago.

I'm 6 full years into a ~$750k loan on a ~1M house. Loan was initially 3.25%, but during the low rates last year Chase notified me they were lowering it to 3.125% and I didn't need to do anything.

Now, a friend of a friend is offering me a 10 yr ARM at 2.25% or 15 yr ARM at 2.375% on the remaining loan ($660k) and saying there is no reason not to take it since all fees will be covered.

I don't really trust the guy, he glosses over the fact the rate will change and the loan period extend. My situation: high earner (MD), no real plan to leave in the next decade. I also think interest rates will be above 5% after the fixed portion is over, though I should have assets by then to just pay it off (house is appreciating too). 

On one hand, I'm happy that I'm finally getting some principal instead of just interest. On the other, I understand the idea that high earners should just grab and hold onto low-interest loans forever. In other words, extend this one.

Advice from friends and family has absolutely run the gamut, so I'm hoping /r/personalfinance has a suggestion how to make this decision. TIA!

personalfinance,Choosing IRA/401(k) Types w/ Student Debt,"I'm currently making 2200$ weekly before taxes and deductions (1450$ after), and have just over 130k in student loans (about 7k of which is interest). I'm at a place in my life right now where I'm simply not spending much money, and I'm able to max out the yearly contributions for both my IRA and 401(k)

 My thinking is to contribute the yearly maximums for my IRA and 401(k), then put the rest towards my student loans above the minimums. Unfortunately, I'm unable to see what my student loan interest rates are normally (they're all set to 0% right now), but from memory they ranged from 4% - 6%.

Considering all of this, I have three questions I'm not very sure on the best answer for:

1. Traditional or Roth for my IRA?
2. Traditional or Roth for my 401(k)?
3. Does paying down student loans make sense for what money is left? Or, am I better off just paying my minimums, and investing the rest into something else?

My thinking here, is to go with Traditional for both accounts, and then take the immediate taxable income deductions to increase the money I can put toward my student loans in the short term. Then, once they're paid off later down the road, I can switch over to using Roth accounts.

So, is this logic sound? Or, am I missing or not realizing something when it comes to how these work with my current situation? I understand the basics of Roth and Traditional accounts, but I feel like maybe there's some subtle details I might be missing/misunderstanding when it comes to optimally handling this.

stocks,Vale - calculations and the thesis,"Hello,

I've made some posts about Vale, I am long and bullish on them and let me share my calculations and thesis. Please find errors.

Vale is the industry leader - quick intro

1. Conservatively finances ( 0.46 debt-to-equity, 196% current ratio)
2. Best ROE, ROIC and profit margins (lowest cost producer)
3. Management incentives and rewards are adequate, focusing on safety risks (dams)
4. Huge moat: geographically unique high quality and abundant iron ore deposits with very efficient vertical integration (railroad system, fleet of 170 vessels with long-term 30Y oil contracts), iron has been around since 1000 b.c (iron age) and a necessaity without substitution. Upside potential from nickel due to EVs, Vale 1st or 2nd largest nickel producer among other metals worldwide.

Numbers


A boom-bust cycle can be determined based on iron ore prices. A relative strong correlation is also measureable between the PPI and iron ore prices.

EBITDA/breakeven is $44.50/mt for Vale currently with production plans for 350 mt per year. Historically their EBITDA to FCF was 27.48% between 2005-2020 excluding 2015 and 2019 for the dam ruptures which were outlier events.

IO Depression price: mean - standard deviation : $65

IO Average price: mean $103

IO Boom price: mean + standard deviation $141



Based on historical cycles, I assumed 4 boom years, followed by one normal year and then 4 depression years, now 2021 is already a boom year which would only move the DCF value higher due 2021 has been enjoying high iron ore prices historically. 

$36.59 fair value for the decade. I would suggest to use a huge margin of safety, 2/3 would do, making even $23.1 a good entry long-term.

Shares outstanding: 4850 - post buyback program

Required Rate of Return: 10%

Perpetual Growth Rate: 2.5%

Their dividend history, as expected, has been irregular to say the least. Their free cashflows were low during the last boom cycle due to very high CAPEX spenditures. This will not happen again, since Vale's CEO (and other CEOs in the industry) are focusing value over volume , and are prepared better for an abrupt Chinese demand drop which caused huge troubles after the previous boom cycle with overspenditure in CAPEX.

Their dividend policy is pleasing - return as much value to shareholders as possible, all excess cash. 30% of EBITDA in regular dividends and excess cash in special dividends is the policy currently, and they have achieved this goal since their CEO's statement about this mindset in a 2017 report.

Macro environtment

China has played this card many times before, threatening to cut steel out put and going green but it is visible that they always fail to succeed due to growth pressures, nonetheless they pressure commodity prices to buy them up cheaper.

We can see a relative high (0.407) correlation between the PPI and iron ore prices. The reason to use the PPI instead the CPI is that PPI represents reality better, more honestly while the CPI is rigged (OER, quality adjustments) for government interest.

The US has been devaluing the USD to reduce the real debt burden on the government, as many countries did historically, and currently seems unable to meaningfully raise interest rates (the US has so much debt letting the rates raise to positive real rate area, above the CPI, 6-8% rates would be adequate at the least which would bankrupt the US), inflation seems to be the major theme for the coming decade.

Many emerging countries and companies have USD denominated debt which would erode due to inflation and help emerging markets like Brazil which is the largest South American economy and Vale. These countries could focus not only on exporting their resources but also to raise their living standards, build their infrastructures.

CryptoCurrency,"(DeFi Lesson) What is Decentralized Finance? A simple explanation about the Benefits and Challenges. Difference between Decentralized Applications, Smart Contracts, and Protocols.","# Quick definition

Decentralized Finance (or simply DeFi) refers to an ecosystem of financial applications that are built on top of blockchain networks, and primarily controlled by their users.

Unlike traditional finance, Decentralized Finance promotes accessibility and transparency. Combining the internet, cryptography, and blockchain gives us the tools to collectively build and control a financial system for users and by the users(Peer-to-Peer).

With DeFi you can do most of the things banks support like :

* **Earning interest**¬†: you earn in real-time and can directly cash out what you earned, instead of waiting once per year. Interests from 5% to more than 50% a year are something common, instead of almost negative rates on traditional finance.
* **Lending &amp; Borrowing** : you can lend your coins for interest to other people or use your coins as collateral to borrow for a project you currently have while still hodling your coins without ever needing to fill any paperwork!
* **Buying an insurance** : protect yourself from unexpected protocols vulnerabilities.
* **Trading assets** : buy and sell tokens on decentralized exchanges that work as peer-to-peer, you'll never be stopped by anyone for selling or buying the dip.
* **And much more** : like Crowdfunding, Derivatives, etc...

# Benefits of Decentralized Finance

* **Open** : Everyone that has an internet connection can participate in DeFi no matter what they are. No matter if you have low income, or financial services are absent where you live. You can still participate like anyone else in DeFi.
* **Transparent** : Everyone involved can see the full set of transactions and can audit the smart contracts. Currently, users of traditional finance have no way to see what's happening behind the scenes, and the system takes unfair advantage of that.
* **Fast** : You can instantaneously move assets. Interest rates and rewards are updated in real-time instead of every year or every quarter.
* **Flexible &amp; Permissionless** : You can send assets where you want and when you want them. You don't need to ask permission from anyone or wait a long time to transfer funds.
* **Pseudonymous** : No need to give your name, email address, or any personal information. You can have as many wallet addresses as you like.
* **User controlled** : The goal of a lot of DeFi dApps is to give controls and benefits directly to users, instead of private investors or teams.
* **Interoperable** : a bit like lego bricks, you can combine multiple protocols to create powerful interactions and automation. People refer to this as **Money Lego**, and it's one of the most exciting features of DeFi.

# Decentralized Applications, Smart Contracts, and Protocols

Traditional finance relies on institutions such as banks to act as intermediaries, and courts to provide arbitration. DeFi applications do not need any intermediaries or arbitrators. This reduces the associated costs while minimizing the friction of the financial system.

Decentralized Applications(dApps) use Smart contracts. They are codes that handle financial operations on the behalf of users. They run on the blockchain network and are immutable. Developers cannot change the code once it's deployed on the blockchain, they need to deploy a new code and the protocol has to ask users to migrate their funds to the new smart contract.

The Protocol is essentially the set of rules or methodology governing a dApp. It defines how decisions are made, how things get done, and how common problems facing decentralized systems are to be addressed. Since intermediaries are removed, the protocol specifies in code the resolution of every possible dispute and the users maintain control of their funds at all times.

On the contrary to Wall Street, open source is at the heart of DeFi. Currently, not all protocols open source their code, but most of them do.

Moreover, one of the most important goals for protocols is Decentralization. They are 2 kind of decentralization for dApps, the first is Technical decentralization, the other is Decision decentralization.

**Technical Decentralization** means that the protocol has smart contracts on a blockchain network with thousands of nodes (computers to secure the blockchain's transactions). They also open-source their smart contracts and front-end code.

**Decision Decentralization** is also referred to as a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). Decisions to evolve the protocols are voted on by token holders. We will have a whole lesson on what is a DAO, how they work, and how to participate.

Running the protocol totally independently without administrative interference to become censorship-resistant, make potential shutdown complicated to enforce and decisions fully owned by their users is what a lot of Decentralized Finance Protocols are aspiring to become.

# Current challenges of Decentralized Finance

While I would love to tell you everything is roses, and we live in a perfect world, the reality is that we are not. DeFi has a lot of benefits, but also challenges.

**Complicated &amp; few education programs** : It can be very daunting to understand all the necessary concepts and all the protocols available, and even more difficult when you have to combine the pieces on your own. I've been and still am sometimes in this situation. My goal is to tackle this challenge with Unfate.co by reducing the burden of learning DeFi for any crypto holder.

**User error &amp; scams** : Since everything is accessible but not everyone is educated enough, user errors are very common in DeFi today. To reach mass critical adoption, DeFi dApps and wallets are getting better and wiser to reduce the number of human errors on users' end. In this course, we will show you how to interact with DeFi protocols and keep you safe.

**Smart contract vulnerabilities** : Unfortunately, smart contract vulnerabilities exist and have made headlines and some people lost their funds. DeFi is still very new, but with 100 billion dollars it attracts lots of hackers. On the flip side of that, we have seen very robust and secure protocols like Aave, highly protected against hackers even if they manage more than 25 billion dollars in their contracts. Also, even some hacked protocols managed to get their users' funds back or refund them. Smart contract security is advancing rapidly.

**Blockchain low speed &amp; high fees** : the blockchain technology with his consensus mechanism increase security of transactions, but it comes at the cost of the network speed. The difficulty blockchains like Ethereum network face is how to increase the speed of the blockchain without sacrificing decentralization or security. Some teams are currently working on solutions for this issue.

While DeFi is not without challenges like any new system, the benefits of participating in far outweigh the drawbacks. The ability to take custody of your finance, earn interest, lend, borrow and trade in an open, flexible, and transparent ecosystem without intermediaries and motivated by user ownership is a revolutionary innovation.

The goal of DeFi is to take power from opaque large centralized organizations and put it in the hands of the individual through the open-source community.

What Blockchain network has a DeFi ecosystem?

Now that you understand what Decentralized Finance is, the next question you could have is which blockchain ecosystem should you choose?

The short answer is that it depends on your situation and what you are attracted to.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ethereum**

If you have $1000 or less, and you want to use Ethereum because it's the most developed DeFi ecosystem, you can. But remember that you make a trade-off, the fees to use the blockchain can be very high.

If you start with more than $100 000, Ethereum is a good choice because even if the fees are high, it's the most decentralized, secure DeFi ecosystem. You will also have a very big community, more opportunities, more token choice, and the largest choice for dApps. If you have the fund size, Ethereum is a no-brainer.

**Decentralization** : Highest

**Security** : Highest

**Network Fees** : Most Expensive

**Liquidity** : Highest

**Community Size** : Largest

&amp;#x200B;

**Polygon**

If you have less than $1000 or even $10 000 Polygon is one of the best blockchains to use. It has the lowest fees and a very large community. Some days it even surpassed Ethereum in Daily Usage. To have very low fees, the team sacrificed a bit of decentralization for affordability.

Polygon is a scaling solution for Ethereum. While not the perfect solution, some in the Ethereum community is looking for, its cheap fees and large community ease the adoption for anyone regardless of fund size.

**Decentralization** : Medium

**Security** : High

**Network Fees** : Cheapest

**Liquidity** : High

**Community Size** : Very large

&amp;#x200B;

These 2 blockchain networks are good starting points for people starting in DeFi. They are many other blockchains with their advantages and drawbacks like Binance Smart Chain, Solana, Arbitrum, Terra, Fantom, and many more. DeFi Lama can help you have an overview of the DeFi protocols on each blockchain network. We will be using Polygon on this course, so anybody with a small amount of capital will still be able to follow and practice without losing too much on network fees.

personalfinance,Debt Consolidation question,"Hi,

I'm just wondering what I should do. I am currently in debt with 4 lenders. 3 CCs and 1 loan. The interest rates are between 0% (expires in Nov 2021) to 24.9%. I start a new job in October which will allow me to aggressively pay down the debts. 

As the interest is quite high, would it be worth it to take out a debt consolidation loan, with a lower interest rate, pay all my cards/loans off and then only have this new loan instead? 

Of course, it seems like a no brainer but I do have some concerns/questions. I don't want to apply for a loan if I cannot get it as it would impact my credit score and make it lower than it already is. 

**My main question is this.** 

**If I take out a loan for 3 years and get offered a 10% interest rate, if I pay the loan off early (which I will do), do I still have to pay the 10% interest rate?** 

**E.g. Would I pay interest on my monthly payments and then once I pay off the loan, I pay the remaining balance OR would I pay the remaining balance + 10% interest on the remaining balance?** 

The only reason I ask is because I won't want to take this loan and end up paying more in the long term via interest than if I don't take it. I ultimately would want to pay it off within the first year but I don't want to take the loan if I have to pay the interest off too (if I pay it ALL off very quickly). 

I'm sorry if this is a simple question but I don't really have anyone to ask/talk to about it.",finance

My husband and I are both 26 with a combined gross income of $128,500. We have worked hard to pay off all of our debt this year, so now we do not have any outstanding bills.

I am looking for advice on how much of a home we can afford without being house poor. Our area (like most of the USA) has been getting more and more expensive over the last couple of years. We have been wanting to buy and we know we can be approved for quite a bit, and while we want a nicer home or somehting with some land we do not want to be house poor. Homes in our area that fit with what style we like are in the $300,000-400,000 range. **Is this something that is feasible? Its a little hard to imagine how much we can really afford.**

We are also on the fence if we will put any money down as our bank has a program where it is not required and they will not require us to have PMI. The only catch is their interest rate is 3.2%-3.5%. As you can see below we have a bit of a nest egg saved up but we dont want to put it all down in case we have an emergency/ if we need to fix up the house.

Our current budget is:

defi,"(DeFi Lesson) What is Decentralized Finance? A simple explanation about the Benefits and Challenges. Difference between Decentralized Applications, Smart Contracts, and Protocols.","# Quick definition

Decentralized Finance (or simply DeFi) refers to an ecosystem of financial applications that are built on top of blockchain networks, and primarily controlled by their users.

Unlike traditional finance, Decentralized Finance promotes accessibility and transparency. Combining the internet, cryptography, and blockchain gives us the tools to collectively build and control a financial system for users and by the users(Peer-to-Peer).

With DeFi you can do most of the things banks support like :

* **Earning interest**¬†: you earn in real-time and can directly cash out what you earned, instead of waiting once per year. Interests from 5% to more than 50% a year are something common, instead of almost negative rates on traditional finance.
* **Lending &amp; Borrowing** : you can lend your coins for interest to other people or use your coins as collateral to borrow for a project you currently have while still hodling your coins without ever needing to fill any paperwork!
* **Buying an insurance** : protect yourself from unexpected protocols vulnerabilities.
* **Trading assets** : buy and sell tokens on decentralized exchanges that work as peer-to-peer, you'll never be stopped by anyone for selling or buying the dip.
* **And much more** : like Crowdfunding, Derivatives, etc...

# Benefits of Decentralized Finance

* **Open** : Everyone that has an internet connection can participate in DeFi no matter what they are. No matter if you have low income, or financial services are absent where you live. You can still participate like anyone else in DeFi.
* **Transparent** : Everyone involved can see the full set of transactions and can audit the smart contracts. Currently, users of traditional finance have no way to see what's happening behind the scenes, and the system takes unfair advantage of that.
* **Fast** : You can instantaneously move assets. Interest rates and rewards are updated in real-time instead of every year or every quarter.
* **Flexible &amp; Permissionless** : You can send assets where you want and when you want them. You don't need to ask permission from anyone or wait a long time to transfer funds.
* **Pseudonymous** : No need to give your name, email address, or any personal information. You can have as many wallet addresses as you like.
* **User controlled** : The goal of a lot of DeFi dApps is to give controls and benefits directly to users, instead of private investors or teams.
* **Interoperable** : a bit like lego bricks, you can combine multiple protocols to create powerful interactions and automation. People refer to this as **Money Lego**, and it's one of the most exciting features of DeFi.

# Decentralized Applications, Smart Contracts, and Protocols

Traditional finance relies on institutions such as banks to act as intermediaries, and courts to provide arbitration. DeFi applications do not need any intermediaries or arbitrators. This reduces the associated costs while minimizing the friction of the financial system.

Decentralized Applications(dApps) use Smart contracts. They are codes that handle financial operations on the behalf of users. They run on the blockchain network and are immutable. Developers cannot change the code once it's deployed on the blockchain, they need to deploy a new code and the protocol has to ask users to migrate their funds to the new smart contract.

The Protocol is essentially the set of rules or methodology governing a dApp. It defines how decisions are made, how things get done, and how common problems facing decentralized systems are to be addressed. Since intermediaries are removed, the protocol specifies in code the resolution of every possible dispute and the users maintain control of their funds at all times.

On the contrary to Wall Street, open source is at the heart of DeFi. Currently, not all protocols open source their code, but most of them do.

Moreover, one of the most important goals for protocols is Decentralization. They are 2 kind of decentralization for dApps, the first is Technical decentralization, the other is Decision decentralization.

**Technical Decentralization** means that the protocol has smart contracts on a blockchain network with thousands of nodes (computers to secure the blockchain's transactions). They also open-source their smart contracts and front-end code.

**Decision Decentralization** is also referred to as a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). Decisions to evolve the protocols are voted on by token holders. We will have a whole lesson on what is a DAO, how they work, and how to participate.

Running the protocol totally independently without administrative interference to become censorship-resistant, make potential shutdown complicated to enforce and decisions fully owned by their users is what a lot of Decentralized Finance Protocols are aspiring to become.

# Current challenges of Decentralized Finance

While I would love to tell you everything is roses, and we live in a perfect world, the reality is that we are not. DeFi has a lot of benefits, but also challenges.

**Complicated &amp; few education programs** : It can be very daunting to understand all the necessary concepts and all the protocols available, and even more difficult when you have to combine the pieces on your own. I've been and still am sometimes in this situation. My goal is to tackle this challenge with [Unfate.co](https://Unfate.co) by reducing the burden of learning DeFi for any crypto holder.

**User error &amp; scams** : Since everything is accessible but not everyone is educated enough, user errors are very common in DeFi today. To reach mass critical adoption, DeFi dApps and wallets are getting better and wiser to reduce the number of human errors on users' end. In this course, we will show you how to interact with DeFi protocols and keep you safe.

**Smart contract vulnerabilities** : Unfortunately, smart contract vulnerabilities exist and have made headlines and some people lost their funds. DeFi is still very new, but with 100 billion dollars it attracts lots of hackers. On the flip side of that, we have seen very robust and secure protocols like Aave, highly protected against hackers even if they manage more than 25 billion dollars in their contracts. Also, even some hacked protocols managed to get their users' funds back or refund them. Smart contract security is advancing rapidly.

**Blockchain low speed &amp; high fees** : the blockchain technology with his consensus mechanism increase security of transactions, but it comes at the cost of the network speed. The difficulty blockchains like Ethereum network face is how to increase the speed of the blockchain without sacrificing decentralization or security. Some teams are currently working on solutions for this issue.

While DeFi is not without challenges like any new system, the benefits of participating in far outweigh the drawbacks. The ability to take custody of your finance, earn interest, lend, borrow and trade in an open, flexible, and transparent ecosystem without intermediaries and motivated by user ownership is a revolutionary innovation.

The goal of DeFi is to take power from opaque large centralized organizations and put it in the hands of the individual through the open-source community.

# What Blockchain network has a DeFi ecosystem?

Now that you understand what Decentralized Finance is, the next question you could have is which blockchain ecosystem should you choose?

The short answer is that it depends on your situation and what you are attracted to.

**Ethereum**

If you have $1000 or less, and you want to use Ethereum because it's the most developed DeFi ecosystem, you can. But remember that you make a trade-off, the fees to use the blockchain can be very high.

If you start with more than $100 000, Ethereum is a good choice because even if the fees are high, it's the most decentralized, secure DeFi ecosystem. You will also have a very big community, more opportunities, more token choice, and the largest choice for dApps. If you have the fund size, Ethereum is a no-brainer.

**Decentralization** : Highest

**Security** : Highest

**Network Fees** : Most Expensive

**Liquidity** : Highest

**Community Size** : Largest

**Polygon**

If you have less than $1000 or even $10 000 Polygon is one of the best blockchains to use. It has the lowest fees and a very large community. Some days it even surpassed Ethereum in Daily Usage. To have very low fees, the team sacrificed a bit of decentralization for affordability.

Polygon is a scaling solution for Ethereum. While not the perfect solution, some in the Ethereum community is looking for, its cheap fees and large community ease the adoption for anyone regardless of fund size.

**Decentralization** : Medium

**Security** : High

**Network Fees** : Cheapest

**Liquidity** : High

**Community Size** : Very large

These 2 blockchain networks are good starting points for people starting in DeFi. They are many other blockchains with their advantages and drawbacks like Binance Smart Chain, Solana, Arbitrum, Terra, Fantom, and many more. DeFi Lama can help you have an overview of the DeFi protocols on each blockchain network. We will be using Polygon on this course, so anybody with a small amount of capital will still be able to follow and practice without losing too much on network fees.

business,Why do boomers still demand physical signatures in 2021?,"For some reason, it's not uncommon for presumably boomer-run businesses to specifically instruct job applicants to download an electronic form, print it out, sign it, then either mail it, fax it, or scan it back in and email it.  In the case of mail, that's just adding an unnecessary delay and increases labor.  I'm not even sure I've ever seen a fax machine in person; we're not talking about prescriptions here.  In the case of email, printing it pointless when folks can sign the documents right on their computer in seconds.

As for the claim that physical signatures are somehow more legal than digital signatures, that's simply misguided.  Even federal agencies allow digital signatures these days, certainly before the pandemic.

stocks,Reasons I Remain Bullish,"Reasons Why I Remain Bullish

Hey Psychos!

You may know me as the guy that writes a the Daily Market Recap. Recently, I've been getting tons of questions asking me why I remain bullish even now. While I never discount market risks or volatility, I believe in the long-run the market (S&amp;P 500) still room to go higher. While the recap broadly covers these points, I want this post to more explicitly cover my reasons. As always, this is simply my humble opinion. This is not meant to be an in-depth post, just my top-line thoughts on the market. This is simply my humble opinion and I would love to hear yours.

**(1) People Overreact to QE Tapering**

Unfortunately, here on Reddit, there is a trove of misinformation spreading around regarding quantitative easing and the effects this has on the economy. To use a crude analogy, QE is like training wheels for a bike, they support you while you are learning, but are not needed once you learn to ride. In the same vein, during the height of the pandemic last year, when people were forced to quarantine and businesses were forced to close their doors, the regular flow of capital was severely disrupted. Therefore, the Fed passed QE measures to bolster, stimulate, and support the economy. Now, we are seeing consumer demand vastly outstrip supply and record growth in corporate earnings. While disruptions still exists stemming from the pandemic and now the surge in the Delta variant, the economy no longer needs its training wheels.

A very similar dynamic played out in 2013. During the 2008 housing collapse and recession, the Fed once again passed QE measures in order to support the economy. Fast forward to 2013 and the Fed decides it is time to taper QE given the economy had broadly recovered and the market absolutely lost its mind for a month or so. This just seems like history repeating itself, people put way too much emphasis on QE, the real test for equities IMO will be when the Fed discusses interest rate hikes.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp)

**(2) Pace of Corporate Earnings**

In Q2, 87% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 beat consensus estimates on earnings per share, according to data compiled by FactSet. The expected, year-over-year overall growth rate for the SPY currently stands at 89.3%, the fastest increase since the Q4 2009. David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, said ‚ÄúIn an earnings season with many surprises ‚Äì including the highest frequency of EPS \[earnings per share\] beats in our 22-year data history ‚Äì one of the most notable was the surge in corporate buyback activity. Strong corporate equity demand is one reason we forecast a 5% return to our SPY year-end target of $470‚Äù.

**(3) Consumer Spending Yet to be Fully Unleashed**

Due to a variety of factors, including the surge in Delta variant and supply-side disruptions, consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP has yet to be unleashed. Due to the multiple stimulus packages passed last year, many Americans have high levels of savings and are cash-rich but have not been able to exercise buying power due to pandemic-related factors. Once the Delta variant begins to recede (there are hopeful signs we have already crested the peak of the wave), I expect supply-side disruptions (which I will discuss more below) to ease up and allow consumer spending, which has been pent up for more than 18 months, to finally unleash.

Just today, the Commerce Department reported a 0.7% climb in sales last month came after a 1.8 percent decline in July and gains earlier in the summer. The gains in August, which were better than what economists expected, were prompted by a rise in spending on clothing, electronics, and furniture, and home goods.

**(4) Supply-Side Disruptions Mean Demand is Higher than Supply**

Nowadays, in order to physically produce goods to sell, companies rely on a truly global supply chain with many different links in vastly different geographical areas of the world. When the pandemic hit last year, essentially global supply chains were forced to suddenly stops, throwing a big wrench into the system. As the economy continued recovering and consumer demand starts picking up, restarting a global supply chain takes a lot of time and effort and continues to be disrupted by pandemic-related factors.

Sizeable gaps have emerged between factory orders and output. Transportation costs from China to Europe and the US have risen seven to 10 times in the past year. More companies in more sectors are supply-constrained. One particular facet you may be familiar with is the global semiconductor shortage, which has led auto-makers and electronic manufacturers across the world to raise prices and slash production capacity.

Moreover, the labor market remains deeply imbalanced, something that has only intesified during the recent surge in Delta variant cases.  Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, August employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous month‚Äôs numbers. Here are the numbers.

* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July
* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July
* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July
* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July

President Biden said of the report, ‚ÄúWhile I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what we‚Äôve seen this year in continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.‚Äù

Moreover, according to a report released yesterday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of job openings in August was 10.9 million, higher than estimates of 9.9 million and 10.18 million last month. The rate of job openings measured against the total labor force swelled to 6.9% in July, up from 6.5% the previous month and 4.6% a year ago. From an industry standpoint, the rate jumped to 10.7% from 10.2% in the critical leisure and hospitality field, which has suffered the most during the Covid-19 pandemic. Openings rose to 1.82 million, a total gain of 134,000 last month. There are enough job openings to cover the roughly 8.4 million unemployed Americans. I see no reason why the slack in the labor market won't start to quickly tighten once Delta variant concerns begin to dissipate, which again would serve to boost consumer spending.",finance

personalfinance,(EU) looking for different takes on my situation,"Hello,
I'd like some feedback on my current situation and ideas for planning out my future.

I am working in private education and we have a unionized salary table. It offers incredible work/life balance and flexible bonus hours where I am working on my own and only need to hit deadlines. I really enjoy it and even though I am only in my fourth year, I could imagine working here until I hit pension.

My base salary is currently at 78000‚Ç¨. The salary increases by 1% every year based on the salary from the previous year and additionally by about 13000‚Ç¨ every 5 career years. The bonus work is voluntarily so I can opt out at end of every year. I currently get 30000‚Ç¨ per year as bonus. Some parts are paid monthly but the huge portion is paid after hitting deadlines. Therefore it is nothing I want to heavily rely on and might drop at a later point (if I can afford to).

Single, not looking to have children: I end up with 4250‚Ç¨ net (no bonus) or 5500‚Ç¨ (avg bonus) net at the end of a month. This already covered health insurance and pension fund.

Now the not so shiny part. I come from a relativley poor and uneducated background, I had to take out a loan of 50000‚Ç¨ to study. I pay 400‚Ç¨/month back into that and it will be paid off in 8 years.

My workplace is located at one of the most expensive locations in Europe. I currently have to travel 4h per day in public transportation and I recently made the choice to buy something very close to my working place for 900.000‚Ç¨ with a 200.000‚Ç¨ downpay (all my savings). I got a loan with a fixed interest rate for 10years of 1.3% which is aprox 2400‚Ç¨ per month. I will also have to pay 250‚Ç¨/month for energy consumption/building maintenance, 200‚Ç¨ for TV/Internet and all other subscriptions, 100‚Ç¨ insurance.

Overview:
+4250‚Ç¨ base net income
-400‚Ç¨ student loan
-2400‚Ç¨ home loan
-250‚Ç¨ energy
-200‚Ç¨ Subscriptions
-100‚Ç¨ Insurance
= 900‚Ç¨ left.

I managed to live with 300‚Ç¨/month during my student time but living standards have changed abit. I can budget very well though and would consider my lifestyle comparably modest.

My worries:
* Interest rates could be very different in 10 years. I took a look at our interest rates over the last 20 years and it did spike upto 6% at some points which would put me into a pretty bad position.

* Do you think that I am relying too much on my bonus?

* How would you invest in my position? Would it be wise to work with those remaining 900‚Ç¨ and enjoy life while putting the bonus into ETF?

* How much should I keep aside incase of an emergency?

* One of my dream goals would be to retire at 50, maybe 55 and move to the location I studied. The cost of living is similar but houses are about 1/2. Do you see any chance of that happening?

Thank you very much.",finance

Bitcoin,Why current markets will fail and bitcoin will prevail.,"The current debt system we have in place is on the edge of of a catastrophic failure. I believe when the global financial crisis hits it will be the worst economic disaster in modern day history. When the crash happens the only option will be to adopt bitcoin and governments will be forced to come with terms with this and welcome bitcoin with open arms. That being said once bitcoin is adopted as a global currency the future will be very bright restoring the corruption that has been going on for well over century.

I don't think the banks are no longer profitable in terms of value- The fed has been giving out loans at an interest rate close to zero. This is absurd based on the fact inflation the past year is well over the skewed projection of 5%. The banks are handing out mortgages at a mere 1-2% for people to invest in a housing which acts as a hedge against the rapid inflation happening. The banks are drowning themselves in falsified wealth. This brings me back to the fact wealth/value cannot be created in terms of currency but only human capital.

The government is handing out cash like candy on Halloween while no human capital is being outputted. Just take a stroll down any strip mall...everyone is hiring and they still cannot find employees . The fed will be forced to bring up interest rates but they know the banks cannot afford for that happen which is why we haven't seen it. They are going to drag this out till the end

CryptoCurrency,This book published in 1999 talks about cryptocurrency. Amazing.,"I haven't read the book yet. This excerpt is from the Amazon website. It's from the first chapter, I believe. [**Emphasis mine**]

--------------------------------= = = = = = =



Microprocessing and rapidly improving communications already make it possible for the individual to choose where to work. Transactions on the Internet or the World Wide Web can be encrypted and will soon be almost impossible for tax collectors to capture. Tax-free money already compounds far faster offshore than onshore funds still subject to the high tax burden imposed by the twentieth-century nation-state. After the turn of the millennium, much of the world's commerce will migrate into the new realm of cyberspace, a region where governments will have no more dominion than they exercise over the bottom of the sea or the outer planets. In cyberspace, the threats of physical violence that have been the alpha and omega of politics since time immemorial will vanish. In cyberspace, the meek and the mighty will meet on equal terms. Cyberspace is the ultimate offshore jurisdiction. An economy with no taxes. Bermuda in the sky with diamonds.

When this greatest tax haven of them all is fully open for business, all funds will essentially be offshore funds at the discretion of their owner. This will have cascading consequences. The state has grown used to treating its taxpayers as a farmer treats his cows, keeping them in a field to be milked. Soon, the cows will have wings.

The Revenge of Nations

Like an angry farmer, the state will no doubt take desperate measures at first to tether and hobble its escaping herd. It will employ covert and even violent means to restrict access to liberating technologies. Such expedients will work only temporarily, if at all. The twentieth-century nation-state, with all its pretensions, will starve to death as its tax revenues decline.

When the state finds itself unable to meet its committed expenditure by raising tax revenues, it will resort to other, more desperate measures. Among them is printing money. Governments have grown used to enjoying a monopoly over currency that they could depreciate at will. This arbitrary inflation has been a prominent feature of the monetary policy of all twentieth-century states. Even the best national currency of the postwar period, the German mark, lost 71 percent of its value from January 1, 1949, through the end of June 1995. In the same period, the U.S. dollar lost 84 percent of its value. This inflation had the same effect as a tax on alt who hold the currency. As we explore later, inflation as revenue option will be largely foreclosed by the emergence of cybermoney. New technologies will allow the holders of wealth to bypass the national monopolies that have issued and regulated money in the modern period. Indeed, the credit crises that swept through Asia, Russia, and other emerging economies in 1997 and 1998 attest to the fact that national currencies and national credit ratings are anachronisms inimical to the smooth operation of the global economy. It is precisely the fact that the demands of sovereignty require all transactions within a jurisdiction to be denominated in a national currency that creates the vulnerability to mistakes by central bankers and attacks by speculators which precipitated deflationary crises in one jurisdiction after another. [**In the Information Age, individuals will be able to use cybercurrencies and thus declare their monetary independence. When individuals can conduct their own monetary policies over the World Wide Web it will matter less or not at all that the state continues to control the industrial-era printing presses. Their importance for controlling the world's wealth will be transcended by mathematical algorithms that have no physical existence. In the new millennium, cybermoney controlled by private markets will supersede fiat money issued by governments.**] Only the poor will be victims of inflation and ensuing collapses into deflation that are consequences of the artificial leverage which fiat money injects into the economy.

Lacking their accustomed scope to tax and inflate, governments, even in traditionally civil countries, will turn nasty. As income tax becomes uncollectible, older and more arbitrary methods of exaction will resurface. The ultimate form of withholding tax --¬†de facto¬†or even overt hostage-taking will be introduced by governments desperate to prevent wealth from escaping beyond their reach. Unlucky individuals will find themselves singled out and held to ransom in an almost medieval fashion. Businesses that offer services that facilitate the realization of autonomy by individuals will be subject to infiltration, sabotage, and disruption. Arbitrary forfeiture of property, already commonplace in the United States, where it occurs five thousand times-a week, will become even more pervasive. Governments will violate human rights, censor the free flow of information, sabotage useful technologies, and worse. For the same reasons that the late, departed Soviet Union tried in vain to suppress access to personal computers and Xerox machines, Western governments will seek to suppress the cybereconomy by totalitarian means.

It's crazy they were able to predict essentially Bitcoin, Defi and Monero. As well, and perhaps even more importantly governments fighting tooth and nail to keep hold of their tax cattle. The future is ours. Don't lose hope even if the governments and powers that be in their desperation try to hold the progress back.

CryptoCurrency,A service idea for using cryptocurrency in trustless environments (please steal my idea or lemme know if one already exists),"My idea, that I hope someone steals from me (just gimme some sats or something) is that there could be a service or a decentralized system that allows anonymous buyers and sellers to exchange in a trustless environment.

Here is a scenario:

A man named Shi wants to buy a used laptop that he sees on Reddit. Shi likes privacy so he has a p.o box and wants to purchase the laptop he likes from a user on Reddit, but doesn't want to lose his crypto with a fraudulent exchange.

The seller, who is named Thead, is interested in selling the laptop on Reddit because he doesn't want to give any personal details, and he isn't a thief.

Shi contacts Thead and tells him about a service or dApp that lets the system hold the crypto until Thead ships it and a valid ups/FedEx tracking number is released. They can also decide to only release the money when the tracker indicates delivery (which brings back cash on delivery in a nicer way). 

Thead agrees and promptly ships the laptop after he sees that Shi did in fact put the crypto into the dApp/service. If Thead was a thief, Shi simply gets his crypto back.

In this case, there is no trust between the two, but Shi and Thead are able to come together and transact without any waste from a bloated service like PayPal which I think kinda stinks.


Is there anything like this? I like the idea of it being really simple so you could buy junk from reddit without worry, or even on Facebook or whatever site. Most websites that do similar things are just so bloated and try to be like the next ebay or something when a lot of sellers might not want to set up new accounts when they just have a thing or two they want to get rid of and don't want to have to build huge reputation to build the trust of buyers

I think there are a lot of Shi and Theads out there that could benefit. I have junk I wanna sell but I don't want to set up a new ebay account with no reputation behind me",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,"Dmitri Vasilev, the former CEO of WEX, detained in Warsaw - high risk of extradition to Kazakhstan and later Russia","Author: Tomasz PiƒÖtek

# Russian king of cryptocurrencies detained in Poland. In the background, the financing of the war in Donbas

**The former head of the WEX cryptocurrency exchange, whose accounts have lost $450 million, is in custody in Warsaw, ""Wyborcza"" established. Dmitry Vasiliev was associated with the Kremlin people who used WEX to launder money and finance the attack on Ukraine. There are also Russian secret services in the background.**

Activists and whistleblowers from Russia, Cyprus and France contacted ""Wyborcza"". They reported that on August 11, Polish authorities at the Warsaw airport detained Dmitry Vasiliev. According to our sources, the management of the WEX exchange, where bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were traded, is responsible for disappearance of money belonging to investors from, among others, the European Union, including Poland.

It is about 450 million dollars in total, the victims are scattered all over the world. According to the Russian BBC website, one of the stock market traders from the city of Togliatti reported the WEX bosses, and the Russian Ministry of the Interior initiated an investigation. The services of Kazakhstan conduct a separate investigation, because Vasiliev was supposed to misappropriate 20,000 dollars belonging to a resident of Alma Ata.

# Vasiliev and the Russian FSB

The former owner of WEX was arrested in 2019 in Italy, as reported in the media. But no one knows how he managed to get out of prison. We established that in Poland he was detained at the airport in Warsaw and arrested by a court decision for 40 days.

Moreover, as our informants claim, information about Dmitry Vasiliev's departure from Italy and his arrest in Poland did not reach Interpol on September 10. Until then, the international criminal police, which pursued Vasiliev in 2019, believed that he was still in an Italian prison.

We also know that only Kazakhstan officially requested the extradition of Vasiliev from Poland - it was similar at the time when the Russian was arrested in Italy.

Why didn't Russia do it? The omission could be related to the activity of Vasiliev and the WEX exchange. He ran his cryptocurrency business in consultation with the Kremlin oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev. The billionaire is a sponsor of Russian mercenaries in Donbas.

In the book ""This is a war"" and other publications, the co-leader of the Women's Strike, Klementyna Suchanow, presented evidence of yet another activity of Malofeyev. It shows that the oligarch finances a network of ultra-conservative organizations outside of Russia, with which the Polish foundation Ordo Iuris is also associated.

But this is not the end of WEX's ties with the Kremlin. As the Russian-language BBC website wrote in 2019, for the disappearance of $450 million. from the cryptocurrency exchange stands the Federal Security Service, which thus obtained funds for the secret financing of aggression in eastern Ukraine. This could explain the fact that Vasiliev left Russia without any problems.

In the Warsaw district prosecutor's office, we learned unofficially that a case was pending there regarding Vasiliev's extradition to Kazakhstan and that Polish investigators did not have information about Vasiliev's work for the Kremlin and his escape from Italy.

# Vasiliev will return to Russia with impunity?

Among the informants of ""Wyborcza"" there are people representing EU residents suffering from the WEX stock exchange. They fear that Vasiliev's extradition to Kazakhstan means de facto handing him over to his Russian principals, because the Kremlin still has enormous influence in Kazakhstan which can lead to another extradition of Vasiliev, this time to Russia.

There, the former WEX boss can go unpunished. And even if he ends up in prison, it will only be a scapegoat. In that case, the embezzlement of him and his principals would not be cleared up, and neither would money laundering and WEX financing the war in Ukraine. And the chances of redressing the wrongs suffered by EU investors would drop to zero.

Due to the rule of law in Russia and Kazakhstan, it cannot be ruled out that Vasiliev would be ""silenced"" there by physical liquidation.

The informers also fear that Vasiliev's detention may not be extended on September 21. It would mean he would be released.

We sent questions on this matter to the District Prosecutor's Office in Warsaw and to the District Court in Warsaw, which will finally decide on the extradition of the former WEX owner.

On Tuesday, we received a response from the court: ‚ÄúThe proceedings in your interest have been registered in the District Court in Warsaw. By a decision of August 13, 2021, the District Court in Warsaw, VIII Criminal Division (...) decided (...) to apply a preventive measure in the form of pre-trial detention for a period of 7 days, i.e. from August 12, 2021 (... ) until August 19, 2021 (...) Then (...) the District Court in Warsaw (...) decided to extend the use of a preventive measure in the form of pre-trial detention (...) until September 21, 2021, time. 20.37, for a total of 40 (forty) days. Regarding the remaining questions, we would like to inform you that it is impossible to answer due to the fact that the preparatory proceedings are confidential (...) please apply to the District Prosecutor's Office in Warsaw with a request for disclosure of the requested information.

personalfinance,Past landlord overcharged me and sent the bill to collections. How do I go about fighting it?,"I'm having an issue with a former landlord who elected to fully replace some perfectly operational appliances that had minimal damage (small dents and scuffed paint) without contacting me and billed me the purchase price for ""irreparable damage"" (about $2000). I got a quote from a local appliance repairman to fix the dent/paint scuffs (about $200 for a trip out, labor, and everything) and paid that to the apartment management company.

 I wanted to take them to court to clear the rest, but I was advised by a lawyer (who agreed that I had a case) that this would be more expense and trouble than it's worth. The lawyer's advice was that I wait until it hit collections and contest it then. I recently got a call and asked for verification, the collections agency mailed me a list of my apartment lease and a list of bills, which included the ""irreparable damage"" to the replaced appliances, and an added $600 for ""collections"". There's nothing there beyond what the apartment manager billed to justify the debt.

I have pictures of the appliances and an official on-paper quote from the appliance repairman saying that $200 was all that was needed to restore them to good condition. How do I go about contesting this debt? Should I just contact the lawyer and let them do all the communications?

&amp;#x200B;

Paulson made billions betting against subprime mortgage bonds during the 2008 financial crisis, earning him the nickname ""Wall Street sky God.""

He said in a recent interview that cryptocurrencies ""will ultimately prove worthless"" and would not advise anyone to invest in them.

&amp;#x200B;

""I would say paulson has been a gold bug for most of his career.

""A lot of gold focused investors don't understand the concept of numbers associated with gold.""

Paulson, like other cryptocurrency critics, misses several points, Wood said.

&amp;#x200B;

""We don't think he recognises that bitcoin is more than just a store of value or digital gold.

Bitcoin, in particular, is a new global monetary system.

It is a rules-based monetary policy, fully decentralized and therefore not subject to the whims of policymakers.

In fact, it's a hedge against the whims of policymakers, especially in emerging markets.""

Wood hopes Paulson will switch sides like other financial titans.

She added: ""I don't know how deeply John Paulson and some of the other naysayers have studied bitcoin, but I think they should change their minds.

financialindependence,Calculating the most Tax Efficient investment account for Lean Fire,"For the purposes of this discussion, I am qualifying LEAN Fire as sub 40k or top of the Long-Term Capital Gains 0% tax rate. I am interested in your Lean Fire ideas and specifically if a Roth Conversion ladder or 72T is worth considering. I am writing this up to solidify my retirement plans. I understand we have three primary ways to invest for those intending to FIRE:

1. Pre-Tax Investment Retirement Accounts (401k / Ira)A. Taxed at income rate for early withdrawB. Incurs 10% early withdraw penalty (72T or Roth Ladder aside)
2. Post-Tax Investment Retirement Accounts (Roth IRA)A. Gains taxed at income rate for early withdrawB. Incurs 10% early withdraw penalty
3. Individual Brokerage/Investment AccountA. Taxed at capital gains tax rate for withdraw, + State Withdraw TaxesB. No penalty for withdrawC. Pays taxes on dividends of long-term holding (Growth Stocks minimize this tax)

Although how do we decide which account we should be investing in depending on our retirement plans? What are your thoughts? These are mine:

**A.** **An Individual Brokerage account is better for Lean FIRE than a Roth IRA** due to 0% Long-Term Capital gains tax rate being lower than most marginal federal + State tax rates.

**B. 401k Account investing is better but primarily because of the immediate tax reduction.** The 401k After-Tax balance was only \~4% better in my example. ($30,400 401k Withdraw With Penalty vs $29,100 Taxable Account ). I am assuming a 12k deduction for the tax rates.

***401k Account - Withdraw 30k PreTax***  
*Initial investment*: $10,000*Account grows to*: $40,000 ($10,000 x 4)  
*Taxes paid on withdraw*: \~$6,600 (\~12% Marginal Tax + 10% Penalty) of $30,000*A*  
*fter-tax balance*: **$23,400 + $10,000 pretax**  
Note: Reduced Taxes mean you get \~$2,500 immediately back at tax time

***401k Withdraw 40k PreTax***  
*Taxes paid on withdraw*: \~$8,800 (\~14% Marginal Tax + 10% Penalty) of $40,000  
After-Tax Balance: **$30,400**

***Taxable Account - Withdraw 30k***  
*Initial investment*: $7,500 ($10,000 minus 25% in taxes paid)  
*Account grows to*: $30,000 ($7,500 x 4)  
*Taxes paid on withdraw*: $900 (($30,000 ‚Äì $7,500 (initial investment)) x (Federal 0% + \~4% State)  
*After-tax balance*: **$29,100**  
Note: \~Assuming 5k in dividends, pay \~1,000 in taxes over time.

**C. Is a Roth Retirement ladder better than a Individual Brokerage Account?**

**Lean Fire Implications:**  
**401k** \- Best Primary Lean Fire account as it makes the most money even if you pay the 10% penalty.  
**Individual After-Tax Brokerage Account** = Viable with Long-Term Capital Gains 0% tax rate

**Roth Ira -** Taxed more than Individual Brokerage account but principal can be withdrawn, used as a savings account.",finance

btc,What‚Äôs your opinion on block size and Bitcoin maximalism?,"I‚Äôm just starting to understand cryptocurrencies and have recently finished reading ‚ÄúThe Bitcoin Standard‚Äù by Saifedean Ammous after which I had some questions which I posted on r/BitcoinBeginners.. I recommend reading the book even if you happen to disagree with the author. I myself am still not entirely convinced of his view of Bitcoin being the only alternative to central banking but he definitely makes some really good points and it was a very interesting read to me as large parts of the book offer a description of the history of money, in all its different forms from seashells over rocks to gold and silver..  

Anyways, while lacking real knowledge myself I'd be interested to hear your opinions on what Saifedean wrote to the issue of blocksize. He imagined what would happen if bitcoin itself, on the first layer as I understand, would be used for as many transactions as Visa is nowadays. From Chapter 10 of ""The Bitcoin Standard"":

""For Bitcoin to process the 100 billion transactions that Visa processes, each block would need to be around 800 megabytes, meaning every ten minutes, each Bitcoin node would need to add 800 megabytes of data. In a year, each Bitcoin node would add around 42 terabytes of data, or 42,000 gigabytes, to its blockchain. Such a number is completely outside the realm of possible processing power of commercially available computers now or in the foreseeable future. The average consumer computer, or the average external hard drive, has a capacity in the order of 1 terabyte, about a week's worth of transactions at Visa volumes. For some perspective, it is worth examining the sort of computing infrastructure that Visa employs to process these transactions. In 2013, a report showed that Visa owns a data center described as a ""digital Fort Knox"" containing 376 servers, 277 switches, 85 routers, and 42 firewalls. Granted, Visa's centralized system is a single point of failure, and so it employs very large amounts of redundancy and spare capacity to protect from unforeseen circumstances, whereas in the case of Bitcoin, the presence of many nodes would make each one of them non-critical, and so requiring less security and capacity. Nonetheless, a node that can add 42 terabytes of data every year would require a very expensive computer and the network bandwidth required to process all of these transactions every day would be an enormous cost that would be clearly unworkably complicated and expensive for a distributed network to maintain.""

The only problem is this would require a commitment from me and my siblings to pay part of the rent. Currently, I am the only sibling out of 3 who works full time (make about $40k a yr) and I contribute $400 to rent. I live in the basement and have a nice space but I definitely don‚Äôt want to live here forever.

My dad is the main breadwinner (makes ~60k) and he thinks he has about 5-7 yrs of work left in him, and after he is going to be receiving a pension of about ~25k a year, so it will basically be up to my siblings and I (who will hopefully have jobs) to pay the majority of the mortgage. 

Is this a good idea? I am considering going to nursing school or something so I can have a higher salary to be able to pay the mortgage here and my own rent, but then I will also have loans. Its possible that without schooling I can be making around ~70k in a few years. I am not sure if this is the right decision or not, but I want whats best for my family even if it means making some sacrifices.

Polkadot,If I hear Eth killer one more time...,"Polkadot has a serious problem amongst the crypto community evident to me spending any amount of time on /r/cc or reading off hand comments on twitter and youtube.

The problem is that a lot of people don't have any clue what it does and the assumption is it's just another L1 just like Eth and therefore its a shitcoin because Eth already does it, or that it's remotely comparable to other L1s like Solana or Cardano or whatever.

This is the best analogy I know for what Polkadots value proposition actually is:

Imagine that Bitcoin is a small conservative country. Entities within that country are subject to laws which dictate the potential of what they can do. Bitcoin is conservative therefore the set of rules is limited and changes to law are very slow and time consuming. These laws are the functionality of Bitcoin blocks, there is some functionality there but it's not turing complete so it ends up being almost entirely transfers of value.

Ethereum, or Solana, or Cardano, are also small countries as well, except less conservative. This means their laws allow for a lot more functionality within blocks. They allow for loops giving way to turing completeness. Whether or not these are proof of work or stake is besides the point. Entities within these countries (L2's) are able to use this set of laws to undergo activities within that country, and they must use the tokens of those L1's to do so (AKA Gas).

Polkadot is the Federal Government of the United States of America. It dictates large overarching rules to the entire country, in which individual states can essentially act like small countries, creating their own state laws dictating the activities of entities within. Each state although restricted in some sense, is given freedom to figure out what rules they want to impose, for all intents and purposes they are L1's.

Polkadot is a Layer 0 network, it's rules are as abstract as feasibly possible in order to allow Layer 1 networks connected via parachains to basically be whatever they want (AKA Karura is Defi, MoonBeam is a L1 smart contract network, etc...). The main value proposition is that Polkadot provides security to all the smaller states like a military or federal funding, this is analogous to securing the network on a blockchain, and dictating governance. 

Polkadot is not a competitor to Ethereum, or Cardano, or Solana. They're fundamentally different things and as soon as the general crypto population realises this DOT will become a sought after commodity due to it's ability to participate in Governance. When I say Governance I really mean parachains as well, because this dictates the entire structure of the Polkadot eco system itself.",cryptocurrency

I‚Äôm 21 Just got approved for a loan for a car want to know your opinion as I am a First time buyer and bought from a dealer that specializes in selling auctioned or unpayed vehicles,"So I want to tell this story as this is my first time applying for a loan. And I wanted to see what you guys thought of this situation. I‚Äôm scared that I might have committed a mistake 

I was ‚Äúapproved‚Äù for a Toyota Yaris 2019  for 21,995 with a 21% Interest rate with a corporation which helps first time buyers. I give a $5000 down payment on the car and the bank ‚Äú accepts ‚Äú the deal. 

I leave the dealer 
The next day I go to the dealer because the car gave me problems with the air conditioner, turns out the compressor was damaged, then im told that I can‚Äôt take the car because the bank ‚Äú disapproved ‚Äú the loan for the Yaris after they sold me the car.
I was going to be paying $509 each month 

So they take the car away and then offer make me an offer for a Hyundai Accent 2019 with around the same mileage, 30k miles for a cheaper price of $18,595 

For the $5,000 down payment I gave they added an extra $900 on their part for my down payment. And was left with a balance of $12,695 + $3,000 + 20% for the insurance to finance for a term of 6 years payments of $407.



I know I am a first time buyer and having little to no credit experience, I am afraid of this decision but I feel that maybe this is my best bet right? cars are expensive Right now $5,000 for a car isn‚Äôt the same as 1-2 years ago that you could get a good working car with that. Now you can only buy a car that may last you 1-2 years without giving you serious problems in the mean time. I have no problem with paying for a year to build credit but after that I plan on refinancing the car with PenFed since I Will be making my car payments from there.

But I am scared that maybe this car might be explode on me later. They offered me guarantee with the dealer until 36,000 miles or 6 months.

With Hyundai for 100k miles or 10 years

Should I consider this car with my plan?
Am i making a bad decision?
Did the dealer get me?",finance
personalfinance,Finding an alternative to Ally,"I have been using Ally for probably seven years now, but a year or so ago my notifications (phone and email) stopped working. I‚Äôve been escalated through tech support and had probably five 30min calls with them attempting to fix the issue. They still haven‚Äôt fixed it.

I‚Äôm bummed because ally has had overdraft protection from other accounts, atm reimbursement, and good interest rates on checking and savings. What are the best banks that are similar in terms of features? I don‚Äôt need a local branch. But I do need to be able to send ACH and wires.",finance
cardano,"Cardano Rumor Rundown September 17, 2021","Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. Now one of Cardano‚Äôs most highly visible critics is implying that the Cardano community has something in common with anti-vaxxers.  Unfortunately for him, it was one of his pet blockchains that was down a few days ago while Cardano just kept healthily trucking right along. [https://twitter.com/spudiot1/status/1438402783040790532](https://twitter.com/spudiot1/status/1438402783040790532)
2. Cardano is still crushing it in terms of daily transaction volume. [https://twitter.com/Eilert/status/1438521555638644746](https://twitter.com/Eilert/status/1438521555638644746)
3. We might have gotten a peek at the virtual world that will be part of the Cardano Summit this month. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1438668061813342209/photo/1](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1438668061813342209/photo/1)

2. Senator Warner made not one but two revisions to his amendment to the crypto provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. Both revisions were good for Cardano since they included proof-of-stake implicitly and then explicitly. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424040216961114112](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424040216961114112) [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424074177770921992](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424074177770921992)

8. Very action packed day today (Aug 9). The Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema came together and proposed a compromise amendment to the crypto tax reporting provisions in the Infrastructure Bill. They were not able to include any section for exclusion of developers from the ‚Äúbroker‚Äù definition but did cover the previous progress on transaction validators and wallet sellers.

9. Toomey-Lummis-Portman-Sinema sought the required unanimous consent, but their attempt was thwarted by a disagreement over $50 billion in defense spending. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424832132204138503](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424832132204138503)

CryptoCurrency,Could we could see a Bitcoin back USD in the future?,"TRDL: TRDL: countries fuck around with economic policy, and disconnect money from reality. It leads to hyper inflation. In hyper inflation they will search for a solution, and will back their USD with bitcoin. 

I think money is an interesting concept today, and has gone through time with many different forms. From clay plates in the Byzantine Empire, to golden coins, to used gold backed paper money and now a ‚Äútrust-the-government‚Äù system. However as we all know, we also now have cryptocurrencies and bitcoin.

But before I want to discuss why Bitcoin has a future to back the USD, I want to discuss the current limitations of our monetary system today, and in order to understand those I think we need to go back to world war 1. Until the First World War, western countries used gold backed paper money. After all the entire principle of using this gold backed form of currency was that the money represented an intrinsic value. That gold had to be mined, processed and stored. And most importantly of all, it is rare and of limited supply. It was therefore a representation of how the national economy was doing. Thus inflation was impossible. However, with the war raging on, the western powers soon realized that a gold backed currencies created a very limited supply of money for the governments to finance these wars. While maintaining a gold backed currency, the western countries would have been bankrupt within a year of fighting. So what these countries did (and most notably Germany), was unpeg their currency to gold and simply start printing. From then on it wasn‚Äôt about the intrinsic value that the money represented that gave it value, it was a general agreement between the people and the government that the money had value, and wasn‚Äôt going to be over printed. We had now entered a form of trusting the government with money. Now at first of course these amounts were relatively ‚Äúsensible‚Äù however in the case of Germany they hid the fact it wasn‚Äôt pegged to gold anymore from the people, and when after the war they had to at back their debts to France, they were forced to print more and more money which led to as we know, the German hyper inflation.

Today pretty much all countries use this system, and to a certain degree, in an even more abstract form. We don‚Äôt JUST have to trust the government, but also banks even more. Our money is digital, a few lines of code in a secret coding formula, where printing money is even easier to buy and sell various financial instruments.

This entire situation led to such an abstract form of money that it resulted in the crash of 2007. And thus the creation of Bitcoin. Bitcoin I see as an attempt to return to a currency backed by intrinsic value in a new digital age. I will give an upvote to all those who write water bottle in the comments because ill know you guys read it thanks, back to what the post is about. Like gold, there is a limited supply of Bitcoin which makes it rare. On top of that, in order to generate bitcoin today, one needs to mine it, which represents the work and value generated to create it. However this currency is based off cryptography, and most importantly its impossible to double spend.

Now of course today a currency like bitcoin is still in its infancy, and to use it as a currency today is very volatile and thus dangerous. (thats also why i think El Salvador were too early). This is due to the fact that it‚Äôs still in its growth phase. Gold for comparison, as we know, has been around for thousands of years, and thus today its really not volatile.

Now returning to our dear governments, I do believe with COVID, the current money situation is one to definitely look out for. Our western governments have printed eye watering amounts of money. Just to give an example, 31% of the total \*circulating\* money supply has been printed in the last year. If such a situation was to continue, I think customer confidence in USD and any government backed currencies could drastically fall, and thereby be replaced by something which does have intrinsic value, albeit a new form of value.

And this is where I think Bitcoin, or some other cryptocurrency could definitely come into play. In the event of hyper inflation, governments could try to peg their currency to some good, or just something with intrinsic value. What could work best than bitcoin? Remember all the arguments above and on top of that, it would be easy to connect to their currency and ""store"" if the governments decided to open ""vaults"" of bitcoins. Of course i think this will affect to a certain degree their monetary policies, however, i think inevitably they will have to accept it. Afterall an ultra liberalistic form of monetary policy is bound to bite them in the ass again, and we will have to learn from those mistakes.

What do you guys think?

CryptoCurrency,Where to find a good staking (YieldFarming),"Hey everybody.

I discovered YieldFarming last summer and I remember the crazy interest rates that could be obtained simply by adding liquidity. Hahah, probably each of us remembers the crazy airdrops from Uni and 1inch. I remember when I woke up and saw +8k on my balance. It was unforgettable. But the HYPE is passing and at the moment I do not see such profitable offers.

I use several sites to search for profitable liquidity pools, CMC, CoinGecko and several other services. At the moment, I am looking for suitable liquidity pools in other blockchains not ETH, since the commissions and speed simply do not suit me. Anyway, ETH is too old.

Also, I am not interested in pools that promise less than 200% APR. There are fewer and fewer of them. There are several projects that I found just in chats. For example, Ref Finance, they just started and I locked my NEAR there, since they pay X4 to the steak in some pairs.

My question is, where can I find such projects? Which aggregator should I use? BSC also does not promise large percentages, or they are on very risky pairs.

I am looking for a project similar to Ref Finance.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Is $1000 to $1500 normal for fees when purchasing a used car?,"My fiance is currently looking to buy a used car. Her budget is on the lower side, as well as her ability to make a down payment, due to her piecing her life back together after various events.

She's currently aiming to try to pay in the $220/mo range.. and I think she'd probably get a 3.8% to 4.0% interest rate (60 months, I think. 48 if the car is cheaper). As she looks around... every website lists things in her ""price range"" in that $10,000 to $12,000 ballpark. But as I look closer... those values are always calculated AFTER putting 10% -20% in as a down-payment. 

And then the sites that show additional costs, such as processing fees like ""$999"" and delivery fees in the $500 range on top of that, pushing the cars true price into the $13,000 to $14,000 range. Which would be well above her monthly affordability, if you roll those processing fees into the loan.

Is this a normal rate? Is the down payment supposed to go to these fees? When you're trying to calculate the cost to the vehicle, shouldn't such high fees be visible... or do they expect you to have double the ""down payment"" on hand for a car purchase?

edit: Just want to say thank you all for your insights. By all means keep them coming, but wasn't expecting this many responses, and getting a lot of helpful information here.

**Post-purchase Follow-up**: Using lots of advice from this thread, my fiance and I had a talk and we ended up making some changes. 1) We found a vehicle in the $7,000 range. 2) We went with a Honda Fit in decent condition over a Chevy Spark, 1 owner, no accidents. CarFax showed regular maintenance by the owner. She loves it, particularly the interior and the windshields. We'll probably need to spend a bit more to deal with a few rust spots we found while they are still tiny. 3) We scrounged up ~$1500 for a down payment. 4) We drove all the way to PA to buy it... it was about $800 extra in fees, tax, title, tags, etc. No fighting over the price or weird fees. 4) Financed through a credit union, and the reduced price made a 48-month possible. 5.5% wasn't too bad, and she's still spending almost $70/mo less than she felt comfortable with. 5) Because of inflated prices, we opted in to GAP protection through the credit union. Not ideal, but I was thinking about the markup and felt if a total-loss accident happens after prices normalize, then at least we won't be out a car with an upside-down loan. Thank you all!",finance

stocks,"Morning Update for Friday, 09/17/21","Good morning everyone. Enjoy your Friday, and take it easy this weekend.¬†

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* UPST
* FANG
* JD
* ZI
* IVZ
* LCID
* ABCL

Gapping DOWN:

* LOGI
* NTES
* PTGX
* OPAD

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open a bit lower this morning after we have seen some indecision in the last few days of trading. We have seen some choppiness this week, and today should be no different. We saw pretty good numbers for August retail sales, but I'm still worried about the negative catalysts that could potentially influence the market, particularly a slowdown in growth. The Fed has said they will likely taper their asset purchase program before the end of the year. Powell has said this will not immediately raise interest rates, but I think we could see a reaction from the overall market.¬†

SPY is currently trading right a bit over 445, and has recovered off the premarket lows which tested the 444.50 support level. If we break down back below that level, we could see more red today. If we can hold up and see a bounce, I'll be watching price action around the 446 resistance level. DIA is trading a bit over 347. With support at 346 and resistance up near 350, I'll be watching to see if we can break out of that range either today or next week. As of now, I'd expect it to test support. QQQ¬†is trading just under 378. If it sees weakness, it could retest the \~375 support. If it sees some strength, I'll be watching for movement back up to 380 resistance. Gold and silver are up this morning, while crude oil is pulling back a bit after the recent strength. B\*\*coin is currently trading around 47,500, and I'll be watching price action closely today. I'll be watching for a break out of the 46,700-48,500 range, and will be watching cr\*\*to stocks closely when B\*\*coin is close to those levels. Cr\*\*to-related stocks are somewhat mixed in premarket trading. Airlines are looking bearish in the near-term, unless they can break out of the current downtrend on the daily charts. Meme stocks are worth keeping an eye on to end the week. I'll be watching to see if GME can hold up over the 200 level.¬†

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)",finance

personalfinance,Several Misconceptions on Car Lease,"I have seen several posts recently asking about whether to lease a car because of inflated car prices. Many of them seem to have misunderstanding of a car lease so I want to clarify them.   

**1. Low lease pmt does NOT mean lease is cheap.**    
It's true that lease pmt is usually lower than a loan pmt. However, it's not because of favorable financing rate but because lease is effectively a longer term loan. (I did the calculation using my previous lease contract. If I make the same lease pmt, it will take 9.5 years to payoff the loan amount using the same interest rate.) The longer the term, the lower the pmt. Lease is engineered in a way to fool ppl into thinking it's a cheap way to drive a car.  

**2. Inflated new car price does NOT suddenly make lease a better deal.**   
True that current used/new car prices are inflated. However, this doesn't mean lease becomes a better deal today. Lease pmt is calculated from the ""Purchase price"" not from the MSRP. With a lease, you are paying for the depreciation (=Purchase price - residual value) + interest/finance/rent charge. So inflated new car prices also makes lease pmt higher.  

**3. Dealership and lessor are NOT the same company.**    
Often, ppl think when they lease, they are leasing from the dealership. No. The dealership is just selling the car and facilitating the lease contract. The leased car is owned by the lessor (typically the financing arm of the manufacturer). When the dealership sells the car, they will receive the ""Purchase price"" through down pmt from you + financing from lessor. So dealerships will try to inflate purchase price (which determines their front-end profit) by creeping in add-ons behind your back.   

**4. You can negotiate the lease contract but not all the terms.**    
Lease pmts are often nationally advertised and some ppl may think they are fixed. First, an advertised lease seldom exists in real world because it's for a specific car/trim. Most dealerships don't carry such bare minimum car. The commercials are just a tool to get you interested in the car and make you visit the dealership. Second, once you are at the dealership, you will get the monthly pmt quote, which is calculated based on many factors including purchase price, length, mileage allowance, residual value, money factor (=interest rate), fees and down pay. All factors except for the residual value (and some fees) are negotiable. If you understand how lease pmts are calculated, it's generally recommended to negotiate the OTD price first rather than monthly pmt because dealership can hide add-ons/fees in lease pmt. In addition, never make down payment as you will lose it, if the car is totaled.   

Lease is not a good financial decision in general. Of course, there are always exceptions. I consider the following 4 are cases when one may consider leasing.   

1. Need a brand new car every 3 years but don't drive too much.   
2. Your dream car isn't available for 3 years and you want to bridge the gap.  
3. Your business can expense the lease. (Technically, a business can expense an owned car but lease is simpler. )   
4. Don't have money now to make loan pmt but will have a higher salary in 3 years to pay off.",finance
stocks,U.S. stock futures struggle as options expiries loom and S&amp;P 500 fights to hold on to a weekly gain,"A week of seesaw trading has left all three major indexes with gains of around 0.4% or slightly less for the week through Thursday. Some of that volatility may be blamed on the run-up to Friday‚Äôs ‚Äúquadruple witching,‚Äù the simultaneous expiration of individual stock options, stock-index options, stock-index futures and single-stock futures.

The pause in stock futures also came a day after data showing stronger-than-expected retail sales, but a jump in weekly jobless claims, all ahead of next week‚Äôs two-day Federal Open Market Committee policy meeting.A busy week of data included softer-than-expected consumer prices on Tuesday, which left both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 lower, as investors fretted that underlying price pressures may not ease up. And while While Street firms have expressed nervousness as stocks grind higher, Ozkardeskaya said a correction is being prevented by ‚Äúthe fear of missing out a further rally in equities, the so-called FOMO, and the fact that there is no alternative, the so-called TINA.‚Äù

While the U.S. 10-year yield is now above 1.30%, an advance to 2% that many forecast earlier this year has yet to happen, the analyst said, adding that ‚Äúthe high inflationary pressures leave investors with no place to go but the equities. Therefore, the U.S. indices will continue claiming new highs in the coming sessions.‚Äù

And although I like to think we have some pretty smart people here in this room*, it sure is a hell of a lot easier to just be first.‚Äù

*‚Äî Margin Call*

I want to take you back in time. The year is 1984. It‚Äôs a beautiful sunny Saturday in California ‚Äì it‚Äôs as hot as a taint after a long-distance marathon. I know some of you are asking; ‚Äúwtf is a taint‚Äù? It is that little piece of skin between your balls and your butthole ‚Äì the circulation is terribl‚Ä¶ nay, it doesn‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs fucking hot‚Ä¶ and unlike 80% of the other people in California, I don‚Äôt have a pool. What I do have is a basement. Not my basement mind you; my mothers‚Äô basement. It is generally cool in the basement and it‚Äôs a pretty awesome place to hang out. I can still picture the Rush posters, my killer stereo, and the best gaming table for DnD that I hand crafted with my dad after he gave up on the idea that I would ever play sports. The taste of Pepsi and Cheesies still give me nostalgia.

That particular day I invite my friends to seek refuge from the heat and roll some dice. You know those perfect days? The 80s were filled of them. Oil was plenty, energy was cheap, the economy was taking off like a pop rocket, and I had not yet discovered the concept of existential dread. It was nice, man. It was really nice.

This day was filled with adventure on the DnD board ‚Äì but we kept getting interrupted by my friend Dave who was unusually enthusiastic about something that was giving him a pop rocket. His father worked in what is now known as Silicon Valley, and had told him about this company that wanted to get computers in every house in the USA. We kept shrugging him off of course ‚Äì more interested in whether or not my Paladin could deal some damage to the Zombie hoard. It was a big deal okay? Dave however was persistent‚Ä¶ he told us that he put all his money that he had saved for the past 4 summers mowing lawns into buying stock of this company‚Ä¶ and he pressed us to do the same.

‚ÄúSeriously guys! This is going to revolutionize the world!!‚Äù

I bit into my apple; looked at him with dismay and sighed‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúDude you‚Äôre holding up the game, can you roll the fucking dice already?‚Äù

Dave rolled the dice‚Ä¶ and he never worked a day again in his life.

**&gt;&gt;&gt;**

Fast Forward to 2011... My nephew is visiting from New York ‚Äì he‚Äôs kind of a shit but likeable enough. I still frequent my basement but DnD has evolved into something else entirely... now we have entire 3D worlds and can interact with NPCs and other characters controlled by real people all over the world, all from the convenience of our personal computers in our own homes (fuck you, Dave). The world was revolutionized. The 2010s were kind of strange. Existential dread was starting to set in. I spent a lot of time on my computer during that time period. I think I was hiding from the real world. I was a cooler person online, still am.

My nephew was one of those typical fratty douchebro types. He was staying with me while he hunted for work in Silicon Valley - he has determination I will give him that. One evening just as I sat down to log onto the server my friends and I frequent ‚Äì he comes home from being out at some kind of networking event for Silicon start-ups. He‚Äôs drunk, and annoying ‚Äì but he‚Äôs also more enthusiastic than usual. He starts talking to me about how he just learned about this magical digital money and how it was going to change the world and asked if he could use my computer because he needed to buy some.

‚ÄúI just logged on, man!‚Äù

‚ÄúDude, seriously this is going to revolutionize the world‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs get some together‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever heard‚Ä¶ go play with your phoney bit money somewhere else‚Äù

He‚Äôs still playing with his bitmoney‚Ä¶ except now he lives in Manhattan. He has a lambo. He‚Äôs basically the WSB guy if that guy jumped out of the screen Kool-Aid Man style. This guy fucks and he sucks at the same time. I‚Äôm a little jealous.

‚ÄúNever again‚Ä¶.‚Äù I tell myself. ‚ÄúNever again.‚Äù

**&gt;&gt;&gt;**

So fast forward again to the present day, February 2021. I‚Äôm still hanging out in the basement. I‚Äôm still on my computer‚Ä¶ but grinding has taken on a whole new meaning. I‚Äôm relentlessly trading, investing, and researching blockchain and crypto projects. I‚Äôve been doing well, but the more I work at the trade the more I start reminiscing about Dave and my Nephew and what they had in common ‚Äì **they were first buyers of a first mover that revolutionized the world.** They were able to identify and predict the future. They weren‚Äôt just lucky assholes ‚Äì **they got ‚Äúit‚Äù before ‚Äúit‚Äù became mainstream.**

**Which is why I want to talk to you about asset tokenization.**

I was introduced to this concept in February after reading an article about the disruption of blockchain technology within the Real Estate market and how the blockchain was going to revolutionize this multi-trillion dollar industry. Naturally, I started to research use-case studies and developers who were making strides in the industry. This eventually became an obsession\*\*, and then I had the eureka moment.\*\* In a nutshell, the vision of this sector is to bring together smaller investors and owners of illiquid assets through issuance of asset or security backed tokens. This is a revolutionary concept. I personally feel like it is the next big thing in blockchain technology.

Hear me out: You know how in the old days how your paper money used to represent a stored figure of value (gold) in the federal reserve? It‚Äôs kind of like that ‚Äì except we‚Äôre not limited to gold as the store of value ‚Äì it could be a commercial apartment building, a piece of art‚Ä¶ the possibilities are endless. **We are on the verge of unlocking value in appreciating assets that formerly had no liquidity.** I can‚Äôt understate how big this is. Think about it. Think about all the small/medium sized businesses that can value from this structure. Think about all the property owners that will be able to leverage this technology for funds. Think about all those with big Van Goghs or Da Vincis on the walls just gathering dust - imagine if you could theoretically own a portion of the Mona Lisa. Take a long hard thought. This is going to be like the stock market, but bigger and not limited to IPOs and shares of private corporations. **We are talking a $25+ trillion market place‚Ä¶ and we are talking alternative investment platforms that will finally have an equal footing with big banks.** Yes, you read that correctly.

So why am I bringing this up now? Glad you asked. Ukraine just passed legislation (to be signed into law shortly) that will set new laws into place which will set legal structures around issuance of digital assets in Ukraine. This bill essentially puts Ukraine at the forefront of digital securities and makes them one of the most crypto friendly countries in the world. They are trailblazing a crypto-revolution; and not just for Ukraine. This is going to be a case study for the rest of the world and it bodes very well for those of you interested in mass adoption.

Essentially - among other things, this law opens up the possibility of asset tokenization. It will allow you to purchase or invest a token or share of an asset on an alternative investment platform. The issuer will be able to access liquidity from your purchase and you will take possession through the block chain of a fraction of the asset, possibly for a fixed period of time with a fixed APY - let‚Äôs pretend 10% per year over a 5 year period. Wouldn‚Äôt you love to have that kind of option in a bear market?

It also opens up the possibility to trade these tokenized assets on a secondary market. **Open up the floodgates because SPLOOSH.** I personally believe it will be the NFT craze on steroids. Want to own a fractional share of the Empire State Building or another landmark building ? I firmly believe this will be possible in the not so distant future. Unfortunately, security tokens are not legalized in the USA - but with countries like Ukraine, Switzerland, Germany, Liechtenstein and others starting to move on this technology and trend - it won‚Äôt be long before the free markets around the globe understand the massive potential. I conservatively give it less than a decade. We have big things incoming.

In summation: I firmly believe that this is going to revolutionize the world. I also firmly believe that we are close to a transition shift for real world utilization of block-chain technology. **There are a few start-ups (DYOR) that are looking to capitalize on this trend right now.** **This is still very early.** We are on the verge of history‚Ä¶ and this time? **This time** **I‚Äôm not going to miss the boat.** It‚Äôs a new era of capital management, ***and*** ***It‚Äôs my time to be first.***

defi,What is CakeDefi? My Investing Strategie,"You have may heard about Cake DeFi or DFI coins but you are not sure about this company or about the program they have ?

Let me give you a short overview about my experience : (I‚Äôll try to keep it short and simple üòä)

Registration:

Everything online possible, fast and clear process. I had my login within 1 day.

&amp;#x200B;

I started to invest in June 2021.

First with the staking program: With staking you can buy DFI coins (for ex. via Bitcoins or direct on the Cake DeFi platform) and the Cake Defi Company will work with this money. For this money you get an interest. Not in Euro or Dollar but in DFI coins. As of today (11.9.21) the APY (Annual Percentage Yield) is over 80%

Explanation about APY :

PY indicates the total amount of interest you earn on a deposit account over one year, assuming you do not add or withdraw funds for the entire year. APY includes your interest rate and the frequency of compounding interest, which is the interest you earn on your principal plus the interest on your earnings.

So I get at the moment over 80%. The payout is every 12h. So twice a day I get the rewards (pay out is in DFI coins)

What you can do now :

You reinvest again. Means you leave the coins in and restake. With the compound interest you get more and more rewards or :

If you need Dollars or Euro you can pay out. Means you have to sell your DFI coins (sell out only with DFI coins possible) For this, you have to send your coins to a exchange like KuCoin or Bittrex and there you can swap to USD or EUR and cash it out. I work with KuCoin and I had never any problems so far.

So far I‚Äôm very happy with the rewards/returns I get.

If you would like to start: You need first DFI coins. But do not buy this DFI Coins on the Cake DeFi platform directly. The cost are too high. (because they take a fee for this). My proposal : Buy on a exchange Bitcoins, send this to Cake DeFi BTC wallet and there swap it to DFI. Much less costs for you.

I hope I could inform you a little bit more about this topic.

If you have any questions, please let me know (Questions in English or German possible)

CryptoCurrency,"The pandemic's upcoming economics fallout on fiat financial systems, and how cryptocurrencies may benefit: A case study on USD","**ABTRACT (TL;DR)** 

The Pandemic has put many countries, including the United States, into economic turmoil. To stay afloat the rapids of the stacking debt from COVID-19, healthcare and reduced GDP productivity, many of these countries have resorted to heavy money-printing. However, due to the Pandemic's stay-at-home and reduced economical 'exchange' profile, cash isn't flowing around fast enough. This loss in monetary velocity nullifies and backs up the ongoing inflations' effect, and just like a dam filling up with water, it will burst very, very soon. The resulting aftermath of pent up inflation will severely damage both fiat value and trust. Although speculative, crypto among other assets will be quick to lap up the demand.   


**ELI5 ABTRACT (TL;DR)**

The Pandemic forced Fed to print crazy amounts of money. Since Pandemic also reduced money exchange rate, this reduced 'monetary velocity' is holding back a huge inflation wave. The aftermath will cause fiat to go down, and the resulting power gap could benefit assets like crypto. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Economics Reasoning: Significant Money Printing**

Between February and December of 2020, nearly 35% of all US dollars in existence were printed. (Choros, 2020) (Fig. 1).

&amp;#x200B;

[ Fig. 1, a graph tracking the circulating dollars printed by the US Feds. Notice the massive spike in printing as the Pandemic rolled around in early 2020 \(Source: FRED Economic Data, 2021b, as cited in Choros, 2020\). ](https://preview.redd.it/dbxy5bixt2o71.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=441e43ef0d4792de675de96410a6dd5034866792)

 

**Economics Reasoning: Low Monetary Velocity**

Since the Pandemic had started, stay-at-home orders combined with the lack of foreign money exchange (i.e. tourism) and lack of purchasing due to COVID-19 has caused a dramatic reduction in US money velocity, which is the speed at which money exchanges hands. Shown in Fig. 2, the velocity has dipped quite a bit, which 'localizes' the effects of the increased inflation caused by 2020's economic impact. If less hands exchange the newly printed dollars, the less widespread the overall effect will be. This is why *for now*, consumer goods' prices for example haven't jumped 35%, although there is still minor impact.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Fig. 2, a graph tracking the monetary velocity of the US dollar \(Source: FRED Economic Data, 2021a\). ](https://preview.redd.it/yxqouvezt2o71.png?width=1163&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2252ff6ae0eea1aef03683119d783431744bb709)

 However, as vaccinations go up and COVID-19 cases go down, more and more businesses are eager to open their doors, and well as shoppers and tourists ready to travel around and purchase things. This will release the dam previously holding back the aforementioned 35%+ cash printed inflation in *2020 alone*, because as more hands circulate the money, will inflation have the chance to distribute over the wider population.   


&amp;#x200B;

**THE AFTERMATH**

We cannot predict how bad the effects will be, but only estimate the damages. Both trust and value in fiat will diminish substantially, providing more room and popularity needed to grow cryptocurrencies for example, as an industry. I'll give it up to your imagination to what this would mean for your portfolio.

Of course, especially small businesses and those unfortunate on the socioeconomic scale will suffer the most, and there isn't much we can do to stop it, sadly.

The feds aren't working diligently on a matter that involves global economy. There have since been only *considerations* put into this problem. To quote Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, ""inflation, though elevated, will likely be moderate"". Compare that to the numbers I just showed you, c'mon, really?

&amp;#x200B;

**TO CONCLUDE**

This is something serious to consider as you invest in both cryptocurrencies and other assets like real estate and stocks. Please do your due diligence before considering any financial moves, especially under this situational umbrella. Inflation is usually something to consider in market trends, but under especially unique circumstances, should it be regarded with the upmost care.

Cheers to that bombshell! :)

personalfinance,Does it make sense to refinance my mortgage?,"Hi there, I‚Äôm having trouble figuring out a break even point in refinancing my mortgage, and whether or not I‚Äôll save any real money. Here are the details:

I want to stay in my house for 5 more years. I am in the Midwest United States, and plan to move less than 20 miles from where I live now.

My current mortgage has $165000 remaining, monthly payment of $1150, and interest rate of 3.85%. It is a 30 year fixed with 26 years remaining. No PMI.

My taxes and insurance cost ~$4000/year. Our original loan was ~$180,000. The current value of the house is closer to $250,000.

My quote from the bank is for a 20 year fixed at 2.87%. Fees for the refinance are estimated to be $3000-$4000, which I‚Äôll roll into the new loan. They are estimating my monthly payment to be $100 more per month ~$1250.

Will I hit a break even point within 5 years and recoup the refinance costs with the lower interest rate? 
Or is the cost of the refinance not worthwhile? 
Also will a new appraisal then hike up my taxes since the market has inflated? 


I can afford to pay $100 more per month, all I‚Äôm interested in is making sure I will be out ahead, when I go to sell.",finance

CryptoCurrency,I updated the spreadsheet for the Trade and Tax Calculator,"A while back I made this to help figure out if my grid bots were profitable or not. I added a tax thing onto it to know how much to hold back. You can adjust the numbers as needed and you also need to look up your local/federal taxes to know how much to put in. Note the green you should change the yellow don't touch.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cxb2jpo5my5JNBDyoA3ixU9Pu\_h1Upfh6Ge2LPTmhGA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cxb2jpo5my5JNBDyoA3ixU9Pu_h1Upfh6Ge2LPTmhGA/edit?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why this is important for grid bot users is when you trade on places like Coinbase, Binance,  etc the trading fees is on the entire amount. Which means if your trading fee for the buy and sell = 7 cents and you only made 2 cents. Just on this alone you lost money. Or lets say the trading fees is 7 cents and your taxes is 50% and you only made 8 cents. You lost money. And I can keep going.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, the new version instead of playing guessing games since I can't figure out how to get the spreadsheet to figure out where the grids are by you just telling it the range and amount of grids. This focuses on 1 grid trade. Just use your highest 2 grids and then do it again for your lowest 2 grids. If it's profitable for the highest 2 and lowest 2, then in theory all the grids in the middle should be profitable.

&amp;#x200B;

IMPORTANT: Anyone can in theory use this as a tool in normal trades. And in theory this should tell you how much to hold back for taxes if everything is setup right and depending on your country.

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: if you use this against reflection tokens and have to deal with whatever fee they charge. Make sure you add that in so you know if your thing is profitable. Like the current setup is meant only for normal coins and not reflections where in some you need to have a 20% gain to break even before any trading fees and what not.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Gift Tax Avoidance?,"Hello!  


I was recently divorced and my retired father wants to gift me a large sum of money to help me purchase a new home for my two kids and I. The amount is 200k. However, for him, his tax bill would be roughly 80k to give me that amount. We spoke to his financial advisors about it and talked about a 1031 form at closing or a federal gift tax exemption and neither relieved the tax burden on him.  


I was wondering if anyone on this subreddit has seen or knows of the most efficient way a sum this large can move from one hand to the other without having to pay a HUGE tax bill.  


I started to think about setting up an LLC he could ""invest"" in that wants to buy and flip houses? I am not sure if that would relieve his tax burden either...

personalfinance,Car Mechanical Failure,"Here's the situation...we have a 2013 BMW that we currently owe about 9k on a 2.1% car loan from our credit union. The car is worth somewhere around 9-12k.

The car recently had its engine seized, and we were quoted close to 9k in total to get the engine replaced. We are not in need of the car any longer, so it is not necessary to get it replaced at this point. 

The only option seems to be to scrap the car. I was quoted 1.5k to 2k to salvage the car. If I'm not mistaken, I can't legally scrap the car without settling the loan first? I would assume I could potentially refinance the loan with the credit union as a personal loan, but I know the interest rate would be considerably higher. Is there any way around this? We could pay off this remaining 7k over the course of 6ish months, but I would like as much flexibility with this as I've never been in this situation before.

Would appreciate any thoughts or help.

personalfinance,Investing vs Higher Down Payment,"Hello everyone!

I'd like to preface and say that I am still learning a lot about FIRE and the personal finance arena so please excuse any naivety on my behalf and I apologize in advance if I have made any mistakes here.   
My brother in law and I were having a discussion regarding putting a bigger down payment on a house vs taking that additional amount and investing it into a S&amp;P 500 Index Fund (e.g. VTSAX). 

  
So for the sake of argument we were discussing a $1,000,000 house and putting either $400,000 or $300,000 or $200,000 as a down payment. 

* If a $400,000 down payment is selected we assume a $0 investment; 
* If $300,000 down payment then, $100,000 investment; 
* If 200,000 down payment then, 200,000 investment. 

It was purely hypothetical and just to run the math. I have attached the excel sheet that I made to look at all the different scenarios. 

  
I used [https://www.amortization-calc.com/mortgage-calculator/] for the mortgage/interest calculation; and [https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/retirement/roi-calculator.aspx] to calculate how much return on my investment would be. I also assumed roughly 9.8% rate of return based on the S&amp;P Index Fund returning roughly that much for the last 20-30 years. I have also considered a 25% capital gains tax, 2.9% inflation, 3.5% interest rate on the mortgage. The other numbers I used are listed in the excel sheet. 

  
If someone can just comment on anything I may not have considered or if my thought process is incorrect but it seems to me that instead of paying more in down payment rather take that additional amount and put it in a brokerage account with S&amp;P 500 index fund to make the money work for you. To me it doesn't make sense to put down an extra down payment just to have a total less interest charge where that money can work for you. 

Thank you for all your help, I have learned a lot from this commnunity and truly appreciate any knowledge that I can gain.

My savings account is getting a sht interest rate though. 0.01% :/ I know there are CD options but I want my money available for emergencies and the rates on CD‚Äôs are terrible too?

I don‚Äôt come from a financially literate upbringing at all and this is actually the most money I‚Äôve ever saved. I want a better future for me financially than what I‚Äôve been shown.




Final edit: WOW! I wish I could thank everyone individually! Before posting this question I hadn‚Äôt really thought about my retirement funds :/

I‚Äôve successfully budgeted 4 months emergency savings. The remaining is going to be SPLIT between a HYS and ROTH IRA. I‚Äôm going to continue to add $200-300 a week for the time being.

personalfinance,Should I pay off car loan early or pay just near the minimums and invest?,"I recently got a car loan for a car for around 14000 after a trade in.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, Sept 17, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, September 17, 2021**

Stocks declined today, reversing from yesterday‚Äôs gain given today was a quadruple witching event and market participants continue to digest a slew of new economic data and the potential implications for monetary policy. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.97% down, the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.19% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.53% down. As of today‚Äôs close, September is headed for its first negative month all year.

Today was the quarterly quadruple witching, an event wherein individual stock options and futures, and index options and futures, all expire the same day. Typically, this event has elevated volume and volatility on the day and days leading up to it. Definitely one of the reasons for today‚Äôs decline. 

With the coronavirus Delta variant fanning fears of a slowdown in growth in the US and China, market participants have been carefully weighing incoming economic data. In the US, August retail sales showed an unexpected rise despite the latest surge of coronavirus Delta variant cases. The Commerce Department's August retail sales report showed overall sales rose by 0.7% on the month after a downwardly revised 1.8% drop in July. Consensus economists were looking for a 0.7% drop. 

A few days ago, China‚Äôs retail sales report showed a dramatic slowdown in growth as the country battles rising coronavirus cases and seasonal floodings, with output and sales reaching a one-year low. Consumer spending grew 2.5% in the month of August, a sharp deceleration from the 8.5% growth in July and missing estimates of 7% growth. Industrial production rose 5.3% in August from a year earlier, narrowing from an increase of 6.4% in July and marking the weakest pace since July 2020, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. Output growth missed the 5.8% increase tipped by analysts.

All the recent data will factor into the Federal Reserve‚Äôs latest assessment of the economy, which is set to be released next week via the meeting minutes. Market participants are anxiously waiting to see if the incoming meeting minutes have a signal regarding the timing to announce plans to begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing. 

Mark Luschini, Chief Investment Strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, said ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs really a tug of war at the moment that is underway, which is to say, there‚Äôs still good news on the economy. In fact, in the last two days, we've gotten some good regional Fed survey reports and today's retail sales number. But at the same time, it's in the context of this overall deceleration of growth we've seen so far in the third quarter \[and\] worries about the Delta variant.‚Äù

How have we even gotten to this point? It's dumbfounding.

In the United States, the Treasury Department sells bonds to raise revenue for government spending. The banks and foreign entities (large institutions, generally) buy the bonds. The Federal Reserve pays the banks for these bonds with money from... nowhere. *In the most generous of cases, this money is justified by saying it is being drawn from the future*, since they are creating debt.

At the local level of commercial banks, with the fractional reserve system, there is no way to put this except to say ""we are creating energy for free"". This breaks the fundamental laws of physics.

I think in very specific cases, debt can be important. Since debt grows very quickly, it can get out of hand, but it can be important to get something moving, like getting a car moving out of a stopped position. If your community is devastated by a natural disaster, for example, it might be a good idea to take a calculated debt up to a certain point into the future to get yourself moving from zero. Charity also works in this situation, because a prospering community has benefits to the surrounding areas. But to have debt as the everyday operating system of a community makes no sense.

""To continue your health benefits enrollment into retirement, you must: (1) have retired on an immediate annuity (that is, an annuity which begins to accrue no later than one month after the date of your final separation); and (2) have been continuously enrolled (or covered as a family member) in any FEHB Program plan (not necessarily the same plan) for the five years of service immediately preceding retirement, or if less than five years, for all service since your first opportunity to enroll.""

If you have any insight on this, that would be great.",finance
investing,What do the specifics of your retirement (early or late) look like in terms of margin + dividend income?,"Disclaimer: I'm 99% sure you can't receive dividends while using margin from any broker (they keep them until the loan is paid back), so... this is all just for fun/""what if"". I came up with this plan as a joke with a friend talking about how crazy interest rates are these days.

1. amass $1.5m in cash/equities by like 40
2. deposit it in a M1 Finance Plus brokerage account
3. take out 2x leverage at 2% margin rate. buying power is $3m now
4. put it all into HYG (iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF), yield is 4%, covid crash was 20% drawdown
5. collect $120k/yr in qualified dividends
6. owe about $10k in taxes (single filer, $12.2k standard deduction, first $40k in dividends is taxed at 0%)
7. owe about $30k/yr in margin interest
8. $80k/yr to spend

I would love a second set of eyes if anybody thinks this is realistic or a terrible idea. Does anybody have a similar idea?",finance
CryptoCurrency,How does crypto deal with inflation/deflation,"Hi, I'm no economist but the one thing that concerns me about adoption of crypto currency is the in ability to control the economy, such as inflation and deflation. With fiat currency you can always print more money or remove them, even adjust interest rates tobalance out the economy. From what I understand about crypto is you won't be able to do that, unless there will be a central holder of majority of the currency that can control money supply. 

What's stopping the capitalists of the world controling the entire economy with out a federal bank? 

I do like the idea of individuals being in control of their own money, but I just don't see how it can work in real life with out checks and balance ability.",cryptocurrency

# **As stocks enter volatile period, the Fed will attempt to not rock the boat further in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/17/as-stocks-enter-volatile-period-the-fed-will-attempt-to-not-rock-the-boat-further-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve‚Äôs much-anticipated meeting next week may not be quite as exciting for markets as some investors had been expecting in the usual choppy month of September.
*****
&gt; The meeting is the highlight of the coming week, traditionally a negative time for stocks. Stocks were slightly lower in the past week, with the exception of the small-cap Russell 2000, which ended the week up 0.4%.
*****
&gt; Central bank officials begin meeting Tuesday, and end their two-day session with an announcement Wednesday afternoon. That will be followed by a press briefing with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.
*****
&gt; The economic calendar is light, and there is mostly housing data. Starts and permits data are slated for Tuesday, existing home sales numbers are set for Wednesday, with new home sales figures coming out Friday. A handful of companies are reporting earnings, including Costco Wholesale, FedEx and Nike.
*****
&gt; The Fed‚Äôs meeting may not be as eventful as investors once expected. The central bank‚Äôs move away from its bond-buying program has been expected by some strategists to cause turbulence for stocks. But the Fed is likely to only discuss tapering at the upcoming meeting and, at most, signal it could slow the bond purchases later in the year.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been very clear in my view on the guidance on tapering. I think they get an ‚ÄòA plus‚Äô on communicating their intentions around the balance sheet,‚Äù Bank of America head of U.S. economics Michelle Meyer said. ‚ÄúThey said they want to take baby steps and they have.‚Äù She expects an announcement in November and the actual cut in bond purchases to start before year-end.
*****
&gt; The unwinding of the $120 billion a month bond buying program is important since it would be the first major move away from the extraordinary policies the Fed used to fight the pandemic. It also takes the Fed a step closer to interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; # Debt ceiling risk
&gt; ‚ÄúEverybody‚Äôs been calling for a correction, and it‚Äôs always hard to see what the catalyst could be. The catalysts for a correction right now are as clear as they‚Äôve been all year long,‚Äù Morgan Stanley Investment Management head of global macro strategy Jim Caron said.
*****
&gt; For now, Caron sees the Fed‚Äôs communications in the week ahead as less of a risk for markets than other simmering issues, like the debt ceiling, the potential for more taxes and uncertainty surrounding the White House‚Äôs infrastructure bill.
*****
&gt; Congress has until sometime in October to extend the debt ceiling before the government runs out of funds and defaults. Political rhetoric around raising the debt limit, which would allow Treasury to issue more debt, has been building. The White House warned Friday the economy could enter a recession if Congress fails to act.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think the Fed wants to stay out of the fight at this point. There‚Äôs just too much ambiguity,‚Äù Caron said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not going to announce tapering. Their statement is going to be carefully worded. The bar is really high for them to say anything hawkish right now. Between now and the next meeting, we should have a pretty good idea about the debt ceiling and where the infrastructure stands.‚Äù
*****
&gt; # What the Fed could do
The odds for a September tapering announcement from the Fed fell sharply after August‚Äôs softer than expected employment report showed just 235,000 jobs were created, about 500,000 less than expected.
*****
&gt; Economists now mostly expect a November announcement, but the September meeting could be important for what else the Fed says.
*****
&gt; The quarterly forecasts of Fed officials are released along with the 2 p.m. statement Wednesday. They include new economic projections and an updated interest rate forecast.
*****
&gt; https://i.imgur.com/vV59aJ6.png
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they want to say anything that‚Äôs slightly hawkish, but the dot plot could come out that way,‚Äù Caron said. The so-called dot plot is the Fed‚Äôs interest rate forecast, which is the anonymous interest rate targets of Fed officials presented in a chart format.
*****
&gt; Some Fed watchers expect the central bank to move its interest rate forecast forward slightly. In June, the dot plot showed two rate hikes for 2023 and none for 2022.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThey are two Fed officials from having a half a hike and they are three Fed officials from getting a full hike penciled in‚Äù for 2022, Bank of America‚Äôs Meyer said. ‚ÄúI think the dots will show the first hike is in 2023, but it is possible that shifts. ... I think if it shifts, the problem the Fed will have is to communicate the difference.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Meyer said Powell has emphasized the asset purchase program‚Äôs unwinding is not linked to the Fed‚Äôs move to raise interest rates from the current near-zero level. If the interest rate forecast moves forward, it could suggest to the market that the Fed will wind down its bond program and immediately move on to a rate hike. The bond program is slowly expected to be unwound over the course of six months or more.
*****
&gt; # September slump
&gt; The major indexes ended the past week with slight losses. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.6% for the week, closing Friday‚Äôs session at 4,432.99. The Dow lost 0.1% for the week. The Nasdaq Composite dropped nearly 0.5% for the week to 15,043.97. The 10-year Treasury yield was higher on the week, at 1.37%.
*****
&gt; https://i.imgur.com/u10YCtQ.png
*****
&gt; September as a whole has been weak for the stock market, with the S&amp;P 500 down just under 2%.
*****
&gt; J.P. Morgan technical strategists, however, do not see the big downdraft expected by some analysts.
*****
&gt; They note the S&amp;P 500 has held above 4,420 to 4,435 trend support levels and another key level of 4,367.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúAs a base-case view, we believe the index holds that support and rallies in the fourth quarter. Even if the market breaks support and sees a near-term increase in realized volatility, we continue to think the 4238-4257 summer-time breakout area will put a floor under the index,‚Äù the strategists wrote.
*****
&gt; # Earnings
Investors continue to watch for earnings warnings ahead of the third-quarter reporting season, which starts in mid-October. The concern is that supply chain risks will continue to crimp revenues and could hurt margins.
*****
&gt; There are a few companies reporting in the week ahead, and they should comment on supply chains and rising costs. FedEx reports Tuesday; General Mills releases earnings Wednesday, and both Nike and Costco report Thursday.
*****
&gt; Nike is being watched closely since it is expected that supply chain issues will hurt its profits and it could continue to have issues getting products to sell.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 down 25 of 31 during week after September quarterly options expiration, average loss 0.94%

&gt; The week after September options expiration week, next week, has a dreadful history of declines most notably since 1990. The week after September quarterly options expiration week has been a nearly constant source of pain with only a few meaningful exceptions over the past 31 years. Substantial and across the board gains have occurred just four times: 1998, 2001, 2010 and 2016 while many more weeks were hit with sizable losses.

&gt; Full stats are in the above sea-of-red table. Average losses since 1990 are even worse; DJIA ‚Äì1.03%, S&amp;P 500 ‚Äì0.94%, NASDAQ ‚Äì0.88% and a sizable ‚Äì1.50% for Russell 2000. End-of-Q3 portfolio restructuring is the most likely explanation for this trend as managers trim summer holdings and position for the fourth quarter.

&gt; # Mid-Pack Performance for Post-Election Year Octobers

&gt; October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term ‚ÄúOctoberphobia‚Äù has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don‚Äôt get whipsawed if it happens.

&gt; Post-election year October‚Äôs are neither great nor bad since 1953, ranking mid-pack across DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 1000 with gains averaging from 0.9% (DJIA &amp; Russell 1000) to 1.4% (NASDAQ). DJIA has the best historical odds for gains having advanced in 12 of the last 17 post-election year Octobers. Despite the best average gain, NASDAQ actually has the worst record, declining in 6 of the last 12 post-election year Octobers. A 12.8% gain in 2001 boosts its average. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.

&gt; # Buy Yom Kippur, Sell Passover

&gt; Happy Jewish New Year 5782! May it be a sweet year for you all! As we informed you early this month the market tends to exhibit weakness during the Jewish High Holy days from Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur. Perhaps it is the market‚Äôs annual repentance for its own sins that drives the market lower over the years during the ten days of repentance or the days of awe as they are often referred. This trade ends tomorrow on Yom Kippur, September 16, but as of today‚Äôs close DJIA is down about 0.8% from the close on Rosh Hashanah.

&gt; We attribute this perennial pullback to the fact that market liquidity drops as many market participants step away from the market and likely square positions ahead of these ten days. These days of awe also land during the seasonally weak end of Q3/beginning of Q4 period as fund managers restructure portfolios and prepare for the October 31 mutual fund deadline. This has made September the worst month of the year and contributed to the phenomenon of Octoberphobia.

&gt; But there is a flipside to this trade. Buy Yom Kippur, Sell Passover. This has an even greater accuracy ratio than Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur up 72% of the time with average gains of 7%. And as I am sure our followers will realize this trade get a big boost from seasonal market strength during Q4 and Q1 and of course the Best Six Months of the Year November-April.

&gt; # Insurance Suddenly a Concern For Small Businesses

&gt; In addition to the various indices regarding small business conditions, the NFIB also surveys firms on what they see as their most pressing issue. In August, by far the most common issue among respondents was labor-related. A record 28% reported quality of labor as the biggest issue; up 2 percentage points versus July. Another 8% reported cost of labor as their biggest issue which was slightly lower than July. On a combined basis, the 36% reporting either cost or quality of labor as their biggest issue was the joint highest reading on record; tying August and November 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/091421-NFIB-MIP-Table.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/091421-NFIB-MIP-Labor.png))**

&gt; Especially over the past several election cycles, the results of the NFIB survey have tended to be impacted by politics. For example, over the past few presidencies, when a Republican is in office there has been a lower percentage of respondents reporting either taxes or government red tap as their biggest issue and vice versa when a Democrat is in office. That combined reading has now completely reversed the uptick following the election of President Biden as labor concerns have increasingly come into focus.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/091421-NFIB-MIP-Gv.png))**

&gt; While government-related problems are still the second biggest concern(s) on a combined basis, there have been some other notable moves this month. The percentage of respondents reporting inflation as their biggest issue rose back up to the pandemic high of 13% this month. The Great Recession was the only other period that has seen as elevated a share of respondents seeing price increases as their biggest issue. Additionally, that excludes those reporting cost of labor as an issue.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/091421-NFIB-MIP-Infl.png))**

&gt; As for what the rise in Inflation as a problem may have borrowed from, one of the most notable has been competition from big business. The reading has seen a gradual decline since the end of 2019, and now at only 5%, it is tied with several months between September 2009 and September 2013 for the lowest reading on record.

&gt; # Why Evergrande Isn‚Äôt The Next Lehman

&gt; Chinese property developer Evergrande‚Äôs liquidity crisis has sparked fear and massive selling in Chinese property stocks over the past several weeks. The big question is could this be the first domino to fall, sparking a systemic risk scenario, similar to when Lehman Brothers went under 13 years ago this week? The good news is we don‚Äôt think so, but we‚Äôll get to that later.

&gt; With more than $300 billion in liabilities and only $15 billion in cash on hand, Evergrande is currently the world‚Äôs most indebted real estate developer. Worries are mounting that starting next week it won‚Äôt be able to pay $84 billion of interest due (according to Bloomberg), along with potentially missing a principal payment on at least one of its loans.

&gt; With Evergrande‚Äôs share price down more than 80% this year, investors are clearly voting with their pocketbooks, while the chart below shows the pressure its dollar bonds have been under as well, at deeply distressed levels to the tune of 28 cents on the dollar recently.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.17.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Multiple downgrades have happened the past two weeks, and some rating agencies are noting that an outright default is probable. Should this happen, what could the fallout be? With 1,300 real estate projects in 280 cities in China, could China‚Äôs communist government intervene to avoid a messy default? So far that answer has been a resounding no, with the company instead looking to banks and other creditors to help the impact of a default.

&gt; The bad news keeps coming, as yesterday, Evergrande suspended trading of it‚Äôs onshore corporate bonds, after yet another downgrade, taking it one step closer to restructuring or default. So is Evergrande China‚Äôs version of Lehman Brothers? Here are three reasons we don‚Äôt think so.

&gt; * First, the dollar bonds will likely get restructured, but most of the debt is in global mutual funds, ETFs, and some Chinese companies and not banks or other important financial institutions. Remember, Lehman Brothers was held on nearly all other financial institution‚Äôs books, so not nearly as many institutions will be impacted by this versus Lehman.
&gt; * Secondly, we think the odds do favor the Chinese communist government will get involved should there be a default. They are holding out as of now, but the fallout could be too great for them to avoid intervening.
&gt; * Finally, Evergrande has tangible assets that can be sold off to settle financial obligations. Their assets aren‚Äôt great and creditors know that the company is in financial trouble , so the value of its assets aren‚Äôt likely worth as much as they think but it will still help settle some debts. Remember, Lehman didn‚Äôt have hard assets it could sell off whereas Evergrande does.

&gt; ‚ÄúAlthough the impact from Evergrande‚Äôs liquidity crisis is enormous, the good news is the fallout hasn‚Äôt started to spillover to other markets,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúShort-term funding markets are acting just fine in China thus far; remember, it was the money markets in the U.S. that first started to show cracks in the system in early 2008, well before the wheels fell off.‚Äù

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, China‚Äôs money markets aren‚Äôt showing any signs of systemic risk. These tend to be the canary in the coal mine, and the fallout appears to be fairly contained as of now.

&gt; LPL Research downgraded our view on emerging markets to negative from neutral last month, due to concerns over China‚Äôs regulatory crackdowns and heightened political risk. Now with Evergrande‚Äôs liquidity crisis in the mix, we continue to recommend an underweight to emerging markets in portfolios.

&gt; This is a very fluid situation and one that could clearly change on a dime. Although the Chinese communist government has avoided helping Evergrande so far, we think the odds do favor some type of eventual bailout to limit the ripple effect from a potential default. We will continue to watch the action in the short-term lending markets for clues if this is spiraling into something larger.

&gt; # Retail Sales Surprise To The Upside

&gt; U.S. consumers shocked economists in August with their willingness to spend in the face of recent jitters over the economic outlook.

&gt; This morning, the U.S. Census Bureau released August retail sales data showing overall retail sales grew 0.7% month-over-month vs. a consensus forecast for a 0.7% drop, while retail sales ex autos and gas rose 2% month-over-month vs. a consensus forecast for no change. Auto sales remained under pressure because of supply chain bottlenecks and higher prices, accounting for the large gulf in the numbers. The big beats come on the heels of disappointing July data, which received additional negative revisions, taking a small bit of the shine off August‚Äôs numbers.

&gt; Nonetheless, the spending resilience shown in this report is receiving an overwhelmingly early positive response, as economic releases in recent weeks have generally been surprising to the downside. COVID-19‚Äôs resurgence in recent months is surely to blame for a significant portion of the lowered expectations, but consumers have also been forced to contend with rising prices, severe weather events, lukewarm payroll gains, and cuts to enhanced unemployment benefits.

&gt; ‚ÄúThere have been several reasons to question the consumer outlook recently,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúAnd yet, the old mantra ‚Äònever bet against the U.S. consumer‚Äô continues to ring true. This has been a volatile series of late, but we look for the consumer to continue powering this economy well into the future.‚Äù

&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, retail sales ticked significantly higher in August following a difficult July.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.16.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The familiar theme of goods over services consumption seen during prior virus flare-ups is evident in this report, as well as a back-to-school boost. General merchandise stores (3.5%) and nonstore (online) retailers (5.3%) showed large monthly boosts, reversing a disappointing July. In addition, furniture and home furnishing stores rose nicely (3.7%). Meanwhile, food services and drinking places (0.0%), an in-person segment most impacted by virus caution, held steady against forecasts for a decline, while volatile electronics and appliance stores (-3.1%) showed weakness.

&gt; We continue to believe that successfully tackling Delta could set up a fourth quarter growth rebound despite many strategists increasingly turning sour on the second half of the year. Cases from this latest COVID-19 wave are starting to decline, and plentiful job openings and impressive wage gains data should prevent a major income shortfall resulting from the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits. Consumers also still have elevated excess savings relative to history‚Äîin the neighborhood of $2 trillion. We continue to look for a resilient consumer, as well as for services spending to play catch-up vs. goods spending in coming months.

&gt; # Inflation Shows Signs Of Moderating

&gt; After a crazy summer of nosebleed inflation readings, we may finally be starting to see signs of transitory inflation.

&gt; The Bureau of Labor Statistics released the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) data this morning, which came in softer than expected. Headline CPI climbed 0.3% month-over-month vs. estimates of 0.4%, while core CPI jumped only 0.1% month-over-month vs. estimates of 0.3%. Base effects from rolling off weak numbers a year earlier meant the year-over-year numbers were larger, but we find more usefulness in the monthly numbers until we get past the weak comparisons versus a year ago.

&gt; To be sure, a resurgent Delta variant played a part in dampening overall inflation, and future reports will help clarify the magnitude of its effect‚Äîbut, expectations were already lowered to account for this dynamic and the data still missed.

&gt; One major takeaway from the report is that the composition of the decline suggests that the long-awaited abatement in price spikes in supply-constrained segments of the economy could be upon us. These relatively smaller parts of the overall CPI basket were driving an outsized portion of the gains this summer. Used cars and trucks (-1.5%), airfare (-9.1%), and lodging away from home (-3.3%) all declined significantly month-over-month.

&gt; ‚Äú‚ÄôTransitory‚Äô has certainly been lasting longer than we originally thought it would,‚Äù said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúBut the CPI components that displayed summer volatility resulting from supply chain bottlenecks are beginning to resolve themselves as expected.‚Äù

&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, used car and truck prices have experienced a drop-off after the summer surge, which saw them become the posterchild for bottleneck-driven inflation from semiconductor shortages.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/blog-chart-9.14.21.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As we have highlighted in previous inflation blogs, we make special note of the trend in rents since they are viewed as ‚Äústickier‚Äù parts of the inflation outlook and count for more than 40% of the overall calculation. Moreover, the Delta variant likely has less of a direct effect on rents compared to some of the other components mentioned earlier. As such, owners‚Äô equivalent rent of primary residences rose 0.25% month-over-month, down slightly compared to the prior two months, a modest pace that is unlikely to spook even the most hawkish inflation watchers.

&gt; Gauging the Federal Reserve‚Äôs reaction function to inflation and jobs data is fast becoming the market‚Äôs primary focus. Following August‚Äôs weak payroll report, market participants have mostly pushed back their expected timelines for tapering asset purchases so long as inflation does not spiral out of control in the meantime. Judging by the early market reaction, today‚Äôs softer inflation numbers are confirming that narrative.

btc,"Top FRESH trending news in crypto, update for r/btc community. #2","1) South Korea‚Äôs crypto exchanges will shut down en masse next week - By Sept. 24, all exchanges operating in South Korea must obtain licenses from financial and Internet regulators. As of Monday, only 28 exchanges‚Äîout of the 63 operating in-country‚Äîhad received certification from the Korea Internet and Security Agency (KISA) 

2) U.S. probes possible insider trading at Binance - U.S. officials are examining possible insider trading and market manipulation at Binance, potentially adding more heat to the cryptocurrency exchange that has become a target of regulatory scrutiny in many countries. 

3) States Act Against Celsius Network for Unregistered Products - New Jersey ordered Celsius to stop offering some of its products, which it also described as unregistered securities, effective November 1. Alabama issued an order, which appeared on its securities agency‚Äôs website on Friday but was dated Thursday, demanding that Celsius show why it shouldn‚Äôt be barred from offering its products within 28 days.


4) Over 2,300 Cardano Smart Contracts Are Waiting in Timelock, ADA Price Slides 20% Over 2 Weeks - 
Following the successful Alonzo hard fork, the Cardano network now has a large swathe of new smart contracts. However developers must wait to use them as they are locked in a timelock contract. At the time of writing, metrics show an aggregate total of 2,352 smart contracts since the Alonzo upgrade was imp]emented. 

5) 'This is how the SEC regulates': Crypto investors wary as Coinbase fight heats up, regulators circle - Tuesday's Senate testimony by newly appointed¬†SEC Chairman Gary Gensler did little to shed light on a number of crypto-related controversies ‚Äî including an evolving battle with Coinbase (COIN), the premier crypto trading platform trying to offer a new lending product. However, Gensler faced pointed questions on how far the agency was willing to go to impose order on the¬†Wild West of trading and product creation¬†in a digital currency sector that prides itself on decentralization, efficiency and the empowerment of small investors. 

6) American CryptoFed DAO Files with the SEC to Be a Public Company - American CryptoFed DAO (CryptoFed) filed Form 10 and Form S-1 this week with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to register Locke and Ducat tokens issued on the CryptoFed blockchain, a sisterchain of the energy efficient EOS protocol. While Form S-1 will not become effective until SEC‚Äôs declaration, Form 10 becomes effective automatically in 60 days subjecting CryptoFed to SEC‚Äôs periodic reporting requirements and making CryptoFed the first legally recognized DAO in the USA as well as the first public DAO in the world. 

7) Solana Dip Leads to $250M Lost in Liquidations - One of the main reasons for such an erratic price action was the ‚Äúintermittent instability‚Äù issue that the Solana network¬†experienced¬†on Sep. 14.

9) US Senator Urges Government Agencies To Step Up Prosecution For Criminal Uses Of Cryptocurrencies - U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland on Thursday expressing concern about the criminal use of cryptocurrencies. Garland is the United States‚Äô 86th attorney general, the country‚Äôs top law enforcement officer who heads the Department of Justice (DOJ). In his letter, Hassan reported that the city of Peterborough, New Hampshire suffered a cyber attack last month and that $ 2.3 million in taxpayers‚Äô money was stolen, noting that most of the funds were converted into cryptocurrencies. The letter was also sent to Alejandro Mayorkas, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); Charles Rettig, Commissioner for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); Gary Gensler, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); and Himamauli Das, acting director of the Financial Crime Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

personalfinance,What Perks do People With Good Credit and No Debt Look For In Credit Cards?,"Hi personalfinance,

I'm in my 30s in suburban USA, I have an 800 credit score, and about 40-50k USD in savings and investments that I could access in an emergency.  I don't have a mortgage (no house either), car payment, or credit card debt.  I consider myself amazingly lucky and I had some help along the way.  Despite all their scandals and issues, I have been banked at Wells Fargo since 2005 or even earlier.  Moving the accounts for my small side-business and ordering new checks never appealed to me.

My only credit card is my Wells Fargo cash back card on which I charge around 1300 USD on an average month.  I pay this off every single month.  I previously had a business card with WF, but it is closed and has been closed long enough that it doesn't show up for me any more.

I understand that having one credit card may not be an ideal situation.  I don't want to end up in a situation where my only card gets closed and my credit disappears or I have no ""age"" to it because my WF card is gone and I have no history with a new card.  For this reason, I would like to have at least one additional card.

The problem I run into is that most cards seem targeted at someone who is not me.

- I have no balance to transfer.
- I don't travel for business and when I travel for pleasure, I go with the best deals and don't want to be tied to certain providers so I can get points or whatever.  It just seems too confusing and messy for my life.
- I don't care about low interest rates because I don't carry a balance.

This leaves cashback cards and cards with special perks that don't fit in any of the other categories.  I do have international family and it's a bonus if my cards are accepted in Western Europe and avoid some of the fees that come with international use.

Are there any types of cards or features that I'm missing that would be beneficial for someone who does not want to have a balance or debt on a card.  I literally just want the convenience and the credit history as I may still want to buy a house some day.",finance
personalfinance,Tax ramifications+ of 73yo widow immediately receiving final 17K owed them on a rent-to-own property of theirs when their sole income is Railroad Retirement from their deceased husband.,"I don't know if this is the correct forum to ask and I'd be happy to post elsewhere for guidance if some other direction were given.

A family member (73yo) receives \~$25K+/year (I don't know how much but it's at least 25) because she was married to her now-deceased husband that worked for the railroad.  (Railroad Retirement Act?)  This is 'mostly' her sole income.

Said family member owns a manufactured home on a few acres in another distant city but in the same state that years ago she contracted someone to rent-to-own.  The renter passed away relatively recently and the option to continue was passed to that renter's son.  The renter's son decided he'll pay off the remainder, (\~$17K) in full as opposed to continuing monthly and in turn will own the property.

The family member in question currently resides in and has a mortgage for her own house with probably \~5-6 years remaining until she gets the note.

Because of their income Medicare(likely?) pays $400/month for a medication they receive, otherwise it would be out-of-pocket.

That's the back-story so upon receipt of the 17K the questions are:

\*Because of her consistent steady income her Federal/State taxes have been largely predictable over the years; how would this affect it?

\*Would Medicare consider this a ""windfall"" and decide to no longer pay for her monthly medicine that she needs?

\*I wouldn't think so (it seems apples and oranges) but doesn't hurt to ask; would it affect her monies received from the railroad?

\*Is there anything else unexpected that she should be prepared for when living on basically a fixed income?

I appreciate your time and advice on this and again, if there's somewhere else I should ask I'd be happy to do so.  This was only brought to my attention a few hours ago so I figured I'd get a jump on it and ask some $ brainiacs what their thoughts were.",finance
personalfinance,Should I move Roth contributions to TSP?,"Within the last year I became a federal employee. I‚Äôve moved all my retirement accounts to the Thrift Savings Plan, except for my Roth IRA because you are unable to move outside Roth IRA‚Äôs to a TSP Roth. I have an emergency savings account and a mutual fund as well. I started the Roth mainly to have money that I could get to if needed. I don‚Äôt plan to withdraw from this account until retirement. I‚Äôm contributing to the TSP each paycheck and plan to increase the amount in time as I get pay increases, etc. I‚Äôm considering stopping the contributions to the Roth and putting them into the TSP. Are there any solid reasons to continue contributing to the Roth as opposed to sending that money to the TSP?",finance
CryptoCurrency,Crypto101: What's Crypto Bonds ?,"# General Conclusion

Bonds are one of the most in-demand financial products to date. According to Icmagroup, the total bond market is over $128Tn and the terrain is open for blockchain projects to penetrate the market.

Many new DeFi projects are looking at concepts found in traditional finance, such as:

* Fixed interest;
* Decomposing fixed income assets into principal and interest;
* Leveraged yield.

DeFi protocols are beginning to address basic concepts and meet the needs of many classes of users that TradFi cannot, because of crypto's nearly frictionless composability.

These protocols were born with the primary goal of uncertain and often volatile returns received when staking or depositing tokens for lending (Aave, Compound), trading (Curve) or actively farming (Yearn, Harvest).

# Traditional Bond

## Definition

A bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.

When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

## Types of Bonds

* Government bonds  
This is a type of security issued by a government for the purpose of raising medium and long-term capital for the government. Revenues from bonds can be used to make up temporary shortfalls of the state budget, to implement national construction projects, or to finance other government purposes according to the budget allocation plan. books every year.
* Local Government bonds  
These are bonds issued by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally run cities to raise capital for local investment projects and works.
* Government-guaranteed bonds  
This is a bond issued by enterprises, financial institutions, credit institutions, and policy banks of the State subject to the provisions of the relevant laws and guaranteed for payment by the Government.
* Corporate bonds.  
Debt securities are bonds issued by companies or financial institutions in order to raise capital for business activities.

# Decentralised Bond

## Definition

By definition, it is clear that decentralised bond has the same meaning as traditional bond. Some of the differences include the time to maturity, the yield, and the ability to combine to create many different products and serve different purposes.

 

**TLDR**:

Recently, the cryptocurrency market has become more and more exciting because of the rapid increase in the number of new participants. In the current situation of extremely low bank interest rates, more and more people with a demand for ""fixed interest rate loans of 10% a year"" will step into this market.

Applications like Outlet, Linus, Dharma, BlockFi, Celsius have developed user interfaces to meet this need, with liquidity coming from centralised liquidity pools or from Compound and Aave. Therefore, users' attention to decentralised fixed-rate products will be even greater.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Exceeded 2020 401k Contribution Limits,"So I goofed in calculating my monthly contributions and neglected my employer's contribution (and still over contributed considering that).  

Contribution - Employee Before-Tax $4,534.45

Contribution - Employee Roth 401k $15,379.21

Contribution - Safe Harbor NEC $903.00

Contribution - Employer NEC $1,774.42


That's $22,590 in total. $3,090 excess.  I'm not old enough to qualify for Catchup contributions.

What are my next steps?  Contact HR?

Thanks!


edit : From the FAQ...  so I only over contributed by $413 then?

9. Do employer contributions into my 401(k) count against my annual contribution limit?

No. Employer contributions do not count against the individual contribution limits ($19,500 in 2021). They do, however, count against the total 401(k) contribution limit ($58,000 in 2021).",finance

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. Smaug gives us a rundown of how many actual Plutus scripts (19)are running on mainnet vs. timelock scripts (21k) as of Sept 17 and explains simple definitions for both.  But, he also mentions down below how many Plutus scripts (213) are reportedly running on ‚Äúthe main testnet‚Äù not counting ‚Äúother Alonzo testnets‚Äù.

3. Now the TX and NJ state securities regulators are after Celsius for crypto loans (BlockFi already got this treatment). Cardano loan projects should probably take note.

4. After the Senate hearing on Tuesday September 14th, Gary Gensler (SEC Chairman) gave a quote to a crypto publication indicating that custodial lending and possibly even staking platforms might be considered securities.

CryptoCurrency,‚Ä¶debt goes on and on. The creditor keeps on coming.,"The mbatsav, or society of witches, was always looking for new members, and the way to accomplish this was to trick people into eating human flesh. A witch would take a piece of the body of one of his own close relatives, who he had murdered, and place it in the victim‚Äôs food. If the man was foolish enough to eat it, he would contract a ‚Äúflesh-debt,‚Äù and the society of witches ensured that flesh-debts are always paid.

Perhaps your friend, or some older man, has noticed that you have a large number of children, or brothers and sisters, and so tricks you into contracting the debt with him. He invites you to eat food in his house alone with him, and when you begin the meal he sets before you two dishes of sauce, one of which contains cooked human flesh‚Ä¶.

If you eat from the wrong dish, but you do not have a ‚Äústrong heart‚Äù‚Äîthe potential to become a witch‚Äîyou will become sick and flee from the house in terror. But if you have that hidden potential, the flesh will begin to work in you. That evening, you will find your house surrounded by screetching cats and owls. Strange noises will fill the air. Your new creditor will appear before you, backed by his confederates in evil. He will tell of how he killed his own brother so you two could dine together, and pretend to be tortured by the thought of having lost his own kin as you sit there, surrounded by your plump and healthy relatives. The other witches will concur, acting as if all this is your own fault. ‚ÄúYou have sought for trouble, and trouble has come upon you. Come and lie down on the ground, that we may cut your throat.‚Äù

There‚Äôs only one way out, and that‚Äôs to pledge a member of your own family as substitute. This is possible, because you will find you have terrible new powers, but they must be used as the other witches demand. One by one, you must kill off your brothers, sisters, children; their bodies will be stolen from their graves by the college of witches, brought back to life just long enough to be properly fattened, tortured, killed again, then carved and roasted for yet another feast.

The flesh debt goes on and on. The creditor keeps on coming.

personalfinance,401k - Am I Doing This Right? A Bit Rusty,"Hello all - This is my first time in 5+ years with an employer sponsor 401k plan. I was contributing to an SEP for the last 5 years.  I got a lot of help earlier this year when I finally sat down to learn about all the fees I was paying on my mutual funds. Wanted to reach out to level set my thinking as I‚Äôm a bit rusty. 

I want to reach the IRS 401k max of $19,500 with the 13 weeks I will be an employee in 2021. My income will exceed that amount so I need to carefully calculate to ensure I don‚Äôt over contribute. 

To ensure I‚Äôm doing the calculation correctly, do I simply take the $19,500 IRS max, divide it by the 13 weeks I‚Äôm employed and double it (bi-weekly paychecks) to figure out what my per paycheck contribution should be?

As a side note: I am a US employee living overseas. No federal taxes this year as I am unemployed all year till I start this new job on October 4th. I will be off US soil for more than 330 days in 2021 and therefore qualify for the FEIE on all my income in 2021. No state taxes for similar reasons: not living in a state. 

Ok now to figure out where to invest this money. The plan provider: Charles Schwab and my age is 42.5. 

Current retirement investment breakdown w/ Fidelity: 51% no fee domestic index fund, 15% no fee international index fund (which BTW has done nothing since I invested), 8% tech stocks, 25% sitting in cash to reinvest (sold travel stock recently when it went up and waiting to see if there‚Äôs a dip in the market come late fall/winter. And yes I know I shouldn‚Äôt try to time the market. No need to lecture me on that one.)

I think I should be at an 80:20 domestic:international ratio with a percent in bonds. I didn‚Äôt invest in bonds as they looked like they have no returns and I‚Äôm a bit more aggressive but maybe I missing something. 

Anyway, given my money is going to be across 2 different banks this is now a slightly more difficult to figure out the correct domestic:international ratio but also, I am doing this right?. With this info above, does anyone have a ration for my Schwab 401k given the Fidelity numbers?

CryptoCurrency,Attempts at crypto before Bitcoin!,"Attempts at Crypto before Bitcoin!

When bitcoin was developed in 2009, it launched a new generation of digital currencies. Bitcoin differs from many of is predecessors in its decentralized status and its development of blockchain technology. However, it's difficult to imagine the creation of bitcoin, let alone the hundreds of other digital currencies which have since launched, without the earlier attempts at cryptocurrencies and electronic cash in the decades before bitcoin was launched. Here are some examples of these attempts.

Attempts in the Netherlands
According to a report in Bitcoin Magazine, one of the earliest attempts at creating a cryptocurrency actually predates bitcoin's creation by about 20 years. Petrol stations in the Netherlands were suffering from nighttime thefts. Rather than post guards and risk their safety, a group of developers attempted to link money to newly-designed smartcards. Truck drivers who needed to access the stations would carry these cards instead of cash, and the stations would not have paper money lying around. This may have been the earliest example of electronic cash, which has links to digital currencies as we know them today.

Blinded Cash
Around the same time, or perhaps even earlier, American cryptographer David Chaum experimented with a different form of electronic cash. He conceptualized a token currency which could be transferred between individuals both safely and privately; again, the similarities to modern day cryptocurrencies are striking. Chaum developed a so-called ""blinding formula"" to be used to encrypt information passed between individuals. ""Blinded cash"" could thus be safely transferred between individuals, bearing a signature of authenticity and the ability to be modified without traceability. Chaum founded DigiCash to put his concept into practice several years later. Although DigiCash went bankrupt in 1998, the concepts the company put forward as well as some of its formulas and  Encryption  tools played an important role in the development of later digital currencies.

Web-Based Money
In the 1990s, a number of startups made efforts at furthering the goals of DigiCash. Of these, perhaps the company with the greatest lasting impact on the broader financial world was PayPal. PayPal Revolutionized person to person payments online. It allowed individuals to quickly and securely transfer money via web browser. By connecting itself to the eBay community, PayPal secured a dedicated userbase which allowed it to grow and thrive. It remains a major payments service today. PayPal also inspired its imitators, including companies which attempted to provide a means for trading gold via web browser. One of the more successful of these operations was called e-gold, which offered individuals online credit in exchange for physical gold and other precious metals. This company ran into issues with various types of scams, however, and was eventually shut down by the federal government in 2005.

B-Money
In 1998, developer Wei Dai proposed an ""anonymous, distributed electronic cash system"" called B-money. Dai suggested two different protocols, including one which required a broadcast channel that was both synchronous and unjammable. Ultimately, B-money was never successful, and indeed, it was quite different from bitcoin in many ways. Nonetheless, it was also an attempt at an anonymous, private, and secure electronic cash system. In the B-money system, digital pseudonyms would be used in order to transfer currency through a decentralized network. The system even included a means for contract enforcement in-network as well, without the use of a third party. Although Wei Dai proposed a whitepaper for B-money, it was ultimately unable to garner enough attention for a successful launch. Still, Satoshi referenced elements of B-money in his bitcoin whitepaper roughly a decade later, so the impact of B-money on the current digital currency craze is undeniable.

Bit Gold
Not to be confused with the contemporary gold-based exchange of a similar name, Bit Gold was another electronic currency system which dates back to the same period as B-money. Proposed by Nick Szabo, Bit Gold came with its own proof-of-work system that in some ways is mirrored by today's bitcoin mining process. Through this procedure, solutions were compiled cryptographically and then published for the public in much the same way a modern blockchain would function.

Perhaps the most revolutionary aspect of the Bit Gold concept, however, had to do with its movement away from centralized status. Bit Gold aimed to avoid reliance on centralized currency distributors and authorities. Szabo's aim was for Bit Gold to reflect the properties of real gold, thereby enabling users to eliminate the middleman entirely. Bit Gold, like B-money, was ultimately unsuccessful. However, it too provided inspiration for a large group of digital currencies which would enter the market a decade or more after its introduction.

Hashcash
Developed in the mid-1990s, Hashcash was one of the most successful pre-bitcoin digital currencies, according to The Merkle. Hashcash was designed for a number of purposes, including minimizing email spam and preventing¬†DDos attacks, Hashcash opened up a wide array of possibilities which would only¬†be realized nearly two decades later. Hashcash used a proof-of-work algorithm to aid¬†the generation and distribution of new coins, much like many contemporary cryptocurrencies. Indeed, Hashcash also ran into many of the same problems as today's cryptocurrencies today; in 1997, facing an increased processing power need, Hashcash eventually became less and less effective. In spite of the fact that it eventually fizzled out, Hashcash saw a large degree of interest in its heyday. Many of the elements of the Hashcash system worked their way into bitcoin's development as well

CryptoCurrency,New US Crypto Regulation Far More Invasive Than We Thought [DUE DILIGENCE],"# New US Crypto Regulation Far More Invasive Than We Thought

**US Congress intends to regulate crypto on a level far deeper  than currently understood‚ÄïThey will:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Designate Bitcoin, Ether, and their hard-forks as commodities and regulate their transactions accordingly;
* Create legal uncertainty for all other crypto projects and ICOs by allowing them to be labeled as securities;
* Ban the use of (unauthorized) stablecoins;
* Introduce penalties for the use of mixers and privacy coins;
* Rebrand smart-contracts that take longer than 24 hours to deliver as futures contracts and regulate them accordingly;
* Re-define  legal tender and change the way money is created by the Federal  Reserve; and authorize the issuing of a digital USD of which all  transactions are recorded;
* Introduce foreign regulations into US law for all virtual asset service providers in the US (and with US clients).

&amp;#x200B;

**In short: Congress wants to bring crypto-currencies under full oversight and control.**

These  new regulations introduce massive regulatory burdens on existing  projects, ban and criminalize current normal activities, restrain  innovation and free enterprise, and even introduce a transparent central  bank digital digital currency that redefines money as we know it!

According  to United States representative Don Beyer, congress should incorporate  ‚Äúdigital assets into existing financial regulatory structures.‚Äù(1) As you will see, they intend to do just that.

And it will change the way things are done for crypto forever‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;What This Post Is About_

This  post provides an overview of the crypto legislation currently  (September 2021) being put through US congress.

It does not just look at  the proposed bills, but rather at the wide range of laws that are to be  amended.

Once all the puzzle pieces are put together, the big  picture reveals shockingly strict regulations of crypto and a complete  overhaul of the idea of ‚Äúmoney.‚Äù This could have serious effects not  only on the crypto sector, but also on the financial system as a whole.

Behind  the excuses of preventing money laundering and ensuring investor  protection, the use of crypto is transformed in something it was not  supposed to be. Especially delicate is the fact that part of this legislation is drafted outside the US.

***Disclaimer***\*:  This report provides a high-level overview of the US laws that are to  be introduced/amended by two new bills. Its depth is limited by the inadequate knowledge of the author of the large body of US law involved, and given that these bills are subject to amendments and have not even passed into law yet, none of this information can be considered legal or financial advice.\*

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;What Is Going On?

On April 06, 2021, a ‚Äúmust pass‚Äù bill was introduced called the ‚ÄúInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act‚Äù(2)  (‚ÄúInfrastructure Bill‚Äù). It passed in the House of Representatives and,  after fierce debate, the Senate. Hidden in this bill, an amendment to  the Internal Revenue Code was added. It introduced new reporting  requirements and obligations for record keeping.

While this bill  created a lot of public outcry, more recently, a real game-changing bill  was introduced in the House on July 28, 2021, namely the: ‚ÄúDigital  Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act‚Äù (3) (‚ÄúDigital Asset Bill‚Äù).

This  bill proposes amendments to the Federal Reserve Act, the Bank Secrecy  Act, Securities Exchanges Acts, and the Commodity Exchange Act. It  changes the definition of legal tender, and it introduces international  crypto regulation into US law.

This article looks at each of these amendments‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Commodities or Securities?_

The  main take-away is that two different bodies of law will apply to crypto  projects: commodities and securities laws. So far, only Bitcoin, Ether,  and their hard-forks are confirmed to be commodities (see below). All  other cryptos are subject to future guidance by market regulators:

*‚ÄúNot  later than 150 days after the date of the enactment of this section,  the SEC and CFTC shall jointly publish, for purposes of a 60-day public  comment period, a proposed rulemaking that classifies each of the major  digital assets.*

***Not later  than 270 days after the date of the enactment of this Act***\*, the SEC and  CFTC shall jointly publish a final rule that classifies\* ***each of the top  25 major digital assets*** *by (i) highest market capitalization and (ii)  highest daily average trading volume as‚Äî*

*(1) a digital asset; or(2) a digital asset security.‚Äù* (4)

&amp;#x200B;

## Interpretation:

* Cryptos will be subject to two different regulatory regimes: commodities and security regulations.
* Services  engaged with both digital assets (commodities) and digital asset  securities (securities) could be subjected to both regulatory regimes.

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Commodities Regulation_

The  Commodity Exchange Act regulates the trading of commodity futures in  the United States. Passed in 1936, it has been amended several times  since then.(5)  It provides federal regulation of all commodities and futures trading  activities and requires all futures and commodity options to be traded  on organized exchanges.

In 1974, the Commodity Futures Trading  Commission (CFTC) was created to oversee the market. With certain  exceptions, the CFTC has been granted exclusive jurisdiction over  commodity futures, options, and all other derivatives that fall within  the definition of a swap. Certain cryptos will be regulated as  commodities.

&amp;#x200B;

## Definition of ‚ÄúCommodity‚Äù Amended to Include Digital Asset:

First and foremost, Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act on definitions will be amended to read as follows:

*‚Äú****The term ‚Äúcommodity‚Äù means***  *wheat, cotton, rice, corn, oats, barley, rye, flaxseed, grain sorghums,  mill feeds, butter, eggs, Solanum tuberosum (Irish potatoes), wool,  wool tops, fats and oils (including lard, tallow, cottonseed oil, peanut  oil, soybean oil, and all other fats and oils), cottonseed meal,  cottonseed, peanuts, soybeans, soybean meal, livestock, livestock  products,* ***digital asset (including Bitcoin, Ether, and their hardforks)****,  and frozen concentrated orange juice, and all other goods and articles,  except onions (as provided by section 13‚Äì1 of this title) and motion  picture box office receipts (or any index, measure, value, or data  related to such receipts), and all services, rights, and interests  (except motion picture box office receipts, or any index, measure, value  or data related to such receipts) in which contracts for future  delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.‚Äù*(6)

&amp;#x200B;

## Digital Asset Definition

Next, the end of Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act will be amended by adding a clarification of what a digital asset is (7)(definition to long to post here)

&amp;#x200B;

## Smart Contracts with Delivery Time of More than 24 hours are Futures Contracts

A  sharpening of the definition of retail commodity transactions could  decrease the options for the use of smart contracts outside of regulated  exchanges.

Currently, Section 2(c)(2)(D)(i) of the Commodity Exchange Act prohibits persons that are not *‚Äúeligible contract participants‚Äù* or *‚Äúeligible commercial entities‚Äù*  to engage in agreements, contract or transactions in commodities on  leverage, margin, or financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a  person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a similar  basis.(8)

Next,  additional amendments mentioned in the SEC. 202 of the Digital Asset  Bill applies this on transactions done by smart contract of which the  delivery takes longer than 24 hours:

*‚Äú(ii) ‚ÄÇExceptions*

*(III)‚ÄÇa contract of sale that‚Äì*

*(cc)  with respect to* ***digital assets***\*, results in\* ***actual delivery*** *(including  transfer of control over private keys) n****ot later than 24 hours after the  transaction is entered into*** *and such delivery is accomplished by  either-*

*(AA) recording the transaction on the public distributed ledger for the digital asset; or*

*(BB)  with respect to digital which are not recorded on a public distributed  ledger for the digital asset, reporting the transaction to a CFTC  registered digital asset trade repository; or‚Äù* (9)

&amp;#x200B;

## Dodd-Frank Act and Market Transparency

After  the 2008 financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act introduced strict  regulations for swaps. Naturally, these will also apply to digital  assets as well.

The definition of swaps, as provided by the  Commodity Exchange Act (section 1a(47)) is broad. For example, it could  refer to any ‚Äúagreement, contract or transaction‚Äù that ‚Äúprovides for any  purchase, sale, payment, or delivery that is dependent on the  occurrence, nonoccurrence, or the extent of the occurrence of an event  or contingency associated with a potential financial, economic, or  commercial consequence.‚Äù (10)

## Next, the Dodd-Frank bill authorizes the CFTC to:

* Regulate  swap dealers by installing capital and margin requirements, require  dealers to meet robust business conduct standards, and meet  recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
* Increase  transparency and improve pricing in the derivatives marketplace by  requiring standardized derivatives to be traded on regulated exchanges  or swap execution facilities and bring better pricing to the market  place and lower costs for businesses and consumers.
* Lower risk to the American public by moving standardized derivatives to central clearinghouses.(11)

&amp;#x200B;

## Digital Asset Trade Repository

To  meet the above mentioned market transparency requirement, the Commodity  Exchange Act stipulates the need for a digital asset trade repository  to collect information on SWAPS in order to provide the public with the  correct market information:

*‚ÄúThe  term ‚Äòdigital asset trade repository‚Äô means any person that collects and  maintains information or records with respect to transactions or  positions in, or the terms and conditions of, contracts of sale of  digital assets in interstate commerce entered into by third parties  (both on chain public distributed ledger transactions as well as off  chain transactions) for the purpose of providing a centralized  recordkeeping facility for any digital asset, but does not include a  private or public distributed ledger or the operator of either such  ledger unless such private or public distributed ledger or operator  seeks to aggregate/include ‚Äòoff chain‚Äô transactions as well.‚Äù* (12)

&amp;#x200B;

## Interpretation Commodities Regulations:

* As  of writing, only BTC and Ether (and their hard-forks) will be confirmed  as commodities. All other cryptos could potentially be regulated as securities (what this means is explained next).
* The fact that novel technologies such as Bitcoin and Ether are to be  subjected to a large body of law that developed around the trading of  livestock and frozen concentrated orange juice could spell regulatory  uncertainty for various business models in the industry.
* No  ‚Äútrading on margin‚Äù is allowed outside regulated entities, unless done  by high-level investors called ‚Äúeligible contract parties.‚Äù This could  perhaps frustrate particular ideas about decentralized finance or OTC  markets.
* Smart contracts  that take longer than 24 hours to deliver could be considered futures  contracts under the jurisdiction of the CFTC. That smart contracts can  be labeled as futures contracts appears indeed to be the opinion of the  CFTC.(13)

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Securities Regulations_

In  the US, securities are regulated by the 1933 Securities Act.  Additionally, the 1934 Securities Exchange Act further regulates the  trade of securities, and established the SEC to oversee these markets.

## Definition of ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù Amended to Include Digital Asset Security:

First  and foremost, Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act will be  amended to include a ‚Äúdigital asset security‚Äù (and exclude ‚Äúdigital  assets‚Äù) in the definition of security:

*‚Äú(10)* ***The term ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù means***  *any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap,  bond, debenture, certificate of interest or participation in any  profit-sharing agreement or in any oil, gas, or other mineral royalty or  lease, any collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or  subscription, transferable share, investment contract,* ***digital asset security***\*,  voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, any  put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate  of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest  therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle,  option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange  relating to foreign currency, or in general, any instrument commonly  known as a ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù; or any certificate of interest or participation  in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, or warrant or  right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing;\* ***but shall not include any fiat currency, commodity, digital asset***\*,  or any note, draft, bill of exchange, or banker‚Äôs acceptance which has a  maturity at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months,  exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity of which  is likewise limited.‚Äù\* (14)

## Digital Asset Security Definition

Next, the Digital Asset Bill (SEC. 101) defines what a digital asset security will be:

*‚Äú(A) IN GENERAL.‚ÄîThe term ‚Äòdigital asset security‚Äô means a digital asset that:*

*(i) Provides the holder of the digital asset with any of the following rights:*

*(I) Equity or debt interest in the issuer.*

*(II) Right to profits, interest, or dividend payments from the issuer.*

*(III)  Voting rights in the major corporate actions (which shall not include  new block creations, hardforks, or protocol changes related to the  digital asset) of the issuer.*

*(IV) Liquidation rights in the event of the issuer‚Äôs liquidation.*

*(ii)  In the case of an issuer with a service, goods, or platform that is not  wholly operational at the time of issuing such digital asset, with  respect to* ***any fundraising or capital formation activity (including initial coin offerings***\*)  which is accomplished through the issuance of such a digital asset,  issues such digital asset to a holder in return for money (including  other digital assets) to fund the development of the proposed service,  goods, or platform of the issuer.‚Äù\* (15)

&amp;#x200B;

## What does it mean to be regulated as a security?

Investing in securities in the US is regulated to:

*‚Äúprotect  interstate commerce, the national credit, the Federal taxing power, to  protect and make more effective the national banking system and Federal  Reserve System, and to insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets  in such transactions.‚Äù* (16)

Regulations  focus on both the issuing of securities (primary market), and  subsequent trade of such securities (secondary market).

The goal  of securities laws is firstly to require issuers to fully disclose all  material information that an investor would need in order to make up his  or her mind about the potential investment. A regulated company must  create a registration statement, which includes a prospectus, with  copious amounts of information about the security, the company, the  business, including audited financial statements.

Next, the  subsequent selling and trading in these securities is regulated, by  restricting trade to market places over which the regulator has  oversight. The Security Exchange Act section ¬ß78l(a) states:

*‚ÄúIt  shall be unlawful for any member, broker, or dealer to effect any  transaction in any security (other than an exempted security) on a  national securities exchange unless a registration is effective as to  such security for such exchange in accordance with the provisions of  this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder.‚Äù* (17)

&amp;#x200B;

## Summary of Securities Regulations:

* Crypto projects will need to be regulated and provide clear financial information for investors to make an informed decision.
* Trading of securities will generally take place on regulated exchanges.
* Any new fundraising or capital formation activity (including ICOs) are likely to be securities.
* When  a crypto is regulated as a security, the entire coin is subject to  strict regulations. In the case of commodities, only specific use cases  (futures) are regulated. It is a big difference.
* US  Congress is taking a leap of faith. It needs identifiable persons to  enforce a law upon. Who is going to be held accountable in a  decentralized network? Many issuing companies have handed control over  to network participants. Perhaps for this reason, Section 12(g) of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 will be amended to allow the issuer to  apply for ‚Äúdesecuritization.‚Äù (18)  The question remains: who will apply for desecuritization once a  network is decentralized? The investors? Weren‚Äôt they the ones supposed  to be protected in the first place?

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Changing the Nature of Money_

These  regulations are not just about crypto. It is clearly part of a wider  discussion on the future of money. As shown below, this bill not only  changes the definition of money in the US, but also changes how money is  created!

As a first, in Section 5312(a)(3)(B) of title 31, US  Code (Money and Finance) digital assets are included as a monetary  instrument.(19)  However, Section 5103, of title 31, US Code will be amended to  specifically exclude digital assets and digital asset securities as  legal tender.(20)  And finally, it is determined that digital assets and digital asset  securities will not be covered by Federal Deposit Insurance (FDIC or  NCUA).(21)

&amp;#x200B;

## Introducing the Digital USD (or Central Bank Digital Currency/CBDC)

After  slamming the door on digital assets to be used as lawful money, the  Federal Reserve Act is amended to provide the Federal Reserve Board with  far reaching new powers; section 11 will be amended to say:

*‚Äú(d) To supervise and regulate through the Secretary of the Treasury the issue and retirement of Federal Reserve notes (****both physical and digital****),  except for the cancellation and destruction, and accounting with  respect to such cancellation and destruction, of notes unfit for  circulation, and to prescribe rules and regulations (****including appropriate technology****) under which such notes may be delivered by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Federal Reserve agents applying therefor.‚Äù* (22)

In addition, Federal Reserve notes will in the future also be issued digitally; an amendment to section 16 confirms this:

*‚ÄúFederal  reserve notes, to be issued at the discretion of the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System for the purpose of making advances to  Federal reserve banks through the Federal reserve agents as hereinafter  set forth and for no other purpose, are authorized. Notwithstanding any  other provision of law, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System is* ***authorized to issue digital versions of Federal reserve notes in addition***  *to current physical Federal reserve notes. Further, the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System, after consultation with the  Secretary of the Treasury, is* ***authorized to use distributed ledger technology for the creation, distribution and*** ***recordation of all transactions***  *involving digital Federal reserve notes. The said notes shall be  obligations of the United States and shall be considered legal tender  and shall be receivable by all national and member banks and Federal  reserve banks and for all taxes, customs, and other public dues. They  shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department  of the United States, in the city of Washington, District of Columbia,  or at any Federal Reserve bank.‚Äù* (23)

&amp;#x200B;

## Interpretations on the Future of Money:

* The door is shut for the use of cryptos as legal tender.
* The  Federal Reserve Board is to be authorized to create and distribute a  ledger-based Federal reserve note that could be used for everyday  transactions in USD.
* Digital  federal reserve notes will make the ‚Äúrecordation‚Äù of all transactions  possible. Did they use this word because ‚Äúmonitoring all transactions‚Äù  would be too obvious? Recording all transactions without anyone looking  at them makes no sense.
* These  amendments significantly increase the power of the Federal Reserve.  Contrary to what is widely understood, the Fed does not ‚Äúprint money.‚Äù  It can only manage the money supply indirectly.(24)  The private sector ‚Äúcreates‚Äù most of what we use as money by issuing  credit. It is with the supply of credit by the private banks that the  monetary supply is inflated. Conversely, with the reduced demand for  credit, the money supply deflates. The Fed is not as powerful as it  wants the market to believe, and the Federal Reserve Act restricts a lot  of its actions. This amendment, however, could drastically expand the  authority of the Fed, by allowing them to create and distribute a  ‚Äúdigital USD‚Äù directly. It could change the entire structure of the  financial system and potentially have far reaching consequences.
* The  original idea behind the Federal Reserve was for private bank deposits  to be combined to provide an emergency line of credit in times of  economic stress.(25)  But if the Digital Dollar is based on a blockchain, how can it also be  based on reserves? And what mechanism will determine how funds (and how  much) are added to the economy? And where and how will they be  distributed? What about privacy and security? Will all this authority be  handed over to a board of seven unelected bureaucrats? This amendment  has the potential to change the way the Federal Reserve operates. This  deserves a wider discussion by economists and financial experts outside  the crypto-space as well.

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;International FATF Crypto Regulation Introduced in the US_

Those  paying attention to international anti-money laundering legislation  know that the following sections from the Digital Asset Bill originate  from guidance issued by the FATF (Financial Action Task Force). FATF is  an intra-governmental organization [creating financial legislation](https://decentralizedlegalsystem.com/fatf-bitcoin-regulations-summary/).

In March, the Paris based FATF issued draft guidance(26)  (‚ÄúFATF Guidance‚Äù) on a number of topics. And even though this guidance  hasn‚Äôt been finalized, there are already a number of points directly  included in the Digital Asset Bill.

&amp;#x200B;

## Banning the use of Stablecoins

Subchapter  I of chapter 51 of subtitle IV of title 31, United States Code,  department of treasury regulation, will be amended, to read as follows:

*‚Äú(a) IN GENERAL.‚ÄîBeginning on the date of the enactment of this section,* ***no person may issue, use, or permit to be used a digital asset fiat-based stablecoin*** *that is not approved by the Secretary of the Treasury under subsection (b).‚Äù*(27)

&amp;#x200B;

## Criminalizing the use of privacy coins and anonymizing services (mixers, coinjoins)

The  bank secrecy act is going to be amended to sanction the use of  anonymity-enhanced convertible virtual currencies and anonymizing  services.(28)  It is worth noting that willful violations of the bank secrecy act  could give rise to a fine of not more than $250,000, or imprisoned for  not more than five years, or both.(29)

&amp;#x200B;

## Introduction of the term Virtual Asset Service Provide (VASP) into US Law

As  a next step, the term Virtual Asset will be introduced into Section  5312(a) of title 31, United States Code. A Virtual Asset can be a  digital asset, or *‚Äúa digital representation of value that can be  digitally traded, or transferred, and can be used for payment or  investment purposes;‚Äù*(30)

So  far we have seen a number of definitions. To understand their  relationship, the following image was made based on the definition of  Virtual Asset according to Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States  Code:(31)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9h73a1z879o71.png?width=502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28730b1ce17e8b920d65d9df418c1d9b7be5f0de

&amp;#x200B;

Virtual  Asset is a broad definition; it covers most activities involving  cryptos. We can see in the Digital Asset Bill that entities that are  facilitating transactions in Virtual Assets are to be called ‚Äúvirtual  asset service providers,‚Äù or VASPS. Sec 301 of the Digital Asset Bill  defines a VASP:

*‚Äú(A) means a person who‚Äî*

*(i) exchanges between digital asset and fiat currencies*

*(ii) exchanges between digital assets;*

*(iii) transfers of digital assets;*

*(iv) is responsible for the custody, safekeeping of a digital asset or an instrument that enables control over a digital asset;*

*(v) issues or has the authority to redeem a digital asset; and*

*(vi) provides financial services related to the offer or sale of a digital asset by a person who issues such digital asset; and*

*(B) does not include any person who‚Äî*

*(i) obtains a digital asset to purchase goods or services for themself;*

*(ii) provides communication service or network access services used by a money transmitter; or*

*(iii)  develops, creates, or disseminates software designed to be used to  issue a digital asset or facilitate financial activities associated with  a digital asset.‚Äù* (32)

This  definition comes directly from the FATF Guidance, with the only  difference being that the US excludes the exchange between different  forms of one virtual assets. On the other hand, section (v) is a new  addition.

&amp;#x200B;

## The Big Picture: Global Regulation

The logic  behind this seems to be to first introduce a high-level definition  (including coins regulated as commodities, securities, and everything in  between). Next, any future global restrictions on the wider  crypto-space can be applied at this level.

From the latest FATF  Guidance, a number of possible additional restrictions can already be  deducted. Things to look out for are the restriction of the use of  ‚Äúunhosted wallets,‚Äù the introduction of the ‚Äútravel rule,‚Äù labeling  those who engage in peer-to-peer transactions as a risk, and a whole  host of other measures. (33)

One  additional aspect of VASP regulation mentioned in the FATF Guidance is  also included in the Digital Asset Bill; VASPS engaged in services which  are available in the United States and to United States persons, have  to be regulated in the United States, even if the provider is located  outside the United States. (34)

## Interpretation International Regulation in the US:

* International AML legislation, created by Paris-based FATF, is being introduced in the US.
* The  FATF term ‚Äúvirtual asset service provider‚Äù (VASP) is introduced in the  US. The definition is so broad that it covers practically all crypto  projects.
* After first being  in the FATF Guidance, the banning of stablecoins and anonymity-enhanced  cryptos and the obligation for VASPs to be licensed in the country of  their clients are included in the Digital Asset Bill.
* It  is not hard to imagine that other restrictions for cryptos currently  discussed by FATF, such as the travel rule and restricting unhosted  wallets, will be introduced next. This is not a regulation you introduce  to then never use.
* All VASPs with operating in the US or with US clients need to be regulated in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Amendments in the Infrastructure Bill_

Last  August saw public outcry over the US Infrastructure bill. It included a  section on IRS reporting for crypto. Some highlights:

## Clarification of Definition of Broker

It  makes sense that the tax authorities use a wide definition to cover all  possible economic activities in crypto. Section 80603 of the  Infrastructure Bill amendments the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,  provides that brokers need to report the activity of their clients to  the IRS and adds the following to the definition of broker:

*‚Äú(D)  any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly  providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf  of another person.‚Äù* (35)

## Reporting of Digital Assets

In addition, a unique wide definition of digital assets is added:

*‚Äúany  digital representation of value which is recorded on a  cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology  as specified by the Secretary.‚Äù* (36)

## Effective Date

Effective after December 31, 2023. So there is time.

&amp;#x200B;

## Interpretation Infrastructure Bill

There  was a lot of commotion about this bill. This was mainly due to the wide  definitions used, which could cover all activities in the crypto space,  including mining. In response, according to an article on Bloomberg,  the U.S. treasury will shortly issue additional guidance, along the  lines of the following:

*‚ÄúOther  firms key to the nearly $2 trillion crypto market ‚Äî from developers and  miners to hardware and software providers ‚Äî won‚Äôt have any new  requirements, so long as they don‚Äôt also act as brokers, according to a  Treasury official‚Äù* (37)

At  a glance, it appears that this bill is not as invasive as originally  feared. It would also be impossible to enforce this legislation on  miners due to the nature of the technology.

In this case perhaps  it would have been better if clear definitions were used of what is, and  isn‚Äôt included. Moreover, comments from ‚Äúanonymous sources at the  treasury‚Äù do not provide real regulatory clarity. This industry too  easily accepts the opinions of officials as decree. But we are all,  including officials, subject to the law. Given that officials change  over time, opinions and guidance are not the way forward; clear laws are  needed.

The commotion also distracted from the massive changes  proposed in the Digital Asset Bill discussed in this post, which so  far have been ignored by the industry...

&amp;#x200B;

I added all 37 footnotes here, but the post become to long to post. For those who wish to check the footnotes, they can be found in the PDF version here:

&amp;#x200B;

# &lt;TL;DR_

**Next to the widely discussed infrastructure bill, another bill is pushed through US Congress: the ‚ÄúDigital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act.‚Äù Both are not law yet and non of this is likely to take effect in 2021 (this cycle). And bills can be amended. But stricter regulations are coming for crypto in the US.**

**Bitcoin, Ether, and their hard-forks, are to be regulated as commodities. Smart-contracts taking longer to deliver than 24 hours are considered futures contracts and regulated as such. Futures contracts are subjected to many existing regulations, including to the Dodd-Frank Act and in certain cases filing obligations with a CFTC digital asset trade repository.**

**Every other project and future ICO is potentially a security. This remains to be determined by a joined ruling of the CFTC and SEC, which will likely be issued somewhere in 2022 (270 days after this bill is passed). Issuers of securities are likely required to provide transparency and financial information to investors. Trade is generally restricted to regulated exchanges.**

**In addition, international anti-money laundering legislation is introduced in the US; Stablecoins, privacycoins, and mixers are prohibited. The high-level term VASP is introduced for likely further future regulation. Every US based VASP (or with US clients) has to be regulated (KYC) in the US. VASP regulation covers a large part of crypto projects.**

**Finally, cryptos are specifically excluded as legal tender, and the Federal Reserve Board is authorized to create and distribute a distributed ledger based digital reserve note (CBDC), with ""recordation"" of all transactions.**",cryptocurrency

If the tax rate is the same pre and post-retirement, and if I am investing in the same mutual fund/ETF, does it matter if I pay the tax in the beginning or at the time of withdrawal? (eg., 50% (fed + state) tax at the time of contribution vs 50% tax at the time of withdrawal.)

Put it another way, is it mainly the tax rate at the time of contribution vs withdrawal that makes the difference in the total after-tax return?",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off my private student loan?,Hi all - lurker here. I have almost 100k in cash for a lump sum payment on my private student loan which is 101k at 3.05%. Should I pay this off? Or should I pay off 80% of it invest the rest? For context - I make about 200k a year and im unsure of which direction is the right path as the interest rate is very good for the size of loan - im 28 years old. Im leaning towards paying off 70-80k and keeping 20k at 3.05% and or refinancing down for a lower %. Thoughts?,finance
CryptoCurrency,"US officials are attacking Tether and Binance again, official investigation started","Is this FUD?

The Officials are the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Justice as well as the CFTC.They have begun investigating Binance (source of BUSD stablecoin) for ""insider trading"" , ""market manipulation"" and they are ""gathering witnesses"".

So seems like they are building up a case.

Binance is an exchange where a lot of crypto derivatives takes place. It is also has its own stablecoins to faciliate that.  Vast majority of trading in crypto is done through derivatives.

And of course, we all know how the FED and Janet Yellen feel about crypto and stablecoins. (They are going to clamp down on it).

[source](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/118040/us-officials-now-investigating-binance-for-potential-insider-trading-market-manipulation-report) for attack on Binance.

personalfinance,Lease EV - has anyone made the trade?,"Considering leasing an EV, mainly to get an HOV sticker to save time and reduce traffic-related stress (saving on fuel and toll $$ is a small bonus). I commute daily, hitting less than 10k miles per year. The dealership would get the $7500 federal tax incentive and factor it into the lease. There is also another $1500 incentive (unsure if this goes to me or them). They‚Äôre quoting me ~$500/mo for a 36 month lease. This is with only taxes/fees down. 

My current car costs about $200/mo in gas and $120/mo on tolls. It‚Äôs got less than a year left on the loan ($350/mo) and is worth about $18-20k, gauging comps on dealership sites and Craigslist. Leased car would cost estimated $50/mo in electricity and $60/mo in tolls, and save me 40+ minutes a day in commute time. 

So I‚Äôm increasing my monthly costs (doable with my income/expenses) but will have the car sale cash to invest. There will be the option to buy after the lease is up. The cost of financing for 60 months was about $100 more than the lease with the value of my trade in. One of the hesitations with financing is that I‚Äôd lose the HOV sticker after 3 years (could potentially switch to a new EV after the lease and get a new sticker). I‚Äôm also wondering if the EV market will be more saturated in 3 years with increased affordability for purchase. 

Has anyone made this trade? I fucking hate sitting in traffic everyday.",finance

personalfinance,Savings and retirement,"Hey guys, I just need some opinions! 

I'm 28 years old, and my wife and I have a combined income of 120k about. We just got done paying off her 100k of student loans and we bought a house about a month ago, so we have a mortgage of about 270k.  Our interest rate is 2.75%

I'm a federal employee, so I have 4.5% taken out for my pension, as well as 5% for tsp (401k) and I get 5% from the match. I just started a few months ago, and unfortunately that's my only retirement savings. Our only debt is the mortgage. 

Right now it's just the 2 of us, but eventually we plan on having a family and in that case we'll need a bigger house. Should we save up money to get ready for a bigger down payment in 3-5 years, pay more towards the mortgage, or pay more towards retirement? I feel like the best answer is a little bit of all 3, but I'm not exactly sure where the split should be. 

I know if we pay down the mortgage faster we will also in a way be saving for a house from the equity, but then I worry that if the housing market takes a hit, I'd much rather have that money liquid vs in a house that went down in value or is hard to sell. 

I feel like I'm way behind on my retirement savings, but I really wanted to get the student loans paid off. Most of them were private, so we were paying around 6% for some",finance
personalfinance,Complicated car buying decision...,"I'm moving in about a month from a major city where I don't own a car to a smaller town where I will need a car. I plan to buy/acquire a new ev once the expected federal ev rebate kicks in in 2022 (and the car is delivered six months later due to backlog).

So I won't receive the ev for around a year and I'll need a different car to hold me over. Under any normal circumstances this would be an obvious used car purchase situation and that's what I'm planning to buy. In particular, I'm planning to buy a used SUV so that I can use it to move my belongings and save on a moving van.

But given that used car inflation is much higher than new car inflation right now the situation is not exactly clearcut. The used model and years I'm looking at are between 16k and 18k which is about 30% above where they would be if they'd depreciated normally over the past two years (the avg price was 15.5k two years ago and these cars normally depreciate 10% per year).  Meanwhile, the new car I would buy is expected to depreciate 13% in its first year according to [caredge.com](https://caredge.com) (though that number is probably high because i don't think their data factors in current inflation). Also the new car I'm looking at I've found priced between invoice and msrp at $27k, so there is little inflation on this particular model.

So there are a few scenarios:

1. i buy the used car, used car inflation stays the same for a year, and i sell it at a minimal loss (mostly tax/title/registration of about $2k)
2. i buy the used car, inflation disappears, and the prices suddenly fall by 30% to about 5k less than what i paid for it (so i lose 5k + the tax/title/registration that i paid = about 7k)
3. i buy the new car and sell it a year later for about 4k less plus ttl = about 7k

Some related facts:

1. i'll be saving about 1k a month on rent in the new location
2. My salary isn't changing
3. i'm planning to buy the car before i move because my belongings will fit in a typical suv and moving vans are extremely expensive right now at between 1500 and 2k for the 1-week trip i'd need to use one for.

Other options:

1. greatly lower my standards on what used car i'm purchasing and buy something with $150k miles-ish on it for much much less.
2. pay for the moving van, buy a bicycle and wait out the year without a car.

CryptoCurrency,Has anyone else tried Gemini as a savings option over traditional bank (because of the 8%)?,"I am curious if anyone is using the Gemini coin as their savings account. I saw this was implemented a while ago and has an 8% average apy which seemed crazy but apparently banks can offer much higher interest rates and don‚Äôt. Right now my bank gives literally .5% and I know some banks might even go negative (like in UK). 

I know everything has risks especially crypto but as I understand it the coin is supposed to be a stable coin pegged to the value of the usd. So my questions would be as follows;

1) has anyone moved any money into this coin for their more ‚Äúliquid‚Äù savings (savings not meant to be spent but could be in an emergency). If so, how do you feel about the experience so far? Do you feel of you needed to liquidate in an emergency you could?

2) is the 8% really a savings account or was this just more of good marketing to incentivize what is essentially a staking reward?

3) how has customer service been? Ultimately I don‚Äôt use Gemini to trade because I found issues with sign up and customer service was terrible. They didn‚Äôt respond quickly and my account was unusable and Coinbase was just easier. 

I love the idea of this in concept but these are my emergency funds in case of true bad life event so I want to be cautious.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Comparing two jobs, which would you take?","Single, early 30s, investing heavy into retirement (max 401k + IRA) to hopefully retire early. Two jobs to pick from (assume benefits not listed are roughly equal):  

1) $105k salary, 100% matching up to 6%, 160hrs PTO *given at beginning of year* with additional ""unlimited"" time off if work is getting completed. Work is in my desired long-term career field, but the actual work doesn't really excite me. Roughly 60/40 remote/in-office weekly so any time away from ""home"" must include using some PTO.  

2) $95k salary, 100% matching up to 5%, 160hrs PTO *accumulated throughout the year*. Work is in my desired long-term career field, *and* the actual work is a better fit for my specialties *plus* something I want to be doing longer-term. 100% remote so I can travel almost anywhere without using PTO so long as I can work 8hrs daily (which does require internet). Job stability is also notably better federal job) and comes with a pension if I stay long enough (20 years, can start drawing at 65). 

For an additional kicker, I started working job 1 already and haven't been there super long, as I was waiting for job 2 to come through. So I would be quitting &lt;6mo from starting job 1 which I don't like the thought of doing (and would probably be let go the moment I give a 2-weeks notice, but financially that isn't an issue at all). My gut is telling me job 2....even with the lower salary and matching it has more potential to keep me happy for a longer time and has a more defined/stable progression, albeit at a lower potential maximum salary.  

Clearly a personal decision (as is *personal* finance), but given the above info (or ask for more!) what path would you choose?  

**EDIT: Thanks for the replies, I think job 2 will be the choice to make given the overall situation and closeness of relevant benefits.**",finance
CryptoCurrency,PSA : ALERT Coin base Wallet Suggested Address Scam,"So This is a post about how I got my Wallet drained.  While attempting to move money from my Coinbase Wallet into my Coinbase Exchange account.

Coinbase must remove the suggested address feature to prevent people from losing their money. 

Pour one out for the stack of Matic lost due to my stupidity.


Edit : so everyone saying why I did not triple check the UI on the phone does not show the address so I could not check. And right now my wallet is hijacked so no activity shows up and all funds transfer in to my address no longer shows.  I should have stuck to metamask but I thought it would have been easier on Coinbase. So let me be the last guy to fall for this shit leave Coinbase wallet if you use it.

personalfinance,Should I get my house re-appraised?,"Hi everybody, I hope you‚Äôre feeling prosperous. TLDR at the bottom. In March 2020 I bought my current house for $180,000. I live the southeastern United States. I made a $40,000 down payment and got a 3.75% interest rate, but unfortunately my dear mortgage company insisted that I do an FHA loan. This requires me to pay mortgage insurance. This is not ideal. 

At the time that I purchased the house, it was valued at $210,000. The seller was keen to get rid of it, as it was their deceased parents home. The house had fallen into what I would call light disrepair: no major structural issues, but in need of paint, a new deck, new floors, and just a general update throughout. I am a skilled handyman, so I immediately jumped into the renovations. I‚Äôve replaced the deck, I have torn up the pink shag carpet and replaced it with solid walnut flooring, and I have started updating the kitchen and bathrooms. However I am not finished. On budget and on schedule, but it‚Äôs a large house (5,000 sq ft) and so there‚Äôs lots to do. 

Here‚Äôs where my question comes in. The company I‚Äôm currently working for will be closing in December of this year, and I will be starting my own business. I‚Äôm very excited, but I know that mortgage companies are not fond of working with folks who are self employed. I‚Äôm feeling the pressure to refinance while I am still gainfully employed; for one to get rid of that mortgage insurance, but I would also like to get some cash out of my loan to use on more renovations. I have determined that this makes sense for me because of the other comparable properties in my area. I believe that I can double the value of my home for about $100,000 on top of my purchase price ($180,000 + $100,000). After the work, I hope it will be worth around $400,000. 

Should I try to get the house revalued when I refinance? Like I said, it is still a work in progress but what I have accomplished so far has certainly raised the value a little bit (from $210,000). I assume this would give me a better equity position. 

TLDR: On a time crunch, have house in the middle of renovations, want better loan terms, and I believe it‚Äôs worth more than it is currently valued. Should I refinance and get re-appraised?

personalfinance,Should I lengthen my mortgage and borrow more to invest?,"Wondering what people think about this strategy

I've got 2 x mortgages, 1 maturing in 20 years, 1 in 28 years, total loans are about $650k.  My house is worth about $2 million, so I've got 65% equity.

I'm considering refinancing them to 30 years loans and borrowing a little extra ($50k) and putting that extra money, and all the extra money i'll save from lower repayments into index funds.  I also have more cash i've saved on top of an emergency fund which I'll keep.

I see the risks as interest rates going up - well I've calculated I can afford the repayments for about a 3-4% rise in interest rates.

Another risk is market crash, well I can wait it out, I don't need the money, I've got the emergency fund.

Historically the market out performs interest rates over long periods so it just seems to make sense.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

- Use Kafka/RabbitMQ as an internal service mediator
- Make API Gateway configurable(for cloud like AWS/Azure or OSS tools like Kong/Tyk/WSO2APIM)

personalfinance,Financing solar panels,"I just received a quote to install a 5.250-killowat solar power system and battery. After federal incentives for solar panel system my electricity bill will drop from \~$200 a month to $118.55.

I don't have a down payment and my interest is 0% with a $3,000 finance charge for 25 years. The $3,000 finance charge is offset by choosing autopay at a $10 a month discount over the 300 payments.

From what I've read, several have made mention of the importance of breaking even quickly so that the system pays for itself and begins turning a profit, and if I did put up the money and incentives towards it, it would break even in 14.5 years.

So I am comparing paying $48,000 in cash and recuperating incentives the following year, bringing the total down to approximately $30,500, and saving approximately $2100 a year on my electric bill - which begins making money after 14.5 years - or putting up nothing and receiving a discounted monthly payment for 25 years and then hopefully a little more after that if the system still works.

Is my logic correct in this or am I missing something? And if correct, which option seems like a better one?",finance
Bitcoin,New Shocking US Crypto Regulation Far More Invasive [Due Diligence],"# New US Crypto Regulation Far More Invasive Than We Thought

**US Congress intends to regulate crypto on a level far deeper  than currently understood‚ÄïThey will:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Designate Bitcoin, Ether, and their hard-forks as commodities and regulate their transactions accordingly;
* Create legal uncertainty for all other crypto projects and ICOs by allowing them to be labeled as securities;
* Ban the use of (unauthorized) stablecoins;
* Introduce penalties for the use of mixers and privacy coins;
* Rebrand smart-contracts that take longer than 24 hours to deliver as futures contracts and regulate them accordingly;
* Re-define legal tender and change the way money is created by the Federal Reserve; and authorize the issuing of a digital USD of which all transactions are recorded;
* Introduce foreign regulations into US law for all virtual asset service providers in the US (and with US clients). This would not be done to then never use it.

&amp;#x200B;

**In short: Congress wants to bring crypto-currencies under full oversight and control.**

These new regulations introduce massive regulatory burdens on existing projects, ban and criminalize current normal activities, restrain innovation and free enterprise, and even introduce a transparent central bank digital digital currency that redefines money as we know it!

According to United States representative Don Beyer, congress should incorporate ‚Äúdigital assets into existing financial regulatory structures.‚Äù(1) As you will see, they intend to do just that.

And it will change the way things are done for crypto forever‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;What This Post Is About_

This post provides an overview of the crypto legislation currently (September 2021) being put through US congress.

It does not just look at the proposed bills, but rather at the wide range of laws that are to be amended.

Once all the puzzle pieces are put together, the big picture reveals shockingly strict regulations of crypto and a complete overhaul of the idea of ‚Äúmoney.‚Äù This could have serious effects not only on the crypto sector, but also on the financial system as a whole.

Behind the excuses of preventing money laundering and ensuring investor protection, the use of crypto is transformed in something it was not supposed to be. Especially delicate is the fact that part of this legislation is drafted outside the US.

***Disclaimer***\*: This report provides a high-level overview of the US laws that are to be introduced/amended by two new bills. Its depth is limited by the inadequate knowledge of the author of the large body of US law involved, and given that these bills are subject to amendments and have not even passed into law yet, none of this information can be considered legal or financial advice.\*

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;What Is Going On?

On April 06, 2021, a ‚Äúmust pass‚Äù bill was introduced called the ‚ÄúInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act‚Äù(2) (‚ÄúInfrastructure Bill‚Äù). It passed in the House of Representatives and, after fierce debate, the Senate. Hidden in this bill, an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code was added. It introduced new reporting requirements and obligations for record keeping.

While this bill created a lot of public outcry, more recently, a real game-changing bill was introduced in the House on July 28, 2021, namely the: ‚ÄúDigital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act‚Äù (3) (‚ÄúDigital Asset Bill‚Äù).

This bill proposes amendments to the Federal Reserve Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, Securities Exchanges Acts, and the Commodity Exchange Act. It changes the definition of legal tender, and it introduces international crypto regulation into US law.

This article looks at each of these amendments‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Commodities or Securities?_

The main take-away is that two different bodies of law will apply to crypto projects: commodities and securities laws. So far, only Bitcoin, Ether, and their hard-forks are confirmed to be commodities (see below). All other cryptos are subject to future guidance by market regulators:

*‚ÄúNot later than 150 days after the date of the enactment of this section, the SEC and CFTC shall jointly publish, for purposes of a 60-day public comment period, a proposed rulemaking that classifies each of the major digital assets.*

***Not later than 270 days after the date of the enactment of this Act***\*, the SEC and CFTC shall jointly publish a final rule that classifies\* ***each of the top 25 major digital assets*** *by (i) highest market capitalization and (ii) highest daily average trading volume as‚Äî*

*(1) a digital asset; or(2) a digital asset security.‚Äù* (4)

&amp;#x200B;

## Interpretation:

* Cryptos will be subject to two different regulatory regimes: commodities and security regulations.
* Services engaged with both digital assets (commodities) and digital asset securities (securities) could be subjected to both regulatory regimes.

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Commodities Regulation_

The Commodity Exchange Act regulates the trading of commodity futures in the United States. Passed in 1936, it has been amended several times since then.(5) It provides federal regulation of all commodities and futures trading activities and requires all futures and commodity options to be traded on organized exchanges.

In 1974, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) was created to oversee the market. With certain exceptions, the CFTC has been granted exclusive jurisdiction over commodity futures, options, and all other derivatives that fall within the definition of a swap. Certain cryptos will be regulated as commodities.

&amp;#x200B;

## Definition of ‚ÄúCommodity‚Äù Amended to Include Digital Asset:

First and foremost, Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act on definitions will be amended to read as follows:

*‚Äú****The term ‚Äúcommodity‚Äù means*** *wheat, cotton, rice, corn, oats, barley, rye, flaxseed, grain sorghums, mill feeds, butter, eggs, Solanum tuberosum (Irish potatoes), wool, wool tops, fats and oils (including lard, tallow, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, and all other fats and oils), cottonseed meal, cottonseed, peanuts, soybeans, soybean meal, livestock, livestock products,* ***digital asset (including Bitcoin, Ether, and their hardforks)****, and frozen concentrated orange juice, and all other goods and articles, except onions (as provided by section 13‚Äì1 of this title) and motion picture box office receipts (or any index, measure, value, or data related to such receipts), and all services, rights, and interests (except motion picture box office receipts, or any index, measure, value or data related to such receipts) in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.‚Äù*(6)

&amp;#x200B;

## Digital Asset Definition

Next, the end of Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act will be amended by adding a clarification of what a digital asset is (7)(definition to long to post here)

&amp;#x200B;

## Smart Contracts with Delivery Time of More than 24 hours are Futures Contracts

A sharpening of the definition of retail commodity transactions could  decrease the options for the use of smart contracts outside of regulated  exchanges.

Currently, Section 2(c)(2)(D)(i) of the Commodity Exchange Act prohibits persons that are not *‚Äúeligible contract participants‚Äù* or *‚Äúeligible commercial entities‚Äù*  to engage in agreements, contract or transactions in commodities on  leverage, margin, or financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a  person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a similar  basis.(8)

Next,  additional amendments mentioned in the SEC. 202 of the Digital Asset  Bill applies this on transactions done by smart contract of which the  delivery takes longer than 24 hours:

*‚Äú(ii) ‚ÄÇExceptions*

*(III)‚ÄÇa contract of sale that‚Äì*

*(cc)  with respect to* ***digital assets***\*, results in\* ***actual delivery*** *(including  transfer of control over private keys) n****ot later than 24 hours after the  transaction is entered into*** *and such delivery is accomplished by  either-*

*(AA) recording the transaction on the public distributed ledger for the digital asset; or*

*(BB)  with respect to digital which are not recorded on a public distributed  ledger for the digital asset, reporting the transaction to a CFTC  registered digital asset trade repository; or‚Äù* (9)

&amp;#x200B;

## Dodd-Frank Act and Market Transparency

After  the 2008 financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act introduced strict  regulations for swaps. Naturally, these will also apply to digital  assets as well.

The definition of swaps, as provided by the  Commodity Exchange Act (section 1a(47)) is broad. For example, it could  refer to any ‚Äúagreement, contract or transaction‚Äù that ‚Äúprovides for any  purchase, sale, payment, or delivery that is dependent on the  occurrence, nonoccurrence, or the extent of the occurrence of an event  or contingency associated with a potential financial, economic, or  commercial consequence.‚Äù (10)

## Next, the Dodd-Frank bill authorizes the CFTC to:

* Regulate  swap dealers by installing capital and margin requirements, require  dealers to meet robust business conduct standards, and meet  recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
* Increase  transparency and improve pricing in the derivatives marketplace by  requiring standardized derivatives to be traded on regulated exchanges  or swap execution facilities and bring better pricing to the market  place and lower costs for businesses and consumers.
* Lower risk to the American public by moving standardized derivatives to central clearinghouses.(11)

&amp;#x200B;

## Digital Asset Trade Repository

To  meet the above mentioned market transparency requirement, the Commodity  Exchange Act stipulates the need for a digital asset trade repository  to collect information on SWAPS in order to provide the public with the  correct market information:

*‚ÄúThe  term ‚Äòdigital asset trade repository‚Äô means any person that collects and  maintains information or records with respect to transactions or  positions in, or the terms and conditions of, contracts of sale of  digital assets in interstate commerce entered into by third parties  (both on chain public distributed ledger transactions as well as off  chain transactions) for the purpose of providing a centralized  recordkeeping facility for any digital asset, but does not include a  private or public distributed ledger or the operator of either such  ledger unless such private or public distributed ledger or operator  seeks to aggregate/include ‚Äòoff chain‚Äô transactions as well.‚Äù* (12)

&amp;#x200B;

## Interpretation Commodities Regulations:

* As  of writing, only BTC and Ether (and their hard-forks) will be confirmed  as commodities. All other cryptos could potentially be regulated as securities (what this means is explained next).
* The fact that novel technologies such as Bitcoin and Ether are to be  subjected to a large body of law that developed around the trading of  livestock and frozen concentrated orange juice could spell regulatory  uncertainty for various business models in the industry.
* No  ‚Äútrading on margin‚Äù is allowed outside regulated entities, unless done  by high-level investors called ‚Äúeligible contract parties.‚Äù This could  perhaps frustrate particular ideas about decentralized finance or OTC  markets.
* Smart contracts  that take longer than 24 hours to deliver could be considered futures  contracts under the jurisdiction of the CFTC. That smart contracts can  be labeled as futures contracts appears indeed to be the opinion of the  CFTC.(13)

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Securities Regulations_

In  the US, securities are regulated by the 1933 Securities Act.  Additionally, the 1934 Securities Exchange Act further regulates the  trade of securities, and established the SEC to oversee these markets.

## Definition of ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù Amended to Include Digital Asset Security:

First  and foremost, Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act will be  amended to include a ‚Äúdigital asset security‚Äù (and exclude ‚Äúdigital  assets‚Äù) in the definition of security:

*‚Äú(10)* ***The term ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù means***  *any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap,  bond, debenture, certificate of interest or participation in any  profit-sharing agreement or in any oil, gas, or other mineral royalty or  lease, any collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or  subscription, transferable share, investment contract,* ***digital asset security***\*,  voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, any  put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate  of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest  therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle,  option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange  relating to foreign currency, or in general, any instrument commonly  known as a ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù; or any certificate of interest or participation  in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, or warrant or  right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing;\* ***but shall not include any fiat currency, commodity, digital asset***\*,  or any note, draft, bill of exchange, or banker‚Äôs acceptance which has a  maturity at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months,  exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity of which  is likewise limited.‚Äù\* (14)

## Digital Asset Security Definition

Next, the Digital Asset Bill (SEC. 101) defines what a digital asset security will be:

*‚Äú(A) IN GENERAL.‚ÄîThe term ‚Äòdigital asset security‚Äô means a digital asset that:*

*(i) Provides the holder of the digital asset with any of the following rights:*

*(I) Equity or debt interest in the issuer.*

*(II) Right to profits, interest, or dividend payments from the issuer.*

*(III)  Voting rights in the major corporate actions (which shall not include  new block creations, hardforks, or protocol changes related to the  digital asset) of the issuer.*

*(IV) Liquidation rights in the event of the issuer‚Äôs liquidation.*

*(ii)  In the case of an issuer with a service, goods, or platform that is not  wholly operational at the time of issuing such digital asset, with  respect to* ***any fundraising or capital formation activity (including initial coin offerings***\*)  which is accomplished through the issuance of such a digital asset,  issues such digital asset to a holder in return for money (including  other digital assets) to fund the development of the proposed service,  goods, or platform of the issuer.‚Äù\* (15)

&amp;#x200B;

## What does it mean to be regulated as a security?

Investing in securities in the US is regulated to:

*‚Äúprotect  interstate commerce, the national credit, the Federal taxing power, to  protect and make more effective the national banking system and Federal  Reserve System, and to insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets  in such transactions.‚Äù* (16)

Regulations  focus on both the issuing of securities (primary market), and  subsequent trade of such securities (secondary market).

The goal  of securities laws is firstly to require issuers to fully disclose all  material information that an investor would need in order to make up his  or her mind about the potential investment. A regulated company must  create a registration statement, which includes a prospectus, with  copious amounts of information about the security, the company, the  business, including audited financial statements.

Next, the  subsequent selling and trading in these securities is regulated, by restricting trade to market places over which the regulator has  oversight. The Security Exchange Act section ¬ß78l(a) states:

*‚ÄúIt  shall be unlawful for any member, broker, or dealer to effect any  transaction in any security (other than an exempted security) on a  national securities exchange unless a registration is effective as to  such security for such exchange in accordance with the provisions of  this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder.‚Äù* (17)

&amp;#x200B;

## Summary of Securities Regulations:

* Crypto projects will need to be regulated and provide clear financial information for investors to make an informed decision.
* Trading of securities will generally take place on regulated exchanges.
* Any new fundraising or capital formation activity (including ICOs) are likely to be securities.
* When  a crypto is regulated as a security, the entire coin is subject to strict regulations. In the case of commodities, only specific use cases  (futures) are regulated. It is a big difference.
* US  Congress is taking a leap of faith. It needs identifiable persons to enforce a law upon. Who is going to be held accountable in a decentralized network? Many issuing companies have handed control over to network participants. Perhaps for this reason, Section 12(g) of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 will be amended to allow the issuer to apply for ‚Äúdesecuritization.‚Äù (18)  The question remains: who will apply for desecuritization once a  network is decentralized? The investors? Weren‚Äôt they the ones supposed  to be protected in the first place?

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Changing the Nature of Money_

These  regulations are not just about crypto. It is clearly part of a wider discussion on the future of money. As shown below, this bill not only  changes the definition of money in the US, but also changes how money is  created!

As a first, in Section 5312(a)(3)(B) of title 31, US  Code (Money and Finance) digital assets are included as a monetary  instrument.(19)  However, Section 5103, of title 31, US Code will be amended to  specifically exclude digital assets and digital asset securities as  legal tender.(20)  And finally, it is determined that digital assets and digital asset securities will not be covered by Federal Deposit Insurance (FDIC or  NCUA).(21)

&amp;#x200B;

## Introducing the Digital USD (or Central Bank Digital Currency/CBDC)

After  slamming the door on digital assets to be used as lawful money, the  Federal Reserve Act is amended to provide the Federal Reserve Board with  far reaching new powers; section 11 will be amended to say:

*‚Äú(d) To supervise and regulate through the Secretary of the Treasury the issue and retirement of Federal Reserve notes (****both physical and digital****),  except for the cancellation and destruction, and accounting with  respect to such cancellation and destruction, of notes unfit for  circulation, and to prescribe rules and regulations (****including appropriate technology****) under which such notes may be delivered by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Federal Reserve agents applying therefor.‚Äù* (22)

In addition, Federal Reserve notes will in the future also be issued digitally; an amendment to section 16 confirms this:

*‚ÄúFederal  reserve notes, to be issued at the discretion of the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System for the purpose of making advances to  Federal reserve banks through the Federal reserve agents as hereinafter  set forth and for no other purpose, are authorized. Notwithstanding any  other provision of law, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System is* ***authorized to issue digital versions of Federal reserve notes in addition***  *to current physical Federal reserve notes. Further, the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System, after consultation with the  Secretary of the Treasury, is* ***authorized to use distributed ledger technology for the creation, distribution and*** ***recordation of all transactions***  *involving digital Federal reserve notes. The said notes shall be  obligations of the United States and shall be considered legal tender  and shall be receivable by all national and member banks and Federal  reserve banks and for all taxes, customs, and other public dues. They  shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department  of the United States, in the city of Washington, District of Columbia,  or at any Federal Reserve bank.‚Äù* (23)

&amp;#x200B;

## Interpretations on the Future of Money:

* The door is shut for the use of cryptos as legal tender.
* The  Federal Reserve Board is to be authorized to create and distribute a  ledger-based Federal reserve note that could be used for everyday  transactions in USD.
* Digital  federal reserve notes will make the ‚Äúrecordation‚Äù of all transactions  possible. Did they use this word because ‚Äúmonitoring all transactions‚Äù  would be too obvious? Recording all transactions without anyone looking  at them makes no sense.
* These  amendments significantly increase the power of the Federal Reserve.  Contrary to what is widely understood, the Fed does not ‚Äúprint money.‚Äù  It can only manage the money supply indirectly.(24)  The private sector ‚Äúcreates‚Äù most of what we use as money by issuing  credit. It is with the supply of credit by the private banks that the  monetary supply is inflated. Conversely, with the reduced demand for  credit, the money supply deflates. The Fed is not as powerful as it  wants the market to believe, and the Federal Reserve Act restricts a lot  of its actions. This amendment, however, could drastically expand the  authority of the Fed, by allowing them to create and distribute a  ‚Äúdigital USD‚Äù directly. It could change the entire structure of the  financial system and potentially have far reaching consequences.
* The  original idea behind the Federal Reserve was for private bank deposits  to be combined to provide an emergency line of credit in times of  economic stress.(25)  But if the Digital Dollar is based on a blockchain, how can it also be  based on reserves? And what mechanism will determine how funds (and how  much) are added to the economy? And where and how will they be  distributed? What about privacy and security? Will all this authority be  handed over to a board of seven unelected bureaucrats? This amendment  has the potential to change the way the Federal Reserve operates. This  deserves a wider discussion by economists and financial experts outside  the crypto-space as well.

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;International FATF Crypto Regulation Introduced in the US_

Those  paying attention to international anti-money laundering legislation  know that the following sections from the Digital Asset Bill originate  from guidance issued by the FATF (Financial Action Task Force). FATF is  an intra-governmental organization [creating financial legislation](https://decentralizedlegalsystem.com/fatf-bitcoin-regulations-summary/).

In March, the Paris based FATF issued draft guidance(26)  (‚ÄúFATF Guidance‚Äù) on a number of topics. And even though this guidance  hasn‚Äôt been finalized, there are already a number of points directly  included in the Digital Asset Bill.

&amp;#x200B;

## Banning the use of Stablecoins

Subchapter  I of chapter 51 of subtitle IV of title 31, United States Code,  department of treasury regulation, will be amended, to read as follows:

*‚Äú(a) IN GENERAL.‚ÄîBeginning on the date of the enactment of this section,* ***no person may issue, use, or permit to be used a digital asset fiat-based stablecoin*** *that is not approved by the Secretary of the Treasury under subsection (b).‚Äù*(27)

&amp;#x200B;

## Criminalizing the use of privacy coins and anonymizing services (mixers, coinjoins)

The  bank secrecy act is going to be amended to sanction the use of  anonymity-enhanced convertible virtual currencies and anonymizing  services.(28)  It is worth noting that willful violations of the bank secrecy act  could give rise to a fine of not more than $250,000, or imprisoned for  not more than five years, or both.(29)

&amp;#x200B;

## Introduction of the term Virtual Asset Service Provide (VASP) into US Law

Next, the term Virtual Asset will be introduced into Section  5312(a) of title 31, United States Code. A Virtual Asset can be a  digital asset, or *‚Äúa digital representation of value that can be  digitally traded, or transferred, and can be used for payment or  investment purposes;‚Äù*(30)

So  far we have seen a number of definitions. To understand their  relationship, the following image was made based on the definition of  Virtual Asset according to Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States  Code:(31)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/buzs5az1dro71.png?width=502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b1726f091d09a7749d85d8e44af6ea8f5e45b7d

&amp;#x200B;

Virtual  Asset is a broad definition; it covers most activities involving  cryptos. We can see in the Digital Asset Bill that entities that are  facilitating transactions in Virtual Assets are to be called ‚Äúvirtual  asset service providers,‚Äù or VASPS. Sec 301 of the Digital Asset Bill  defines a VASP:

*‚Äú(A) means a person who‚Äî*

*(i) exchanges between digital asset and fiat currencies*

*(ii) exchanges between digital assets;*

*(iii) transfers of digital assets;*

*(iv) is responsible for the custody, safekeeping of a digital asset or an instrument that enables control over a digital asset;*

*(v) issues or has the authority to redeem a digital asset; and*

*(vi) provides financial services related to the offer or sale of a digital asset by a person who issues such digital asset; and*

*(B) does not include any person who‚Äî*

*(i) obtains a digital asset to purchase goods or services for themself;*

*(ii) provides communication service or network access services used by a money transmitter; or*

*(iii)  develops, creates, or disseminates software designed to be used to  issue a digital asset or facilitate financial activities associated with  a digital asset.‚Äù* (32)

This  definition comes directly from the FATF Guidance, with the only  difference being that the US excludes the exchange between different  forms of one virtual assets. On the other hand, section (v) is a new  addition.

&amp;#x200B;

## The Big Picture: Global Regulation

The logic  behind this seems to be to first introduce a high-level definition  (including coins regulated as commodities, securities, and everything in  between). Next, any future global restrictions on the wider  crypto-space can be applied at this level.

From the latest FATF  Guidance, a number of possible additional restrictions can already be  deducted. Things to look out for are the restriction of the use of  ‚Äúunhosted wallets,‚Äù the introduction of the ‚Äútravel rule,‚Äù labeling  those who engage in peer-to-peer transactions as a risk, and a whole  host of other measures. (33)

One  additional aspect of VASP regulation mentioned in the FATF Guidance is  also included in the Digital Asset Bill; VASPS engaged in services which  are available in the United States and to United States persons, have  to be regulated in the United States, even if the provider is located  outside the United States. (34)

## Interpretation International Regulation in the US:

* International AML legislation, created by Paris-based FATF, is being introduced in the US.
* The  FATF term ‚Äúvirtual asset service provider‚Äù (VASP) is introduced in the  US. The definition is so broad that it covers practically all crypto  projects.
* After first being  in the FATF Guidance, the banning of stablecoins and anonymity-enhanced  cryptos and the obligation for VASPs to be licensed in the country of  their clients are included in the Digital Asset Bill.
* It  is not hard to imagine that other restrictions for cryptos currently  discussed by FATF, such as the travel rule and restricting unhosted  wallets, will be introduced next. This is not a regulation you introduce  to then never use.
* All VASPs with operating in the US or with US clients need to be regulated in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Amendments in the Infrastructure Bill_

Last  August saw public outcry over the US Infrastructure bill. It included a  section on IRS reporting for crypto. Some highlights:

## Clarification of Definition of Broker

It  makes sense that the tax authorities use a wide definition to cover all  possible economic activities in crypto. Section 80603 of the  Infrastructure Bill amendments the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,  provides that brokers need to report the activity of their clients to  the IRS and adds the following to the definition of broker:

*‚Äú(D)  any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly  providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf  of another person.‚Äù* (35)

## Reporting of Digital Assets

In addition, a unique wide definition of digital assets is added:

*‚Äúany  digital representation of value which is recorded on a  cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology  as specified by the Secretary.‚Äù* (36)

## Effective Date

Effective after December 31, 2023.

&amp;#x200B;

## Interpretation Infrastructure Bill

Commotion about this bill was mainly due to the wide definitions used, which could cover all activities in the crypto space,  including mining. In response, according to an article on Bloomberg,  the U.S. treasury will shortly issue additional guidance, along the  lines of the following:

*‚ÄúOther  firms key to the nearly $2 trillion crypto market ‚Äî from developers and  miners to hardware and software providers ‚Äî won‚Äôt have any new  requirements, so long as they don‚Äôt also act as brokers, according to a  Treasury official‚Äù* (37)

At  a glance, it appears that this bill is not as invasive as originally  feared. It would also be impossible to enforce this legislation on  miners due to the nature of the technology.

In this case perhaps it would have been better if clear definitions were used of what is, and  isn‚Äôt included. Moreover, comments from ‚Äúanonymous sources at the  treasury‚Äù do not provide real regulatory clarity. This industry too easily accepts the opinions of officials as decree. But we are all,  including officials, subject to the law. Given that officials change over time, opinions and guidance are not the way forward; clear laws are needed.

# &lt;TL;DR_

**Next to the infrastructure bill, a new bill was introduced in US Congress: the ‚ÄúDigital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act.‚Äù It is not law yet, could still be amended, and if it ever comes into effect it will likely not be this year/cycle. What it says:**

**Bitcoin, Ether, and their hard-forks, are to be regulated as commodities. Smart-contracts taking longer to deliver than 24 hours are considered futures contracts and regulated as such.**

**Every other project and future ICO is potentially a security; guidance will be issued by CFTC/SEC. Issuers of securities are likely required to provide transparency and financial information to investors. Trade is generally restricted to regulated exchanges.**

**In addition, international anti-money laundering legislation is introduced in the US; (unauthorized) Stablecoins, privacycoins, and mixers are to be prohibited. The high-level term VASP is introduced for almost all crypto projects, possibly to facilitate more future regulations.**

**Finally, the Federal Reserve gets shocking new powers to create and distribute a central bank digital currency (CBDC), of which all transactions are recorded.**

CryptoCurrency,Facebook exec says stablecoins 'probably' require more regulation,"SEC Chair Gary Gensler put forward a¬†wide-ranging view of potential cryptocurrency regulation¬†at a Senate hearing this week, saying that a type of digital asset called stablecoins may be considered a security.

The comments come as the Treasury Department works with other federal agencies to¬†draft a report by next month on potential regulations¬†for stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency that pegs its value to a commodity or currency, like the U.S. dollar.

New rules could draw support from a top industry player, Facebook's (FB) David Marcus, who has spearheaded the tech giant's soon-to-launch digital wallet called Novi. Marcus also sits on the board of the Diem Association, a coalition of corporate and non-profit members that aim to bring out a stablecoin called Diem that will be exchanged over the new digital wallet from Facebook.

In a new interview, taped prior to Gensler's comments on Tuesday, Marcus told Yahoo Finance stablecoins ""probably"" will require additional regulation, which should focus on consumer protection as well as the prevention of illegal payments like money laundering.

""Do we need more regulation?"" says Marcus, head of F2, also known as Facebook Financial. ""The answer is probably 'yes.'""¬†

""The first thing is really consumer protection,"" he adds. ""Do consumers understand what they're buying? And what guarantees do they have to get their money out in an adverse event? And so that pertains to if you're talking about stable coins, specifically, what are the reserves made of?¬†

""Are they're fully backed? reserves? Or are they not fully backed? And if they are fully backed? What are they backed with?"" he adds.

During Gensler's¬†testimony before the Senate Banking Committee¬†on Tuesday, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) asked about the possibility of crypto investors attempting to withdraw money during a market crash. Gensler said the SEC could not do much to help investors since crypto exchanges like Coinbase (COIN) had not registered with the SEC.¬†

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last month¬†urged speedy adoption of stablecoin rules¬†in remarks to regulators.

Marcus said investor risks found in stablecoins depend on the commodities that back a given cryptocurrency.

""In my view, very high quality stable coins are only backed by cash and very short term treasuries,"" he says. ""That's it.""

""Then you could add a capital buffer on top of that, to basically cover unexpected operational losses, or what have you to add another layer of protection,"" he says.

Facebook aims to release Novi along with Diem by the end of the year, Marcus¬†told Axios earlier this month. Diem, which emerged from Facebook's effort to develop a cryptocurrency that began under the name Libra in 2017, will be pegged to the U.S. dollar, Marcus said.

Libra faced backlash from regulators and lawmakers when it was announced in 2019, and¬†ultimately lost support from corporate backers¬†like Visa (V) and PayPal (PYPL).¬†

Speaking to Yahoo Finance, Marcus said concerns over illicit payments with stablecoins offer an opportunity for regulators to improve the clarity of rules governing such transactions, even though stablecoins are currently used for everyday payments in rare circumstances.

""We're very motivated to solving payments use case but stable coins are mainly used right now for exchanges when people are buying and selling other crypto assets,"" he says.

""There are provisions around anti-money laundering, combating the financing of terrorism, sanctions enforcement ‚Äî and I think the rules are pretty clear,"" he says. ""This actually offers an opportunity to get better at it than the current system is, which I think it will be.""

personalfinance,Help with getting free of my debts?,"Hello guys

I created a throwaway as not entirely comfortable with the reasons behind the situation I'm in, but basically, I gambled a lot, sports betting, casino etc, I've took the first step to quit and used Gamstop (a UK service to stop me from using any bookmakers), now I want to plan forward to improve my credit and get debt free, or atleast free of the loans and credit cards, and in a position where I can look to get a mortgage

Currently I have 4 credit cards, all maxed out, ¬£1750, ¬£1500, ¬£1000 and ¬£150  
I have a car on a HP agreement which I love and don't want to let go of, this costs me ¬£300 a month because the interest rate sucks because of my bad credit  
I have payday loans, short term loans etc which I hope to have paid off fully by February/March next year, making use of my monthly salary and Christmas bonus which I get end of December  
I also have a ¬£1000 arranged overdraft through my bank

I earn ¬£32,000 a year and currently am living at home, I have a partner who I've been with for years, we want to move out and get our own place but we have no savings so far

I've fully quit gambling, I'd say every month with the credit cards, ongoing loans, rent contibution, bills, travel costs etc I'm usually left with around ¬£600 per month spare to last me for the month, that includes me putting ¬£300 in a savings account from next month onwards. With my gambling ¬£600 a month wouldn't be that much as I would go through it quickly, I know, its bad, but I hope I'm over it now

Can anyone help to tell me how I am best to do this? I want to save and get a mortgage, but my credit sucks, so I need to improve my credit significanly, currently its in the 'very poor' lowest section on Experian.  
I also want to pay off my debt, I'm fine with my car payments and those just being an ongoing thing, and I have plans in place to make sure all my short term high interest loans etc are paid off early 2022... How much should I be paying off my credit cards? How can I improve my credit? I'm in a bit of a weird spot, I never really budgeted properly because my budgeting was solely based around leaving as much money as I could to gamble, as stupid as that it, that's gambling addiction I guess

Also, are mortgages hard to be approved for? If i have a, say 10% deposit and get my credit to 'poor' or 'average', am I going to be able to get approved?

Thanks in advance!",finance

algorand,Discussion - Why will the ALGO coin be valuable in the future?,"There is a great pinned post about Algorand misconceptions that addressing the tokenomics and a few other issues that people perceive detract from the value of ALGO the coin, which is separate from the technology behind the network. One issue that doesn't seem to be brought up is where the free and public Algo blockchain and token fits into all of this.

The Algorand foundation is developing technology that others would use to deploy blockchain solutions, be it a CBDC or some other application specific blockchain application. However, these solutions may not be deployed to the public Algorand network, and it is unclear if they would be L2 solutions on the public network or completely separate semi-public/private blockchains using Algorand technology.

I've got some heavy Algo bags for several reasons:
- Great API - Examples and documentation are fantastic. Multiple languages are supported and not just Haskell. 
- Great 3rd gen blockchain tech - A lot of the benefits of what makes Ethereum great and where Ethereum plans to head built into the base blockchain, no forking or risky implementation delays
- Governance - Who doesn't love guaranteed interest rates in the teens
- Team - A great mix of talented professionals and academics
- Low market cap - The market cap for the current product seems extremely low compared to, say, Cardano, which is the closest current peer.

**Are these reason enough for the ALGO to become a common medium for exchanging value to the broader public? Do Algo proponents feel that the free and open public blockchain will provide enough use case for the ALGO token to increase in value compared to other currencies (fiat or other coins)?**",cryptocurrency
dogecoin,Dogecoin: Deflationary vs Inflationary,"While there is no cap on the total number of Dogecoin that can be made, the cap of 10,000 Dogecoin per block means that as Dogecoin's block time is 1 minute,¬†approximately up to 5 billion new Dogecoin¬†will enter circulation every year.

Unlike other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin doesn't have a cap. In order to keep the network secure and operational, there's always an incentive of 5 billion coins per year for miners. By the end of 2030, there will be 180 billion Dogecoin in circulation.  As a comparison 6.3 billion Federal Reserve notes are printed every year at value of $188.3 billion.  This is just actually paper and coin minted, not how much is created in the economy and debt spending by government that is digital currency.  

Most altcoins, as they‚Äôve been designed so far, are deflationary. This means there‚Äôs a hard cap on the number of coins that will ever be in existence. Bitcoin, for example, is designed to not have any more bitcoins come into existence after 2040. Other variants (Litecoin) have similar setups. However, one of the downsides of¬†deflation¬†is that it essentially encourages hoarding, as the perceived real value of the currency increases over time. Accordingly, academic researchers showed last year that¬†64 percent of all bitcoins have never been spent.

Dogecoin just might have a better chance of being used and transacted in the long-term. (After all, there's still just a handful of¬†businesses¬†that accept dogecoins as payment.)

""As long as it‚Äôs at a steady and predictable rate, you would want that inflation rate to more or less match the growth of the global economy,‚Äù¬†James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University. ‚ÄúIn order for a currency to survive, it‚Äôs got to be useful. One of the problems we learned with gold standard was that it‚Äôs too inflexible‚Äîit takes too long for gold miners to dig it up out of the ground. Having a nice, steady, predictable money supply is actually a good thing.‚Äù

So it is possible for Dogecoin to actually become a useful currency.  It might never be worth $50,000, but there are predictions if will be worth up to $30 by 2030.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Pay off student loans in 2022?,"Hey everyone so I currently have been saving up a lot of money in cash in preparation to pay down my student loans come Jan 2022 when the federal student loan interest free period comes to an end. I have about 228k in student loans and I've saved up about 179k in cash and so I should hopefully have accumulated enough to pay it down then. 

Recently my significant other and I have been planning on purchasing a home hopefully next year and that has made me reconsider paying down my loans entirely and perhaps maybe instead pay it down partially that way I have enough cash for a down payment. If I do go down this route I would probably refinance my fed student loans to get a better rate but my concern is the hit that my credit score would take from refinancing as well as the credit check. This can potentially also come back to bite me when I seek out financing for the home. My credit score is currently around 750 ish per Credit Karma. Anyways just wanted to get some input. Any help is appreciated thanks.",finance
CryptoCurrency,BaFin awards second crypto license to Kapilendo the more the better!,"Crypto custodian Kapilendo becomes the second company after Coinbase to receive BaFin approval to hold crypto assets.

Kapilendo Custodian AG has scored a major success. According to a LinkedIn post, the Berlin-based company is now the second custodian of crypto assets in Germany to receive a license from BaFin, after Coinbase. This means that the financial services provider can now officially operate and advertise its business activities in this country - all under the watchful eye of the German financial supervisory authority.

For Kapilendo Managing Director Didier Goepfert, this creates new opportunities. A clear legal framework and licensed providers would help financial institutions participate in the development and growth of the young digital asset market, he says. In addition, Goepfert predicts:

""In my opinion, the influx of new investors will boost market growth next year and lead to less volatile markets, which in turn will attract new investors, which should lead to a positive feedback loop.""

At the end of June, BaFin's awarding of a license to Coinbase Germany for the safekeeping of crypto assets made waves in the crypto space. Now Kapilendo is following suit. In perspective, more licenses are likely to be added. A question from the FDP parliamentary group to the Federal Ministry of Finance reveals that, in addition to the licenses already granted, there are 25 more applications. Some of them are expected to be approved ""in the coming weeks"".

CryptoCurrency,What can we actually do im the U.S. about this trash legislation?,"As many of you may or may not know there is new crypto regulations/legislation on the horizon. For a summary, an incredible post can be found below.

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pqm1ba/new_us_crypto_regulation_far_more_invasive_than/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share 

So yall, I dont like to be too animated or colorful or emotional in writing/reddit. Words are powerful but doing something about it is better. 

I could talk about how the reporting transactions over 600 dollars is financial surveillance acknowledged by governments on an unprecedented scale, never before in mankind.  Something about 4th ammendment protections from unreasonable searches? Invasion of privacy? Is it reasonable to show uncle sam every single time you move 600 dollars of wealth?  

I could talk about making stable dollar coins illegal. This is outlawing code in an unprecedented way. Viruses aren't illegal to own, they are illegal to deploy. For academic freedom of knowledgeable open source reasons. Code is an extension of words and knowledge and words and knowledge are covered under free speech. Code has never been illegal like this. Pictures and media files have provisions because although it is code it extends from the computer as a real item that can be manifested other ways. Pictures aren't code, they can be printed. Although crypto tokens are litterally just code, its now widely acknowledged they can exchange real wealth. It will be illegal for you to own Dai you generated off of your own eth after 2023. 

I could talk about how interactions with defi contracts that last longer than 24 hours are to be called futures. Thus will make it illegal to use 99% of defi unless you are registered with the CFTC and SEC. Thats a couple hundred grand buy in. Litterally forcing retail out of defi. 

Why shouldn't I be allowed to leverage my eth for dai? Why shouldn't I be able to lend? My brokerage lends my stocks. Oh yeah to protect me.

We could talk about how celsius and blockfi are being bullied through litigation. God forbid some company offer people an attractive interest rate.

I understand this is all based on the Howie test but that even feels unconstitutional. I know its well established but why should I not be able to enter any money contract with anyone at all while expecting a profit? Am i incapable, should it be just that I am legally not allowed to lend to another countrymen for our own interest rate decided on between the two of us? That's a security

I'm not even going to talk about privacy coins. Am i a money launderer for owning monero? 

This is the part where I hate to be emotional or colorful here but....

Its fucking tyrannical, totalitarian financial surveillance, unjust search on a huge scale, denial of freedom of speech, detrimental to American jobs and technological innovation. It will completely shut down my side business, make our hobby illegal, and make it illegal to pursue a retirement outside of the American pension/401k /social security system which has historically been pilfered and taken advantage of at every opportunity.

Under the name of protection is a bold lie. It doesn't protect me. It prices me out. It cannot protect me. I do not need protection from my own choices when code is auditable. 

Theres constitutional proportionality widely recognized as a governments oversights and intrusions must be in proportion to the benefit they serve. Is the intrusion of government here proportional to the protection from money laundering they offer when we're litterally leaving blackhawk helicopters for taliban? Its embarrassing.

I wanna do whatever I can to fight this. So here I am. What can we do besides inform our friends? Can we do anything? Can we get some template letters floating around? Can we start our own pool or protocol to donate to that would leverage staking or lending yield to consistently pay for lobbying forever? Fuck im down to try and stage a protest. Ive never done any of it though. Help me help more people and please use this thread to speak out ideas for how we could peacefully resist, protest, and stop this trash legislation. 

Also don't be political, be inspirarional.

I'm tired of talking, thinking about it. What can we do about it?

Let's have a look at fiat interest rates...they either have a lot of zeroes behind the decimal or they have a minus in front of it (aka negative interest).

We in crypto space have &gt;4% APY. Crypto prices will rise to new ATH which are making this 4% even more worthy.

If crypto gets fully adopted we can never expect staking rewards as high as it is now, because this would be too inflationary.

So what can we learn from this? Get even more crypto, stake them and get wealthy years later. This goes beyond simple HODLing, it is SHODL (stake hodling).

stocks,How to monitor the supply chain disruptions,"**Current situation:**

* Inflation (*core PCE*) has consistently been below 2.0% for over a decade.
* Now, customers are experiencing large price increases to many goods &amp; services due to supply chain disruptions &amp; labor shortages.
* Some parts of inflations may be transitory while other parts may be permanent. It will be important to the Federal Reserve to get it right because:
   * if inflation is transitory even though core PCE is above 2.0%: Fiscal policy should be accommodative (*no rate hikes*) and the business cycle should continue so supply can catch up with demand
   * if inflation is persistent + core PCE is above 2.0%:  Probably a good idea for fiscal policy to take some rate hikes to tame inflation

CryptoCurrency,Russian Central Bank to delay payments made to crypto exchanges,"In a move in keeping with global regulatory crackdowns on the crypto industry, the Central Bank of Russia is looking to cooperate with commercial banks to delay payments made to crypto exchanges, announced in a recent event in the southwestern city of Sochi. This announcement comes as general crypto investor interest in Russia rises.

This is a move which seeks to prevent the ‚Äúemotional‚Äù purchases of cryptocurrencies via peer to peer and over-the-counter trading platforms.  CBR First Deputy Governor Sergei Shvetsov believes that crypto differs from traditional assets, and has the signs of a pyramid scheme. The country‚Äôs financial monitoring company has also commissioned the creation of a new system to track and scrutinize crypto investor behaviour.

Crypto is too Risky, says CBR
Earlier this year, the CBR implored stock exchanges not to offer crypto-related products to investors.  Cryptocurrency was deemed to be very risky by the Central Bank, way back in 2019, as they felt that cryptocurrency could be used to launder money from criminal activities, finance terrorism, and that conducting transactions posed a risk due to crypto‚Äôs volatile nature. Limited liquidity, a lack of transparency, and unclear regulations all contribute to the risk of using crypto assets. The Central Bank, however, intends to pilot its own digital currency in 2022.

Russia‚Äôs Stance on crypto over the years 
Russia has taken aggressive moves against cryptocurrency in the recent past. The Binance domain was recently blocked in Russia, after Binance was allowing Russians to buy cryptocurrency with the Russian Ruble, but was subsequently unblocked. They also claimed in 2020 to be testing the prototype of an AI software to reduce the anonymity inherent in cryptocurrency transactions. In the same year, the Russian Federation‚Äôs financial regulator proposed changes to criminal punishing undeclared digital wallets holding more than a one million Rubles.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Why would I want to pay off my mortgage?,"I'm planning to buy a home, and have been looking at paying cash vs mortgage. I've found that the longer mortgage I can take, the better, since it's so much more effective for my money to be in the stock market (assuming 10% average returns, so 6.5% inflation-adjusted).

But given that interest rates are significantly lower than average stock appreciation, why would I ever really want to have equity in the house? From what I can see right now, I'd rather just have the bank fully own the house and I pay interest on that loan.

Practically, what this means is that I would take a cash-out refinance as often as possible so that I could keep as much of my capital in the stock market as possible. 

I expect that there are practical reasons/rules that prevent me from actually executing on this (I'm still fairly ignorant about all the regulations and rules around home loans). In principle, however, I don't see why I wouldn't want to - the stock market seems significantly better than the real-estate market (on average, in the long-term). 

Things that I might not be accounting for:
- my idea of average stock market returns are grossly inaccurate (I don't think this is the case, but maybe)
- I'm underestimating home-value appreciation
- the stock market is high-variance, where as the real-estate market might be lower? I've run my simulations assuming average market returns, not doing Monte-Carlo style with actual returns data. (But over long timespans, like 30 years, I would expect this to not matter quite as much)

My wife and I are both mathematicians but most of the current thinking on homeownership doesn't make sense to us. The opportunity cost of having your capital locked up in real estate is so high (given what it could be doing in the market) that it seems like owning a house is much more costly than folks account for.

personalfinance,Should I let my parents use my name for a mortgage for a rental property? (USA),"Hi, my parents have been asking me for permission to use my name for a mortgage to buy an apartment to rent out. They already paid off their home so this won't affect their housing situation at all. My parents are both financially responsible but my father has low income and my mother recently did a refinance for another property so their interest rates would be close to 5%. However, using my name will supposedly get them &lt;3%. The mortgage will be ~$500,000 over 30 years. I'm 22 and currently making $175k living with my parents but will eventually also need to pay for rent either in the Bay Area. 

I want to evaluate the pros and cons of doing this. What I know so far are that the pros are helping my parents invest in another property without the poor rates and getting the ability to claim tax deductions for this home. The cons seem to be that I will be responsible for the loans if shit goes wrong, it'll be harder for me to get another loan (I have no plans to buy a home within the next 5 years), and I lose my first time home owner benefits. I believe I'll also own part of the property as well so I guess I can sell my % of the place if I can't pay? My parents are also planning to sell this property in the next few years.

Given this information, do you guys think it's OK to let my parents use my name? I really want to help them but I want to cover my ass too.

1. Their accountant(?) that if I ever applied for another loan, I can prove that my parents have been making all the payments and that the mortgage will be ignored in that case. Is that true?

2. Are the benefits of the being a first time home owners really worth saving? Is it possible to regain the benefits somehow?

personalfinance,Investing vs paying off auto loan and student loans,"Hi! Wondering if my current situation checks with all of you. I am a government employee and have a fairly steady job. I have student loans ($18K, highest interest rate 4.299%, in deferment until 2023 and not currently paying) and a car payment (owe $4500, interest rate %6, currently making double payments of $400/month). 

I recently realized  I wasn't an active participant in my finances and needed to rip the bandaid off my situation. Since then, I have paid off my credit card debt completely and saved a 6 month emergency fund. I'm now looking at financial planning that suggests saving \~20% per check and dedicating it to long term savings or investing. I understand the principle that investing can potentially yield greater than 6% interest rate of my car loan- I'm just looking for advice on what you all would do. Continue to make 1.5x-2x payments while saving a little less (ie 15%)? Or fully double down on paying off the car?

I'd appreciate any help or thoughts.",finance
personalfinance,the employer won't pay us both holiday pay and overtime,"This is Texas and we are contract employees

On a typical pay period, we work 3-night shifts. 12 hours per night. We get a paycheck after a week (Friday night to be specific)

When we work more than 40 hours a week, say we pick up the fourth shift, we get paid overtime. (Any hours after 40 hours is overtime)

On a holiday, we get holiday pay (This was a labor day) which is a 1.5X hourly pay. 

This past labor day, my friends who worked both the holiday and overtime won't be paid both. The employer says holiday hours don't count towards regular hours. Meaning the holiday hours were subtracted from regular hours (and paid 1,5X), and my friends weren't paid over time. He (the employer) says it's a federal law, and he can't change it. We all think it's not fair. If they worked both holiday and over time they should be paid both and it should count. 

Has anyone been in this same situation before? We can use some insights. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all!!!!!!

Explanation: 

Meaning the holiday hours were subtracted from regular hours (and paid 1,5X), and my friends weren't paid overtime. 

our calculations:

worked hours: 48 hours

holiday hours: 8 (since we work the night shift, it start from midnight until 8 am)

overtime: 48-40= 8 hours

Our employer's calculations:

worked hours: 48 hours

holiday hours: 8 

no overtime: holiday hours do not count towards regular hours, so you worker 40 regular hours and 8 holiday hours. It's a federal law, I can't change that. No overtime pay!",finance
personalfinance,Buying a car from a private seller,"My live-in significant other has a car loan with a ridiculous interest rate (22.99%). We're trying to reduce our bills, and reducing the amount of money  we throw away on interest seems like a good place to start. 

If I payoff the loan, is it possible to have the title transfer to me rather than to my significant other? 

I would like to have possession of the title while my significant other pays me back. We agreed on an interest rate and monthly payment that works for us, but it would be an informal agreement between us. If we split up, I would be able to give back the principal and keep the interest and the car/title.

CryptoCurrency,"Reminder: If you have your money in banks, you can stake it for interest rates 2000x higher.","If you are wondering why banks are obsessed with Crypto and why they are spreading so much bad PR, this is exactly the reason. So much so that even the SEC is going crazy. In the US banks are not giving you anything that can be counted as interest. Keeping money in banks is a total no brainer. You will lose money due to inflation instead.

A lot of countries are literally giving you 0% interest while **some are even charging money to keep your money in banks** (Switzerland, Denmark, Japan and a lot more countries have negative interest rates)**.** Remember, these are the same banks that loan out the money that you keep in them. 

So, if you didn't know yet, or you are a beginner to Crypto. You can stake your stablecoins on exchanges like Gemini or other exchanges interest rates **thousands** **of times higher**. There are some offering even 20% interest rates which insane when you compare it to what banks are giving you.

There is no reason to miss out on this. You can also stake your profits if you think you have already reached your target. This is better than straight up cashing out since you won't be corroded by inflation.

financialindependence,The Luxury of a High Savings Rate; or Who's Afraid of Bonds?,"# Intro

A frequent question on this sub is whether bonds have any place in an accumulator's portfolio. Setting aside the currently *en vogue* idea of a bond tent (which is a weak asset allocation move of dubious value), many investors here take the view that can be crudely summarized as ""stocks have a higher expected return with higher volatility, the volatility is reduced by a long time horizon, I can stomach the volatility, therefore I should be 100% stocks."" Another poster has tackled [the specific fallacy](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/irzfer/the_fallacy_of_time_diversification_or_the_other/) of volatility being reduced over the long term, but I thought I'd give some attention to bonds to highlight ways they may still have utility for the accumulator.

# A Brief Note on Total Return

If you Google ""BND"" to find the return of the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF since inception, you'll see that the price has gone up a whopping 15% since inception in Spring 2007. Not 15% per year, but 15% overall. Google and Yahoo Finance, however, only report the market *price* of assets you search. Bonds and bond funds return the vast majority of their value as coupon payments. It's a simplification, but think of coupon payments as bond dividends. Google and Yahoo Finance do not include re-invested dividends, and should not be used for historical analysis of total return. If we look at [Portfolio Visualizer's](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;leverageType=0&amp;leverageRatio=0.0&amp;debtAmount=0&amp;debtInterest=0.0&amp;maintenanceMargin=25.0&amp;leveragedBenchmark=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=BND&amp;allocation1_1=100) result for BND since inception, we see the more accurate 68% total return for that period. 

All values used for the rest of this post will be total returns in real, inflation-adjusted terms.

# The Luxury of a High Savings Rate

One simple reason putting bonds in your portfolio may be desirable is that it likely won't set your retirement back by a substantial amount, and in exchange you get a decent amount of safety with a reduction in portfolio volatility. [Portfolio Visualizer](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&amp;mode=1&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1975&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;leverageType=0&amp;leverageRatio=0.0&amp;debtAmount=0&amp;debtInterest=0.0&amp;maintenanceMargin=25.0&amp;leveragedBenchmark=false&amp;portfolioNames=true&amp;portfolioName1=100%2F0+Portfolio&amp;portfolioName2=80%2F20+Portfolio&amp;portfolioName3=60%2F40+Portfolio&amp;asset1=TotalStockMarket&amp;allocation1_1=100&amp;allocation1_2=80&amp;allocation1_3=60&amp;asset2=TreasuryNotes&amp;allocation2_2=20&amp;allocation2_3=40) shows us that the annualized growth rate of 100/0, 80/20, and 60/40 US Stock/10-yr Treasurys portfolios have been 8.59%, 7.88%, and 7%, respectively. Giving up 0.7% (or worse, 1.6%) seems like throwing money away.

But what does the FIRE saver lose (and what do they stand to gain) by choosing a more conservative portfolio? By using the [NPER family](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/pm6q8n/when_coastfi_is_rational_an_introduction_to_qalys/) of formulas, we can estimate this. 

Assume a FIRE-minded saver who knows that the value of money is in the quality of life that it provides and not as a score in a game that should be run as high as possible. As a result, they are interested in reaching a portfolio large enough to afford a comfortable retirement, and place more emphasis on hitting this number than on dying with the most money. They earn 80k/yr, save 40k/yr for a 50% savings rate, and are targeting a 3.33% withdrawal (or 30x the portfolio) and thus need 1.2M to retire.

* With the historical return of the 100/0 portfolio, they get there in 15.5 years.

* With the historical return of the 80/20 portfolio, they get there in 16 years, or **6 months later**.

* With the historical return of the 60/40 portfolio, they get there in 16.7 years, or **15 months later**. 

What do they get for that extra 0.5-1.25 years of work? In the fallout from the market crash of 2008:

* The 100/0 portfolio lost 37% in a single year and experienced a cumulative drop of 51% from Nov '07 to Feb '09. It didn't recover in value until Mar '12, **over 3 years later**.

* The 80/20 portfolio lost 26% in a single year and a cumulative 39% and took **a little under 2 years to recover**.

* The 60/40 portfolio lost 14% in a single year and a cumulative 26% and took **just over 1 year to recover**.

Considered another way, the 80/20 investor needs to save a relative 6% more (42k/yr) to retire at the same time as the 100/0 investor (53% savings rate) and the 60/40 investor needs to save a relative 14% more (45.5k/yr) to retire at the same time as the 100/0 investor (57% savings rate). (Assuming everyone still wants a 1.2M portfolio that allows for spending 40k/yr.)

In his incomparable post on the [Psychology of Money](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-psychology-of-money/), Morgan Housel highlights Charlie Munger's first rule of compounding: ""never interrupt it unnecessarily."" If there's a whiff of chance that an investor can be spooked out of the market by a 50% drop in their portfolio that doesn't recover for over 3 years, they'd likely be much better off saving 6% more or working an additional 6 months with a 80/20 portfolio than suffer the catastrophe that is quitting the market entirely. We all think we are made of sterner stuff than the ""average"" investor, but most people also think they're smarter than the average person too.

# But Bonds are Useless Now, Aren't They?

A concern that has been recirculating, *but is by no means new*, is that this time it's different and bonds have zero upside potential going forward. Phrased another way, ""interest rates can only go up,"" which *oBvIoUsLy* crushes their value. 

First, it's worth noting that besides any return characteristics, bonds have a place in risk-adjusting your portfolio. This role does not disappear even if bond return goes to 0% or even goes negative. Considered another way, stocks have a risk premium which is extra return in payment for the extra risk you take for holding them. There is no reason to believe that the risk premium for stocks has gone up for some reason, so if the risk-free rate (let's call it the rate on short term Treasurys) goes down from 2% to 0%, the expected return for stocks will go down by the same amount. There is no free lunch; everyone is getting smaller portions. 

Second, I can't hold a candle to nisiprius at the Bogleheads forum when it comes to illuminating the fallacies of ""common sense"" investing ideas like interest rate rises and bond pricing behavior. See his series of posts [here](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6058140#p6058140) and [here](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6065083#p6065083), demonstrating that the total value of a bond fund will eventually recover and provide a positive return even in a case where interest rates *never stop rising*. 

He follows this up with [a series of points](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6065103#p6065103) that are the best summary of bond dynamics that I've ever come across:

&gt; * Rising interest rates exert a downward pressure on bond prices. The pressure is related to the *rate* of rise. If interest rates keep rising at, say, 1% per year, the pressure doesn't keep increasing, it is a constant pressure.
&gt; * Bond prices respond to that pressure by moving downward.
&gt; * Because a bond pays back its face value at maturity, its market value must rise to face value at maturity. A bond whose value is down must rise. You can think of this as an *upward* pull, often called the ""pull to maturity.""
&gt; * The more depressed a bond price is, the more it has to rise in order to get back to face value.
&gt; * That means that the more depressed the bond price is, the stronger the upward tug.
&gt; * There is a balance of forces. Rising rates push down. The always-approaching maturity pulls up.
&gt; * A forever-rising interest rate does **not** create a forever-falling declining bond price.
&gt; * As the bond price declines, the pull to maturity becomes stronger and stronger, until an equilibrium is reached.
&gt; * In other words, if the first 1% interest rate rise creates a -6.2% fall in the bond price, that does not mean the second, third, fourth etc. create further -6.2% falls.
&gt; * The relationship, price fall = interest rate rise x duration is only true for a single instantaneous rise. It is **not cumulative** for long-term continouusly-rising interest rate, or a series of rises.
&gt; * The bond *price* stabilizes, but coupon payments continue.

Finally, if you're intrigued by the mechanics of bonds (which on the whole are *much* more complicated instruments than stocks) and want to potentially get extra returns even in an ultra-low-rate environment, see this excellent tutorial on bond convexity over at [Portfolio Charts](https://portfoliocharts.com/2019/05/27/high-profits-at-low-rates-the-benefits-of-bond-convexity/).

# Conclusions

Owning bonds can reduce portfolio volatility and provide an overall higher risk-adjusted return than 100% equity. Holding bonds may reduce expected return, but with a high savings rate there is minimal impact on additional working years. Bond funds are not facing a permanent zero-return outlook even if you believe interest rates have ""nowhere to go but up,"" and the subtle mechanics of bond convexity offer substantial asymmetrical upside if long duration bonds are appropriate for your investment horizon.",finance
personalfinance,Student loans help!,"Hello! 

Long time lurker here! 

I have a massive amount of student loans which is eating away at me. All my loans were private as I was a international student. I have finally consolidated my loans at a interest rate of 3.5%. The total principal and interest at this time is $310,000. (I went through medical school) 

I am a resident finishing my residency in ~9 months and I have signed for a job which will be giving me $150,000 as a sign on bonus and ~$230,000 annually for my salary. 

My question is, do I put ALL of the $150,000 into my loans and pay it all off in a year by living way below my means? 

I am in my mid 30s, I have not started a 403b, no other loans in my name, and do not have any children (yet). No HSA. I am just starting out my journey to become financially independent (and yes, I know I am very late to the game). 

What I am hesitant about with my plan above is that I have delayed gratification in pursuit of my career. I have not travelled, don‚Äôt own a house, and driving a car which is almost on it‚Äôs last legs. 

Is putting all $150,000 into my loans a wise choice - or should I put in $100,000 and keep $50,000 for a house down payment? What should I do with my sign on bonus? 

Thank you very much!",finance

stocks,"Morning Update for Monday, 09/20/21","Good morning everyone. I hope you had a nice weekend, and let's get back at it today. Lots of stocks gapping down this morning, things could get interesting. Make sure to stay disciplined, I'll be cautious today.

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* AVIR
* BRKS
* UVXY

Gapping DOWN:

* TSLA
* BABA
* NIO
* BA
* UAL
* AMD
* PUK
* CLF
* AMC

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open lower this morning after some choppiness in last week's sessions. The Fed is set to hold its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, and we could be getting an indicator as to when the Fed will taper its asset purchase program. US Treasury Secretary called for Congress to raise the US debt ceiling, and that failing to do so would generate ""widespread economic catastrophe"". There are also concerns that Chinese Evergrande Group, a Chinese real estate juggernaut, could collapse because of major debt. Shares were down more than 10% on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Adding to the fear is the broader crackdown on real estate by the Chinese government; this situation is worth monitoring, as it could have effects on the overall market. Worth watching UVXY if we continue to see fear in the market.¬†

SPY is currently trading a bit under 434, and if we see more weakness we could test the SMA(100) as support at \~432. We'll see what things look like closer to open, but regardless, we should see some volatility today. DIA is trading just under 339, after breaking down below the SMA(100) in last week's trading. We could see a retrace to the \~332 level by the SMA(200) if we continue to see weakness. Potential support levels at 337 and 335, so we could see a bounce. QQQ¬†is trading a bit under 367 and is currently gapping down below the SMA(50). 370 will now be a key resistance point, and we could be in for a bigger correction if we can't get back above that 370 level today. Gold and silver are up a bit this morning, while crude oil is pulling back. Crude oil is currently hovering right around $70 per barrel, we'll see if that holds up. B\*\*coin is currently trading around 42,800 and things are looking bearish at the moment. Unless we see a strong bounce off support at these levels, we could see more selling off in the near future. Cr\*\*to-related stocks are down in premarket trading, as a result. Airlines and cruise stocks are down this morning. It will be worth watching to see if we bounce off support levels sometime this morning, or continue to see weakness. Meme stocks are showing weakness at the moment, but worth keeping on the radar.¬†

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)",finance
personalfinance,Looking for wisdom in debt and personal finance management,"Hello everyone! 

Some background information: I am a hospital pharmacist who graduated in 2018. I‚Äôve had 6 years of college and one year of hospital residency. I have worked at my hospital for the past two years.

During this time, I have accumulated $250,000 in student debt. Thankfully, as a pharmacist, I am making $2400 ish/biweekly paycheck and I‚Äôve been taking extra shifts due to COVID patient volume and staff shortages. I am also married to an OT and she has 120,000 of student debt. My focus during the first years of working has been lowering my interest rates on the student loans and paying off credit cards from school (all done). 
My wife is down to 3.25% for 10 years.
I have my private loans (150k) with 4.19% for 15 years and considering refinancing again while rates are low (we have great credit). Im also paying towards my federal loans (100k) for the public student loan forgiveness program. Ideally, those should be forgiven after 10 years of payments (8 more years to go). These are currently on hold until 01/22 so I have another extra 700$/month to save/invest. 

My wife and I purchased a small starter home in early March 2020 (119k), since then we‚Äôve seen the equity increase quickly due to the housing market and making improvements. My goal is to sell this house in about 8-10 years and trade up to a larger and more modern home. However, all my debt is a barrier so I want to make sure I am doing everything I can now to be prepared to meet this goal. 

My question is, now that I have the ability to make some extra money by working extra shifts and collecting 200$ COVID bonuses in addition to my pay, how should I allocate extra money? 

My wife and I have a personal loan of $6800 from our wedding and that has the highest interest rate so that should be done this winter.

After this the question is what is the next best thing to do?

1.) Do I pay extra on the house to increase equity?

2.) Do I try to pay as much extra on the student loans ?

3.) Do I grow my savings (only around 2500). Is there a target I should save for?

4.) I have a personal investing account in addition to my wife and I‚Äôs Roth IRAs. I have about $2000 in stock from some pharmaceutical companies Im familiar with plus some major companies I regularly spend money on and am also familiar with. The goal is to keep these investments for about a decade and use the funds for costs associated with buying a new home. Should I invest more here? 

I appreciate any feedback or wisdom from the community. Thank you",finance
stocks,Dow futures skid nearly 2% Monday as fear of market contagion from China‚Äôs Evergrande intensifies,"U.S. stock futures fell sharply on Monday, with those for the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling 500 points, as Hong Kong-listed property companies came under fresh pressure. Investors also were positioning ahead of this week‚Äôs Federal Open Market Committee meeting.

**How are stock futures trading?**

* Dow Jones Industrial Average futures [**YM00,** **-2.01%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/YM00?mod=MW_story_quote) dropped 671 points, or 1.9%, to 33,791.
* S&amp;P 500 futures [**ES00,** **-1.82%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/ES00?mod=MW_story_quote) fell 78 points, or 1.8%, to 4,343.
* Nasdaq-100 futures [**NQ00,** **-1.76%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/NQ00?mod=MW_story_quote) tumbled 1.7%, or 260 points, to 15,066.

**What‚Äôs driving the market?**

Is this the correction that some strategists have anticipated?

A downturn in China‚Äôs property market, which suffered heavy losses Monday, with shares of China Evergrande [**3333,** **-10.24%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/3333?countryCode=HK&amp;mod=MW_story_quote) falling 13% in Hong Kong, were threatening to drag stocks sharply lower.

Markets were closed in mainland China for a holiday, but the Hang Seng [**HSI,** **-3.30%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/HSI?countryCode=HK&amp;mod=MW_story_quote) dropped over 3%.

The 8.25% Evergrande bond that has interest payments due this week was trading at around 29 cents to the dollar on Monday, according to Reuters. That is as Wall Street investors are poised to pick up where they left off last week ‚Äî on a weaker footing.  

‚ÄúThe dip is due to a variety of causes, including fading earnings estimates, uncertainty related to shifting monetary policy, and instability in the world‚Äôs second-largest economy as a result of escalating crackdowns,‚Äù said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade, in a note to clients.

Markets will be closely watching for any talk of tapering at the Fed‚Äôs two-day policy meeting that begins Sept. 21. The central bank‚Äôs ultra-easy policy stance, put in place more than a year ago to help the economy cope with the pandemic, looks untenable to some given spikes in inflation.

The economy has been giving off mixed signals, though, amid rising cases of coronavirus due to the delta variant. Friday‚Äôs losses for Wall Street came as a reading on consumer sentiment held close to a roughly 10-year low.

Analysts also were discussing the inability, so far, of Congress to increase the debt ceiling.

personalfinance,Federal taxes weren't taken out of my check,"I'm a salaried employee (teacher). I earn about 75k. I recently got a side gig teaching at a community College where I earn 8k. I have two children, 5 and 1. My wife earns 82k. We file as married filing jointly. 

In August I updated my W-4 to reflect my new wages. I followed what I thought were straight forward instructions, and somehow my recent paystub showed $0 paid to federal taxes. The code shows as ""Federal Tax:M~"". In the past, my federal tax deduction from each check was $263.51 for several months in a row. I called HR, and the person I spoke to wasn't very helpful. She basically said, ""All we can do is input the information from your W-4 and the rest happens automatically.""

I followed the directions for page 3 based on my earnings at the new job, but my Doculivery portal doesn't show any info other than the first page, which only shows the 4000 under the claim dependents section. 

I know it's hard to tell from this information alone, but can anyone help me out here? I don't want to get slammed by owing taxes next year.

CryptoCurrency,Crypto Investors Buy Inflationary Theory,"Investors who are looking for a hedge against inflation (which is when prices for goods and services in an economy spike) are increasingly drawn to cryptocurrency.

Argument For: Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, reportedly once contended that since Bitcoin will be limited in supply, it could potentially be a hedge against inflation. This is similar to gold (another hedge against inflation) and different from cash (which can be printed indefinitely by the Federal Reserve).

Data: As inflation has jumped in the past year, mostly due to economic policies from the pandemic, more investors have jumped on the crypto bandwagon. About 1 in 10 people are investing in crypto, and more digital coins are being created.

Argument Against: Critics say that Bitcoin‚Äôs price drop from May through July (which is when inflation crept up) is proof that crypto is not a hedge after all. This is true for other digital coins that dropped during that time too. The price of Bitcoin has since recovered some - but not all - of its value since peaking in April 2021.

Final Thoughts: Cryptocurrency‚Äôs hedge theory will be put to the test this year. How will it compare to other inflation bets? So far, it seems to be positive.

personalfinance,Turning Current Home Into Rental Advice,"My wife and I have been interested in renting our current house out for a while now and moving into a larger house for more space and to potentially start a family. We have owned and lived in our current house for just shy of two years. Last week, a property that we love came onto the market, giving us the opportunity to possibly put our plan into action. Some info about us:  
Ages: 26  
Income: $110k

Retirement Investments: $150k  
Current House Value (conservative): $350k

Current House Loan Amount: $249k  
Current House Interest Rate: 2.625% - 30 years  
Current House Payment: $1300  
Potential Cash Flow: $500 (1800-1300)  
Rental Emergency Fund: $20k  
New House Cost: $360k  
Down Payment for New House: $60k (see below also)  
Projected New House Mortgage Payment: $1550  
Market: Nashville, TN  
We have $40k in cash to put down, but wanted to also see about a cash out refi and how much we could pull out of the current house to fund a down payment. I would rather only use $20k of the cash we currently have with what I can pull out of the house, and the remaining $20k or so as an emergency fund for the rental. If anyone has insight on this, that would be greatly appreciated.  
I'd appreciate any help/insight anyone could give on a situation like this. The house we currently live in is in an extremely desirable area to live in right outside the city. The house we are looking at is in a less desirable area a bit further out from the city (15 minutes), but a lot of development is happening and planned to happen there in the next 10 years. We would like to keep and rent the current house, since we know a lot of companies and people are moving to our city over the next few years. Thanks!",finance

investing,China‚Äôs growing property crisis: a look onto a few spill over scenarios,"**Further conclusions (ADDED sep 22)..**

* Chinese indexes opened on Wednesday and didn't show panic. Media coverage in China shows that Evergrande news are secondary or even tertiary (possibly sidelined) to avoid stark main streets reactions 

* Onshore (local) bond payments of Evergrande have been resolved through negotiations off the clearing house, which a implies delayed payment schedule. (this is saying bond is paid on Sep 23, without payment actually happening on Sep 23)
 
* According to bond covenants (bond agreement terms) Evergrande may have 30 days to pay its unpaid or partially paid bond interests/coupons if not completely paid on the agreed date without facing penalties ... hence the unfolding of the crisis due to unpaid onshore and offshore bond obligations may take months, which provides the Chinese gov with ample time to inject liquidity, trim &amp; restructure the Evergrande empire as well as externalise toxic assets. Thus containment is likely, bits and pieces may resurface in 202 when more data about China based land and property sales is available, steering further market sentiment in positive or negative direction.

* Possibly most of the upcoming gov &amp; authorities' involvement will happen behind curtains, so we won't learn much about the evolution of this drama in the news.

* markets in US, EU and Asia will likely calm down short-term until big quarterly data dumps show the impact on China market sentiment, incl. Caixin Manuf. PMI, Services PMI and Commodity Index


Assumptions‚Ä¶

* 70% of wealth in China is held in property (elsewhere average is btw. 20 to 35%)

* Evergrande‚Äôs international payment obligations are due on Thursday

* 1/3 of current China GDP is created by construction and property related activity (builders, materials/commodities, industrials/machines, services, etc) 

* China property market (sales) has been lagging for some months already

* a lot of Chinese investors have been harmed by the gov's regulatory actions in respect to Chinese tech companies (declining tech stocks), hence sentiment sensibility is heightened

* holidays in China until wednesday .. markets are closed... thus delayed reaction of Chinese main street

* Evergrande's total assets approx. 2trillion RMB (2% of China‚Äôs GDP) and complex structure (+200 offshore &amp; almost 2000 onshore wholly and non-wholly owned subsidiaries). Accounts for roughly 4% of China‚Äôs total property sales. Its over 123,000 employees and 3.8 million contractors make up a fraction of China‚Äôs over 400 million urban labor force.

* 40% of mainland China based bank loans are backed by properties


Further Information

* Insightful article (English) from China's leading business magazine Caixin (China's version of WSJ/FT) about the internal dealings (various schemes &amp; crowdsourcing debts)  of Evergrande    https://archive.is/8QjU6  
* based on the article there could be a large volume of hidden debts and other obligations off their balance sheet
* it will likely take years longer to complete the portfolio of 800 building projects under construction, because of unpaid contractors and due to Evergrande having to pay other obligations first
* in respect to the complexity of Evergrande's assets, holdings, financial products and corporate constructs, it may take the Chinese gov months to accomplish at least the minimum of insight into the breadth of the longterm financial obligations
* UBS estimates that $19 billion of Evergrande‚Äôs liabilities are made up of outstanding offshore bonds.
* in the case of bankrupt developer Yinyi Group (approx. July 2019) the process from application to restructuring kickoff took 2 years (Dec 11, 2020 signed reorganization Investment Agreement), yet it seems to have partially failed because investors didn't come up with the required funds (Link Bloomberg Law: https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/yinyis-investor-fails-to-wire-required-funds-for-restructuring) (2nd payment up until July apparently was also much lower than agreed by courts).... these things take long in China and are very intransparent, yet they may suffice as means of containment



Market impact

* after digging into surrounding circumstances many analysts (jeffries, JPM, MS, citi, UBS, Barclay, Fidelity) believe that systemic distress is not evident, risks are priced in and that contagion can be avoided  ([Bloomberg!] (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-21/wall-street-s-message-on-evergrande-china-has-it-under-control)

* we may see more market tremors once Chinese markets are open (wednesday), so Tuesday may be green in US and Europe in the verge of slight rebounds

* a large net injection may signal Beijing‚Äôs intent to reduce systemic stress. If the Peoples Bank of China withdraws funds, that could mean it‚Äôs prepared to tolerate higher market volatility as the developer moves closer to a default.



Outlines of 3x spill over scenarios 
----------------------------
**1.) Unorderly containment + large spill over**

Evergrande default spills over to other property and real estate firms in China.. with unorderly containment, leading to a considerable decline in many related industries (incl. services) due to panic and liquidity-squeeze-related market actions. Property prices in China would collapse and lead to a moderately sized property sell-off -&gt; the rather significant negative GDP impact would hit Chinese wallets directly, leading to severe repercussions for China-focused firms (global) and China‚Äôs future growth in general

-&gt; large impact on international markets (most sectors), global crisis potential, quicker decline of China‚Äôs GDP, FED would have to delay tapering 


**2.) Orderly containment - moderate spill over**

Evergrande default spills over to other property firms in China.. with orderly containment, resulting in a moderate decline in a few related industries (construction, concrete/steel, machines, real-estate) -&gt; the GDP decline would impact China‚Äôs domestic spending/consumption power moderately and lead to a medium-long term cooling of the China property market with rather big slow down of international commodity markets (spec. looking at Australia, New Zealand, South Africa)

-&gt; moderate impact on international markets (few sectors only), less long-term effects, slow-paced decline of China‚Äôs core GDP


**3.) Orderly containment - small spill over**

Evergrande default spills over to a few selected property firms in China (with extra large debts). China‚Äôs gov steps in quickly and aggressively to ensure an orderly containment with a direct relief to calm down markets, resulting in a small decline in a few related industries (construction, concrete/steel, machines, real-estate) -&gt; the slight GDP decline would result in rather short-term consequences for China‚Äôs domestic spending/consumption power. The CCP would at least manage to keep China's property prices stable thus not affecting savings/wealth of the main street too significantly; the spill over effects would be barely visible.

-&gt; only short-term / slight impact on international markets (selected sectors only)

Any advice would be great even general advice.

personalfinance,How to get out of an economically depressed area?,"I graduated last year during the height of the pandemic, and took up a job as an administrative assistant making $10/hr because it was literally the only job I could find that would offer some kind of remote work. The rest of the jobs were seasonal working in hospitality. I moved in with my (retired) family to save on rent money, but can't seem to save much of it because it's deceptively expensive to live here. My spending habits I'd say are fairly normal for someone whose in their 20s, I generally am able to save 20% of my paycheck every week.

My employer has in the last 18 months given me two raises- one to $12 in January, with another raise to $13/hr as of this past few weeks. I have health insurance from my family, but I also pay for my own supplemental insurance and have been putting money towards my student loans even though they're in COVID forebearance (federal, most subsidized) because I genuinely don't know if I'll be making enough to cover the current monthly interest rates.

The biggest problem I'm seeing is that although my folks tout the South as ""really low CoL"" compared to the northeast.. it isn't. Not for a young person who can't drive (medical restriction, trust me I've looked into it), Uber generally costs $40 one way to get to work, if it even exists. Groceries routinely cost $60 when I'm trying to be conservative, and I have had a string of medical visits totalling $800 in bills over the last two months. My savings are basically gone, I have about $500 left, not enough to move back to a major city without a job lined up, and it looks like my hours are going to be cut from full time to 2-3 days a week ""because we're getting slow"". 

My savings when I came to the area were about $2,000 a year ago, to give you some idea. If it wasn't for some luck on the stock market I would likely be asking about how to pay off credit card debt.

I have approximately $3500 in face value savings bonds at varying interest rates to draw from as a kind of last resort. My parents constantly have told me I need to save that money for a downpayment on a house or something but realistically I don't ever think they'll be worth that much money. I've been applying to work in major cities as well as work abroad, but I want to know how I can change my situation here and now while I'm employed.

 I don't know how I can save money while living in a town that constantly screams about how they can't hire anyone while also paying rock bottom wages. Making $13/hr is a godsend here, $30,000 a year is like winning the lottery. My parents have said they'd be open to ""helping"" me with rent if I were to find work in a major city, but they won't actually front me the money to make that initial move, constantly telling me how I'll ""never leave"" and that if I need to stay until I'm 40 ""that's okay""...  I want to get out of here, and I want to know how I can do that while remaining financially solvent.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Here is why Evergrande is important,"The problem is leverage and currency risk.

 Evergrande has ~30bn in assets and 300bn in liabilities ($80 million of which is due this week, but they have already stated that they cannot pay this interest). Much like 2008, the real estate market in China is highly levered and in an extreme bubble. This is because the Chinese government imposed strict limits on who can invest in certain types of assets (mostly equities) but lifted almost all restrictions on real estate/housing market. Ergo, many of the middle class started investing in ‚Äúinvestment properties‚Äù and as demand grew, so did the prices. The problem was, Evergrande used the increases in the price of land and began taking out equity on that increase in order to fund more and more real estate deals. They currently account for ~2% of China‚Äôs GDP and is the second largest real estate developer (and 30% of chinese gdp comes from real estate)‚Ä¶ yeah a pretty big deal.

Now, how does this shitstorm in China affect the US Markets? 

Theoretically it shouldn‚Äôt be but a ripple right? Well, when Evergrande was raising capital, they did so by selling commercial paper and investment grade bonds. The buyers of these bonds and CP were large large banking + investment institutions: Vanguard, Blackrock, HSBC, Goldman, etc. These institutions then took these bonds, rolled them into mortgage backed securities and sold them to anyone who would buy them. Much like 2008‚Ä¶ everyone believed that if something happened to Evergrande, that the Chinese government would step in. After all, how would it be conceivable that the CCP would let their second largest real-estate developer fail? 

This is where things started going wrong. Everything was fine until the insiders started getting word of Evergrande‚Äôs overinflated balance sheet. But once investors started selling out, Evergrande‚Äôs bonds started taking a nosedive. The intl banking institutions didn‚Äôt want to be left holding the bag, so my guess is they started deleveraging these toxic assets to any firm willing to buy. How do I know this? Evergrande‚Äôs investment grade bonds are now downgraded to junk bonds, and they are trading at 20cents on the dollar. This became such a big issue in fact that these very firms and their executives were in China this weekend to discuss ‚Äúrisk management‚Äù 

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-wall-street-meeting-focused-092729599.html 

Now, the ripple effects would most likely be as follows: banks + institutions will seek to continue to sell toxic investment and decrease their exposure to the real estate sector. The firms that were dumb enough to buy these toxic assets from firms unloading are now left holding the bag. The once ‚Äúinvestment grade‚Äù bonds are now junk, and no one will accept them as collateral. So they get margin called. Firms will all rush to find cash, but the smaller firms will inevitably have to liquidate their long positions in order to remain solvent. This will likely happen in growth stocks and tech stocks with high PE ratios that have continued their bullrun since the middle of last year. As these equities start losing their value, other firms with exposure to these US equities will be forces to manage their risk to the downside and sell their positions, thus further driving the price down. This cycle will probably continue until firms have de-leveraged, defaulted, or until the fed decides to buy the toxic assets from these institutions (much like 2008). 

So in short, the effects of Evergrande defaulting will likely have huge implications to the US + international markets.

personalfinance,Capital gains taxes - how to minimize them (and why you might not be able to),"*(This is intended as a Work-in-Progress. I am far from an expert on any of this, so please feel free to dispense wisdom and I will do my best to incorporate feedback.)*

**""I have $X in capital gains and am looking at a huge tax bill. How can I minimize this?""**

This question comes up a lot, and with the rise of meme stocks, crypto currency, etc., a lot more people are coming with similar questions. This is my attempt to make a single post to collect the wisdom on this topic. **This post is aimed primarily at US taxpayers with gains in stocks or options purchased on the open market, or cryptocurrency.** If your gains are related to either real estate or stocks that you're receiving as compensation, you might have more options - see the appendix.

I will assume that you understand the basics of capital gains taxation. If not, Investopedia has a good introduction: [https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/capital-gains-tax-101/](https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/capital-gains-tax-101/), but the most important takeaways are the difference between short-term and long-term gains, and the fact that for both types of gains your taxes go up the more income you realize in any single tax year.

**Now, to the answer: how do you minimize capital gains taxes?**

Mostly, you can't. Just getting this out of the way. There's no magic bullet to erase taxes; if there were then everyone would use it and the tax code would be meaningless and eventually the holes would be closed. But you can lessen the impact with some careful planning, and if you're really motivated (i.e. we're talking about a lot of money) there  are some ways, but all of these methods require *significant sacrifices* and most of them additionally require *significant amounts of pre-planning*.

But lets get the easy methods out of the way.

**Good techniques to reduce your capital gains taxes:**

* Hold your assets until they meet long-term gains criteria (&gt;1 year between acquisition and sale).
* If you have any investments that have lost value, sell those in the same year you are realizing gains. If you have more gains than losses, you can realize all of your losses and offset an equivalent amount of gains. For stocks, to avoid something called a 'wash sale' you should make sure you have no other purchases of those stocks within 30 days before or after the sale.
* Sell as gradually as possible. The best way to minimize taxes is to keep your income as even as possible year-to-year to avoid crossing into higher tax brackets.
* Get ahead of the problem by practicing tax-gain harvesting in low income years. Between the 12k standard deduction and the 40k 0% long-term cap gains bracket, you can sell your assets and immediately re-purchase them to establish a new higher cost basis.
* Use your available pre-tax accounts to cut down on taxable income. Your pretax 401k is the main way to do this, and if you qualify for an HSA that gives you additional pretax savings capacity.
* A CPA can help you map out all of the above if you don't feel like trying to run the numbers yourself.

**What about charitable donations?**

When you donate to charity, you can theoretically deduct that from your taxes, but it's important to note that this does not result in more money in your pocket. You are giving away $X but reducing your tax bill by &lt;less than $X&gt; so it still remains a net loss for you. Also, you can only benefit from charitable donations to the extent your deductions will exceed the standard deduction. But if you have a year with big gains, and you want to include charitable giving in the picture, that year is a great time to make a a big one-time donation.

There are two ways you can enhance the power of your giving.

* The first is to donate appreciated assets directly instead of selling them for cash. When you do so, you increase the power of your deduction because you not only avoid paying any taxes on the unrealized gains, you can also claim a deduction for the full value of the assets you contribute. In effect you get a double deduction equal to the unrealized appreciation in your assets (plus the single deduction of your cost basis.
* The second is to utilize a Donor-Advised Fund. By giving to a DAF, you are able to claim a full tax deduction in the current tax year but you don't have to decide right away where all of the money goes. You can leave the funds waiting to be distributed at some later date, and even invest them for additional growth in the meanwhile. Fidelity &amp; Schwab both run DAFs with low minimums.

\\A CPA, again, can help map out exactly how the numbers would work for you.

**Yeah, but none of that works for me. What are advanced techniques I can use?**

All of the above is well and good, but if you need to sell soon, and you don't have losses to offset, and you're already maxing your 401k, then none of that will actually help you. This is where we get to the problem I mentioned: there are no really good ways to help you beyond this, ***and the best answer for most people is just to pay their taxes and move on***\*.\* But if you want to explore all your options, here is a running list of ways to cut down on capital gains taxes. Note that the first 3 here all require significant amounts of pre-planning. If you're talking about gains you have already realized in the current tax year, you can skip down the list to number 4.

1. Sell through a **Charitable Remainder Trust.** A CRT is a special purpose vehicle you create with the help of a lawyer. You transfer your appreciated assets into the trust, at which point you can sell them without incurring an immediate tax bill. The proceeds remain within the trust, and can even be reinvested, and are disbursed back to you over a predetermined schedule with a set formula for handling of income. You will still pay capital gains taxes, but only when the money is transferred from the trust to you, which can keep you in lower tax brackets. But the catch is that you must commit a portion of your value to charity, and there are strict legal requirements around how the payoff schedule can be structured. CRTs come in various forms (CRATs, CRUTs) and are highly complicated. A consultation with a knowledgeable lawyer would be necessary to explore this.
2. Sell through a **Deferred Sales Trust.** This is somewhat similar to a CRT, in that you first transfer assets into a trust, which can then liquidate them but then distribute the assets to you over time. And unlike a CRT, a DST does not require specific formulas or a charitable interest. But it has a major drawback: a DST cannot be something you control. You must hand over control of the trust to an external trustee (someone not connected with you), letting them make investment decisions and charging a (probably substantial) fee for their service. DSTs are a highly bespoke legal structure and you can expect to pay hefty fees to set up and maintain them.
3. Move to **Puerto Rico**. Residents of PR are exempt from federal capital gains tax, but there are some big exceptions here. A big one is that this does not apply to stock gains that were accrued before you moved to the island. If you're sitting on huge $ in your appreciated stocks, that will remain taxable even if you wait until you move to sell. PR is a better option for crypto investors, because crypto is currently treated as property rather than an investment and thus qualifies for the tax exemption. But to take advantage of this, you must jump through all the hoops to establish PR as your true tax home; you cannot just take a long vacation there. If you are interested in this, you should look for a tax lawyer knowledgable with it. The /r/act2022 subreddit may have additional resources for you.
4. Reinvest in a **Qualified Opportunity Zone**. QOZs are regions of the US that the government has targeted for economic revival, and has incentivized this by giving investors a deferral on gains taxes if they reinvest in a business within the QOZ. It's important to note that this is a *deferral,* not an exemption; you will still owe taxes on those gains by the end of 2026. This may help if you want to cut your gains in half, for example; you can realize some now and punt the rest 5 years out. This also gets you 5 years in which your gains can continue growing, so there is some compounding growth benefit. But there are (again) many caveats here. Finding an appropriate investment is challenging; you must invest in a business that meets certain community criteria and thus accept a lot of risk. You can invest indirectly by giving your money to a Qualified Opportunity Fund that invests in businesses for you, but you will incur management fees by doing so, and you're still taking on risk. You could find your investment losing more value than your tax benefits.
5. Start **your own business** with a big upfront capital cost. This is the most dangerous approach, because the IRS takes a hard look at anyone claiming aggressive tax write-offs in a business's early years, especially if you're spending the money on lifestyle things like cars or real estate. And, of course, this approach also does not put more money in your pocket;  you still need to commit $X to save &lt;less than $X&gt; on taxes. And if your business does not turn profitable, or if the IRS decides it's really a hobby, you risk an audit that wipes out your deduction entirely and leaves you paying taxes on money you no longer have.

So there you have it: most of the ways to minimize or defer cap gains taxes come with huge drawbacks.

**Appendix A - What about real estate?**

With real estate, you have much better options, depending on whether we're talking about your personal residence or an investment property.

With your **personal residence**, you are entitled to exempt the first 250k of capital gains on the sale of your home, and it's doubled to 500k for a married couple. This exemption requires that you have both lived in and owned the home for 2 of the last 5 years. If you are moving out sooner than 2 years, then you still might qualify for a smaller exemption if you moved for reasons related to job or health. Pub 523 has more info: [https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc701](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc701)

With **investment properties,** you can use something called a ""1031 exchange"" to sell a property and re-invest your proceeds without paying any taxes. 1031 exchanges are complicated and have a lot of caveats; talking an experienced accountant is advised if you want to go this route.

**Appendix B - What about stock options I received from my employer, and which might become very valuable in the near future?**

Normally, stock-based compensation is treated as income in the year you receive it, or in which you become able to sell it (e.g. when your company IPOs). However, if you anticipate a lucrative future payday from company stock grants, you may qualify at doing what is called an ""83b election."" This allows you to pay tax on the value of your stock today (and if you have options instead of just stock, this lets you exercise them and hold the stock) . Later on, when the stock is sold after IPO or some other liquidity event, the gains in value from the date of the 83b will be treated as capital gains rather than income, and if more than a year has passed they will be treated as long-term gains complete with a lower tax rate. This can greatly reduce the taxation on a big IPO payday.

However, there is a big catch - if the stock later becomes worthless, you can only claim a capital loss based on what you actually paid for the stock. If your company folds rather than succeeds, you will have paid taxes on income you never received with no way to recover it.

Additionally, what you can do with regards to stocks is a complicated subject that really depends on the nature of the compensation you're getting (non qualified stock options vs. restricted stock vs. RSUs, etc.). Best to consult with a tax advisor about your specifics.",finance

Global markets were rattled today due to fears that Evergrande, the second-largest real estate developer in China with over $300 billion in liabilities, would default on its debt obligations and what the potential implications on the Chinese, and even, global economy may be. If Evergrande were to default, there are fears that the potential damage to Evergrande‚Äôs lenders could lead to a contagion of the entire Chinese economy. Ming Tan, Director at credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor‚Äôs said, it was unlikely that Evergrande‚Äôs default would cause a credit crisis ‚Äúby itself‚Äù but acknowledges the risk of contagion spreading into the financial sector and the implication that has for other sectors. He said, ‚ÄúBanks‚Äô exposure to Evergrande is quite distributed across the sectors. The main risk for China‚Äôs financial system would be other highly leveraged developers to default at the same time.‚Äù 

Since I am not a macroeconomist nor proficient in Chinese policy, I don‚Äôt feel comfortable drawing conclusions on the potential global implications of the default, though personally I do not yet see how contagion would spread globally like in 2008 given China‚Äôs financial sector remains comparatively insular, unlike the US. While comparisons are being drawn to Lehman Brothers, a US bank whose bankruptcy catalyzed the global 2008 recession (which largely did not affect China), I think those comparisons are not correct for a few reasons, though please note this is just my humble opinion.

1. For starters, it is almost a certainty the CCP will aggressively intervene in the case of a default given Evergrande is designated as an entity of ‚Äúsystemic importance‚Äù in China and President Xi has proven to have no problem wielding a heavy hand when it‚Äôs forced. For example, In November 2008 the government introduced a 4 trillion Yuan stimulus package (roughly $620 billion or 14 % of 2008 GDP) for 2009 and 2010. Countless other examples exist. 
2. As I said above, the relationship between Chinese and US lenders is limited at best, unlike Lehman Brothers, which existed in the balance sheets of financial institutions worldwide. This means any damage caused within China has is likely to be contained within its own economy. 
3. Unlike Lehman Brothers, Evergrande still has tangible assets that will be sold off to help settle financial obligations. While their assets aren‚Äôt great and creditors know the company is in trouble, the sale of physical assets will help some. On the other, Lehman Brothers never had hard assets it could sell-off.

In other news, market participants are looking ahead to commentary from the Federal Reserve‚Äôs latest monetary policy meeting set to be released Monday. As has been the theme for the past few months, market participants are looking for signals as to when the Fed may begin tapering the current pace of quantitative easing. As I have said before, I remain uncensored by QE tapering, I think the real test for equities will come when the Fed starts discussing interest rate hikes

personalfinance,How to weigh financial windfall options involving student loans?,"Looking for risk/reward insight about repaying federal student loan debt!

My wife and I are in the processing of buying a new house and selling our current one. We are under contract on both and got a terrific offer for our current home and so should be receiving an higher than expected windfall from the sales proceeds. I know things can always change before close but we're trying to assess options now.

We'll likely have \~$100K in proceeds and would love any advice on how to attack some debts/fund other projects. We meet a lot of suggested goals (6 mo em savings, max Roths, get employer match for 401K). We're both in our early 30s with two kids.

Some options we're weighing are:

* Put 10% more equity in our new house ($50K) and recast (not refi) the loan ($150 fee) to lower our P&amp;I and remove PMI ($80/month).
* Pay off car loan $7.5K at 3.5%
* We have $76K combined in student loan debt, all federal and varying interest rates (highest is 6%). We're both in PSLF (6 years in for me, 4 years for wife) and I'm wary of making any extra payments on these until we get clarification about yes/no on any debt cancellation and/or any changes to the PSLF program. I'd hate to pay a big chunk and then hear it would've be forgiven 6 months later. Would it make sense to set aside a portion of the windfall in some sort of investment vehicle and just withdraw a few times a year to set aside for our monthly income based repayment?
* Just invest a good portion of the windfall in various mutual funds/ETFs that cover wide swaths of the market.
* Any other suggestions welcome!",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Debt isn't bad, and using crypto profits to buy a house when interest rates are this low is a bad idea (in most cases).","I get taking profits, I really do. I also get that drowning yourself in debt is a bad move. But I feel like people really need to understand that there are ways to make debt work to your advantage, and it really isn't something to be afraid of.

Specifically in the US right now, you can get a home loan for around 3-4% interest. Houses appreciate at between 7-10% on average per year. So, what does that mean? Well yeah, you end up taking on some debt... but that debt ends up netting you 5-7% return per year. The interest is offset by the increase in value of your property. Even better: this is money you didn't have before. And this magic money is now providing you a solid return. This is the definition of making money work for you. And even better - you are making THE BANK'S money work for you. 

On top of that, why would anyone sell the fastest appreciating asset in modern history??? The only reason to sell your crypto is if you believe it cannot outperform the 5-7% average yearly return that you would get if you bought a house with that money. Given current trends, crypto most definitely beats that, and likely will continue to for some time. So, not only do you get a 5-7% return on loaned money, but you also get your 20-600% returns on your own money. Win win all around.

Anyways, this obviously isn't a one-case-fits-all scenario. Everyone's circumstances are different, and there is obviously a caveat to avoid becoming overly indebted. And don't overleverage. But since most people here are in it for the money - please make sure to just do some research on debt, interest rates, and the like before just outright opting for a debt free life. If you have a stable income, and plan to continue accumulating wealth for a while then it is highly likely that safely taking on some debt is actually a much faster way to get to financial freedom than not doing so. 

This doesn't only apply to houses. This is just one example of making debt work in your favor. There are plenty of others but houses are a relatively safe and common example that are easy to explain.

personalfinance,Setting Realistic Expectations for a Budget,"I (22M) was just recently offered a Software Engineering gig as a recent grad with a base salary of 88k a year. The job would require me to relocate across the country to a relatively large metro area in the midwest with plenty of suburbs/housing options.

However, despite being well-compensated, I will have around 75k in undergrad student loan debt to repay. I have done numerous different tax calculators to understand my rough monthly take-home pay, tried giving myself a rough budget estimate etc.

With a repayment period of 10 years, I would be looking at a 800-900 monthly student loan payment (most of my loans are federally subsized/have moderately low interest-rates).

Moreover, I was unsure how frugal I should be with how much I should spend on rent. Coming from the Great Plains, spending 1.5k a month on a 'nice' apartment sounds absurd and like a pure waste. Yet, I'm also very keen on having a nice environment to decompress/work hybrid when needed (also having amenities is important). Not to mention, this area of the country is entirely unfamiliar to me and I know absolutely no one there, hence a 'hip' area with a good social scene would also be a plus.

So, is it practical to spend a little bit more on rent to ensure I place myself in the best situation to succeed, or should I be fiscally 'smart' and adhere to a stricter rent-budget?",finance

This might be a silly question, but should I pay off all of interest that has accrued from my student loans and then start tackling the principal with the highest interest? Or should I just focus on the principal ($29.5k) with highest interest rate (7.6%), which also happens to be my  biggest loan. I‚Äôve already paid off the accrued interest for this loan. 

Let me know if I should provide more info!

Edit: I‚Äôve left out a crucial piece. I‚Äôm in my grace period, so interest hasn‚Äôt been added to my principal yet, and I don‚Äôt have a minimum payment due (yet). My bad everyone. I asked this question to figure out how to maximize the grace period and the 0% interest rate.

stocks,"Evergrande isn‚Äôt the only reason the stock market is headed lower, here are 7 other reasons","I've summarised the news and added a link just in case you guys want to read the complete article-

U.S. stock benchmarks were on track to post their worst daily drops in more than two months, with the skid being blamed on the potential collapse of Evergrande. The Chinese property giant is threatening to default on $300 billion in debt that could ripple through global markets. However, the downturn in the highly leveraged real-estate sector, which the Financial Times notes makes up more than 28% of China‚Äôs economy, isn‚Äôt the only problem for markets on Monday. Here are the other reasons-

**Delta woes**

The delta variant of COVID-19 is resulting in higher case tallies in the world‚Äôs largest economy. The U.S. is now averaging more than 2,000 deaths daily, according to a New York Times tracker, the most since March 1, and consist almost entirely of unvaccinated people. Florida, which has vaccinated 56% of its population, is averaging 353 deaths a day. Texas, where 50% of the population is inoculated, is seeing 286 deaths a day, according to the Times. Those two states account for more than 30% of all COVID-19 deaths since March 1. 

**Fed taper talk**

Markets are fixated on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee‚Äôs Sept. 21-22 meeting, where Fed officials face the prospect of winding down the accommodations that have propped markets up since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., even as the economic rebound looks uneven. The Fed has been buying $80 billion in Treasurys and $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities each month since last June to keep long-term interest rates low and bolster demand.  A number of Fed officials have expressed a desire to announce tapering at the September meeting and begin the initiative before year-end. Investors are anxious about the timetable for such reductions and are also looking out for any signals of an interest-rate increase in 2022.

**Debt ceiling**

On Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urged Congress to raise or suspend the nation‚Äôs debt ceiling or risk ‚Äúwidespread economic catastrophe.‚Äù In an op-ed published by the Wall Street Journal, Yellen, a former Fed chair, noted that the U.S. has never defaulted, and she said it must not do so now.

**September and stock-market seasonality**

There is a growing sense that valuations are rich and the Federal Reserve‚Äôs easy-money punchbowl will be yanked away at the worst possible time. Seasonally, September has been one of the worst months for stocks, and investors think that the market might behave true to that pattern.

**A correction is due**

Strategists think that the market is due for a significant pullback as the S&amp;P 500 has recorded more than 200 sessions without having seen a drawdown of 5% or more from a recent peak, making the current stretch of levitation the longest such since around 2016, when the market went 404 sessions without falling by at least 5% peak to trough.

**Inflation lingers**

Inflation continues to dog markets. Data recently showed that the cost of living for Americans rose in August at the slowest pace in seven months and signalled the surge in inflation this year may have peaked, but Americans probably aren‚Äôt going to get much relief from these elevated prices soon.

Aside from a brief oil-driven spike in 2008, consumer prices have risen this year at the fastest pace in three decades. And a new survey by the New York Federal Reserve shows consumers expect inflation to average 5.2% in the next 12 months.

**Buy the dip?**

Investors have grown accustomed to buying market downturns, referred to as buying the dip. However, Monday‚Äôs action, and trading over the past week, suggests that investors are becoming more reluctant to purchasing beaten-down stocks with expectations that stock values will resume record run-ups after modest declines. On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 closed below its short-term trend line for the first time since around June, which could reflect the erosion of buy-the-dip behaviours.

stocks,Volatility in the market,"So yall saw the vix shoot up and stocks decline , why was that ? Well these are some of the reasons I found.

1) Well the selloff aka pullback started back 2 weeks ago as wallstreet started realizing that stimulus money had ended and that the reason why there was so much consumer spending was due to stimulus. **Basically higher valuation fears, the market thinks growth will be slower with no huge stimulus that these evaluations these companies had were too high thus we had that pull back as the market was pricing that in.**

(I will note that I think the market are partly right on this , a lot of people saved up a shit ton of cash this past year and are waiting for better deals before spending their cash. Especially with all this transitory inflation)

2) Fed taper- yes everyone and their mom agrees that it will probably happen in November/December or even early 2022 but even then people are fearful and waiting for a direct answer from the fed this upcoming fomc meeting. So when that is answered the vix will probably shoot down.

(I am thinking that the FED will announce that the taper will start later such as nov or dec and this will cause the market to enjoy a nice rally leading into q3 earnings season. This is just my 2 cents  but that evergande situation does concern me)

3) Evergande - Monday and Tuesday , are national holidays in china thus their markets are closed . People are speculating whats going to happen. They have interest payments that are due later on this week , I believe Thursday and a lot of people are thinking they will default the payment. Thus fucking their investors/lenders who are expected to write it off as a loss .The CCP said they would not allow a bail out to happen , which is ether a bluff or they actually are serious . There is discussion of a refinancing that could happen , but other than that it isnt looking too good for the company.

These are just my opinions please let me know what yall think will happen ! Have a great day",finance
CryptoCurrency,Evergrande even and posible outcomes(this is long),"Hi, first of all i'm obligated to describe what is Bitcoin, because a lot of people didn't know what is it, feel free to skip paragraph 1. if you already know it.

1. Bitcoin blockchain from a pure economic perspective is just a private, secure and inmutable liquidity pool tokenized by btc symbol and collateralized by fiat.

Okay if that is clear let's examine what Evergrande debacle comes from and posible scenarios,

not just Evergrande but all the mayor Chinese companies grow on foreign debt.

major events:

prior to 2007: China fast growing due to good exports bough at debt by EU and USA

2007: Leman Brothers meme (debt bubble crisis). No more x1000 leverage and el cheapo credit but China didn't want to stop double digit grow rates.

2008-2013: China use foreign debt to raise grow and incentivise internal expense, that happen because arbitrage investors take low interest loans fueled by USA FED and use that liquidity to jump into high yield China bonds. Mode info-&gt; ""Quantitative easing 2009""

2014: (Tapering) US FED saids no more cheap liquidity. Then China lows the interest rate on popular bank bonds to stimulate their debt.(el cheapo credit for all Chinese people sponsored by China gov)

2020: Corona, China DD  in debt.

2021 Grow rates are not enough to pay debt + House crisis in China(Basically it's the only good they can purchase to invest, that's why bitcoin was so popular there)

Important to remember:

Chinese investors mostly invest in real state (there is common to own 2 or 3 houses and at least 1 house at 25 yo, also it's very difficult there to found a wife if you don't own a house, this is not because they don't know about other stocks but because they can't invest in foreign stocks and they don't trust Chinese companies.

&amp;#x200B;

Posibles outcomes:

1. Chinese GOV restructures the debt of all zombie companies, and no major economic downturn happen. Chinese investors will learn the lesson and get scare about real state and turns to other investment vehicles difficult to trace for their like cryptos.
2. Chinese GOV can't restructure the debt and stocks panic sell. &lt;- That means free liquidity is going to be up, and as I mention in the top btc is just a private liquidity pool. So an scenario like 2007 free drop(institutional balance account reestructure) and 2008 jump(private investors not trusting FIAT to deposit free liquidity from stocks) could be another scenario.

Edit: That two scenarios are only valid if USD and other FIATs keeps  high inflationary policies

&amp;#x200B;

If you get this far Thanks for reading.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Just read Posible outcomes.

personalfinance,Cash-Out Refi Plan - is it Sound?,"Trying to make this as straightforward as I can, but would appreciate some advice!

Wife and I own our home, $180k left on the mortgage. We bought at $190k, but home values are $250-260k currently (lots of comps now, unlike when we bought). We've refi'd once, and are now down to 3.75%. Payment is $1100/mo, with $100 being PMI.

We have about $45k in Fed student loans we are continuing to pay down, and $8k on a car loan at ~4.5%. Credit is excellent. We are SWIMMING in refi offers, so I'm trying to choose what makes sense.

**My hope would be to refi at a lower rate, drop the PMI, and cash out $10k to knock out the auto loan and help us drop the largest student loan balance as well.** Emergency fund, retirement, and student loan payments are all fully funded.

I know the market is overinflated, but our county-appraised value (historically very low) is $220k for our home. Therefore, I was thinking leveraging $10k in equity to pay off the car and shift the $400-500/month to student loan payments (saved from PMI &amp; car payment) would be a big help, with minimal risk, even if the market declines. We can afford to stay in our home through a crash if needed.

Thoughts? I know it will depend on rates and closing costs as to how the math works out, but I wanted to run my thought process by you good folks first. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,The Ideal Safety Features:Price Ratio of Car Buying,"I apologize in advance for the title of this post. I really struggled with how to summarize my question. 

**TL;DR: My wife is pregnant and when the baby is born we will have 4 children 5 &amp; under. This is the last kid.  lol   At what point does a new enough/expensive enough car meet sufficient safety standards for a family with 4 very young kids? I want to keep my family safe but not break the bank. Are the safety features on a used 2010 Toyota Sienna good enough? What about a new 2022 Honda Pilot? A used 2018 Chrysler Pacifica? Does a used $15,000 car get me just as safe a car as a new $30,000 car?**


So here are some details to explain my exact situation. 

**Car Situation**

We currently have a 2004 Toyota Sienna XLE Limited with 175,000 miles on it that we bought years ago when I was still in grad school for $5,000. I think the time to upgrade is shortly arriving and I would like to get a new car sometime between Sep 2022 and March 2023, giving me roughly 12-18 months to figure out a plan and hopefully let the market cool down a bit with the chip issues. 

I generally prefer to buy used as I don't like eating depreciation costs, however, this is the first time I'm buying a car with a big boy salary ($95,000). In my mind, I should be looking at a ~2012-2015 3rd row car and whether that's a minivan or a midsize to large SUV it doesn't matter. I can find those in the $10,000-$18,000 range depending on miles and trim and all that good stuff. However, I'm probably too stingy with my money and need some perspective and help to find where to draw the line on safety and price and some level of luxury/convenience. 


**Financial details**

I currently have $6000 set apart for a down payment and I am adding about $100/month to it until we end up buying one. This gives me 20% down a ~$30,000 car. With a credit score of 780, I can get a plenty good rate.  My wife is a SAHM and we only have my income. My income is about as steady and secure as you can get. I am a federal employee many years past my probation period with years of highly-rated annual reviews with important responsibilities. 

If I follow the classic advice of 20% down, 4 years, no more than 10% of monthly gross then that means I could very reasonably buy a ~$42,000 car and have my payments in the ~$750-$800 range which is about 10% of my gross. This seems like an absurd amount to spend on a car, though, unless I'm just a tightwad who doesn't value the newest and best in safety for his kids? Even if you toss in insurance and gas costs into the 10% it would still probably be close to a $40,000 car. 

Does a 2021 or newer ~$40,000 car which costs about 10% of my monthly gross provide significantly better safety and value for my young family than an older used ~2014 car which would only be about 4% of my monthly gross? 

**Help me find the balance between being too much of a financial tightwad and taking care of my family within my means**

CryptoCurrency,Less than 12 hours to see who was right.,"In less than 12 hours the Chinese markets open. For those unaware, they have been closed the last 2 days for holiday in China. Looks like approximately 9:30 am over there is the open, which puts us at about 9:30 pm EST.

That's when the Evergarde shit will hit the fan. Multiple things could go down:

1.) CCP announces a bailout for them. Unlikely currently, but NOBODY wants a repeat of 2008.

2.) MASSIVE crypto pump today. Like all the big ones (ETH, BTC, etc) see gains of 4-5% or more. This could be indicative of a coming dump on Wednesday/Thursday. Beware of seeing pumps close to 9pm tonight (EST).

2a.) ...But also, the dumpage yesterday could mean a massive rebuy of crypto that could be hiding assets of those that invested in Evergarde. It *could* be a good thing if we see prices in the green today. However, that boils down to money laundering, so if that IS the case, expect a response from the Fed on US soil in a week or 2 clamouring for regulations if this is the case.

3.) The markets will be dumping hard. Stocks, bonds, and crypto to liquidate. It most definitely affects global markets just like the 08 crash did (though not as large). Expect to see drops on futures, and throughout Wednesday and Thursday. Friday might see some corrections from this.

4.) Crypto is going to be liquidated first. Honest truth and a hard truth. It's intangible digital money. And even will all the evidence of ""practical us"", it can't be used for shit and smart economics says ditch it first. Think of how much you buy with actual cryptocurrency (not crypto you converted to cash) and realize this is mostly true.You get your cash assets out of it to bail yourself out of their junk bonds and bad margins. After that, liquidate stocks as well. Same shit.

5.) There could be an impending downturn for major crypto. BTC sub $35k, ETH sub $2200. This shit scares everyone.

6.) Maybe this is all wrong and the crash part happened yesterday and now it's green dildos for the rest of September.

TL; DR: September still sucks for crypto. But I think we will bull run in October when this shit settles the fuck down.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Alright you skin based humanoid monkeys,"Since everyone and their moms are panic selling crypto due to the overwhelming fear that the Evergrande situation could screw up both equities and crypto currencies, I will be buying and holding the dip. Here‚Äôs why:

The equities market was already stuffed to the gills in February and was still overbought throughout the summer until we get here right now, where everyone and their moms expect a huge crash. 

Crypto, in my opinion, is not stuffed to the gills. At all. We aren‚Äôt even the market cap of Microsoft as a whole industry. 

Inflation, COVID, colder weather, upgrades, adoption every second every minute, market stagnation perhaps slow burn‚Ä¶crypto may dip and slow and rise but I DO NOT BELIEVE for goddamn second we will go into a Bear market until we reach BTC and ETH all time highs once again. It won‚Äôt happen. It‚Äôs psychological. Humans are programmed to succeed beyond the previous accomplishments (in this case, price targets) 

Don‚Äôt believe that if you sell, that you will just be waiting around for the bear market again where you can freely pickup $500 ETH or 10k Bitcoin. 

In fact. This is the moment in time to ignore the stupid fucking fud and focus on the real threats to crypto currency. If those real threats are not imminent, keeping buying and keep holding because all it takes is one moment‚Ä¶and this market is gonna run.

I'd like to preface this post by apologizing for my complete lack of insurance/car knowledge. I am a 20 year old female who escaped an abusive home. I was strictly forbidden from doing basic things like learning to drive, getting a job, having my own bank account, etc. I'm on my own now and kind of figuring out everything as I go since I did not have parents that fed me, let alone taught me about car insurance.

cardano,"In the longterm, will ADA ownership become more centralized towards the largest holders?","Since ADA has a capped supply, according to the monetary policy, the newly minted ADA decreases over time. With that said, it's my understanding that the staking rewards will not be decreased in parallel to the newly minted ADA, but that they will become more subsidized over time by transaction fees until they are entirely funded by transaction fees. I could be wrong, but that's my understanding. If this is the case, this would mean that the largest holders of ADA will, after a long time, will end up holding a large majority of the supply because it can be assumed that usage, and therefore the majority of transaction fees, will be dependent on the majority of users in the system. I think we can easily assume that the largest holders, won't also be incurring the largest portion of transaction fees. It will be the largest number of users that will be incurring the largest amount of fees. This would inevitably lead to a small group of holders amassing a large majority of the ADA. So long as the staking rewards aren't coming from newly minted supply, it would seem that the majority of the burden to subsidize the network's staking rewards would fall on the largest group of users, which will certainly in the future, not own the most ADA. 

If this is the case, what kind of solutions can we create to mitigate this problem?

personalfinance,"Purchasing new home not built yet, should we rate lock?","Me and my wife have recently placed earnest money on a new build in a area we really love. It's our first home so we are very excited! Expected completion dates is around 210 days as the home hasn't even been started yet. 

We have a lender we'd like to use as they offer a very good APR with incentives towards closing costs. They are currently offering a promotion for an extended rate lock for $1500 upfront. 

\- 110 day lock available at current 60 day rate.

\- 170 day lock .125% above the current 60 day rate. For example, if current 60 day rate is 3% with no points your rate would be 3.125% on a 170 day lock.

\- 260 day lock .375% above the current 60 day rate.

\- 350 day lock .5%¬†¬†¬†¬† above the current 60 day rate

The interest rate we were quoted was 2.750% with an APR of 2.878%. No points were added. 

There is an option for a single float down, if rates are lower, at least 60 days before close. The rate lock cannot be extended.

personalfinance,Retirement plan through insurance company. Is this a good offer?,"Hi. Im 25, dont live in the US, and have no idea how to invest for my retirement. I live in Bosnia. We dont have pre-tax IRAs here, we have a pension fund (that I cant control how much I contribute to or receive from). I have no idea how to find a financial advisor here (they all seem to be for companies). I need help deciding if the offer I got from an insurance company is good.

The offer:
1400 EUR/year installment
35 years (until I‚Äôm 60)
59,000 EUR insured sum (how much I‚Äôd‚Äôve paid and the minimum I‚Äôd get back)
69,000 EUR insured sum + gains

The fine print says the ‚Äúgain‚Äù is calculated based on forecasted interest rates for the following years. Its not guaranteed. 

I can even do an option where it does not get paid out lump sum in 35 years, rather monthly (like a paycheck or pension) for the next e.g. 15 years and the principal still continues to grow, meaning that all in all, I would receive around 91,000 EUR (my insured sum + forecasted gains). 50 years adds up. Also if I croak, my husband can inherit whatever I‚Äôd contributed thus far + any gains on that. And I can change the installment at the end of each year if I want. 

Is this a good idea? I don‚Äôt really have any better options. This would only be like 10% of my income, so its not a big deal. I can use more of my ‚Äúsavings money‚Äù to invest in real estate or something else to *diversify*.

More info: Husband and I will pay off our car and mortgage within the next 3 years. No other debt. We have an emergency fund, and I have vested stocks in my company.

personalfinance,"Would you decrease retirement savings for a down payment on a house, with the caveat that you're already behind on retirement?","My wife and I (26, 27 y/o) are currently renting, and we are looking to buy a house as soon as possible (ideally within the next year) for the following reasons:

* She recently started a job that is completely WFH. We live in a small city apartment, so we need more space for that.
* Since she no longer works in the city, it is wasteful to pay the increased cost of living and taxes continuing to rent here, so we'd like to move closer to my job to shorten the commute
* We have some hard requirements that are hard to find in a rental in the areas we are looking for. For example, it needs to be wheelchair accessible, and it needs to be pet friendly, in addition to the requirement for more space for a WFH office as mentioned before. *Very* few rentals meet these requirements.
* In the areas we're looking at, the rental prices just don't make sense. On the rent alone, some quick math says that paying for a mortgage, insurance, property taxes, repair savings, and PMI would be the cheaper than renting. We'd also save money by leaving the city but it's hard to quantify exactly how much.
* I personally believe that, while housing prices are at an all time high right now, the low interest rates make it appealing to buy now. Housing prices might be slightly cheaper in the future, but those savings would be less than the additional mortgage cost as interest rates increase.

So for these reasons we decided to start saving for a house. Our current lease ends in June, so we'd like to move next summer or fall. We are trying to save 3.5% for a house down payment as soon as possible, plus another 3.5% for closing costs. The houses we are looking at are $400k, so we'd need $28k cash for the down payment and the closing costs. We would like to do this without taking any money from our savings accounts.

Each month we currently save:

Monthly saving | Purpose
---|---
$1000 | Roth IRA (maxed)
$1230 | 401(k) (neither of us get a match FYI)
$428 | ""Known unknown"" Savings (unexpected vet bills, medical expenses, car expenses, etc)
$0 | ""Unknown unknowns"" emergency fund (stopped after reaching 6 month goal)
$1200 | House downpayment

Our balances currently look like:

Current balance | Purpose
---|---
$6k | Roth IRA
$20k | 401(k)
$4k | ""Known unknown"" Savings
$30k | ""Unknown unknowns"" emergency fund (6 months of expenses)
$0 | House downpayment (haven't started yet)

The amount we currently are saving for the down payment isn't enough for the down payment and closing costs in the timeframe we are hoping for. However if we stopped putting money into the 401(k) for a year then it would be easy to do so. Since we don't get any matching we wouldn't be leaving money on the table by doing this.

I've already done research and people generally believe that 1 year isn't a long time to skip retirement savings, especially if it's being used for a house which can decrease living expenses after retirement. The problem is that we're already behind the standard ""1x gross annual salary by age 30"" rule of thumb. Based on our current balances, if we funnelled all 401(k) contributions into the house for 12 months then switched back to the schedule I outlined in the first table above, we wouldn't reach the ""1x gross annual salary"" goal until we are 32. We would then need to scrimp up a bit in order to reach the next goal of ""3x gross annual salary by age 40.""

Edit: Since I was asked a few times how affordable a 400k house would be for us, I want to clarify that 400k is our max. We'd are actually hoping for 350k. In any case, I've included our numbers below:

Monthly amount | Purpose
---|---
$14754 | Gross monthly income
 | 
-$4125 | State, federal, and city tax withholdings
-$446 | Non-retirement pre-tax deductions (e.g. medical premiums)
-$4459 | Required expenses to live and make money (rent, groceries, fuel, etc)
-$3858 | Savings (see first table above)
- ~$1900 | Discretionary spending (gym membership, restaurants, netflix, anything not needed to survive)",finance

stocks,Michael Burry's 2nd Big Short: Tesla (Part 1),"**Overview**:

Tesla is the current king of the EV industry, having accounted for nearly 80% of EV sales in 2020. Between their S, 3, X, and Y models, they sold [a total of 200,561 cars in 2020](https://electrek.co/2021/02/16/tesla-owns-electric-car-market-us/) according to *Electrek.* (Note that these numbers significantly differ from the investor decks, which show a total of 499,647 cars delivered in 2020, and 386,181 through H1 2021.)

They‚Äôre actively gearing up for continued growth, undertaking significant capital projects in Texas (Y, CT), and Germany (Y only), continue to expand the capacity of their existing production facilities in California and China, and are developing the Semi, Roadster, and the as-yet-unnamed future product. (Slide 7, Q2 2021 Investor Deck)

Beyond that, due to their acquisition of SolarCity, Tesla is also a dealer in the renewable energy business, via their rooftop solar photovoltaic products and home &amp; grid-scale battery storage products, notably also introducing their Virtual Power Plant [pilot program in California](https://electrek.co/2021/07/16/tesla-launches-virtual-power-plant-powerwalls-help-california-grid/) this past July.

Straight from the company itself - Tesla‚Äôs mission is to accelerate the world‚Äôs transition to sustainable energy.

**Necessary Caution**

Disclosure up front - I am currently bearish on Tesla, with a growing put position fairly far out of the money. I'm not looking to dig my heels in on this position, though. Unlike many bear theses I have seen, though, I don't see Tesla crashing to double-digits anytime soon (barring some rather specific severe catalysts), and despite alluding to a possible frenzy-fueled crash to $100, I don't think Burry does either. There are a lot of legitimate risks to Tesla's value to analyze without resorting to bankruptcy theories or accusations of fraudulent accounting, and there are many legitimate reasons to support its stratospheric valuation, as well. I happen to think the risks outweigh the justifications, but that's just me. I'll be exploring those over this series of posts.

**First things first - Bull Cases**

I won't be analyzing these in this post, but I'd like to acknowledge them. ARK Invest has some well-known theories to support their 2025 price target of $3000 - Establishment of a proprietary ride-hailing service, success of autonomous full-self driving, increased market share in both EV and insurance, and continued realizations of manufacturing efficiency as described by Wright's Law.

Possibilities ARK left out of [their Monte Carlo Model](https://github.com/ARKInvest/ARK-Invest-Tesla-Valuation-Model):

\- Significant expansion of their grid storage, solar, and VPP businesses

\- Cybertruck captures a significant market share of electric trucks

\- Tesla Semi goes first to the market and captures majority share

\- Excess production capacity/expertise is used in a significantly profitable way (Think AWS)- Simplified government subsidies tip the auto market in favor of EVs

If you haven't seen it yet, I recommend perusing ARK's Monte Carlo model. It's an impressive piece of work, though I was dissatisfied with how every case was simply a bull case, even their ""bear case"" and ""minimum case."" Considering Tesla's mission, I also found it odd that ARK ignored Tesla's stationary battery and solar sectors entirely, but...moving on.

**Risks** **- or, the Bear Cases**

There's a lot here, so I'm only going to highlight my top favorites:

\- PR tipping point results in mass recall/sales freeze - Tesla crashes receive a disproportionately amplified level of negative attention and exaggerated coverage. Enough incidents like the one captured in Coral Gables, FL, though, (dashcam footage showed a fatal instant, explosive failure of the older battery pack upon an impact from beneath) would result in regulatory action and put a chill on the market for Tesla vehicles similar to that experienced by the Boeing 737 MAX.

\- **Black Swan** \- Unlike ARK's case of ""Tesla goes bankrupt"" my black swan case is a complete loss of confidence in the security of **all** Tesla products due to a successful cyberattack which causes real-world havoc. ([In general, the average member of the public may tend to penalize the victim of the cyberattack, not the perpetrator](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1909/1909.13256.pdf).)

\- The ""Solar City"" trial ruling ends with Elon Musk repaying Tesla the full cost of Solar City's bailout. Due to the leveraged nature of Musk's Tesla holdings, this would possibly lead to a significant chain of margin calls for him if he lacked the liquidity to pay this amount. (As Elon is the holder of around 20% of Tesla's stock, this would be a minor effect on the price.)- A rise in interest rates results in significant increase in the cost of Tesla's debt service.

\- **My personal focus** \- The ""everything shortage"" results in a pileup of undeliverable, unfinished inventory and/or a significant slowdown in production, drastically reducing their asset turnover. (Of note, Model S/X production went from 16,097 in Q4 2020 to 0 in Q1 2021, though this was completely offset by an increase in Model 3/Y production)

**Valuation**

I'm not going to set a price target in this post. I'm not there yet. I'll just provide the following for now. As Tesla is behaving more as a growth company, I did an extended DuPont breakdown of their finances. Whole-year 2021 projections were created by making a simple assumption that the H1 2020 to H1 2021 change percentage would be identical for H2 2020 to H2 2021. A flat $5B was added to 2020 assets and equity.

&amp;#x200B;

|Net Income|\-862|721|6,009|
|EBT|\-665|1,154|9,578|

|Revenue|24,578|31,536|58,625|
|Total Assets|34,409|52,148|57,148|

|Interest Burden|963.77%|57.87%|153.73%|
|EBIT Margin|\-0.28%|6.32%|10.63%|
|Asset Turnover|71.64%|60.47%|102.59%|
|Financial Levr.|518.42%|234.64%|209.91%|
|Rtn on Equity|\-13.3%|3.24%|22.07%|

As the ""best minimum"" ROE is 15%, if H2 2021 financial reports result in 2021 coming in close to my crude projection, ROE will approach 22%. Given that only two years ago ROE was negative, and was in the single digits last year, I feel that this is a sign of unsustainable growth, and the right mishap could finally force a rapid correction in the stock's price. Until then, my overall valuation is: **overvalued**.

Next time - I'll be checking the ROE numbers against ROA as I explore Tesla's debt.",finance

solar,request for advice on solar ppa in MA,"Hi all,

Sorry for the wall of text.  TLDR, is the proposed PPA a good deal and if not, what should I do about it?

  I'm new to this sub.  I bought a house in MA a few months ago and with the central air running in the hot summer months, my electricity bill is around $300/mo for 1276 kWh with an average daily use of 37.5 kWh (\~13,698 kWh/year).  Of the $300/mo bill, about half is a charge for ""supply"" and the other half is for ""delivery"".  There is also a $7.00 customer charge (which seems to be the only charge that is not based on kWh) and a $1.49 ""transition charge"" which appears to be negative.  All in all, if I am calculating correctly, I pay about $0.233/kWh plus the $7 customer charge, of which $0.10753/kWh is for supply. 

  I've got oil-fired heat and hot water so, I expect the bill for electricity  to go down considerably in the winter (of course solar generation goes down too) because I'm no longer running the central air.  

  Solar sales guy came around with their sales pitch for a PPA.  They propose to install an 18.02 kW system with a starting rate of 0.15/kWh and a 2.9% annual rate increase.  They project the average annual production for this system will be about 15,888 kWh (\~1,324 kWh/mo).  Note that this production number is quite a bit higher than my use during my highest period of expected usage.

  The agreement comes with a 25 year warranty on the panels and production and that sort of thing, and an option to purchase at market value at 5 years, transfer the PPA if you sell the house, or take ownership of the panels after the 25 year period.

   By my calculation, if I generate 100% of my electricity using solar panels, my cost would have been I guess something like 7+1.49=8.49 for the customer and transition charge, plus I guess approximately $199 for the approximately 1,324 kWh/mo\*$0.15/kWh.  Did I get that right?

  This seems like a good deal considering my \~300 dollar electricity bill now.  However if my bill (without solar) goes down to $200/mo (or less) in the winter, then it seems quite pointless.

  The sales guy said that in MA, if I overproduce I get paid back annually for my overproduction.  Is that right?  If so, do I get paid back at the rate I would pay for consumption (i.e., get paid back the blended supply and delivery rate of \~ $0.233/kWh) or just the rate I pay for supply?

  I know there are options other than PPA (loan, cash buy, etc.).  Let's say I'm not willing to spend 10s of thousands up front on solar.  A loan could work, but I'm not sure I could get an interest rate that would make this a better deal than the PPA.  Does that sound right?

   I could:

i) shop around for a better deal.  If I do that, what is a competitive deal?  Is $0.15/kWh a good deal?  What about the 2.9% annual increase?  Are these things negotiable?

ii) get a smaller system.  It seems like a 15 kW system would fit my needs.  In that scenario, I might have to pay my utility every once in a while, but that doesn't seem like a bad idea.  Does that sound right?

I'm happy to provide additional information.  JUST ASK!

personalfinance,Allocating 17k into investments vs debt,"Hey all, I know this topic comes up occasionally but I wanted to see what everyone thought given my circumstances.

I'm 23 and a recent college grad. I'm making 60k a year at my current position and have just over 44k in student loans. The loan has a 4.07% interest rate. I have an emergency fund set up and continue to save 10% of what I make as well as invest 10% into my retirement accounts while also making the minimum payments.

Outside of my retirement accounts and emergency fund, I have roughly 17k sitting in a taxable investment account that was saved over the pandemic. Up until yesterday I had understood that making the minimum payment on loans below ~5% and investing extra money was mathematically advantageous, so that's what I've been doing. However I have been debating whether or not I should put the 17k against the balance of my loan to lower my overall debt as well as give me a better debt/income ratio for when I'm ready to buy a house/property.

I think it would be advantageous to lower the debt faster so that I can speed up saving for a down payment once the bill is gone.

personalfinance,Is there any compelling reason not to max out a HELOC every month?,"I just made a payment on my HELOC again, as I do every month, and I realized that right after I made the payment, my available credit bumped up a notch on the web banking page.  

It occurred to me today that it seems to make little sense to not have this line of credit maxed out while paying higher interest rates on other debts.  Right now my financial priority is a 9.9% construction loan, then 7.9% and 6.8% student loans.  My HELOC, at 3.74%, is really my dead last priority to pay down/off.

Anyway, I still have a checkbook on this line, and I think it will remain in a revolving status for another two or three years.  Wouldn't it make at least mathematical sense for me to use the entire available balance of the HELOC to make a payment on one of my other debts after paying the minimum every single month?  

I haven't done this before because I've been wary of maxing it out just in general, but also because I like keeping some available credit on it to supplement my emergency fund.  However, right now I just keep looking at the interest I'm paying every month on all my other debts and it seems to me that increasing my payment on another debt by about the same amount as my HELOC payment would help me pay down that debt a little faster.  

I'm doing the one where you pay in order of interest rate, for the most part - which is kind of frustrating because right now I have several small accounts that are smaller than my savings account balance, but each is currently at a much lower rate than my student loans so I have to put the extra money to the costlier balances first.  

The only reason I ask is because it seems intuitive that you shouldn't keep a credit line maxed out while you are trying to get out of debt, but it also seems logical to me that, as this line is at a very affordable interest rate, it makes sense not just to only pay the minimum on it but to effectively pay even less by ratcheting the balance back up after each payment.  It just feels... I don't know, kind of sleazy to draw a check taking out the last $200 of a $50,000 credit line, especially to consider intentionally doing so month after month.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

We started just under 3 years ago as a VERY humble project with absolutely zero funding and completely based on reddit posts and a basic website/social media. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today we are a fully established 501c3 organization (non-profit registered by the irs) that is leading this niche category.   


You might be wondering - why is this organization necessary if there are homeless shelters and food kitchens? 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason is because 90% of the homeless people absolutely do not utilize ANY of those services for many many reasons (too far from their preferred area to pan-handle, disqualified due to addictions, places are too unsanitary/infested with bed bugs, lack of knowledge of location, mental/physical handicaps, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

We distinguish ourselves in that we do what most other charities do not do. We crowd fund without wasting a single penny on advertising, we have zero overhead/maintenance fees and use the funds for food. We HAND DELIVER the food to the homeless in the most difficult to reach areas in the city (yes I've gone to the dangerous areas under the bridge many times to hand the homeless people pizza). 

&amp;#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/5kkC7pM.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/5kkC7pM.jpg) \- this is a collage of images from earlier today to give an example of what we do.

&amp;#x200B;

Volunteers:

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently looking for regular/consistent volunteers (but even if you can only go out once it is still something we are looking for). If you are able to buy/hand out food and document everything exactly like how we do it on our websites/social media, you will be reimbursed 100% for the cost of food.

&amp;#x200B;

We've had several redditors volunteer for us and get reimbursed who can vouch for our integrity as well.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Full time workers:  


we are ALSO looking for full time workers (30 hours a week, work from home) 

we have various positions available, but they will mainly be related to social media, engagement, recruitment, etc. Currently, I have 2 positions open for this - so please message me if you are serious about it and we can proceed with a conversation/interview. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our organization QUALIFIES FOR PSLF (public service loan forgiveness) - meaning if you work for us for 10 years and make 120 qualifying payments towards your student loans, the rest of your student loans will be forgiven. HUGE incentive to help out the homeless and get your loans paid off. 

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless, thanks again for all of your support! Look for big things from us going forward.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,What's DeFi Systematic Risks ?,"# General Conclusion

Risk is one of the most prominent issues in traditional financial markets. In particular, risk helps investors to quantify a specific number representing an asset value, in order to assess whether that level of risk is acceptable.

In DeFi, however, risk is often undervalued as the majority of participants do not fully appreciate it. Several lending/borrowing protocols are at the forefront of this field when it comes to assessing the risk of an asset. In other protocols we rarely see full consideration of risk.

In this article, we will introduce the concept of systematic risk (generalised) from traditional markets to DeFi.

# What Is Systematic Risk?

Assuming you invest in a single asset, what is the source of risk for this ""portfolio""?

We can say that there are two common sources of uncertainty:

1. Risks arise from overall economic conditions, such as business cycles, inflation, interest rates and exchange rates. These economic factors are difficult to predict with certainty and all affect the return on assets.
2. Risk comes from the asset itself (specificity). For example, is the government controlling the asset or is their direct demand for it, etc. These factors affect one asset but do not affect other assets.

Now we look at the ""portfolio"" of even more assets (a diversification strategy), asking the same question, what about portfolio risk?

Diversifying multiple asset classes spreads the risk of the entire portfolio. The ability to decrease the value of one asset provides the ability to increase the value of another asset. These effects will offset and stabilise the return on the entire portfolio and portfolio volatility will continue to decrease.

However, even if we hold a certain amount of assets (e.g. &gt;1000 assets), we still cannot avoid risk completely, because almost all assets are affected by factors such as general macro factors. For example, if all assets held are affected by the business cycle, then we cannot avoid business cycle risk no matter how many assets we hold.

&gt;This risk that persists even after diversification is called market risk, which is associated with sources of market-wide risk. Such risk is also known as systematic risk, or non-diversifiable risk.

*Note: Risk that can be eliminated by diversification is called unique risk, nonsystematic risk, or diversifiable risk.*

 

**TLDR**:

In conclusion, risk analysis of DeFi protocols is a very complex process as the areas of risk exposure are very different and often interfere with each other. For example, a protocol that allows more freedom in governance will attract investors who want to make the most out of being able to cast their votes on a wide variety of factors, but it will also be subject to more volatility in changes and be undesirable to another group of investors who want to hold the tokens for stability in asset value. Thus, we have to be clear of our purpose first, and then make the relevant analysis and comparison across protocols.",cryptocurrency

I was aware of this going in, the *entire purpose* of the HELOC was to convert that debt.

Is there a specific, known threshold on a credit account whereby I would be able to know  for sure that if I paid off my balance to below that level, that reason for credit denial would not be something I'd have to watch out for when applying in the future?  I already knew my credit utilization was high, so going through the application process and subsequent credit check was just a big waste of time.

If I could know for sure that I'd need to say, pay off X amount of each balance so that I could then be approved for a HELOC, that would have been vastly more useful and saved everyone some time.

*Sorry for the delay in posting the recap, was having technical difficulties on my end*

Stocks closed lower once again in another volatile session as market participants continue to digest the fallout from Evergrande in China and anxiously wait for commentary from the Fed regarding their monthly monetary policy meeting set to be released tomorrow, Wednesday. 

Global markets were rattled today due to fears that Evergrande, the second-largest real estate developer in China with over $300 billion in liabilities, would default on its debt obligations and what the potential implications on the Chinese, and even, the global economy may be. If Evergrande were to default, there are fears that the potential damage to Evergrande‚Äôs lenders could lead to a contagion of the entire Chinese economy. Ming Tan, Director at credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor‚Äôs said, it was unlikely that Evergrande‚Äôs default would cause a credit crisis ‚Äúby itself‚Äù but acknowledges the risk of contagion spreading into the financial sector and the implication that has for other sectors. He said, ‚ÄúBanks‚Äô exposure to Evergrande is quite distributed across the sectors. The main risk for China‚Äôs financial system would be other highly leveraged developers to default at the same time.‚Äù 

In other news, market participants are looking ahead to commentary from the Federal Reserve‚Äôs latest monetary policy meeting set to be released Wednesday. The monetary policy statement and subsequent press conference from Fed Chair Jerome Powell Wednesday afternoon will lay out what the Fed thinks of the current state of the economy and potential signal when the Fed will begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing. 

Julia Coronado, President of MacroPolicy Perspectives, said ‚ÄúI think on balance the Fed is still marching forward. They're going to tell us that they're about to taper this year, or their plan is still to taper this year. That sets up November or maybe December as a formal announcement. So this meeting is really not about doing anything, it's just about reminding us that the economy is making progress, the recovery is under way and the Fed is beginning a very gradual process of normalizing, as they like to say, monetary policy.""

The policy decision will also come alongside an updated economic projection from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, including the first look at their expectations for 2024. Based on the central bank's latest projections from June, the FOMC's ""dot plot,"" or chart of interest rate expectations, suggested the median member expected two rate hikes by the end of 2023.

CryptoCurrency,"Bull Case For Tomorrow: Why Evergrande Is A Distraction, Even If It Is Relevant","So, I'm sure you're all aware of the Evergrande situation in China right now, since that seems to be all anyone is talking about. That's funny though, because we've known this event was coming for a long time, Evergrande has been in decline for over a year now.

What is more likely is that Evergrande is being used to leverage a narrative, and distract people from what is honestly a more important event; the Fed decision on whether they will begin to ""taper"" the economy, or remain in a state of Quantitative Easing. For those of you not familiar with the concept:

  
QE helps **the economy by reducing the long-term interest rates**, thus making business and mortgage borrowing cheaper thus giving a signal that the US Fed wants to support the economy. Tapering is the gradual slowing of the pace of the Fed's large scale asset purchases.

This decision tomorrow will be the confirmation most of the big players need to be sure there's more gas in the tank for the bull run. If the Fed mentions tapering, then we will see the sharp drop everyone expects from this Evergrande news.

I honestly believe this hyped up Evergrande news is being used to lower prices temporarily, so the Fed will surely not mention the ""T-word"" (tapering) tomorrow. Once the green light is given that we're not transitioning our stance at the Fed level, the bullrun will resume.",cryptocurrency

Banks have too much cash on their hands - and they're running out of places to put it.

The rules suggest that banks overcollateralize their crypto holdings by 1250% to avoid insolvency.

The Basel Committee would slap those Group 2 assets with a 1,250% risk weight when calculating a bank‚Äôs capital levels (a key measure of a firm‚Äôs health calculated as its assets minus its liabilities).

Higher risk weights require a bank to hold more capital against those holdings to insulate the firm‚Äôs depositors from any losses that may come from holding those assets.

economy,How to hedge against inflation Michael Burry style. Part 2.,"Hi all -

This is the second installment to a post I made back in May on r/Burryology that documented some of my inflation DD from researching Michael Burry/Scion's 13F plays. People seemed to learn a thing or two so I thought I'd post here as well. Do keep in mind that this is analysis of his stock picks for Q2 2021 and that his views on the economy have likely changed given the Evergrande situation (this is my own speculation based on his tweets from this week).

By my estimate, 28.4% of Scion's Q2 2021 portfolio is currently hedging against inflation. I arrived at this number by going through the individual positions of Scion's Q2 2021 13F, using the ""Think Back"" function in ThinkOrSwim to estimate options contracts prices, and summing the resulting positions together.

# US 20+ year Treasury ETFs (7.6% of Scion's Q2 2021 portfolio)

Burry's treasury instrument of choice is the 20+ year bond. This is a direct play on inflation where he's essentially concluding that the Fed will eventually need to raise interest rates which will lead to an increase in bond yields thereby causing their prices to fall. TLT is tied to the bond price itself. TBT is tied to the inverse of the yield (so when the yield falls, TBT goes up 2x that rate (in theory)).

He has positions in both TLT and TBT (see below for descriptions). It should be noted that both of these positions first appeared in Scion's 13F in Q1 2021. It should also be noted that he reduced his TBT position and increased his TLT position in Q2 2021. His TLT position is the third largest position in his Q2 2021 portfolio (which, in my opinion, says something about which ETF he prefers).

**Put Options on** [Ishares 20+ year treasury bond etf (TLT)](https://investopedia.com/articles/investing/031915/overview-tlt-etf.asp) **- 7.2% of current holdings**

Probable Burry thesis: rising inflation over the mid- to long-term will lead to the need to increase interest rates, leading to increased yields and making these 20 year bonds less attractive.

Some context: The U.S. Treasury announced plans to start issuing 20-year treasury bonds in January 2020. The benefits to 20 year treasury bonds are that they're relatively safe, their value could increase if interest rates drop, and they're relatively liquid. The cons are that they're over a 20 year period (meaning you lock in very low interest rates at which you get paid), inflation may occur over that 20 year period and lead to an increase in interest rates that you'll miss out on, and rising interest rates in general hurt the value of these bonds (link).

**Call Options on** [Proshares trust ultrashort lehment 20+ year treas etf (TBT)](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/TBT/profile) **- 0.4% of holdings**

Probable Burry thesis: this is the same 20+ year treasury bond mentioned above so the strategy is likely the same. The difference here is that it's a call on a 2x inverse bond ETF.

Context: The ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses that correspond to two times the inverse of the daily performance of the ICE U.S. Treasury 20+ Year Bond Index. (from Zacks article linked above).

Commodities are a fairly traditional inflation play. This [article](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/020816/importance-commodity-pricing-understanding-inflation.asp) on investopedia gets into some of the details regarding the relationship between commodities and inflation. The challenge with each of these companies is determining whether the company is an explicit hedge against inflation or whether it‚Äôs a value investing play.

This is the 6th largest Scion position and the 2nd largest shares-only position (i.e., no options contracts).

They are currently redirecting their cash flow towards paying down long-term debt which in itself is another positive for inflationary times (one group that does particularly well during inflation is debtors as the debt inflates itself away).

[Scorpio Tankers](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4438157-scorpio-tankers-has-more-upside) **(STNG), SunCoke Energy (SXC), and** [Golden Ocean Group Limited](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOGL) **(GOGL) - 2.9%, 2.4%, and 1.7%**

I grouped these positions together as they each clock in below 3% of the overall portfolio. Each of these was also an existing position that Burry added to in Q2 2021.

***Scorpio Tankers and Golden Ocean Group***

These two are likely plays on ocean freight/transport inflation. Scorpio is tied to oil transport and is a proxy play on any boost to oil demand that occurs at the global level. Golden Ocean Group looks similar but tied specifically to dry bulk goods.

***SunCoke Energy***

This is the one that I'm leaning more towards ""value investing play"" and less towards inflation (but I could be wrong). The arguments in favor of it being an inflation play are that it‚Äôs a commodity company (coal), it just recently started paying a dividend, and its been working towards deleveraging (at least that was the case earlier in the year). These are themes that you'll see in other investments such as CVS Health below.

# Revenue Mammoths (9.8% of current holdings)

The final group of companies are the revenue mammoths. They hail from the retail, grocery, and pharmacy sectors. All four of these organizations are in the top 31 companies in the world by revenue. They have some combination of pharmaceutical distribution and retail/grocery. They offer dividends with two of them being dividend aristocrats.

**CVS Health (Call Options and Shares) - 4.7% of portfolio**

Interestingly, CVS Health is the only stock where Burry is currently holding both shares and call options. They are the [7th largest company in the world by revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_by_revenue) (hence the revenue mammoth term).

The characteristics that make CVS an interesting potential inflation play are:

‚Ä¢ They have a large pharmaceutical distribution presence

‚Ä¢ They have a large health insurance segment

‚Ä¢ They have a sizeable retail store segment

‚Ä¢ They froze their dividend in 2018 to pay down debt related to their Aetna acquisition

What makes these intriguing characteristics from the inflation perspective?

Healthcare and pharmaceuticals have consistently beaten inflation over the past several decades. Pharmaceutical drugs continue to trend up. CVS owns a pharmacy benefits manager which, as a business, is incentivized through proportional rebates to push pricier drugs where they can.

From the retail perspective, their ""front"" stores are essentially baskets of goods which can pass on the costs of inflation to the consumer.

Lastly, the most intriguing reason (in my opinion) is their current strategy to pay down long-term debt. Their stock price is arguably depressed due to the massive $69 billion acquisition of Aetna they made in 2018. They had been increasing dividends every year for almost 2 decades before this acquisition, at which point they froze the dividend and put the money towards their debt. They estimate that they'll hit their debt-to-capitalization ratio in Spring of next year (I personally think it will be summer or fall of next year). At that point, it is anticipated that they will resume dividend hikes and share buybacks as they've done historically.

With CVS, you have a potential case where the 7th largest company in the world by revenue is undervalued due to a large amount of debt that they are slowly and steadily paying off in an advantageous inflationary environment with a predicted return to hiking their dividends in 2022 (and they appear to be largely inflation-proof).

**The Opioid Twins: McKesson Corp. and Cardinal Health (Call Options only) - 2.9% of portfolio**

Two more pharmaceutical revenue mammoths: McKesson clocks in at #12 on the largest companies by revenue list and is the largest pharmaceutical distributor in the United States. They also own a chain of 4000 pharmacy stores. Cardinal Health clocks in at 14th by revenue and is in the top 5 largest pharmaceutical distributors with McKesson. Both offer similar inflation characteristics to the ones listed for CVS Health with the difference being that CVS owns a health insurance plan on top of their pharmacy retail/PBM businesses.

Another key difference between CVS Health and the duo of McKesson and Cardinal is that McKesson and Cardinal Health were penalized in July of 2021 for their role in the Opioid crisis. Cardinal Health [expects to pay $6.4 billion over 18 years](https://www.dispatch.com/story/business/2021/07/22/cardinal-health-pay-6-4-billion-part-opioid-settlement/8053626002/) for its share of a $26 billion opioid settlement. It's possible that this legislation is currently a drag on these two stocks.

**Walmart (Call Options only) - 1% of portfolio**

Walmart is an interesting case because, at first glance, it appears to make more sense as an inflation play than the rest of this mammoth revenue group. Walmart is the largest company on Earth by yearly revenue. They have a strong pharmaceutical presence like the other companies in this category though over half of their revenue is actually from their grocery segment.

What makes them an interesting inflation play is that their stores are literally giant baskets of goods. They have a large breadth of products which allows them to keep the prices of various product categories lower than their competitors. They also own the basket that the goods live in (along with the land around the basket). Real Estate is a well-known inflation hedge.

solar,Project Solar - Legit?,"I'm looking into alternative options after starting to get fed up with Tesla Energy (ordered March 2021, still waiting).

I got a quote earlier this year from them, but their price was a little higher than Tesla for what seemed like worse equipment. But I've revisited and they seemed to have updated.

They're offering an 11.89 kW system (supposedly 340W panels, not sure how that math works out) for $23,061.75 or $1.94/w pre-incentive. According to their site (https://projectsolar.io/pages/project-solar-equipment-specifications), they are 340W Q-Cells, the same panels that Tesla is offering. And IQ7+ inverters.

Anybody have any experience working with them? Will they pull a fast one by advertising this equipment and then delivering a design with something else entirely?",energy
CryptoCurrency,Evergrande averted for the time being. Now we look to FED meeting outcome tomorrow.,"‚ÄúSept 21 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers begin a two-day meeting Tuesday to discuss the U.S. jobs and inflation outlook and craft a policy response that could edge the central bank closer to dialing down its support for the economy.

Here are five things to look for from the meeting, which wraps up on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. (1800 GMT)

FURTHER PROGRESS?

The Fed has promised not to cut back on the $120 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities it is buying each month until it sees ""substantial further progress"" toward its goals of maximum employment and 2% inflation.‚Äù

[Reuters Article](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/five-things-watch-fed-policy-meeting-this-week-2021-09-21/)

What a start to the week! 

Evergrande will make their interest payment. Crisis averted for now. Although by today‚Äôs Shanghai market reaction it doesn‚Äôt seem like this particular situation will have too much effect on global markets. There is just a lot of uncertainty which we don‚Äôt know is an appropriate reaction. 

Now we look to what FEDs will decide concerning inflation and COVID assistance. This meeting started today and wraps up tomorrow afternoon which is when they will announce their decisions to the public. Keep HODLing. The rest of 2021 is going to get reallllll volatile.",cryptocurrency

I would be looking at taking out 30k so I can pay off my credit cards and use the other 9k for necessary home repairs as we are looking to move in the next 2 years. In my head this seems like a no brainer as A. Lower interest rates. B. Even adding the loan will move my credit utilization from 32% to 23% which should up my credit score. C. Once I sell the house I will have a nice profit to pay off. I have gotten in trouble with extreme debt in my past, but have learned a lot from my mistakes‚Ä¶.which maybe why I‚Äôm looking for approval.

Bitcoin,Evergrande‚Äôs Situation on Crypto,"I keep seeing people post about Evergrande making interest payments on time and that the world is good again. I used to work on a bulge bracket Asia HY bond desk and this is not the case. 

Twitter and the Media is missing the full picture and no one has pointed it out yet. üëá

We aren‚Äôt fully out of the woods. There is a difference between onshore (denominated in CNY) and offshore bonds (USD). Evergrande has offshore coupon denominated in USD due Sep 23 and have yet to make an announcement on those. Given a choice, they would pay onshore first. Should they decide not to pay USD, this will hurt global investors regardless. That said, there is still a 30-day grace period so it‚Äôs not end of the world, even if they don‚Äôt. 

The CCP won‚Äôt directly step in but they will save the house buyers in the case of a default (so they don‚Äôt see any protesting etc). SOE banks will be the first to get screwed and majority of loans/commercial papers are to them. The scary part is that we‚Äôre not too sure how many of these guys re-levered this debt into other instruments so there may be ticking bombs all around. 

Ultimately, the nearest USD coupon that is due is on Sept 23rd (Thursday), roughly equating to US$100m in interest. Sure, you may meet that interest but the company still has $300bn of principal coupon worth to pay. 

Personally, I see a few routes moving forward but one needs to look at the debt structure (1). horizontally (time-based) and (2). vertically (who and what type of debt do they hold) to see a better picture.

Horizontally:
- Sept 23, $83mio in interest due
- Sept 29, $45mio in interest due
- Oct 11, $~160mio in interest due
- Nov 6, $80mio in interest due
- Dec 28, $250mio in interest due

Vertically:
- 54% of its $300bn are in secured borrowings
- 2% are convertible bonds (lower pecking order)
- 21% are senior notes (this is mostly held by UHNW individuals and big funds/banks)
- 6% PRC bonds (local onshore denominated debt)
- 17% Unsecured direct bank borrowings (mostly to SOE banks)

That said, my gutfeel is that the CCP will go in indirectly via the SOE banks taking the brunt of the hurt; they‚Äôll likely working their butts off now with some meeting of sort with all EVERRE‚Äôs biggest debt/equity backers. The key players in this game are:

[In order of importance to the CCP]. 
1. People who bought homes (they will be taken care off first)
2. Suppliers and construction companies contracted (perhaps this may be next)
3. Public debt holders (UHNW/Funds/Banks) ‚Äì the key people here are the funds/banks
4. SOE banks who provided direct loans (govt backed anyways)
5. Equity holders. 

My guess at the end: some SOE banks come in with some package to save certain pieces of the above pie. Perhaps the CEO/management team gets reprimanded strongly? Either ways, this is the largest elephant in the room now and the Crypto market is worried of the repercussions and quakes that we could feel from this fallout.

That said... enough about Evergrande, Crypto is dealing with its own troubles. Messari's Mainnet event got hijacked by a SEC subpoena, Mr Gensler called stablecoins 'poker chips' (we get it), and Binance derivatives service got clamped down in Australia.

On-chain data wise: During the dip, BTC's LTH-SOPR (1.26) vs STH-SOPR (0.97) indicated short-term holders (speculators, swing-traders, etc.) sold into losses, while long-term holders took profit. Regardless, the stablecoin supply ratio fell, and the exchange reserves of BTC is nearing a six-month low. This suggest traders are flushed with cash, but whether they are willing to step in (presumably on long leverage positions) is another question. For the second day, BTC Long liquidation also indicated a sharp up spike relative to the past 12 days while the estimated leverage ratio hovered at the mid-point (relative to the past two weeks), suggesting a very risk-off environment.

In derivatives: BTC and ETH option contract open interest held constant while traders adopted a wait-and-see approach to prices. Options skew indicators reflect a different story: 25% delta skew (Volatility premium for puts to calls), a significant jump, reflecting a high belief among option traders that further downward movement is imminent. Coin days destroyed also show that the move was mostly driven by short-term traders. 

Personally, I like to fade such event-driven markets (but only post FOMC). Just note that conditions are primed such that if we get very positive news, people are flushed with cash for a jolt back to risk. A gentle nudge to also remember just how short-term market participant thinks, and that one only needs to look just over the ridge to stay ahead. IMO, the Evergrande fiasco is starting to look more like a very controlled detonation by the CCP - even if their offshore entity defaults (after the 30-day grace period), it won‚Äôt trigger a cross-default to its onshore entity. Finally‚Ä¶ I actually took Gary Gensler Washington Post interview early this morning to be bullish for Crypto long term. We certainly need certain aspects of the market to be reined in to progress further. Have a good one!

personalfinance,22 years old and need help exploring my future financial/housing options,"Hi, I am 22 years old and recently graduated college in May. This is going to be pretty long... Currently I live in apartment where I pay around $650 (w utils) per month - which is extremely cheap for my location (my roommate pays 2/3rd of the rent). Our lease is going to expire in February and my roommate is going to live with his girlfriend so I need to look for a new place to live. I have three options:

1. Purchase a home and *potentially* have 3 roommates
2. *Potentially* rent a home with the same roommates
3. Rent a 1br apartment

I work in tech (which could mean frequent salary increases) and gross \~$59k. I am prequalified up to $400k for a mortgage. I have no debt, no car payments, and no other expenses besides food &amp; gas ( fortunately my parents pay for my phone and insurance still). If I do purchase a home I would only put 3% down. I have enough for 10%, but then I would have no savings and 5% does not make much of a difference on the monthly payments so 3% makes the most sense to me.

Issues with Option 1: All the homes in my price range are only 3 bedrooms and are all at the high-end of my range; which could potentially leave me house poor with no roommates. I do not know if it is a good idea to take on housing payments that are around 55% of my monthly net income. The roommates that I could have are 3 of my close friends that were already planning on getting a place together within the next 3-5 months. 2 of them are okay with sharing a room in bedroom home - however I already know that could not be a long term option and they will probably move out before even a year of living there. Leaving me making payments on my own (there is a decent chance that I have other friends that would be willing to move in around a year from now). I would charge $400 a room plus utilities and not have them sign a lease, which I know is a bad decision financially but they are my friends and I do not want to live with random people. There are just a lot of uncertainties with a decision this large. All standard expenses considered: with roommates I could save \~40% of my income and without roommates probably \~20%.

Option 2 does not have too many downsides I just really would like to take advantage of the low interest rates right now. The renters market is not too optimistic. Also, I make considerably more than my friends and it is definitely a risk going into a lease with people that work part-time because I could get stuck with payments (there is a \~1% chance this would ever happen though).

Issues with Option 3: A 1 bedroom apartment in my area is around $1300-$1700, and are continually rising. I would hate to pay even $1500/mo for an apartment when I could pay $2000/mo towards an investment (home).

Sorry if it sounds like I am ranting, it is just a big decision to make so I have a lot going through my head.",finance

Our expenses including rent are about $2100/month


Also, I still owe about $30k in student loans which are all federal so I have not made a payment since March 2020... when the interest and payments start up again in a few months, should I refinance these loans with a private company for a lower rate, or keep it federal? (Currently 7%)... 


Our plan/goal is to retire in the 40-45 range. 

I am up for a promotion that should net me another $30k or so soon. If it doesn't, I plan to apply for positions at other companies and expect to be paid in the $115k range with my credentials/experience in mind.

Our IRAs and Brokerage accounts are with schwab in the intelligent portfolio which have performed well. Is there more we could/should be doing, or should we start to enjoy our money a little bit now?

CryptoCurrency,"Cryptocurrencies - Issues of trust, security and scalability in simple terms","###‚ÄúThe root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that‚Äôs required to make it work.‚Äù Satoshi Nakamoto 

###Trust of open-source protocols tasked with distribution and validation

A centralised authority such as a government are the only ones who are trusted to distribute and validate a currency - though whenever there is such concentration of power, there is inevitably, corruption, greed, and nepotism. 

Cryptocurrencies are not politically or geographically centralised, meaning they are not vulnerable to flaws like a centralised system. However they are logically centralised, meaning there is one commonly agreed state and the network (if working as intended) behaves like a single trustworthy system. 

###Security of decentralised systems is baked into the protocols

Security by governing authorities are costly, time consuming and mostly present centralised points of weaknesses. 

Cryptocurrencies‚Äô use of encryption algorithms and automatic consensus mechanisms, make it virtually impossible for third-parties to retrieve, corrupt or disrupt data - the ‚Äòcrypto‚Äô in cryptocurrency. Security is baked in without the need for third-parties to approve, corroborate or validate transactions. 

###Scalability of global payment processing systems is complex to say the least

Scalability of millions of individual transactions across thousands of geographical locations, whilst still being trusted and secure, has proven to be the most difficult issue to solve.

Electronic payment systems, such as Visa claim 1,700 transactions per second (no they can not process 24,000 tps - this has never been the claim or the reality), can be fulfilled through their network, a figure it rarely exceeds, with which any decentralised network is going to have to compete. 

Blockchain scaling can be implemented in a range of ways, from Layer-1 solutions like increasing the block size and sharding (more on these later), to Layer-2 solutions such as the Lightning Network, all of which carry various trade-offs. Blockchains may become ‚Äùfaster‚Äù but that also often means they become more ‚Äúcentralised‚Äù - because, for example, they have to rely on a much lower number of validators. 

###Speed and decentralization essentially exist on a spectrum, so the more you have of one, the less you have of the other. There is nothing inherently wrong with having a fast but semi-centralized blockchain, but it compromises the permission less and censorship-resistant properties that make the blockchain so unique. 

###‚ÄúCryptoeconomics didn‚Äôt begin and end with Satoshi‚Äôs whitepaper ‚Äî it‚Äôs a body of techniques that we are only learning to apply. Not just in the design of core protocols, but in the design of second layer systems that extend the functionality of the underlying blockchain.‚Äù Josh Stark

###Proof-of-Work

Proof-of-Work (PoW) uses computational power and electricity to validate and secure transactions. This is an external validation process - meaning an external resource is used to ‚Äòcreate‚Äô blocks on a blockchain (validate, approve and secure transactions). It is highly secure and benefits from being totally decentralised (no external governance needed) but has issues of scalability. 

**Bitcoin BTC** uses a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism which is highly secure and trusted but proving difficult to scale, as the blockchain grows the amount of computer processing power needed also increases, which can be slow and hence not scalable. With only 7 transactions per second taking 10 minutes to confirm, it requires Layer-2 solutions like the ‚ÄòLightening Network‚Äô to function effectively as a global currency. Transactions can be fulfilled in seconds but it is a centralised solution - the payments are processed and collated through the Lightening central processing network before they are ratified by the blockchain as the settlement layer. (Again this is not necessarily bad, but centralisation creates issues of security and privacy).

As Bitcoin faced the problem that it was taking too long to process transactions. A portion of the Bitcoin network, notably bitcoin miners, favored a solution of increasing the block size above the standard 1 megabyte. The developers in the Bitcoin network, however, did not like this solution as it made the network more susceptible to hacking. Their preferred solution was to separate the blockchain functionality from the actual transaction processing in a scheme called Segregated Witness (SegWit for short). Because not all members of the Bitcoin network agreed to adopt the software changes implementing SegWit, it was possible for the network to fracture into distinct and separate networks. This fracture occurred on August 1, 2017, with the Bitcoin network splitting into two cryptocurrencies.

**Bitcoin Cash BCH** is a ‚Äòhard fork‚Äô of the original Bitcoin, and claims to have addressed the scalability issue by increasing the maximum block size, from 1MB up to 32MB, with ongoing research to allow future increases. This Layer-1 solution addresses the issue of scalability, allowing 116 tps, meaning more transactions are able to be processed - ‚ÄúTransact in seconds. Get confirmed in minutes.‚Äù However, it can still not compete with Visa‚Äôs 1700 tps and although big blocks are faster, they sacrifice decentralization because more powerful computers are needed to process larger blocks. (Small blocks are slower, but maintain the key advantages of decentralization and security because more nodes can join and maintain the network).

**Ethereum ETH** currently uses a PoW consensus mechanism which only manages 15 tps and requires every transaction to be processed by every single node in the network, so hence has scalability issues. For the network to handle millions of transactions, which it now does because of smart contracts running decentralised finance projects and NFT exchanges, the network is often slow and intolerably expensive (‚Äògas fees‚Äô are charged to validate transactions, the rewards paid to the miners - the busier the network the higher the fees). 

###Proof-of-Stake

Proof-of-Stake is a consensus mechanism that validates transactions that is reflective of their ownership stake. For instance, a miner who owns 3% of the coins available can theoretically mine only 3% of the blocks. Validators are chosen at random to create blocks and are responsible for checking and confirming blocks they don't create. This is a purely internal validation process, meaning it does not require external resources to confirm blocks. This is a point of contention because there is less separation between power (control) and money - whoever has the most coins is the most powerful, which can hardly be said to be decentralised. 

This does mean though there should be lower barriers to entry because of the reduced hardware requirements, which should lead to more nodes in the network - improving participation and hence decentralisation and transaction speeds. (It also allows for stronger support for Sharding). Criticisms have been made that the opposite may be true and PoS increases the risk of an oligarchy forming (largest stake pools have the most power) introducing concepts of a formal governance structure. Again, conflicts of centralisation and security arise. 

###Layer-1 and Layer-2 solutions

One **Layer-1 solution** (one that is built into the blockchain), is known as **sharding** and is where the network is divided into two sections which could operate semi-independently and double the transaction speeds, since transactions can be processed by two nodes at the same time. 

Another **Layer-2 solution** (one that is built on top of the blockchain), would be for the transactions to happen ‚Äòoff-chain‚Äô while still guaranteeing a sufficient level of security and finality by referring back to the blockchain, when a large enough number of transactions have been completed. In other words, instead of making thousands of small transactions many times, one larger transaction is made less frequently. This is called a ‚ÄòState channel‚Äô solution and is how the Lightening Network works on the Bitcoin blockchain. 

###It should be no surprise then that Bitcoin and Ethereum are at the forefront of creating and implementing a combination of all these mechanisms with the Bitcoin ‚ÄòTaproot‚Äô and Ethereum 2.0 upgrades. 

Other projects, such as Cardano ADA, Algorand ALGO, Solana SOL, Polkadot DOT, use Proof-of-Stake or Delegated Proof-of-Stake protocols and Sharding mechanisms - combining core design with smart contract functionalities to work as payment systems. 

Stellar Lumens XLM, Ripple XRP are PoW blockchains but use Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) protocols - essentially meaning much smaller computers can be used to validate transactions. Hashgraph HBAR, uses hashing mechanisms but is essentially a closed network. They have all made projects claiming to have solved the issues of trust, security and scale - designed from the ground up to work as currencies. 

Whether it‚Äôs Layer-1 solutions, built ‚Äúinto‚Äù the blockchain, or Layer-2 solutions, built ‚Äúon top of‚Äù the blockchain, Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake or Byzantine Agreements, or any mixture of them all, they have proven to be more than capable of competing or in some cases outperforming centralised payment systems and hence worthy as currencies. 

Which one will be the most successful in the long run is still unanswered. Whether different solutions will be used for differing use cases is also very likely. 

###But what can‚Äôt be questioned. This mixture of direct financial skin in the game of all parties involved - investors, users, developers - and innovating technology, can‚Äôt be found anywhere else and makes the community so fascinating. 

As usual, this is not a comprehensive post, it is attempting to explain complex issues in simplified terms. Any issues or errors with accuracy would be considered and greatly appreciated.

cardano,Is Cardano the biggest innovation after the Internet?,"# Everything is about trust

Trust is absolutely essential for the functioning of the world. Every single interaction between people requires trust. Interaction built on trust alone can sometimes fail, and therefore there are many repair mechanisms to resolve conflicts. Trust can be abused by one party for its own gain. It is in our society‚Äôs interest to maintain trust at a high level. Many financial and social interactions today are protected by law, with third parties overseeing compliance. People trust each other because they trust the authorities to resolve any conflict.

Authorities are able to prevent abuses of trust. This mechanism requires people to trust third parties. It is thus essential that authorities maintain their credibility. Loss of trust in authorities could lead to loss of trust among people. Without third parties that represent the trust authority of last resort, people would have to start resolving disputes themselves. This could disrupt the world order. New laws and new guardians of trust would probably arise.

The basic trust between people is not developing much and is still the same. People trust family and friends because they have found through experience that they keep their word. But people have to trust many other people, companies, institutions, and governments. We have to trust our employer to pay our wages, we have to trust an online shop to send us the goods we have paid for, we have to trust a bank not to take our money, we have to trust governments not to raise taxes unnecessarily, we have to trust laws and judges to protect our rights and property. Trust is a very complex subject today and there are many places where trust can be broken or may not work effectively.

Third-party trust issues are linked to abuse of power in many possible ways and low transparency, both in the performance of the service and in the case of audits. In addition, problems may relate to excessive complexity and therefore inefficiency. This can result in an inability to adapt to new conditions and a rapidly changing world. Time is money. Time is becoming a very expensive commodity and for wealthy people, time is often more valuable than money. If trust is broken, costs and time increase when people interact with each other, whatever the goal of the interaction. Conversely, time and costs decrease when trust is present. It is therefore important that the level of trust is as high as possible.

Blockchain technology brings innovation at the trust level. That is why we refer to it as a foundational technology and compare its potential impact on society to the Internet. Foundational technologies are by definition those that can enable progress and applications in a variety of problem domains. The Internet has done this, and it has manifested itself in some form in perhaps every human sector. Now the same is expected of blockchain technology. Or rather from public decentralized blockchain networks, not so much from private corporate solutions.

Decentralized blockchain networks can perform similar services as third parties. What is truly innovative is the ability to improve their operation and maintain a high level of trust. Decentralization allows the autonomous execution of rules. Processes can be completely transparent where needed, auditing can be easy and 100% reliable. The efficiency of processes can be increased. The systems can be completely fair to everyone equally and no one will be able to covertly abuse their position to own benefit. Let‚Äôs look at specific examples to understand how important trust is in people‚Äôs everyday lives.

Financial and social interaction tends to be about following agreements and rules. The complexity of agreements and rules increases as trust decreases. If you want a small loan from a good friend, you simply agree without a third party and without a contract. You rely on the friend not to risk a friendship for little gain. Trust has a high value. Trust takes a long time to build, but it can be lost quickly. Rebuilding trust takes a long time, and sometimes the restoration may not fully succeed.

In the real world, however, we need to interact with someone we are seeing for the first time in our lives. Therefore, mutual trust will not be high. Breach of trust can be tempting for one party. Especially if the parties do not know each other very well and there is no emotional involvement at stake. The interaction may be vital to one party and any breach of trust could result in unfortunate consequences. It is therefore essential to take into account possible breaches of trust. Borrowing to buy a house, start your own business, or for your children‚Äôs education is a case where we need to trust someone who can lend us money at a reasonable interest rate. The mutual agreement has a written form and many rules. To conclude such a loan takes time and is not free. Experienced attorneys must look at the agreement and if there is a dispute, both parties have confidence in their lawyers and the legal system in that jurisdiction.

Did you notice something? Being able to trust someone you don‚Äôt know well is only possible because you trust authorities or other third parties. Laws dictate what a contract between citizens should look like, how much interest is fair on a loan, how long working hours should be, or how to return poor quality goods bought from an online shop. If the trust between the two parties is not high, someone or something else must provide it for both. Each of the interacting parties knows the public explicit or implicit rules and also knows how any conflict will be resolved. Trust works because it is not socially or economically advantageous to break the rules.

Mutual trust is essentially about agreed or generally accepted rules and adherence to them. People have trust in centralized third parties for creating, oversight, and enforcement of rules. The revolution brought about by blockchain is about the possibility of decentralizing this activity that is absolutely crucial for people. At its very basic core, decentralization is about defining rules that are unbreakable, transparent, and the same for everyone. Decentralization can prevent abuses of trust in specific places. Obviously, people who abuse trust today will resist the development and adoption of this technology. The rules by which our society is governed today are complex, we have too many of them, and the whole process of creating and changing them requires a huge bureaucratic apparatus. Blockchain may offer a return to simplification, which paradoxically can also be a relatively complex process.

People generally value the trust they have earned and benefit socially and financially. Replacing centralized entities with decentralized networks will certainly not be an easy task and many people will naturally resist it. This fear is to some extent unnecessary and futile. Technology will make it possible to replace specific jobs, but new jobs are being created. It is necessary to look for the advantages that decentralization offers and think about appropriate uses. The loss of trust in third parties could have far worse social consequences than the adoption of blockchain.

# What blockchain can really change?

We said that blockchain can disrupt many sectors. Who would have thought, for example, that Cardano would find its first application in the education sector in Ethiopia? The education sector is far from finance at first glance. However, the opposite is true. In a country where corruption is high and trust between government and citizens can be very low, it is advantageous to use technology to increase trust. There are cases where it does not make sense from a government position to put too much trust in centralized local entities. It is preferable to trust multiple independent entities that are directly involved in the process. Data from multiple sources can be used to build an overall picture of the situation. State financial support can then be allocated more accurately to where it is really needed.

It is good to ask a very fundamental question. What is the difference between a database and a blockchain? We will answer the question from the perspective of trust. In the case of a database, it is an arrangement where all participants trust one centralized entity. Alternatively, multiple centralized entities. One entity cannot be responsible for all business sectors, e.g. education, health, ecology, transport, etc. Therefore, there are multiple centralized entities. All data are held in databases. Users do not actually own them and have no control. Database administrators have control of data. There is an element of decentralization in this arrangement as the centralized entities are independent of each other. If trust is broken in the health sector, for example, it will not affect the transport sector. Each individual centralized center of power poses a potential risk of breaking trust. The administrator of the centralized server can do whatever she wants with the data without having to interact with the users.

A decentralized system like Cardano has no significant center of power. All participants have equal status. For example, there is no distinction between a civil servant and a citizen. The important thing is that individual participants decide on the change of data. Thus, a financial transaction is only sent if the owner of the funds confirms this through cryptography. The civil servant cannot fraudulently send the transaction instead of the owner or prevent it. The transaction record is never lost and cannot be altered. The network is used as a transport mechanism. Blockchain is a record of all transactions. In the case of using second layers, blockchain contains the final balances of all accounts. This is a fundamental difference compared to a conventional database. The individual users are the owners of the coins or their data and only they decide on the change. In many cases, only the participants can hold the data and the blockchain is only used as the necessary underlying infrastructure for cryptography.

It can be said that when using blockchain, all participants are equal. The power goes back into the hands of the participants. If the system has an imaginary center of power, such as a city hall, all interactions will be transparent (not necessarily public, but better auditable) and it will be significantly more difficult to abuse power. For example, if a citizen pays a compulsory tax, the official cannot conceal this fact in an attempt to steal the money. Similarly, a citizen cannot claim that he has paid the tax and the officials have registered it incorrectly.

Some people sometimes think that innovative blockchain technology makes it necessary to replace certain elements on a societal or financial level. For example, that Bitcoin was to replace monetary banks, which are essential components of all sovereign states. We do not think that it is absolutely necessary to replace something at all costs. Sometimes an improvement on a technological level or an alternative choice is enough. Today‚Äôs world is too complex to simply replace one part of a complex system and keep all the others. If we have a problem at the level of trust, it is a broader problem that involves multiple parts of the system. The solution may not be a complete replacement, but sensible and targeted improvements in specific places.

Incremental improvement is a much safer form of blockchain technology adoption than sudden disruption. We can observe this in the Ethiopian example. Cardano solves a specific problem that would not be easy to solve through a database. Why is it better to use blockchain? Because the system works with the digital identity of students and teachers. Attendance, exam results, and other things are entered into the system individually by all participants under their own identities. A regular database could certainly be used as a data repository, but here a different problem is being solved. We are solving the problem of the trustworthiness of data entry into the system. We don‚Äôt want centralized entities to manipulate the data to their advantage. It must be understood that the system will not prevent teachers from giving their students better grades in an effort to improve their achievement. However, the teachers are responsible for entering the data and a third party has no chance to influence the data in any way. Blockchain thus puts not only power back in people‚Äôs hands, but also direct responsibility for their actions. If students fail a college entrance exam, it will be possible to point out the inconsistency with grades from previous schools. From the government‚Äôs point of view, it is all about having credible and unbiased data from all individual participants.

So where can blockchain help solve problems? The answer is surprisingly simple. Wherever there is a trust issue and a third party can abuse its position. This is wherever the system will work better if more power, but also more responsibility, is put back into people‚Äôs hands. I am sure you can think of many examples yourself from your own environment. Every single country in the world is dealing with different problems. In the West, there is generally more trust between people and trust in authority, because there is a higher success rate in detecting crime and enforcing the law. There is also a higher level of communication between people and institutions. In developing countries, this can be significantly worse. This may also be because there is almost no digital infrastructure. Some countries will skip the centralized solutions we have in the West and everything can be built directly on the blockchain. So from the very beginning, trust will be built very differently on a technological level.

Blockchain technology can change absolutely everything if people want to. Blockchain can give people more freedom and sovereignty. It can prevent abuse of power in many places and make our society more transparent. There will always be centers of power in human society. There will be political parties, governments, central and commercial banks, multinational companies and institutions, local companies and businesses, etc. Decentralized technology has no chance of disrupting the social order that has been in place essentially since the beginning of our modern civilization. The goal of blockchain technology is not to disrupt everything around us, but to fundamentally improve it. The impact of specific changes on society is hard to estimate. Certain is this. If we start to change things at the level of trust, we as a society will have to redefine our attitude towards things like identity, money, ownership, privacy, decision-making power, etc.

# Our biggest problem is greed

It‚Äôs always good to be able to name specific problems and then look for an acceptable solution to them. People are very good at finding and naming problems. However, their solutions are often stuck, which is a problem in itself. There are problems that most of society knows about, yet there is no common will to change. Many of our society‚Äôs problems stem from greed.

Humans have a strongly encoded survival instinct. This compels them to gather the resources that will enable them to survive. Often at the expense of others. In modern society, people seek a balance between their own wealth and that of others. We often observe a great deal of greed in those with a strong financial or social position. Powerful status goes hand in hand with the centralization of power. Almost all people on the planet are profit-oriented. Some less, some noticeably more. The problem tends to be especially with those entities that are powerful and can abuse their position. Greed at this level leads to the accumulation of great wealth. The accumulation of wealth is not in itself a problem, as long as it is not at the expense of others.

Can decentralization fix greed? It can‚Äôt. Technology has limited ways to prevent individuals from accumulating wealth and influencing their environment through their dominance. What decentralization can do is offer the possibility of Peer-to-Peer communication in social or financial interaction. If we leave unnecessary intermediaries out of the processes of interaction, we weaken their ability to abuse their position. Intermediaries profit disproportionately from fees or misuse of data about us.

Cardano is built precisely for the purpose of being able to omit intermediaries. Allowing people to interact directly and freeing them from dependence on intermediaries puts a lot of power in their hands. Greed cannot be fixed, but its possibilities can be blunted.

From the beginning, the goal of cryptocurrencies has been to be able to do without banks altogether. Banks get rich through our fees, and they can misuse our personal data to increase profits. If there was a globally available network that was faster, more reliable, and had lower fees, it would be beneficial for people to take advantage of it. Not only will they themselves save money, but they will also weaken the dominant position of the bank, which can charge exorbitant fees for cross-border transactions, account maintenance, credit card provision, loans, etc.

If people switch to other technologies, a bank that wants to survive will have to fundamentally change its business model. Lending, insurance, investment, and savings are areas that ordinary people are not very interested in and are happy to take advice on or pay for services. Banks may continue to exist in some form, but they may not hold our money and, ultimately, our data. If a bank lends to us, let the loan be made on a blockchain with predictable fees and the inability to change the contract during its lifetime. Let decentralized alternatives to traditional banks emerge that compete on price, reliability, or even anonymity and global accessibility.

Abuses of dominance can be seen almost everywhere around us. Technology has the potential to completely disrupt the established order, and it doesn‚Äôt have to be just blockchain. We see many examples throughout history where technology has punished excessive greed. BitTorrent, for example, began disrupting the music industry around 2001. Several major music labels had contracts with almost all the famous artists. These producers got rich by selling overpriced CDs and profited enormously. The middleman was rewarded, not the artists. All at the expense of the end-users. BitTorrent made it possible to share music between users for free, and other technologies made it easy to play on personal computers. In this music sharing, copyrights were infringed and many lawsuits were filed. Many services built on data sharing had to go out of business. However, something has changed. People were no longer willing to patronize the fortunes of the major labels, and the giants eventually fell. Today, music is streamed. People can consume as much music as they want and are willing to pay reasonably.

In the case of the music industry, it ended well. Is it possible to change the world of finance in a similar way? It is much more protected by national governments and multinational interests. The world of finance is very slow to accept innovation. Everything has sort of stopped with credit cards and internet banking. You could even say that the big IT giants are more eager to innovate than the banks themselves. The financial world is in for a major revolution in the next decade. There are several reasons for this. A loss of trust in traditional services, a reluctance to build financial infrastructure in developing countries, better existing solutions offering better terms, and hopes for a more comprehensive change in society. We believe that people will embrace the opportunity to use alternative financial protocols and that they will not be afraid of the potential changes that will inevitably impact governments as well.

# Blockchain, not Bitcoin

There is still a lot of debate about whether all the problems can be solved by Bitcoin and its other layers, or whether other networks like Cardano will find a place. If blockchain and decentralized networks are truly groundbreaking inventions with the potential to turn the world upside down, it is naive to think that the technology will not continue to evolve. Banks will always have a lot of capital, so a significant portion of the population will go there for a loan. This will not change even if there is global bitcoinization. A bank could lend us bitcoin instead of fiat currencies and still charge unreasonable fees, change the terms of the contract, or misuse our personal data. Banks would continue to ignore the needs of developing countries and abuse their dominant position. From the perspective of the people, nothing would change. Why? Because the problem of trust has not been solved.

Forget bitcoinization, it won‚Äôt happen in our lifetimes anyway because of high volatility. Let‚Äôs think a little more realistically. What makes the most sense is peer-to-peer communication. Decentralization must be seen as a trust machine. Cardano is a network that allows participants to establish trusted communication with each other without an intermediary. Users own and dispose of all resources. In a way, the network is just a decentralized mechanism for transmitting and recording information.

The success of blockchain technology will be greater the higher the ability to omit third parties from the communication. There is competition at the level of price, speed, or reliability of service, but what brings real disruption is improvements at the level of trust. Trust has two levels. First, there is trust in the protocol itself, for example, that there will only be 45 billion ADA coins and never more. Users trust the team that modifies the protocol. Next, they trust all the people who run the full nodes, especially the pool operators. This also includes trust in the network that processes signed transactions. All transactions must be included in new blocks and values transferred as expected by the signers.

More important, however, is ensuring trust among the participants themselves. If Alice and Bob want to send each other some tokens, there must be no fraud. If Alice and Bob don‚Äôt know each other, they won‚Äôt even trust each other. Even more so if the transaction involves a larger amount of money. In the traditional world, fraud is handled by the legal system. But it often only works on a local level. If Alice were from China and Bob from Russia, a potential dispute might never be resolved because of the language barrier and the cost of the investigation.

Let‚Äôs take an example. Alice is from China and sells stocks of the Tencent company. Bob is an investor from Russia who wants to buy the stock for 10,000 ADA coins. The pair agree to exchange tokens via chat. Now a problem arises. Who should send the tokens first? Should Alice send the shares first or Bob send the ADA coins?

Blockchain will only be successful if it can establish trust between participants in these kinds of interactions. If we want to spend money, we always want to be sure that we will get the goods or services we have purchased. As we explained above, one solution is that we are protected by a third party in the form of state authority. If Russia and China agree to resolve conflicts that arise on blockchain technologies, and practice shows that this is indeed happening, one of the pair, Alice or Bob, can send the tokens first. If Alice sends shares first and Bob does not pay, Alice will contact the Chinese authorities for help.

This dispute may take a very long time to resolve. Moreover, the attitude of states towards blockchain technology may be lukewarm. Authorities may not be willing to resolve these disputes. Cardano is a global network and wants to be able to connect people around the world in a trustworthy way. Is there any other solution that can do without third parties?

Fortunately, it exists. It‚Äôs smart contracts. A smart contract is a kind of extension of the capabilities of a transactional network. They allow for greater granularity in terms of focusing on a particular problem among users. You can write a contract that serves as a temporary custody service. A smart contract can be a temporary token store and will only exchange tokens if Alice and Bob send the expected amount of tokens. This protects both Alice and Bob from fraud. If only one party sends tokens, the smart contract will return them to the sender after a defined time. There will be no exchange, but there will be no fraud either. It could be said that the smart contract was able to play the role of an intermediary, which would be difficult to find in practice. Moreover, this intermediary could be relatively expensive and inefficient compared to the smart contract.

A similar transaction would never happen on Bitcoin. Let‚Äôs think about why. Tokenized stocks were required for implementation. These stocks must exist on the blockchain and must be verifiable that they are really stocks of the company. To do this, the identity of the issuer of the stocks must be verified. Next, a smart contract must be written to exchange the tokens. Cardano is built for exactly this kind of financial interaction. Cardano allows tokenization, working with decentralized identity, and writing smart contracts.

If two parties are to lend each other some funds, they need very similar properties. They need a stable financial environment, ideally through stable coins. Next, use the identity of the borrower and lender, put something up as collateral, and write a smart contract. On top of that, the fees for deploying the contract and subsequent transactions should be cheap and predictable. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to borrow $1000, pay $50 in interest, and then pay maybe $60 in transaction fees on top of that.

We have no doubts about the success of Cardano, as it will allow much more diverse things to be implemented at the trust level than Bitcoin. Bitcoin transactions only work between users who know and trust each other. Any disputes must be resolved by the legal system and state authorities. If an authority needs to be engaged to resolve disputes, it makes no sense to seek to disrupt it. As we have shown in the example of cryptocurrency-for-stock exchanges, Cardano will enable the trusted execution of token exchanges in such a way that a third party will theoretically never be needed. Yet we do not think that this and other capabilities will cause the demise of state authorities. It makes sense to consider using blockchain technologies to ensure that there are fewer disputes and greater trust between participants.

# Connecting digital technology and society

We could find more reasons why blockchain is not more adopted than the community would like at the moment. These include uncertainty around regulation, low technological readiness for mass adoption, low interoperability with current systems, low trust in new technologies. Adoption will take a long time, but at this point, we can be almost certain that it will happen.

For some of the above uses, regulations are necessary. Especially for the DeFi sector. Tokenization of stocks is easy to implement on Cardano at the moment, but regulatory uncertainty, in particular, prevents this. The same also applies to the possibility to enter into contracts on the blockchain. Participants would like to know if the law will help them in case of problems and what specifically is possible. Uncertainty hinders wider adoption as people, but especially large companies, will not risk unnecessary problems or even suspicion of breaking the law.

As soon as the regulations become clearer, it will be possible to start connecting decentralized networks with current solutions. It is easy to issue a decentralized identity on the blockchain, but it still requires cooperation with current authorities who can legally validate the identity. This is not a problem in developing countries, as people in the aforementioned Ethiopia have no identity. Within developed countries, this can be seen as extra work from the point of view of the authorities. Although adoption, or the promotion of a nascent technology, makes sense from the point of view of the people, the authorities may take a completely opposite view. Try to imagine the benefits when the whole world worked with one standard for people‚Äôs identity. Citizens from China would have a similar identity to citizens from Russia or the US. Everyone would know how to verify such an identity and how to work with it.

People are looking for ways to connect decentralized networks to physical or traditional centralized worlds. The NFT sector is essentially just one more such attempt alongside DeFI and ICO. NFT can be seen as an effort to connect art with the world of decentralization, which allows for unquestionable ownership of digital tokens, shared ownership, easy sale, or the implementation of new business models. At its core, it is again about changing the handling of trust or approaching Peer-to-Peer transactions. If physical art were tokenized and copyright guaranteed by law, the utilization would take on a whole new dimension. Let us not forget that pictures, music, films, magazines, games, advertising, even images are now mainly consumed digitally. In this light, NFT offers a huge potential that is waiting to be fulfilled. However, adoption must come from famous artists, and here again, regulations can help significantly.

From our point of view, there needs to be more integration and therefore adoption with decentralized systems. If we wanted to pay with cryptocurrencies and states considered it an illegal activity or were unwilling to address potential cryptocurrency fraud, mass adoption would never happen. Usage would be limited to only a few scenarios. Purely decentralized cryptocurrency payments would only work in a face-to-face scenario. Anonymous or semi-anonymous payments over the internet would be riskier. It may be difficult for the general public to build trust in decentralized systems if they are deemed unsafe or illegal by authorities. Once precise rules and laws are defined, decentralization will have the door open for mass adoption.

# Is blockchain really needed?

If participants trust each other, do they need a blockchain? They don‚Äôt, because it doesn‚Äôt matter who writes the data into the database. What if there are multiple participants and they don‚Äôt trust each other? The option is that they all agree on a single third party to trust. This third party again only needs the database. Blockchain is best suited to an environment in which there are many participants who do not trust each other. Therefore, it is necessary to reach a majority consensus over each data entry. Participants need to look out for each other. The definition of decentralization states that all participants are equal to each other. While this is not the case in practice, there is an effort to get closer to this definition. In a decentralized system, participants can enter at any time and it must be assured that no one has any advantage from having dominance. Ideally, of course, there should not be a situation where someone is in a dominant position. The rules must still apply equally to all.

Let‚Äôs look at how today‚Äôs systems work. Decisions about a particular technology and system setup can only be made by those participants who are present at the beginning or those who own the system. Those arriving later must accept the initial state. This applies to the operation of both governments and large companies. The government apparatus is somehow set up at the beginning and then only slowly and clumsily changed. Fundamental things are difficult to change. This is how it has often worked for centuries. Big companies have an even easier position because they build the system to generate profit. All other interests can go by the wayside. Once a large company has a large enough network effect, it can abuse its position almost indefinitely. Many people are born into a world in which basic functioning is decided long ago and without them. It‚Äôs hard to change anything because the system is protected by a lot of inertia.

A system based on centralization is fundamentally different from one that honors the principles of decentralization. The difference is most evident in the definition of rules, the possibility of changing them, and the redistribution of resources. In a centralized state system, the rules can be bent and circumvented. Even if the system is democratic, compliance with the rules cannot rely upon 100%. As we have already said, companies just need to follow the law and do not need to behave democratically. In centralized systems, there are always entities that overly benefit from their position. In a state system, there are control bodies that try to prevent this. Look for nothing of the sort in companies.

Decentralized systems have basic rules hardwired into the source code, and participants can monitor compliance. These rules cannot be circumvented or abused. They can only be accepted and used. This can also apply to the reallocation of resources. At the base layer of the Cardano protocol, we are talking about native ADA coins that allow the system to be owned. For the system to survive, the protocol must collect fees, which it then redistributes. The fees collected and the new coins from the monetary expansion will be given to all current stakeholders. The rules for redistribution are fixed by the protocol and apply equally to all newcomers. Dominance can only come from excessive ownership of ADA coins. However, this does not change the fact that a majority holder of ADA coins can bend the laws of the protocol without the other participants noticing. Transparency and fairness will still be maintained.

The rules of the Cardano protocol and the distribution of power via ADA coins are about the internal setup of the economic model and ensure the functioning of the network. So do all other networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. The most important rule is always about monetary policy. Other rules are about the transmission network, i.e. block creation and transaction verification. Let us now ask ourselves the very key questions. Can these simple first-layer protocol rules change the way our society works? Can the concept of decentralization make its way into the centralized structures of states and companies? Is Cardano really the biggest innovation after the Internet?

Let‚Äôs take it one step at a time. From our point of view, the rules concerning monetary policy and the transactional networks of the first layers seem insufficient to cause a major disruption in society. Alternative transaction networks with their own coins have no chance of becoming a unit of account or a mass medium of exchange. Even if we allow for this possibility, it still does not solve our trust issues with centralized entities.

There will always be entities in our society that serve multiple people. It doesn‚Äôt matter if we‚Äôre talking about existing services or newly created alternatives. There will always be some public service entities and successful global companies in our society. If we stopped paying taxes, we would still have to find a way to fund the maintenance and construction of roads in the local areas. People will always be forced to trust third parties they do not know personally and may not fully trust.

Do you remember that blockchain fits the best into an environment where people don‚Äôt trust each other? It can also be used where multiple people need to trust a single entity. Third parties can have a dominant position in terms of decision-making power regarding the funds entrusted to them. What can change is higher transparency and thus a higher chance that decision-making power will not be misused.

If we limited ourselves to a transaction network, the third party would basically just publish their address where people would send funds. Once the third party had the funds, they could do whatever they wanted with them. In countries with high levels of corruption and an inability to punish fraudsters, this would work much like it does today. The change would be negligible. Trust can be abused. Remember when Alice and Bob wanted to exchange stocks and ADA coins? Smart contracts will allow us to build new alternative business models. The powers to dispose of the funds collected can be limited and it can even be ensured that the funds will be returned to the people if certain conditions are not met. Building a new highway can be designed like a loan. The builder borrows from the people and promises to pay the money back once the road is in use. A toll will be collected which will be used to pay off the debt. People may choose to sponsor the construction of the highway in return for getting a lifetime chance to use it for free. They will be given a token linked to their identity that will allow them to use the highway. The contract between the builder and the people can be complex, but smart contracts allow all possible scenarios to be treated.

The adoption of decentralized technologies will require changing mindsets and finding new ways for society to function. It may lead to a redefinition of the social contract between us and governments. Technology gives us opportunities for which it is useful to seek applications. The development of technology will never stop, so the number of opportunities for applications will grow. Decentralization will not stop at monetary policy and the transaction network. Smart contracts extend the possibilities of decentralization in the sense that they can adjust the rules as needed for a given purpose. This is a very powerful concept and in a way a game-changer. People can agree on the rules and then rely on the network to ensure that none of the participants change the rules. No one is able to stop a contract once deployed, or prevent participants from interacting with it. It does not matter whether the contract is between two participants or between citizens and the authority.

Decentralization definitely has the potential to disrupt the functioning of the current centralized entities. However, it is imperative to continue to develop these technologies and not be hampered by expensive and slow transactions. The second layers are an absolute necessity and we are still at the beginning. Additional functionality needs to be added to enable better connectivity with the physical world, existing systems, and ultimately with centralized entities.

Cardano may indeed be one of the biggest innovations after the Internet as it advances the concept of decentralization. There are more projects like this, of course, but Cardano goes about it through peer-reviewed research and developed through evidence-based methods. This is of course no guarantee that it is the best way, but the probability is relatively high. The projects do not compete with each other in terms of objectives. Technology is impartial. I wish we could see this at the community level.

Do we need blockchain? Yes, if we want to make a fundamental change in society. Our trust in third parties is waning and we all know we need change. We now have a technology that can ensure trust not only between two participants, but also between a group of participants, or between all of us. It is up to us how we make use of it.

CryptoCurrency,FOMO and pump and dump,"I'm convinced, at this point, that many of the sources that crypto traders at large use are bent towards a fiat bias. Yet they still use them wholeheartedly. This CCP bs proves it.

So many losses accrued by foolish retail investors panic selling. For what? A corrupt investment scheme from the world's largest exporter of evil and inhumanity. Those retail investors drive prices down and force the swing traders to bail out early.

The Federal Reserve, dogmatic big government politicians, legacy finance experts, all get to go on TV and say ""See? Crypto is soooo unstable. You just can't trust it."" I'm not trying to say the sky is falling, I am saying that this proves a few things.

1. We ARE STILL EARLY. We, most of us, know that the purpose of crypto is to replace fiat. It is to force corrupt politicians out of our currency. It is to truly, give power to the people. Retail investors are looking for a quick buck, we're left hoping they come back.

2. There is no government on the face of the earth that will ever have our best interests at heart. So many times in this sub I read comments and posts where people still do not get this fact. It is as plain as the nose on your face. Breaking that paradigm could be a true key to mass adoption.

3. Legacy finance is slow to the adoption of its own survival. Yes there are obvious and glaring examples of the opposite. I think those examples to be the exceptions that prove the rule. People have failed to learn from the examples of history, that motivations for one person's act is motivating another to act differently.

4. I think all this means is we should keep our powders dry. Find our opportunities to grow, and recognize that we're not simply to be our own banks. We're to be our own news agencies, advocates, and champions. Stop looking for heroes, be one yourself.",cryptocurrency

Key observations:

* US is discounting the pandemic more than non-US.
* EM opps strong but very capital intensive; can tick off excess return but not downside protection &amp; income.
* China: Macro is hard to predict, too many variables. Wait for great valuations.
* Overall: Valuation spread collapsing; balanced portfolios prevail for now -BUT-
* Smaller, boring companies that gush cash are where to focus when valuation spread widens.

personalfinance,Significant Income Increase And Overwhelmed By Options,"Hello all,

I am 26 years old and work in marketing in Orlando. I had been saving some money back in 2018 and had around $12,000 but unfortunately was laid off twice over the year and burnt through basically all of my savings. I was making around $45,000-$50,000 back then. In Jan of 2019 I landed a job paying $50,000. Summer of 2020 I got a $5,000 increase to put me around $58,000.

Last month I negotiated a promotion because I had been doing managerial level work, but they only brought me up to $65,000. The job market is super hot and I've had recruiters reaching out to me left and right and just accepted an offer for a job that pays $60/hour, 40 hours a week, on a W2 paid weekly. It's a 6 month contract and they are looking to convert and extend. Of course none of that is guaranteed, but a lot of the job offers and interviews I have been getting have been around $85-100k. Assuming I take off 3 weeks a year like a standard PTO, that puts me around $118,000 for the year.

After taxes, and before vacation days that puts me now at net.

Monthly: Around $7,800

Weekly: Around $1,800

I currently have no retirement savings and no big emergency fund. I know a 4-6 month emergency fund is my first step.

I have a car loan at $425/month that has $13,320 left on it at 3.290% interest going until about March of 2024. It's a 2017 Maxima with 53,000 miles on it that I received a quote on from Carmax and is worth $21,500 currently to sell to them at a $8,000 difference between what I can get an owe. After interest and taxes and fees and upgrades the car came out to $27,900 for the car loan at 7,000 miles on it back in 2018. A bit below market value.

I currently rent an apartment and split the rent with a roommate. I'm paying $850 in rent and after all utilities it comes to around $1,000 a month. My lease ends in December, and I have the option to renew. Hopefully rent doesn't skyrocket as it has been doing all over Orlando.

I spend way too much eating out and can cut that down a lot.

My biggest questions are on retirement, saving for a house, and what to do with my car.

I will now be making an ***additional*** $3,100 or so, after taxes, every single month. Assuming just the 6 month contract, that's close to $20k I will be saving if I didn't save a penny of the money I was making before the job switch. I can probably be near $40-50k after a year depending on how tight I budget.

I'm worried about house prices continuing to rise and interest rates starting to come up as well. I'm renting, which I know isn't always just throwing money away, but I'd like to start getting equity in something.

I'm also worried about not having any retirement savings currently. I'm looking into a Roth IRA. Given I am a W2 contractor, there is no 401k match currently.

Also wondering if I should do something about my car, given it seems to be in a prime spot right now of value, compared to what is left owed on it. I drive quite a bit and worry if I wait a year or two years to sell it will drop drastically in value once it approaches 80-100k miles. I know then buying a replacement car may be tough with the chip shortage, but having that extra $8,000 in the bank sounds nice to use for a down payment or retirement catch up.

Living in a safe and nice place and driving a decent car are important to me. I eat out a bit, and can cut back on that. I don't spend a ton on clothes or alcohol or random things. I take a couple road trips a year.

What is my best course of option moving forward over the next year or so? I am at around $118k, and know that job isn't guaranteed forever, but feel confident in being able to at minimum land at a job that pays $85-90k if things didn't pan out there.",finance
CryptoCurrency,How the economy works. Macro 101 with the crisis in China in mind,"I have been wanting to write this for a while. I am a economics teacher who had a cup of coffee at a economics think tank.

In order for an modern economy to be properly functioning money needs to be moving.  Typically, interest rates are increased or decreased to slow down or speed up the economy. This allow banks to loan out money for investments (trucks, computers and software)to improve the speed of business. Businesses will then hire more people and they will spend money in the economy. (Very simplified)

Now there has been a housing boom in China. That boom might be crashing in front of us. Many are over leveraged and will not be able to pay their bills. When/ if this happens the second largest economy in the world will have serious issues and spending will slow down. (Simplified) 

If this happens the global economy will be affected and that includes the crypto markets.  Start thinking ahead in all areas of your finances. Try to have 6 months of savings. It might get a lot worse before it gets better.

CryptoCurrency,"6 Inner Demon that caused your trading losses, which one do you have?","# Hello everyone, I am your friend (Coin Circle One Brother)

# Focus on the analysis of the digital currency market, strive to deliver the most valuable currency market information to the majority of currency friends, welcome the attention and praise of the majority of currency friends, and reject any market smoke bombs! Thank you for your praise and attention!

Let's talk about why trading always loses money.

You must know that the biggest opponent of traders is not the market, nor the elusive market trends, but ourselves.

In the past year, 80 out of 100 people may have asked me to help them identify the reasons for their losses. So today I will combine my trading experience to talk about the 6 most difficult demons to overcome in my own trading history.

You can look for your own demons together, and destroy them together if you find them. If you don't, work together to compound interest in the currency circle for a long time.

**Inner Demon** **1: Greed**

Greed is the biggest demon in trading. As long as you develop greed, it must be a deep abyss. It can be said that 90% of the psychological problems in trading come from greed.

What are the manifestations of greed?

Do not want to miss the market, want to buy at the lowest point, sell at the highest point, is greedy.

Don't want to miss the market of any variety, it is greed.

Want to pursue the perfect trading system is greed.

Even unwillingness to accept losses is greedy.

Pursuing huge profits and heavy trading is even more greedy.

The naive pursuit of financial freedom is the greed of greed.

There are too many such examples.

**How to deal with it?**

Change cognition. Any trading system has its own rate of return, and long-term stable and reasonable returns are the pursuit of trading.

I am a victim of greed myself.

When I started trading, I quickly achieved some results, which made my heart like a balloon extremely inflated.

The purpose of my trading is to achieve financial freedom. In order to achieve this goal, I invested all my energy and all my savings, and I also studied hard. I felt that at that time, as long as I wanted to do it, everything could be achieved.

So I want to create a perfect trading system that can predict future market trends, with a high success rate, good profit-loss ratio, small drawdown, and heavy trading, quickly doubling.

At that time, I watched some wealth myths every day. Whoever achieved richness because of trading, I fantasized every day that I could replicate this kind of success. At that time, I was so poor that I was watching Porsche every day.

**But how can there be any magical trading system?**

In those few years, I was in a mess. Fortunately, there are a few like-minded friends making deals. They are calmer than me. We have changed our expectations for transaction returns. From the initial expected doubling of 10 times to a stable 40%+annual interest rate, after several years of compound interest, we gradually have everything we want.

I remember it deeply. I have a very good friend by my side. He used 10,000 US dollars to trade in five days and made more than 40,000 US dollars. We often drink to celebrate. Within a few days, this friend disappeared, and no one has been contacted so far. He is said to have liquidated several accounts, including his relatives and friends.

Alas, life is impermanent, don't be greedy. Greed is the biggest loss

**Inner Demon 2ÔºöFear**

The main reason for the poor execution of many people's transactions is due to fear.

What are the manifestations of fear in trading?

Optimistic about the market, afraid to open a position, afraid of losing money. The trading plan is clearly formulated, there are obvious rules for entering and exiting the market, and the capital is also a reasonable ratio. When the conditions for opening a position are met, they dare not click the button for opening a position. If you want to wait, you missed it.

We have the right trading funds, but we have made a profit but dare not hold positions. With the ups and downs of the market, afraid of profit taking, we rushed to close the position.

We can't stop losses, but it's also a manifestation of fear, fearing that if we lose money, we won't be able to make money back.

Our capital positions are getting smaller and smaller. In the futures trading, we finally opened our capital positions to 0.01 hand, but it was still tangled.

**There are many such examples, how to solve them?**

The fear in trading is mainly due to the face of unknown market conditions, we do not know the final profit and loss of the transaction.

Fear in the face of the unknown is human nature.

The best way to solve this problem is to turn an unknown profit and loss result into a predictable profit with a high probability.

How to do it specifically? That is to test the profitability of the trading system extensively.

The specific methods and cases to solve the fear psychology, because the number of words are too many, I will not repeat them one by one. Friends who are interested can communicate with me alone.

**If you think my views are helpful to everyone, you can give me a thumbs up or follow me. You are also welcome to leave a message and discuss their trading experience together!**",cryptocurrency

&gt;(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve officials signaled they would probably begin tapering their bond-buying program soon and revealed a **growing inclination to start raising interest rates in 2022.**  
&gt;  
&gt;If progress toward the Fed‚Äôs employment and inflation goals ‚Äúcontinues broadly as expected, the committee judges that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted,‚Äù the U.S. central bank‚Äôs policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said Wednesday in a statement following a two-day meeting.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Fed also published updated quarterly projections which showed officials are now **evenly split** on whether or not it will be appropriate to begin raising the federal funds rate as soon as next year, according to the median estimate of FOMC participants. **In June, the median projection indicated no rate increases until 2023.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a virtual press conference at 2:30 p.m. in Washington to discuss the U.S. central bank‚Äôs first steps toward withdrawing emergency pandemic support for the economy.  
&gt;  
&gt;His performance will be parsed both by investors and the White House: The central bank chief‚Äôs term expires in February and President Joe Biden is expected to decide this fall whether or not to renominate him to another four years in his post.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚Äúwe‚Äôre seeing a Fed that is getting more hawkish,‚Äù Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton LLP, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television after the statement was published.  
&gt;  
&gt;U.S. stocks rose slightly, while yields on 10-year Treasuries maintained an earlier decline. The dollar remained lower after the decision.  
&gt;  
&gt;New Projections  
&gt;  
&gt;The FOMC decided to maintain the target range for its benchmark policy rate at zero to 0.25%, and continue purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $120 billion per month. The vote was unanimous.  
&gt;  
&gt;Projections for 2024 were also published for the first time, with the median suggesting a federal funds rate of 1.8% by the end of that year. The median for 2023 rose to 1%, from 0.6% in the June projection.  
&gt;  
&gt;Other Forecast Takeaways (median estimate):  
&gt;  
&gt;FOMC median projection for 2022 inflation rose to 2.2% from 2.1% in June; held the 2023 forecast at 2.2%  
&gt;  
&gt;Unemployment 3.8% 2022, 3.5% 2023; no change from June forecast  
&gt;  
&gt;GDP growth seen at 3.8% in 2022, 2.5% in 2023, both higher than the prior projections  
&gt;  
&gt;The Fed also said it would double the per-counterparty limit on its overnight reverse-repurchase agreement facility to $160 billion daily.  
&gt;  
&gt;The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 5.2% in August, well below the April 2020 peak of 14.8%. But it‚Äôs still above the 3.5% rate that prevailed in February 2020, just before the pandemic struck. Fed officials have said they expect to keep the funds rate near zero ‚Äúuntil labor-market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committee‚Äôs assessments of maximum employment.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Inflation, according to the Fed‚Äôs preferred measure, was 4.2% in the 12 months through July, well above the central bank‚Äôs 2% target. Many Fed officials have said they expect it to return to around 2% after temporary supply-chain disruptions resulting from the pandemic have been resolved, though several have also cited the rapid price increases as a reason to begin raising rates as early as next year.",finance

economy,What are your plans on earning interest rates in the case of the bear market?,"It is highly likely that the recent downturn in the cryptocurrency market is not an isolated case, and many have lost a certain value of their crypto assets. So what are your further plans? I believe some of you may ""hodl"" until the next growth. And such a strategy takes place, especially for long-term investors! However, how do you consider earning interest strategy while simply holding?

There‚Äôs a great way that many of you had already heard of ‚Äî making money with your cryptocurrency while waiting for it to go up in value through interest payments on cryptocurrency investment platforms. 

The first thing that comes to my mind is something like [Blockfi](https://blockfi.com/), which is probably described as the easiest method of earning interest on your Bitcoin. It is a financial company specializing in digital assets that provides services to both businesses and individuals. After registering for an account, a user stores their cryptocurrency on the platform, where it earns interest of up to 8.6% (verify that). Blockfi pays interest monthly. The platform does not have a deposit limit for minimum or maximum amounts, making it a good place for both beginners and experienced investors.

How about DeFi space? Here I turned my attention to a Swiss DeFi asset management company called [Midas Yield](https://y.midas.investments/). The company explores and uses liquidity providing, lending, borrowing, and yield farming opportunities on over 50 DeFi protocols to offer the best yields across multiple assets. One of the core yield sources is concentrated liquidity providing on Uniswap V3, the biggest decentralized exchange. The platform doesn't lock users' assets and pays daily interests up to 13%.

But, man, what about dessert? Of course, I couldn't get past [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) ‚Äî  more than one million users platform. Unlike some of the other savings platforms, crypto.com is available only as a mobile app. The website exists as an information and marketing vehicle. The platform supports more than 90 cryptocurrencies that can be used to earn interest or be bought and sold by users. The interest rates are up to 12%.

CryptoCurrency,My macroeconomics textbook view on Bitcoin!,"Will Bitcoins Replace Dollars? 

Bitcoins are virtual assets that can be used in transactions. Their use relies on a technology that allows transactions to take place without any third party being involved. As of December 2018, the total number of bitcoins in circulation was 17.3 million. One bitcoin was worth $3,900, so the total value of the bitcoin stock was $67 billion. This may sound big, but it is very small compared to the total value of the stock of US currency, $1.5 trillion. Despite this, some bitcoin supporters argue that, one day, bitcoins will replace dollars (and euros and yen) as the currency used in most transactions. If this were to happen, the supply of currency would no longer be determined by the Fed (or other central banks), but by the mechanical rule that determines the creation of new bitcoins over time. Monetary policy as we know it would disappear (and much of my textbook would have to be rewritten). 

Is it at all conceivable? One can indeed imagine a world in which all prices were quoted in bitcoins, all interest rates were quoted in bitcoins, and people and firms did all their transactions in bitcoins. Then, there would be no reason to hold dollars, and dollars would indeed disappear. 

Is it likely to happen? No. For three reasons: 

First, for economic reasons. So long as most prices are quoted in dollars, transactions in bitcoins will involve what is known as ""price risk."" If the price of bitcoins in terms of dollars were stable, the risk would be limited. This is not the case. As shown in Figure 1 below, since its introduction, the price of bitcoins has fluctuated widely. From about $1,000 at the beginning of 2017, it soared to $19,300 at the end of 2017, only to fall back to $3,900 at the end of 2018. Holding bitcoins is a very risky proposition and is likely to remain so. 

(Yes I understand this data is outdated but we all agree on its current volitility)

Second, for technical reasons. The technology of bitcoins is such that the verification process and the creation of bitcoins are extremely expensive. The electricity used today by computers for Bitcoin-related operations would be enough to supply electricity to 4 million US households. Were the use of bitcoins increase dramatically, the costs would most likely follow. 

Third, for political reasons. Countries want to keep control of their monetary policy and will not relinquish it to private actors. Moving to an equilibrium where bitcoins become the main or the only currency would require a large coordination among price setters: You will typically not want to quote your prices in bitcoins if nearly everybody else quotes theirs in dollars. You will only do it if nearly everybody else quotes theirs in bitcoins. Such coordination to move from one equilibrium to the other can be achieved only with the help of the state. And the states will not willingly give up their currency.

The market bounced today, breaking on the year‚Äôs longest streak of underperformance as Evergrande fears in the US ease and market participants digest commentary from the Federal Reserve‚Äôs September monetary policy meeting, which indicated the central bank will likely start tapering the pace of quantitative easing in the ‚Äúcoming meetings‚Äù and telegraphed interest rate hikes six or seven times by the end of 2024. As I have said repeatedly, I remain unconcerned by the tapering of quantitative easing, I think the real test for equities will come when the Fed begins raising the interest rate sometime in the coming 1-2 years. Glad to see the market avoid a taper tantrum today.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has previously communicated to the market that the timing of a so-called taper ‚Äúwill not be intended to carry a direct signal‚Äù on the timing of eventual rate hikes. 

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm)

Since the depths of the pandemic, the Fed has been absorbing about $120 billion a month in U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities. But Fed officials have said in recent weeks that by the end of the year, the economy will likely make the ‚Äúsubstantial further progress‚Äù indicated last December needed for the central bank to begin slowing the pace of those purchases.

Here is the full transcript: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20210922a1.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20210922a1.pdf)

The Fed signaled, ‚ÄúParticipants generally view that as long as the recovery remains on track, a gradual tapering process that concludes around the middle of next year is likely to be appropriate‚Äù. 

In other news, during remarks following the release of the the meeting, Powell promised to make changes to the central bank‚Äôs rules on members trading securities. e added that he was not aware of the controversial trades made by Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren in 2020 prior to media reports over the past month.

‚ÄúWe understand very well that the trust of the American people is essential for us to effectively carry out our mission. And that‚Äôs why I directed the Fed to begin a comprehensive review of the ethics rules around permissible financial holdings and activity by Fed officials,‚Äù he said.

personalfinance,Should I keep just hacking away at my credit card (&gt;20% apr) or get a personal loan with a way less interest rate to pay it off?,"Alright so first off I know I'm not the best at budgeting, but I think I do okay. Probably do more than most people. I have a spreadsheet that I update frequently with all of my purchases and try my best to follow it (which doesn't always happen.) I'm constantly adjusting to see where I can move money into other budget lines (spend less on clothes, more on food, etc). 

I'm sitting at some couple thousand on my personal CC that's been sitting there for a few years, due to massive misfortune after I graduated which left me homeless for a few months. I've been trying to pay it off. The balance just kind of sits there. I do my best with my budget to allocate *at minimum* interest+50 or so bucks, though I'm not making a big dent. The card's APR is 22.99% which stresses me out. I currently do not use it, just trying to pay it off.

I have an option to take out a personal loan at 10-15% interest, pay off my credit card immediately, and then sit at the lower interest rate for a while.

Realistically I could not take it, and just try to keep hacking away at the debt. The lower interest and predictable monthly payment would definitely be nice though.

Any advice? Pros/cons of doing this?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Crypto being blamed for causing any future market crash in the mainstream media today,"I wanted to share the FUD that's making it to the front page of the mainstream media today, which is likely planted by those manipulating the entire system. The current narrative is that crypto will cause the next big crash.

I find it ironic that Satoshi invented Bitcoin in response to banks causing the 2008 financial crisis, and only 12 years later it is being blamed for an upcoming potential market crash.

[Drudge Report](https://www.drudgereport.com/) today has the following articles linked:

**POWELL: Fed mulls launching digital currency...**

**Could Doom Dollar...**

**Crypto Equated to Toxic Pre-Crisis Swaps by Banking Watchdog...**

**Threat to Financial System...**

**Treasury Sanctions First Exchange...**

So as you can see, crypto is being blamed for any upcoming crashes. The [pre-crisis swap Yahoo article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-equated-toxic-pre-crisis-192241795.html) says this:

&gt;Notorious credit default swaps were engineered by math wizards in much the same way crypto has emerged. Crypto/DeFi today is on a path that looks similar to CDS in the early 2000‚Äôs.

&gt;How are the returns generated? It is hard to get straight answers that don‚Äôt quickly devolve into cryptospeak.

&gt;Crypto/DeFi solutions to problems in the real economy are rare

The [MSN article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/crypto-risks-existential-threat-as-us-crackdown-gathers-steam/ar-AAOGPfQ) talks about 

&gt;Cryptocurrency firms are fighting for lobbyists and fielding subpoenas in what could be an existential fight over how the multitrillion-dollar industry should be regulated. In the past month, lobbyists have been overwhelmed by firms seeking representation in Washington, as regulators threaten the cryptocurrency companies with lawsuits or cease-and-desist orders. Current and former enforcers say those warnings are likely just the beginning. 

At least the Celsius CEO is fighting the good fight:

&gt;‚ÄúWe have to work twice as hard because these guys have the largest lobbyists working for them at both at the state and the federal level,‚Äù Mashinsky said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll prevail. The fight is over all the money in the world, right?‚Äù

Anyway, I just wanted to share the FUD that's going around in the mainstream media today. Seems like a storm is brewing and crypto's going to get the blame for anything and everything wrong with the world's financial system.",cryptocurrency

worldpolitics,What is Japan preparing for?,"Japan's unprecedented activity in conducting military exercises is causing increasing concern on Russia and China. July 2021, the exercises ‚ÄúOriental shield 2021‚Äù were held. The largest bilateral field exercise of the US and Japanese Ground Self-Defense Forces, which gathered more than 1,600 people and hundreds of equipment. The exercises took place at the Yasubetsu training area, within 100 km from the islands of the Lesser Kuril Change. Visiting Hokkaido during the exercises, Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi officially stated that the northern direction is of ‚Äúcritical importance‚Äù. By the way, Japan has only one neighbor in the north ‚Äì Russian Federation. This statement makes it clear that the Japanese consider Russia as a potential target in the north, in particular the southern Kuril Islands.
Before the dust of the July Japan-US exercises ‚ÄúEastern Shield‚Äù has settled down, samurai embarked on a new trip. The Ground Self-Defense Forces are mobilizing for the largest exercises since the Cold War. They will gather 100 thousand personnel, 20 thousand vehicles, 120 aircraft, as well as a landing ship of the US Army. This time, the exercises are anti-Chinese oriented related to Japan's territorial claims to the Peoples Republic of China around the Senkaku Islands. Hence, the question naturally arises: what the country voluntarily abandoned the armed forces preparing and hoping for?
Russia is a nuclear Power, capable of defending the sovereignty of its territories by dialogue, and if necessary ‚Äì with its own armed forces. If Japan is preparing to solve the territorial issue in the northern direction, which is of ""critical importance"" for them, by force, then it should be noted that modern Russia has quite enough power and means to repel an aggression. The PRC also has nuclear weapons and advanced means of delivery and American missile defense systems Aegis cannot block it. Also, Japanese do not want to rely on the United States. Americans can use Japan to their advantage, but they will not get involved in World War III just for the sake of a distant eastern country. An open armed confrontation, both with Russia and with China, will lead to enormous losses, primarily from Japan. Small piece of land should not be equal to lives of millions of people, including civilians, and unleashing a nuclear war.",energy
worldpolitics,Again the US is at the center of scandal,"We all know that the United States is the main driving force in the development of capitalism. And as practice has shown, the America is ready for anything for money. No matter how hard they tried to convince us that the countries of the NATO counties mutually support each other, the recent events with France, the United States and the United Kingdom made it clear to the world community that everything is not so smooth. The reason for the discord in the ""Western family"" as usual was a large chunk of money that the Americans literally snatched from France. We are talking about the fact that a few days ago Australia broke a 56 billion euros contract with the French shipbuilding corporation NAVAL GROUP for 12 submarines. Now, instead of the French, the Americans will deliver submarines to Australia. 
The reason for such an unexpected change of supplier is AUKUS, which has often flashed in the news headlines in the last few days. On September 16, 2021, world heard of an establishment of the AUKUS trilateral partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. It is worth noting that representatives of the Australian Foreign Ministry say that this is not a military block, but an exclusively friendly alliance created for the exchange of technologies and experience. But the alliance where Australia will build nuclear powered submarines for the first time in history can hardly be called offenseless. It looks more like a direct threat from America and Britain, which aims at strengthening their positions in the Asia-Pacific region and undermining the authority of Russia and China. Of course, the United States just looking to expand its spheres of influence. Such cooperation makes it possible for America to interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries and threatens stability in the region. Such an association is more than undesirable for Russia and China. After all, any exchange of technologies and experience in the field of national security implies joint actions, such as military exercises and training. Therefore, it is not surprising that representatives of the Russian Federation and China are concerned about the AUKUS. They think the trilateral union is nothing more than an attempt by the West to pursue an anti-Russian and anti-Chinese policy and strengthen control in the Asia-Pacific region.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Tokenization of stock/bond markets,"Watching the FED meeting today was painful when they started talking about conflicts of interest and certain FED members making million dollar trades in the markets they they oversaw and bought assets from. 

Tokenization of the stock market and bond market would make everything so much more transparent from a compliance and regulatory perspective. If we tokenized these markets we would (or regulators) be able to see his trades and holdings in real time so they can see any wrong doing when this shit actually happens and not years later when they have to disclose all the money they made from their shady dealings. 

The FED members are requires to disclose their holdings and trades ONCE a year and this FED member made like 37 multi million dollar trades in a year with no one knowing shit about what he was doing until huge already made huge profits from insider info. 

Wouldn't it be so much better if we can see what these scum regulators and political figures are doing with their money so we can stop them of taking advantage from the insider information they all seem to have and use to get rich as fuck.

I am 46, same job for about 20, and survived the last one by going higher in bonds during a market crash. However, with the fed decision to hold interest rates, bond values are not the safe play that they were in 08. Is there a safe play in a declining market and frozen rates?",finance
retirement,"If you are looking for secure income, has the FED been robbing you? Look twice!","I did some figuring.

From the time the FED started doing Quantitative Easing (QE) in 2009 the interest rates have continued to plummet to near zero. Instead of me getting a secure 3% to 6% on CDs and Treasury Notes and Bonds, I can barely eke out 1.3% on a 10 Year Treasury Note.

The FED has made it so the U.S. Government gets cheap money to spend at will, at the cost of everyone that is in retirement that has money that should be in secure and safe assets, instead of the stock market. Of course, I too had to move money in more risky assets and have done well, until‚Ä¶‚Ä¶the next deep dive, like in the 2007-2009 time period, where the SPY500 lost 50% or more.  Then what?

So the first look, is retirees not having a place for secure and safe assets that provide a reasonable return, for retirement accounts.

Secondly, the Social Security Trust Fund is taking a huge hit also. From January 2010 to today, the interest received from the Special U.S. Treasury Bonds/Notes has halved, even though the Trust Fund Balance has grown. In 2010 the Social Security Trust Fund received approximately $119.6 Billion in interest, while in 2020 the Trust received an estimate of $67.8 Billion.

THE AMOUNT OF INTERESTED RECEIVED IN 2020 WAS 57% LESS THAN 10 YEARS AGO! NO WONDER THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND IS STARTING TO RUN OUT OF MONEY! IF THE RATE REMAINED THE SAME OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS AS 2010, THE TRUST FUND WOULD HAVE ANOTHER $288 BILLION IN IT!

So, the second look is FED‚Äôs QE and low Fed Funds rates are causing decreased interest going into the Social Security Trust Fund.

THE IMPACT ON THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND ISN'T AS BAD AS THE IMPACT ON THE RETIREES! RETIREES HAVE LOST 70-80% OF INTEREST IN THE PAST 10 YEARS DUE TO THE VERY LOW RATES FROM SECURE ASSETS, SUCH AS CDs and TREASURIES.

THE FED HAS FAILED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. THEY HAVE SCREWED THE RETIREMENT COMMUNITY.

CryptoCurrency,Thoughts on the Crypto Market Today (23 Sept),"Happy pre-Friday, everyone! Yesterday was my first post on Reddit on the Evergrande Fiasco and many people told me to post here daily. Here goes post #2!

Today: We‚Äôll find out in a few hours if Evergrande does indeed pay its USD interest obligation; I‚Äôm leaning for it to trigger its 30-day grace period and potentially ghosting the media entirely (remember folks, this still doesn‚Äôt signal the end of the world).

Digressing back to the write-up, today‚Äôs piece focuses on 3 topical subjects, relating to: Central Bank (CB) decisions / Crypto Regulations / ending with my usual technical analysis (TA). Let‚Äôs get to it:

**1.** Yesterday, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) confirmed it would stick to its ultra-easy monetary policy (maintaining its target for short-term interest rates at -0.1% + its target for the 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield at practically zero). The Fed was next, holding on to its decision to not cut / taper yet. Immediately, the Crypto market reacted positively, glorifying its decision to ‚Äúkeep printing.‚Äù \[brrrrr\]‚Ä¶ Looking deeper into the dot plot though, two members changed their forecast nearer with half the committee now forecasting an increase in 2022.

IMO, I‚Äôm surprised to see how well the market reacted‚Ä¶ The FOMC has always been a game of expectation, and Powell disappointed in my books - Prior to this morning‚Äôs FOMC, expectation was for the first hike / taper to be in Oct/Nov 2022. He‚Äôs now pushed it forward to a target of mid-2022. In theory, for the Fed to stop its current QE pace of US$80bn/month, that would mean a US$10bn/month reduction vs the US$10bn/meeting expectation. The fact that he also provided a precise expectation gauge vs his previous casual remarks also bring us one step closer to the end of the printing party. That said, the market reaction was actually right long-term (even though they‚Äôre thinking short-term), as I‚Äôm doubtful that things would be as rosy in the months leading to mid-2022.

**2.** WSJ headlined today ‚ÄúSEC‚Äôs Gensler Doesn‚Äôt See Cryptocurrencies Lasting Long.‚Äù This was taken from his online interview with the Washington Post yesterday. The only thing I saw in the interview that could lead to such a conclusion was when Mr Gensler remarked, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs long-term viability for five or six thousand private forms of money‚Äù \[speaking on stablecoins\]. One can only shake their heads for someone so skilled to magically conjure such a heading‚Ä¶

Anyways, Biden tapped Omarova to head the OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency). For our purposes, the primary role of the OCC is to: ‚Äú(A). to ensure the safety and soundness of the national banking system; (B). to foster competition by allowing banks to offer new products and services; (C). to ensure fair and equal access to financial services to all Americans; (D). to enforce anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism finance laws; and to (E). investigate misconduct committed by institution-affiliated parties.‚Äù Apparently, Omarova is a Crypto critic, who would spell trouble given her key power to approve / deny applications for new charters, branches, capital, and changes in the banking structure. That said, I would hold off on judging her until we hear her speak at the very least (I myself used to be a critic but flipped rather quickly). Interestingly, if we were to re-read the key roles of the OCC, DeFi is clearly the best solution to (B), (C), (E).

**3.** Finally‚Ä¶ Volatility is the name of the game come tomorrow (Sept 24), with $2.8bn of BTC and $1.4bn of ETH options expiring, the highest volume since May 17 (same date when its price collapsed from $43k to $30k). Downside protection is still in-demand as 1-week 25d skew continue to lie on the high end of \~15% (avg. 4%). The current max pain price is at $44k, but shorts are still protected considering current price levels. On-chain metrics show little change at present, with exchange outflows and miner flows dipping back down during this reversal from $40k to $43k. MVRV ratios for BTC and ETH have also creeped back down to the 2.0 range, around the same as late May. This gauge to some look like a healthy consolidation.

personalfinance,Refinancing my auto loan?,"Is there any major cons to refinancing an auto loan and how do you go about the process? Can this be done all online or will there be phone calls or in person appointments for refinancing?

I can afford my current payment just fine now, so if my best choice is to stay then that‚Äôs alright. Also if it‚Äôs a hassle and going to take hours sitting at the bank I rather not.

I‚Äôm just curious if a lower interest rate is really possible for me. My loan is currently about 6 percent interest, I‚Äôve seen BofA offers refinancing loans as little as 3 percent. My credit score is a little over 770 via Chase app and was 680 or so when I initially got my loan over 2 years ago. So I don‚Äôt know if that would be good enough for them to give me around that 3%?

So basically tldr; is applying for refinancing worth it when your credit score increases by 100? Is getting a 3% interest loan possible? Is it a hassle to do or can it all be done via computer?

Living with parents but saving every month to eventually purchase a home. I've heard people say that the biggest way middle class stay broke is by paying car loans, and so I was wondering what the best move in my case in. I am currently paying off a 2019 Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus with full self driving (Purchased used for 41k out the door with 20k miles) and I owe about 33k at 3.0% interest rate. My payments are about 500 a month but I usually give about 6-700 a month to help bring the principle down. I haven't anything in terms of maintenance in the year ive owned it other than an air filter replacement ($40) and i spend about $50 a month charging it at superchargers. Insurance is roughly around $175. I don't feel like my budget is necessarily stretched, but I feel as if I could be saving much better and more efficiently. Would my best move be to continue to pay off the loan and paying extra per month to finish it off early? Or would it be to trade it in (Appraisal from carmax put me at positive 4k equity.) and get something much cheaper, gasoline vehicle? I know gas prices are relatively high right now at least in my area, and as far as I have been reading online, the depreciation percentage on the Model 3 is pretty low as well for 5 years.

CryptoCurrency,"If the SEC is suing Crypto exchanges citing ponzi schemes and scams, why not sue all banks?","I think it's a no brainier. The SEC is using a horrible excuse to go after Crypto. They are constantly waging a propaganda campaign against Crypto. To state their own concerns, they call Crypto a ""flavor of the year for fraudsters"". Yet despite them trying to look like saints, they continue to lobby for banks.

They call Crypto a ponzi scheme while completely ignoring the shit banks do. The entire purpose of banks is to take your money and scam you by giving you a horrible interest rate while using the same money to loan to others and saddle them with debt using high interest rates. If this doesn't sound like a scam or a ponzi scheme, then I don't know what is.

Moreover, their entire motive for going after Crypto is to save banks. Imagine if everyone knew about Crypto. Who the fuck on earth would deposit their money into banks for a 0.01% interest rate while they could put that money into any Crypto exchange for an interest rate hundeds or even thousands of times more? Their entire pursuit is to stop Crypto from giving banks a run for their money.

These people have a mindset from the 19th century and are funded by banks. They keep trying to convince people that banks are superior and that [Crypto won't last long](https://www.wsj.com/articles/secs-gensler-doesnt-see-cryptocurrencies-lasting-long-11632246355). They can't cope with the fact that Crypto is already becoming legal tender of some countries in just 10 years of existence, while banks are failing due to their shady policies.

But alas, Crypto is used for scams right? I mean, even if you look at some of the most high level Crypto scams, it is nothing considered to the scams you can fall for using banks and fiat. Banks themselves are scamming people at an institutional level. Yet these people ignore banks because their paycheck relies on them.

This problem is not only endemic to Denmark, taking into account inflation. In New Zealand, the largest bank, ANZ offers a ‚ÄúSerious Saver‚Äù Account which pays up to 0.2% pa, as long as you makes no withdrawals for the whole month. Considering NZ‚Äôs inflation rate this year being 3.3%, by keeping the money at the bank, people are actually losing purchasing power. ANZ and many other banks also offer ‚Äúflexible saving accounts‚Äù which pay around 0.05% pa.

One viable option is actually staking stablecoin. This post is not intended to endorse any particular stablecoin pool, but a quick look around shows one could earn at least USDC 8.88%, TUSD 8.88%, BUSD 8.88% pa.

The banks often try the best to confuse customers between ‚Äúsavings‚Äù and ‚Äúinvest‚Äù,  and get people to ‚Äúinvest‚Äù their money for a few cents a month. For me, savings is for a rainy day, so keeping, says 6 months emergency funds into a bank account.

# September 19-25, 1921

This week, the Fed lowers rates to 5%, and the WSJ editors bravely declare the Dow has bottomed.

&gt;**Quick Stats:**  
*DJIA: 69.43 (Today: 34,584)*  
*Shiller PE Ratio: 5.4 (Today: 38.3)*  
*Federal Reserve Bank of NY Discount Rate: 5.0% (Today: 0.25%)*  
*GBPUSD: $3.71 (Today: $1.37)*  
*Price of The Wall Street Journal: $0.07 (Today: $4.00)*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Market-Moving Themes:**  
Sentiment remains lukewarm towards stocks despite the perfect setup (equity, debt markets)  
As wartime raw material shortages ease, relative price stability reigns (commodity markets)  
German war reparations causing strong dollar (currency markets)

**Executive Summary:**

* On September 19, the WSJ editors bravely declare that ‚Äúthere is a bull market impending in stocks‚Äù and the August low was the finale to the 1919-1921 bear market. This masterful front page news piece walks through how National City Bank (today known as Citigroup) and The New York Times believe the current bounce in the market is a ‚Äúfalse boom,‚Äù yet these same characters were so wrong in November 1919 when the market turned south. Writers go on to say that the current bear established itself when things looked impossibly good. The reverse is now true today.
* The broad equity and debt markets in New York and London may be dull, but there‚Äôs always a bull market somewhere. The trading action over the past month has been in Germany. On Monday, pit traders illustrate the view from the German bourse. Speculation runs rampant. Banned from owning dollars, the public want to move their wealth out of marks. To where? Stocks. Equities are going gangbusters, with coal and iron companies bid up. Areas where desks previously rested are now in storage to make room for people.  

   * **Historical Fact:** In the early phase of the Weimar Republic‚Äôs inflationary saga, the equity market preserved purchasing power. As we get closer to the middle of 1922, hyperinflation will wipe out equities, debt, and currency holders leaving real estate as the sole wealth preserver. Too little or too much inflation damages any economy.
* The Federal Reserve of New York lowers rates from 5.5% to 5% on September 21. The rest of the Fed branches match in tandem. The powerful New York Federal Reserve President (Governor pre-1935), Benjamin Strong, delivers a terse statement to the Journal. Equities seem nonplussed and drop the next day. The aggregate yield on high quality debt rallies from 4.8% to 4.5%.
* A special ""Sequence of Crisis"" report out of Amsterdam on Saturday. Such heavy hitters as Royal Dutch and Heineken were considered high-class securities only months ago. What has transpired is a terrible blow for investors and speculators alike, who had bought these shares never expecting a catastrophe. Perception is stronger than reality, and nobody cares about business improvements over the past couple months. Depression haunts the trading hours.
* Although the first reparation committee convened nearly two years ago, Britain, Belgium and France still can‚Äôt agree on their share of German payment. All of these countries remain heavily indebted to the US, and quick goals of extinguishing war debts vanish with yet new meetings to solve this quarrel. The article mentions that the US is not pressing claims, and will not push any of the Allied countries into bankruptcy as long as it ‚Äúreceives its share of the fruits of victory.‚Äù",finance

Bitcoin,The BTC Game,"Aside from planting FOMO and FUD in the ""news"" cycle, I'm not entirely clear how the price of BTC is being manipulated, but I have some ideas.  

We know that the dipshit behind Mt. Gox had an after-hours trading program that just kept moving BTC from one pile to another and then back, thus generating false demand to move the price north.

So, if you can move the price north with false demand, can you move the price south with false supply?  

My guess is that the Federal Reserve and other central banks, and perhaps the BIS and IMF, have bought large holdings from multiple addresses so as to mask their 'whale' activities.  Discounting Japan and their progressive crypto stance, the largest six central banks are the Fed, China, Germany, France, Italy, England, none of whom are particularly keen on BTC.  If you can just print digital currency, how can you win?  You buy a large pile from multiple addresses, you plant FUD via clampdown and bombastic headlines, you dump large quantities from several addresses, and then you buy with other newly minted digital dollars from other addresses, then rinse and repeat.  

The way the central banks win is via SQUEEZING us out, literally like wringing a towel of its last drops of water, wringing our bitcoins out of us one by one through a cycle of bad news and wild dips in value.  

The WORST thing that we can do at this point is panic, which is really the worst thing you can do in any situation.  DON'T PANIC.  Don't look at the price.

Since graduating, I moved back home to live with my parents - we live in a very VHCOL area (Washington DC/NoVA). We are a family of immigrants and have been renters in this area since we arrived. However, over the past couple of years, it has become apparent that we have outgrown the place we are currently living in because my parents put purchasing a home on hold to help me and my younger brother pay for college. 

My parents and I started discussing purchasing a home together ‚Äì with them being the primary borrowers and me being a co-borrower. This is primarily due to my parents not being able to afford the type of home we are interested in solely on their income. With that said, the amount I would be paying to help with the mortgage is significantly less than renting with another person or on my own as rent prices are quite high in our area. I do want to say that I would prefer to live on my own if I were to rent, primarily because of not-so-great roommates in college and my friends in the area not being compatible roommates. I enjoy living with my parents and we see eye-to-eye on a lot of things. They gave up everything to restart their lives in this country and purchasing a home would essentially fulfill their American Dream and all the goals they set for themselves once they arrived here. 

My parents have made it clear though that the home will become mine once they retire and move back to our home country (they don‚Äôt care about the equity or profit made on the home, they just want to live under the same roof) ‚Äì so in a way, they are helping me purchase this home which is why it‚Äôs appealing. Another reason why this is appealing is because over the next few years or so, I can see myself and many individuals from my generation being price out of homes in the area. From what I‚Äôve researched and learned from our agent, the area we are in was somewhat resistant to the 2008 Real Estate crash. 

The past couple of days, I have been getting cold feet. While my parents did help me pay for a lot of my college, I do have $47K in federal student loan debt primarily from my graduate degree (this is the only outstanding debt I have ‚Äì no car, no CC debt, etc.). So, with that lingering over my head and trying to get my finances in order, I have been concerned with how a mortgage will impact me down the line. My current job and salary are great for this area (and I foresee myself staying with this firm for a long time), and by the time my parents retire and move on (5 years or so), I will be able to comfortably afford this home on my own. It‚Äôs just been so hard navigating all this so soon after finishing school. 

I'd appreciate any thoughts and insights on my situation but please, when giving advice be considerate that I am from a different cultural background. The country where we are from is very much collective and putting family first is of utmost importance.

Additional Information: 

My parents have excellent credit and we‚Äôve been pre-approved for way more than we need, and fully anticipate staying on the lower end of that budget. My parents are going to be putting 5% down on the home with no immediate out-of-pocket costs for me until we close on the home.",finance
personalfinance,Student loan repayment strategy: Down to just under 50k mixed between Federal (31.6k @ 5.6%) and Private (18K @ 2.8). What to do when forbearance ends?,"Hello all,

Just looking for some advice on how I should move forward with paying for my loans, namely when the Covid forbearance is done in February.

Some facts about my loan journey so far:

- I'm 31, so I've basically been paying these loans for 10 years already and I want to be done with it

- Graduated from a crap school with a crap degree (got suckered by a for profit). In my early years out of college I was dirt poor and so my student loans hit a peak of somewhere in the 120k range whilst I was unemployed with the majority being private

- Eventually started making a little money but not enough to pay more than interest for years. I let one loan go into collections (approx 26k)

- Turned things around with a career switch and tons of refinancing. Continued to ignore loan in collections

- Saved money (around 16k) for settling with the loan in collections in case I got sued while I continued to ignore it. Never got sued and the loan ended up being dismissed. Big win. That money is now my emergency fund (but is 20k now)

- Currently I work two jobs. I make 107k from my main job and somewhere around 12k-13k a year from the secondary (it's a low stress job but I honestly don't want to do it anymore, I always dream about quitting)

- My credit has repaired from my past delinquency this year. It's been good for a while but right now it sits just above 800 (according to both Chase and Discover's score calc)

- Outside of that 20k fund, I don't have much savings or assets. Just a retirement fund that I probably don't give enough money to and some other small things. No real investments like in the stock markets and no mortgage or anything like that.

- Don't have kids nor do I plan to in the next few years. Yay for debt delaying my life :(. I have a girlfriend but I live alone and don't necessarily expect that to change soon.
 
- Right now all my money goes to the private loans. My regular automatic payment is $430, then I add the $370 I would be paying my federal, plus an additional $400 from my main job and the entirety of what I get from my second job which let's call $600 monthly on average. This sums up to about $1800 monthly at least. Sometimes if I just have excess cash I'll make another payment to my loans.

Given my circumstances, what should I do? Do I just keep paying down the private until it's gone, or should I start moving a little more aggressively on the federal to save on interest? Should I just refinance my private and take advantage of the lower interest rate? At what point should I stop paying my loans so aggressively and start moving more money towards savings and investments? Or should I only do that when I'm debt free. I'd love some advice on what I should be doing. These loans have stressed me out for basically all of my adult life and while I still have a long way to go there's at least light at the end of the tunnel for me.

**TLDR: Used to be poor, now not poor. What should I do about these loans and my general savings?**",finance

The Fed announced that it will maintain the zero interest rate level and the monthly bond purchase scale of $120 billion unchanged, and said that it may officially reduce its debt at the November meeting, which is in line with market expectations.

However, the Fed will advance the time to raise interest rates to next year. The market sentiment in this interest rate resolution is dovish. Almost everyone does not think that the Fed will show a hawkish color this time to start debt reduction. The debt reduction is a secret weapon.

At the same time, it is also a Pandora‚Äôs box. No one can predict how much impact it will have on the market after it is opened, but this does not interfere with the market‚Äôs opening of another expectation for the Fed, that is, whether the specific period of debt reduction will be November or December. Including whether there is any further explanation on the speed and scale of subsequent debt reduction.

The core of the US economic recovery has gradually returned from the service industry to the manufacturing industry. It can be seen from the overall PMI production capacity from August to September that the manufacturing PMI of the local Federal Reserve in September was even more than twice as large as expected, which means The service industry economic support cycle from June to August has ended, which is why the core CPI has been able to fall.

If this continues, the U.S. economy will fall into the transition between manufacturing and services. Without checks issued by the U.S., retaliatory consumption will hardly be ushered in a second time. If you want to break this situation, then the Fed will accept The next action is to take debt reduction, or to make full communication with the market as soon as possible before being forced to take action, such as the period and details of debt reduction. This will be a measure to strengthen the confidence of the Fed‚Äôs monetary policy guidance. The market also needs this kind of clarity. signal of.

Looking at it now, interest rate hikes must be in 2022, and debt reduction can only be extended later. The global market after mid-October is likely to have global resonance turbulence. As for the global resonance in the past few days, it is just a small test. .

On September 23 news, Fed Chairman Powell stated that the Fed‚Äôs measures will ensure that monetary policy supports the economy until the recovery is complete. The Fed is firmly committed to achieving its goals. For the rest of this year, growth is likely to continue to maintain a strong pace.

Inflation is rising, and it may continue for several months before it eases. If progress continues, the reduction of debt purchases may soon be guaranteed, and debt purchases will be gradually reduced, which will end around the middle of 2022.

Powell‚Äôs speech is very clear, that is, that we will not raise interest rates this year and continue loose monetary policy to achieve economic recovery. I think that under the premise that the general environment remains the same, it is unrealistic for Bitcoin to fall sharply.

Like my prediction yesterday, short-term oversold, there will be a rebound to kill the market. Back to today's disk, the daily double needle of Bitcoin hit the bottom, and it closed with a very long lower lead. This is a manifestation of a large number of buying orders at the bottom and a sign of a short-term stop.

I predict that this wave of decline may have something to do with the Fed meeting. The main force predicts that interest rates may increase, leading to the main force hitting the market in advance. Now that interest rate hike expectations are gone, I don‚Äôt expect that there is any need to hit the market. The market outlook will likely remain unchanged. Fluctuates upwards, I suggest to continue to hold currency. The support level is **41,000** and the pressure level is **45,000.**

CryptoCurrency,Cardano Ecosystem Boost In Run-up to Sept. 25-26 Summit,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/10vf96wx5ap71.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=122ac6105599e49a50d22a7b168bb3de57e1243c

\[Update 9/28/21\]

The Cardano Summit ended this past weekend with several key announcements and developments. Perhaps chief among these is a deal with DISH network/Boost Mobile (a U.S. cable and cellular provider) which adds yet another tangible use case for the Cardano ecosystem.

EMURGO also announced a $100M fund for defi, NFT, and education.¬†

Other notables included:

* The new Djed stable coin, to be built with COTI (their token has been soaring despite the broader crypto downturn), will be an important development for the Cardano defi ecosystem
* The previously announced dApp store
* A deal for an esports tie-up with¬†NFT marketplace Rival
* Purpose-driven project VeriTree to plant 1 million trees to fight climate change

&amp;#x200B;

\-------------------

\[Original Post\]

Cardano has been holding steady over the past week despite a bit of market turbulence (U.S. fed stimulus drawdown, U.S. debt ceiling, SEC regulations, not so Evergrande). Part of that was due to the Alonzo upgrade that enabled smart contracts/decentralized validators.

An even more influential event is just days away, billed as having ""industry defining"" announcements during the [Sept. 25-26 Cardano Summit](https://summit.cardano.org).

There's been a lot already said about smart contracts that will enable dApps and defi to run on the low fee, proof-of-stake blockchain. Many others already have that, so what can we expect from the end of month Cardano Summit that might launch the #3 crypto project into even loftier heights?

**1) A Cardano dApp Store**

Charles Hoskinson, Cardano's founder, has pointed out one of the [key chokepoints](https://forkast.news/video-audio/why-cardanos-charles-hoskinson-says-defi-is-up-for-grabs/) in current dApp development -- a lack of an easy to access portal for users. Expect an announcement about a [Cardano dApp store](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/09/22/bringing-certified-dapps-to-cardano/) that will list projects (bother verified and unverified) akin to Apple's and Google's equivalent. This would transform the largely fragmented crypto space into an easily recognizable, usable interface.

**2) Payment systems**

There are several blockchain payment systems already up and running form point-of-sale machines (anyone remember PundiX?) to credit card adoption that runs on VISA and Mastercard systems, and now PayPal getting into the game. There are also pure play crypto payment solutions including Bitpay and the lightning network for Bitcoin transfers.

Still, with Cardano's focus on Africa, and the largely unbanked population there, an enormous business opportunity exists tot take a first mover advantage across the continent by offering low fee, fast transactions that sidesteps the legacy banking system.

**3) Cross-chain Bridges**

Hoskinson has already said the future will belong to multiple blockchains, not just one. He's indicated interest in Solana (pre-crash), and will be speaking on an [MIT panel](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pppl1e/cardano_algorand_a_winning_combo/) with Algorand's founder at the end of the month. An ERC-20 converter is already planned that will enable dApps to port their functionality with ""wrapped"" token equivalents that could make low Cardano fees an attractive alternative for gas-laden Ethereum dApps.

**4) More government adoption**

The Ethiopia education system ""deal"" didn't garner a whole lotta love, primarily because it was small scale in the grand scheme of commercial adoption. If there is a broader agreement (an election system running on the blockchain, for example) that would be sure to raise eyebrows.

**5) Explosive dApp growth (and probably some NFTs because they're still a thing)**

Other projects are also benefiting from Cardano's relatively new found fame. Below is a snapshot of a  publicly accessible CoinMarketCap [watchlist](https://coinmarketcap.com/watchlist/611fd3bf5f94276918958e97). (if you know of other exchange-listed projects let me know in the comments.)

[Exchange-listed projects connected to Cardano](https://preview.redd.it/zozo73812ap71.jpg?width=1317&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=703375269139550be0eb0349341875a994b3967c)

Of these projects Ergo (financial contracts, DEX) and COTI (fintech platform) have gotten plenty of interest lately with their mid-tier market caps and decent daily volume. Hundreds of other dApps are expected with a greatly expanding ecosystem.

Here are a few that, at time of writing, aren't listed on an exchange yet.

* **Sundaeswap** \- similar to Uniswap and a fully decentralized DEX. Tokens through an Initial Stakepool Offering based on staked ADA.
* **Ardana** \- stable coin minter based on staked ADA. Will run Dana Swap DEX with stable coins based on other currencies.
* **MELD** \- lending/borrowing platform
* **DrukenDragonGames** \- NFT game
* **Empowa** \- decentralized property developer/affordable housing for Africa. Offers future rental income for holders.

stocks,"Another peaceful green day today, when do we see Evergrande finally over?","After Monday‚Äôs decline, every market day has been green. Whilst this is nice to see, I was anticipating a further decline sometime this week.

Firstly, the Fed is holding interest rates steady and (still) is deciding to not taper asset repurchasing programs, which I was expecting some kind of announcement for. 

Secondly, I think a whole bunch of us were expecting Evergrande to default between Tuesday and today, China announced some sort of financial assistance for them at the last minute and they are still standing.

So primarily, my question is how long until Evergrande is actually done? China has effectively kicked the can down the road for us with the financial assistance, but in reality it is like a drop in the bucket with the remaining ~$300bn in debt Evergrande has.

personalfinance,Thoughts on buying a 2nd home. Why or why not?,"Should I buy? Why or why not?

Hi all, 
So my wife and I bought a house back in December 2020 for $420k. We knew this house wasn‚Äôt going to be our forever home but we bought it because we didn‚Äôt want to keep renting and it‚Äôs in a great location in the Palm Springs area. Since we bought it, it‚Äôs gained over $100k in value in 9 months. 

Now, there‚Äôs a new development community being built later this year and we really want to purchase one. Existing homes in this area are going nuts and there‚Äôs bidding wars, as I‚Äôm sure in many parts of the country. There will be tons of new development being built around this community: more new single family homes, condos, expansion of a Cal State University, resorts, and a huge Arena that will host sport games and concerts, etc all within a 10 mile radius of this new development I want to buy. 

The home will cost about $750k (more if we decide to add a pool). 3 bedrooms/ 3 bath + casita. So In total 4 bed /4 bath and 2,600  sq ft home. My plan to is rent out our current home. Rents here are crazy expensive and after speaking with agents, they tell me I can get about $3,300/month on long term lease. My mortgage with PITI is $2,300 so it will more than cover expenses. 

On the new home, we plan to rent out the casita for at least $1,200/month. Im being conservative in the $1,200 because I tested out the market and posted on Nextdoor that I was renting out my casita. I had 4 people contact me and the lowest someone offered me was $1,500 per month. Someone was willing to pay $1,800. It‚Äôs insane - so that‚Äôs why I figured $1,200 is a good starting point. 

Finances
- Combined income: $170k 
- Stable jobs in healthcare 
- We‚Äôre both 25 years old 
- 1 baby 
- We contribute into our 401k and investment accounts 
- no debt 
- Will put 20% down on the home

Our mortgage payment will be about $3800 with an interest rate at 3% (rates are actually lower but being conservative with 3%) jumbo loan and $600k financed. I know this is basically going over our budget and we‚Äôre over leveraged. But considering that we will be renting out the casita for at-least $1,200, this would bring down our payment to at-least $2,600 if not more ($300 more than we‚Äôre already paying). I‚Äôm entertaining this idea because of how low interests are and the appreciation this house will get after build out and the expansion of all the other developments surrounding this house. Yes, the price of the home is crazy high, but the interest rate is insanely low! And property values will only increase in this area and there‚Äôs a bunch of new development happening. Homes near this development are exceeding the $1M price tags and Real Estate agents have told me this is a prime location. Not to mention, new construction homes are being rented out for over $6,000/month short term rentals and there‚Äôs a waitlist (note: they all have pools as that‚Äôs what renters are looking for). Also, if the values does significantly increase after build out, I can sell it and take my profit. Or keep it, take out a HELOC and buy more investment properties. 

I‚Äôve spoken to an investor that has over 25 homes in the Palm Springs area and he gave me his perspective and told me: 
One of two things are going to happen, 1. In 5 years, you‚Äôre going to be extremely happy and grateful you bought this house 5 years ago because it‚Äôs worth $1M plus or 2. You‚Äôre going to purchase it and regret it because it‚Äôs now worth $500k. 
What side do you want to be at? 

Why shouldn‚Äôt I buy this house? What am I missing? What should I consider?",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, Sept 24, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, September 23, 2021**

Stocks extended yesterday‚Äôs remarkable bounce with another great day as investors cheered the Federal Reserve‚Äôs monthly monetary policy decision, which indicated the central bank will likely start tapering the pace of quantitative easing in the ‚Äúcoming meetings‚Äù and telegraphed interest rate hikes six or seven times by the end of 2024. As I have said repeatedly, I remain unconcerned by the tapering of quantitative easing.

Market participants also eyed developments out of China as the Evergrande saga continues to play out. Concerns that the nation‚Äôs second-largest real estate company, which has over $300 billion in debt, will default coming to a head. The company faces $84 million in interest payments to bondholders today, just one of the payments owed in a long string of liabilities coming up that will most likely not be paid. The stock briefly rallied yesterday after agreeing to settle interest payments for an onshore note, though the stock quickly lost the gains as the fate of its offshore debt obligations lies in the balance. 

I will make no comment as to how the situation will affect China‚Äôs economy or its stock, I am in no way an expert on China or its policies. However, on Monday, I saw comparisons being drawn between this situation and the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers that catalyzed the recession and was asked multiple times if I thought this would lead to some sort of global market crash. My answer, of course, was no. Here is what I wrote on Monday with some slight edits for clarity: 

‚ÄúI think those comparisons are not correct for a few reasons, though please note this is just my humble opinion.

1. For starters, it is almost a certainty the CCP will aggressively intervene in the case of a default given Evergrande is designated as an entity of ‚Äúsystemic importance‚Äù in China and President Xi has proven to have no problem wielding a heavy hand when it‚Äôs forced. This is China‚Äôs ‚Äútoo big to fail moment‚Äù and the CCP will likely have to intervene in some way to protect the more than 1.6 million homeowners and bagholders affected
2. As I said above, the relationship between Chinese and US lenders is limited at best and unlike Lehman Brothers, which existed in the balance sheets of financial institutions worldwide. This means any damage caused within China has is likely to be contained within its own economy. Compared to the US, China‚Äôs financial sector remains very insular/regional. 
3. Unlike Lehman Brothers, Evergrande still has tangible assets that will be sold off to help settle financial obligations. While their assets aren‚Äôt great and creditors know the company is in trouble, the sale of physical assets will help some. On the other, Lehman Brothers never had hard assets it could sell off, what they had was literally worthless.

Since the depths of the pandemic, the Fed has been absorbing about $120 billion a month in U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities. Yesterday, Fed officials said that by the end of the year, the economy will have likely hit the ‚Äúsubstantial further progress‚Äù milestone indicated last December needed for the central bank to begin slowing the pace of those purchases.

The Fed signaled, ‚ÄúParticipants generally view that as long as the recovery remains on track, a gradual tapering process that concludes around the middle of next year is likely to be appropriate‚Äù. 

Here is the full transcript: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20210922a1.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20210922a1.pdf)

Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income said,  ""Though markets have been nervously eyeing the start to tapering for months, it is ultimately ""...likely to have minimal market impact at this stage. This is partly because the Fed has done a decent job of telegraphing when tapering is likely to begin (most market participants believe the announcement will come this year),"" Rieder said in a note Wednesday evening.

stocks,Inflationary Depression (Part 1): The Everything Bubble,"The US is showing signs of Inflationary Depressions from the past. I have created a 3 part series that will break it down. Part 1 will break down the current market and how we got here. Part 2 will explain what we should expect and why we are beginning to see the things we are seeing. Part 3 is how to profit off of the things learned in Parts 1 and 2.

***So how did we get here?***

In March of the United States shut down the economic machine by forcing people into their homes to fend off what seemed at the time to be an extremely severe crisis. This immediately put the US into a store of pent-up demand. In order to hold off an economic collapse the Fed and the Federal government (we will look at them as two separate entities here) sent interest rates to zero, immediately initiated Quantitative Easing (the method the Fed uses to buy bonds as used in the ‚Äô08 crisis) while the government began dishing out trillions in stimulus (roughly 3.3 Trillion already paid out, 3.7 trillion obligated and another 1.2 Trillion budgeted).

M2 Supply skyrocketed more than any other time in the past 60 years. From February 2008 to February 2020 M2 increased in historical fashion going from $7.5B to $15.4B which was an increase about in line for previous 12 year periods over the past 30 years (a roughly 6.2% annual increase). From February 2020 to July 2021 M2 has ballooned from $15.4B to $20.5B (a roughly 21% annual increase).

Of course, with easy lending and plenty of cash we began to see debt grow extremely rapidly. Both nationally and among households. Household debt had moved past 2008 levels in Q1 of 2017 and has only been on an upward trajectory since. Although instead of moving into low interest rate housing loans, Americans are taking on more personal loans than ever before. But the US currently isn‚Äôt seeing the true burden of this debt as student loan debt payments (the 2nd highest form of debt and the highest form of personal debt) begin in February of next year. This pause on student debt was another inflationary pressure that will continue until the true debt burdens are taken on (roughly 60 billion in interest each year). We have also seen an increase in auto-loans the second highest personal loan type.

***This wasn‚Äôt the beginning of our story***

In 2008 we had the biggest crash in arguably over 100 years as the whole financial institution had collapsed leading to at least 12 years of negative real interest rates with inflation out pacing the interest rate in all but one year.

As inflation takes off, we are seeing the lowest real interest rates we have seen since 1951. What has this led to? A ballooning of Assets and Debt to GDP (discussed more in the next section). With relaxed lending, QE continuing through 2015 from 2008, this has led to the wealth gap that we see today.

Cryptocurrency obviously has been affected by this, along with meme stocks, and stock prices in general. Corporate Debt has skyrocketed at insane levels across the world: China 150%+ of GDP, Japan 120%+ of GDP, America and Britain around 80% of GDP. Of course, this doesn‚Äôt bode well for the Chinese property market as I am sure from recent news you can guess where all of their Corporate debt is (Chinese Corporations are borrowing more than Japan‚Äôs bubble from the 80s/90s as a % of GDP). Property across the world is sky high.

***What are the direct impacts of all this spending?***

Stocks have boomed over the last decade with Shiller‚Äôs P/E (a good sign of the valuation of the market) beginning to approach the levels of the ‚Äô99 bubble burst (it has already passed black Tuesday). This is due to the increased corporate debt and over stimulation from the Fed. Allowing for assets to skyrocket. Stocks have easily outpaced 15% over the past 5 years as well (S&amp;P 500).

New comers are surging into the market en masse. A classic sign of a bubble (due to a majority of newcomers, not all, being relatively uninformed) with over 15% of current investors starting in 2020 (This was seen in the 1920s, 1990s, and mid 2000s). Also in an inflationary bubble good investments become harder to find as incomes rise and debt increases but more capital goes after these investments (stock bubble).

Inflation is a huge impact being felt by the increase in fiscal stimulus and easy lending. As debt has started to move up, we have seen real household income shrink in 2020 (and expect to see a much greater shrink in 2021) as inflation increases. Shortages have come to dominate our future with commodities skyrocketing in price with input good prices while demand has stayed solid due to a lack of action from the Fed. Housing has begun to feel the intense effects of shortages as well. We are only in the beginning stages and it is starting to be seen on 10-Q's. *SIDE NOTE: THE FED DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ASSET PRICES OR DEBT PRICES. THEY CARE ABOUT INFLATION, GDP GROWTH, AND UNEMPLOYMENT.* The US can begin to lose its reserve currency status if it allows for inflation to continue for too long as it puts downward pressure on the dollar.

Companies from Procter and Gamble, to FedEx, to Tesla are all being impacted by shortages in everything. Walmart even bought inventory in preparation of more shortages in Q4 of this year. Car prices are flying (although they‚Äôve slowed). I think you get the picture. Because of the Feds incompetent ability to assess for large changes in assets and debt that get passed onto consumers they make the fatal flaw of relying too hard on CPI (Consumer Price Index). This has led to the Fed personally fueling these shortages along with other central banks (Historically almost all central banks abuse this flaw). I will discuss inflation and shortages more in a secondary post.

With Covid taking hold, the United States Government income plummeted but their spending skyrocketed. Already having a high Debt to GDP ratio, the ratio has stormed past any other point in United States history.

And don‚Äôt worry the spending doesn‚Äôt seem like it will slow down anytime soon. Our one bright spot is that household debt to GDP has slowed down. In inflationary bubbles growth tends to be spurred by debt and in this case it seems to be the United States government debt. It‚Äôs not just the US with global debt to GDP raising to 365% of GDP. This leads to another sign of an inflationary bubble: GDP growth of over 4%, well above potential... The US just clocked 6.6% annual GDP growth. And although we don't have any data since 2019, I am sure foreign inflows are at all time highs.

In inflationary bubbles, you tend to see imports rise faster than exports causing the current account to worsen. This leads to a devaluation in the currency. The US happens to have the largest negative net export situation in over 70 years.

I think it is safe to say that we are in the middle of an inflationary bubble. Now what?

***So, what should we expect from here?***

In part 2 we will discuss the inflationary depression. Also in part 2 we will discuss the findings in this report and how it relates to what we should expect to see and what is currently being seen. This will discuss bubbles, shortages, inflation, and the impacts of too much fiscal stimulation. In part 3, we will discuss how to make money on the things we expect to see in part 2.",finance

ethereum,Stablecoin Market Trends and Report,"In terms of overall market capitalisation for stablecoins, we have seen high demand and tremendous growth in the space due to the importance of the role played by stablecoins in DeFi. In Q2 2021, $BUSD experienced the largest growth in its market cap. This is likely due to the influx of users to the Binance Smart Chain due to high gas fees and network congestion on the Ethereum platform in Q1 2021. We take a closer look at the top 5 stablecoins by their market capitalisation.

&amp;#x200B;

The top 5 stablecoin by market cap are $USDT, $USDC, $BUSD, $DAI and $UST respectively. The first 3 stablecoins are generally similar in that they are a form of fiat-collateralised stablecoin and have a centralised backing. The latter 2 stablecoins are a form of crypto-collateralised pegged stablecoin and are also considered to be decentralised.

&amp;#x200B;

Tether ($USDT) remains the most adopted stablecoin in circulation. For the case of $USDT, Tether Limited claims to back $1 worth of Tether for every $1 of USD, although there have been some controversies regarding this claim. As of July 2021, Tether executives are under federal investigation. The market cap for $USDT started to flatten in Jun 2021, but nevertheless recorded growth of 54% in Q2 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

USD Coin or $USDC is the 2nd largest stablecoin by market capitalisation. $USDC is governed by Centre, a membership-based consortium that sets technical, policy and financial standards for stablecoins. $USDC is issued by regulated financial institutions, backed by fully reserved assets and is redeemable on a 1:1 basis for US dollars according to Centre. In contrast with the decline in Tether's growth, we see a corresponding increase in $USDC's market capitalisation. $USDC market cap increased by a whopping 133% in Q2 2021, in comparison to Tether's 54%.

&amp;#x200B;

Binance USD (BUSD) is the 3rd largest stablecoin by market capitalisation and is similarly a 1:1 USD-backed stablecoin issued by Binance (in partnership with Paxos), and is approved and regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). $BUSD is used in the Binance Smart Chain and has also seen an uptrend in its market cap.

&amp;#x200B;

$DAI uses an over-collateralised mechanism to maintain a $1 peg of $DAI to USD. Unlike the 3 aforementioned stablecoins, $DAI is a form of crypto-collateralised pegged stablecoin and is decentralised. However, much of what collateralises $DAI involves $USDC. Critics argue this means that $DAI is backed by a centralised entity, making it susceptible to centralisation risks like the 3 stablecoins described above.

&amp;#x200B;

$UST is the stablecoin used within the Terra ecosystem. The $LUNA token in Terra is used to support the $UST stablecoin peg. The market cap of $UST is relatively small compared to the top stablecoins because $UST is not widely used in other blockchains but only has utility within the Terra ecosystems in protocols such as Mirror and Anchor.

&amp;#x200B;

Algorithmic stablecoins are starting to develop this year but overall there are not too many outstanding projects. Stablecoins under the Rebase/Seignorage type models have not really performed in terms of maintaining their peg. Most of them have been priced below the peg price for a long time despite measures of price equalisation such as $ESD, $DSD and $BAC.

&amp;#x200B;

$FRAX, $UST and $sUSD are stablecoins with pretty good performance when it comes to keeping relative stability against the 1 US dollar. However, $AMPL, although dynamic around $1, has a very large fluctuation.

&amp;#x200B;

Stablecoin Supply Ratio

Cryptoquant recorded an ATL for the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR), which measures $BTC market capitalisation relative to the total stablecoin supply to estimate purchasing power in the stablecoin market. Accordingly, when the price of $BTC falls, the amount of stablecoin purchases will increase to push the price of $BTC up and vice versa. But the growth of stablecoin supply in the spring of 2020 and 2021 has kept SSR near historic lows. This shows that demand for $USDT seems to keep pace with the demand for $BTC

&amp;#x200B;

Popular Stablecoins

Stablecoins were born with the noble function of resisting the strong volatility of other cryptos. However, not all efforts have been fruitful.

&amp;#x200B;

Stablecoins are now being used to exchange and pay more frequently than $BTC and $ETH . Velocity measures the rate of average trading volume against the market capitalisation.

&amp;#x200B;

A high velocity means that the cryptocurrency is widely traded within the economy.

&amp;#x200B;

$USDT and $BUSD have the highest speed, ranging from 1.0 to 3.0. Given the dominance of Binance as the top exchange and the rise of its blockchain (BSC), it is no surprise that $BUSD is being most widely used after $USDT.

&amp;#x200B;

According to statistics, Ethereum is still the top blockchain, accounting for more than 70% of stablecoins in the market as of January 2021. Tron, Omni, and Terra are next ‚Äî proving that the stablecoin market is very active and the algo-stablecoin space is growing beyond just $UST.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"What are some good ideas, given my situation...","Hello,

A few months ago, I quit my job as a software developer and I am now in the process of learning how to be a day trader (currently paper trading). I have enough money in my checking account to support me 15 months (roughly takes me to January 2023 if my monthly expenses are on the higher end, longer if I budget better). 

Given that I do not have an income right now, I am obviously hesitant to put my money in an illiquid/volatile investment unless I am positive I can cash out when I need it. I would never keep this much money in my checking account if I was working a 9-5 due to inflation and I'm not buying a car/house/etc anytime soon. I'm confident that I won't need that much time to be able to cover my expenses day trading, but I know 9/10 day traders are not successful, so I am making sure I don't get too comfortable with this cushion by busting my ass paper trading, reviewing my trades and furthering my education like my life depends on it.

My question is, what are some ideas for a liquid investment that it is either a set term or very liquid? What first came to mind was treasury bonds. I know they're low risk, I can set 3/6 months, but the return is only a little better than interest rates at bank. My other thoughts were stock market. I already have some money invested in crypto and a dividend portfolio. Maybe put some in index fund. 

I am open to ideas, mostly serious ones but silly ones are appreciated also. Thank you",finance

personalfinance,Social Security checks and income level question,"My mother receives a social security check, she draws it from my fathers account (who passed away while at work). I do not claim to fully understand how SSI works, but my basic understanding is that she receives a certain amount each month based on how much my father paid into social security before he passed away.

&amp;#x200B;

There also is, apparently, a limit to the amount of income she can earn in any given year. If she earns more than that amount, the SSI check will be lowered to compensate.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year she earned over the limit (I am not sure what it is exactly, but do know that it is not much at all. Our family is not very well off, barely over the poverty line.) and the first few checks she received were drastically lower. This month she was notified that she has to contact the office to update her employment pay scale so that the amount of the checks can be re adjusted. Also, without any warning, her most recent check was about 1/4 of the typical amount.

&amp;#x200B;

She has come to me to ask about her options, I told her that she would either need to get her pay cut or flat out quit her job if she wanted to keep getting these checks at the current level. She asked for a pay cut but the company she works for would not lower her pay (I know, I didn't believe it either!) and they can not cut her hours any because the place is understaffed as it is.

&amp;#x200B;

I am wonder if there are any other options for her to consider, other than getting a different job that pays less, for her to continue getting the amount she has been getting.

\*Edit\* after reading a few of the links that some of you have provided, I realized that I am not 100% certain if her checks are considered ""survivor benefits"" or ""supplemental security income"".

&amp;#x200B;

Would not be surprised if FedToken is issued on several public blockhain(s) instead of their own private ledger.

Why? CBDC issued on public blockchains more readily adopted around the world.

What if said public blockchains goes out of fashion and no longer maintained? Can always be redeem/exchange 1:1 for FedToken on different chain.

&amp;#x200B;

How does this affect BCH? Ironically, the BCH Network via its low fees, instant transactions and on-chain scalabity and thus ability to replace FIAT is therefore also the best platform for CBDC issued FIAT. It will be an unusual love-hate symbiotic relationship. Inflationary currencies running on top of a deflationary asset. Mises carrying Keynes on his shoulder.

&amp;#x200B;

But isn't CBDC bad? What about sound money? In this model sound money is achieved via the deflationary asset the CBDC  is run on. In a SHTF scenario where CBDC is issued to infinity, the people already having access to the underlying deflationary asset can use it as fallback medium of exchange. Think of it this way: If Keynes gets too rowdy Mises can just throw him off.

&amp;#x200B;

So why hasn't Fed issued FedToken on BCH? Currently the only token  system we have is SLP. SLP is simple and fun. Its more appropriate for NFT and other small scale usecases. It doesn't scale to CBDC usage requirements. This is why BCH desperately need a base layer token system that scales. OP\_GROUPS is in the works. I hope it gets through quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

The narrative that BCH would not be allowed to win because its challenging FIAT and therefore is risky investment, must have been true at some point, but falls apart in context to the currency model described above. (i.e. the game has changed)

algorand,An apology post,"Yesterday, in response to various questions in posts about the OPUL launch, I said that the ASA version of the token was loaded and ready on [Gate.io](https://Gate.io). I based this on OPUL's [pre-launch press release](https://opulous.medium.com/opul-token-available-on-exchanges-9b68c85186b0) where they stated that ""Gate.io supports both the Algorand and Ethereum chain. This means that ***you can deposit*** and withdraw OPUL as an ASA and ERC-20 token."" Later, one Redditor disputed this, and after some back and forth and getting more information to be able to research, I snuffed out this [Telegram post](https://t.me/opulousapp/94543) stating that ASAs could not be loaded on Gate because of a technical glitch. This post came out hours after the initial launch. I believe I posted a response to everyone I interacted with regarding the subject.

According to [this Yieldly tweet](https://twitter.com/YieldlyFinance/status/1440915566844264449) the ASAs they distributed seem to amount to 2M of the much larger supply of initial [IDO/pre-launch tokens](https://cryptorank.io/ico/opulous). (Please, somebody correct me if I'm mistaken).

CryptoCurrency,I am open sourcing my letter to our representatives.,"In the interest of spreading awareness and not letting our government (at least in the United States) carelessly regulate crypto assets and do more harm than good in the process, I am making available a letter I wrote. Anybody reading this has my permission to use, alter, send or publish the following letter. I know not everyone here has time to make their thoughts known and educate our ruling class, so I hope this streamlines the work for many of you and allows a high volume of potent rhetoric representing our interests.

&gt; I can only hope my and my fellow citizens' thoughts are actually read in these emails. I think it's worth addressing some of your concerns which are often repeated by folks in Washington from the perspective of someone with competency around the subject. With respect, it is obvious from the perspective of a technically literate non-billionaire that the current rhetoric you and most others in your position have taken on crypto currencies must come largely from an ignorance on how most of them operate.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Whereas traditional currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, are overseen by central banks and regulatory agencies with legal obligations to work for the public interest, cryptocurrencies by design lack centralized oversight.  Historically, gaps in oversight and regulation of the financial system have contributed to financial instability, consumer protection problems, and increased criminal activity.""
&gt; 
&gt; The first mistake here is to take literally the term ""crypto currency."" While catchy and alliterative, that does not mean you as 'the government' now have ten thousand potential unregulated overthrowers of our national currency. How people should be referring to these technologies by default is with the term ""crypto assets."" I believe if you begin your journey of understanding with this fundamental (and accurate) shift in perspective much of the panic will seem misplaced. The reason these technologies are more like assets rather than currencies is precisely because they are not centrally controlled, and therefore cannot be altered from the top down in swift response to events in the kinetic world like The Federal Reserve is known to do. Crypto Assets are far more stable in their parameters - despite the common monicour of ""currencies,"" these assets if they are to be considered ""decentralized"" (the primal qualification of legitimacy in the space, meaning their function is crystal clear and a change in its function is difficult, slow, and predictable) then by definition they will be unable to fulfill the fluid requirements of a national currency and therefore do not attempt to, or are a threat to the United States Dollar.
&gt; 
&gt; While that reasoning applies to all crypto assets, it's worth noting that many of these assets stray even further from the idea of a currency - meaning their value does not come from being an effective means of exchange, it actually comes from that crypto asset's ability to perform a useful function. When you hear about ""Ethereum,"" or more broadly ""smart contracts"" what is really being discussed most of the time are tokens that can be redeemed for smart contract operations which perform a service. Currently the big one I'm sure you've heard of is ""DeFi"" (decentralized finance), but as the technology improves these contracts will be able to interact with data from traditional markets and businesses in a decentralized manner. As a huge enthusiast I could go on, but the point is that tokens redeemable for these use cases are not, nor do they pose as ""currencies"" in the sense of your concern. These tokens are instead a digital analogue of material goods.
&gt; 
&gt; Another concern anybody with an understanding of crypto-technologies and crypto-assets has when reading your generic response is the moral panic around a lack of centralized oversight. Perhaps if in your perception crypto assets are attempting to be and pose a threat to a national currency then this makes sense, but as laid out above this view is not justified. Taking the most basic example: Bitcoin, and comparing it to gold - gold has no central oversight, really. The financial sector cannot control the supply of gold, nor is it in the interest of a free market society to control the sale of such a basic, fundamental asset. Since Bitcoin does not, and cannot, serve the interest of a select few (it cannot even serve the interest of its largest holders), concern about consumer protection from lack of oversight is, as are many concerns from Washington on crypto assets, misplaced. The Bitcoin protocol is laid out clearly (please research the significance of ""open source"" in regards to technology before even considering forming any regulations ((as a famous podcaster once said: ""If you can't code a ""Hello World"" program, you should not be allowed to rule in a modern society))); this clear dictation of Bitcoin's rules of operations in its code are extremely difficult and slow to alter - there is always a huge warning to make even the most minute of changes.
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin is impossible to change in the following ways:

&gt; 1. In a way that is not in the interest of most of its holders, whether those holders hold very little or a huge amount.

&gt; 2. In a way that is unexpected or abrupt.

&gt; 3. In a way dictated by a set of technologically gifted but malicious actors.

&gt; And it is extremely unlikely that:

&gt; 1. Bitcoin will ever change its protocol in any significant way from what it is now.

&gt; 
&gt; With these things in mind consumer protections and additional regulations (it's already taxed just like property and gold are taxed) is the governmental equivalent of helicopter parenting. A protocol which is as predictable and slow to change as Bitcoin serves no deed of tricking those who interact with it.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course the more logical concern now is the myriad of other crypto assets which are not Bitcoin. Most of these good features of Bitcoin apply to most of the other crypto assets - a select few only present the veneer of true decentralization as a faux selling point. These faux crypto assets are not crypto at all - if the ability to alter these coins or tokens exists for the interest of the select few they are by definition not a crypto technology. If the government fails to make this distinction then they will be making the same error in perception as all the people tricked by these faux crypto assets, and be firing a shotgun to kill a tick on a horse - if you regulate based on the fear of a few bad eggs, and do not do so predicated on an intricate understanding of the underlying technology, the amount of damage you will be doing will be murky to you, but crystal clear to people like me who understand this technology, and the younger generation who probably became technologically superior to yours before they graduated highschool.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope it's clear that your generic email was an insult to the intelligence of those who know the basics of crypto technology, and that any mis-steps in setting regulation will not soon be forgotten by interested voters in the coming elections. At least Ted Cruz takes a quizative view of that which he does not understand when it comes to crypto assets - I would hope the politicians representing our best open minded and forward thinking citizens would be careful not to end up as effective luddites.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,A Look Into The Future,"Alright y'all I know this is VERY far fetched but this thought/idea recently came into my head and I'm curious what others think.

There has been a fair amount of oppression at the federal level towards crypto in the US (yes I know there is adoption at a smaller scale within specific states and senators). 

Crypto will succeed at a global level because it doesn't need one country to keep moving forward, but what happens within the US if it keeps getting dismissed at the federal level?

Over a LONG (talking 100+ years) period of time could you see it falling behind the times, failing to adapt, and regressing away from a ""first world country""?

I think this is an extreme but a thought provoking idea nonetheless. 

Thoughts?",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,What can the international Crypto community do to fight the SEC etc?,"I know that I am not the only one that is annoyed and want to help out the Americans deal with these organisations that have a vendetta against us. 

I feel powerless seeing this blatant theft of freedom pass through the chain for approval in the American government. We should work together where possible to resist any form of law, bill or ‚Äúregulation‚Äù that aims to halt adoption. 

Also, Coinbase has just been pressured to stop it‚Äôs Crypto Lending program by the SEC. This would‚Äôve allowed citizens to earn an above inflation return on their hard earned cash instead of the 0.00 interest rate scams that has been plaguing us. 

Any ideas are welcome.",cryptocurrency

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. Apparently RuntimeVerification is now in the Cardano audit business! This is awesome to see! We‚Äô‚Äôll take some NASA mission-critical level auditing for our ecosystem‚Äôs projects. [https://twitter.com/SundaeSwap/status/1441077920215310343](https://twitter.com/SundaeSwap/status/1441077920215310343)

3. dcSpark‚Äôs new open source project Fracada will allow you to fractionalize NFTs. [https://twitter.com/dcspark\_io/status/1441043274911866880](https://twitter.com/dcspark_io/status/1441043274911866880)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Anticipation for Cardano smart contracts keeps growing stronger as more and more ETH users are publicly venting frustration over fees and throwing their support behind Cardano. [https://twitter.com/RandCorp\_/status/1427473742742052865](https://twitter.com/RandCorp_/status/1427473742742052865)

4. In larger nation-state crypto adoption news (an area that is very relevant to Cardano), it looks like the Salvadorean Finance Minister is now saying that Bitcoin acceptance by merchants in El Salvador will actually be optional despite the language in the law. [https://www.coindesk.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-not-mandatory-businesses](https://www.coindesk.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-not-mandatory-businesses)
5. Various rankings websites are called out for what seems to be an unbelievable number of errors that imply an anti-Cardano bias. [https://twitter.com/TheADAApe/status/1428312666569904129](https://twitter.com/TheADAApe/status/1428312666569904129)
6. Coinbase is going to invest $500M into crypto and 10% of all profit going forward (probably increasing with time) according to Brian Armstrong. Since Cardano is listed on Coinbase and it‚Äôs a good guess they will invest in the coins they list, this is probably very relevant for Cardano. [https://twitter.com/brian\_armstrong/status/1428489591665856512](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1428489591665856512)

15. If Web 3 will really be a building of new economies out of online communities and the units of value of those economies will be tokens and NFTs, it seems like a blockchain like Cardano that can generate those assets natively without smart contracts is going to be a central player. [https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1429585831899983876](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1429585831899983876)

29. Cardano competitor Ethereum suffered a consensus bug today (Aug 27) that impacted 54% of nodes.

personalfinance,High interest rate for grad school but high credit score. Confused as to why?,"I just applied for a loan for the first time in my life for grad school through Sallie Mae for about ~90k, but it came out to variable rate of 8.5% and fixed rate of 10%. 

I am so confused as to why I am getting such high rates. My credit score is 750+, I have always paid my bills on time etc., no dings on that aspect. Does the fact that I have never taken out a loan until now really causing these high rates?

The only other thing I could think of was this month I used my credit card to pre-pay part of my yearly rent so paid $12k on a $19k credit limit card. My card closed the statement with it on the 20th, but I paid in full on the 23rd so it is not late - just showing high credit utilization. I know this affected my credit score, but enough for a 8.5 % interest rate?? I was expecting 3 - 4%. 

Also I am in the middle of grad school so I don‚Äôt have income, except for my summer internship. I paid first year tuition and living expenses with my savings.

Anyone familiar with the loan application process can help me understand this? What can I do to bring my rates down? Is this normal rates for first time loan?

UPDATE: It was my credit card utilization. After it went down my rates went down.",finance

personalfinance,Federal Solar Investment Tax Credit - Can I claim it if I'm renting the house I'm installing solar panels on?,"**UPDATE:** Thanks everyone, looks like waiting is my best bet.

Long story short, I'm currently renting a house from a family member that I will be purchasing from them in February 2022.

I have permission from them to install solar panels on the house.

If I get solar panels installed (financed, which still qualifies for the ITC credit) in 2021, would I be able to claim the Federal Solar ITC on my taxes even though I am not the homeowner?

If I get them installed in January 2022, would I be able to claim them on my 2022 taxes since I will be the homeowner *that year*, but not the homeowner at time of installation?

Or do I need to wait until after February 2022, when I have purchased the house and it is in my name, to install the solar panels in order to claim the ITC on my 2022 taxes?

[Energy.gov](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/homeowners-guide-federal-tax-credit-solar-photovoltaics) states the following:

&gt; Can I claim the credit, assuming I meet all requirements, if:
&gt; I am not a homeowner?

&gt; Yes. You do not necessarily have to be a homeowner to claim the tax credit. A tenant-stockholder at a cooperative housing corporation and members of condominiums are still eligible for the tax credit if they contribute to the costs of an eligible solar PV system. In this case, the amount you spend contributing to the cost of the solar PV system would be the amount you would use to calculate your tax credit. **However, you cannot claim a tax credit if you are a renter and your landlord installs a solar system, since you must be an owner of the system to claim the tax credit.**

That last part seems to indicate that the owner of the *system*, not necessarily the owner of the home its installed on, can claim the credit. Is my understanding correct?",finance
stocks,U.S. stock-index futures slide early Friday,"U.S. stock-index futures were pointing to losses on Friday, on the heels of two strong sessions, as bond yields continued to rise in the wake of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs policy statement on Wednesday.

**What‚Äôs driving the market?**

Equity benchmarks have enjoyed two strong days of gains following the Federal Reserve‚Äôs policy meeting on Wednesday, as investors welcomed a delay to the start of the tapering of the central bank‚Äôs bond purchases and ignored the projected rise in interest rates in 2022. ‚ÄúSomething has clearly changed and positioning on rates is shifting. U.S. 10yr yields jumped to 1.44%, posting their biggest one-day gain since March, whilst 30 year bond yields jumped the most in a single day since March 2020,‚Äù said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com. Thursday also saw several global central banks meet, with interest rate hikes out of Norway and Turkey. ‚ÄúAlthough the Fed and \[Bank of England\] remain fairly cautious and the dogma of transitory inflation persists, they‚Äôre starting to move beyond pandemic-era emergency mode. Investors see this and are moving too ‚Äî rates steepening again as they did earlier this year,‚Äù said Wilson.

Major US. stock indexes were holding on to slim weekly gains, in a week that began with sharp losses linked to fears over global contagion from troubles surrounding property group China Evergrande. As of Thursday, bondholders still hadn‚Äôt received any money from China Evergrande 3333, -11.61%, which was due to make a $83.5 million interest payment on dollar bonds, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources.

The company has a 30-day grace period to make a payment, but barring that, Evergrande could trigger a default. Those shares fell 12% in Hong Kong on Friday. Elsewhere, media reports said Friday that the company‚Äôs electric-vehicle unit hadn‚Äôt paid suppliers in months, with employees also receiving no salary for September.

Can you get discounts if you pay it all in a lump sum? I know sometimes like hospitals will lower the bill if you pay it all at once.

Is it worth taking out a lower interest personal loan to pay off the student loan?

The $75,000 consists of a \~$55,000 private loan and $20,000 federal loan. I am currently 24 years old, and I make $72,000/year. I have $8,000 in my savings account, $2,500 in crypto, and $13,000 in my mutual fund investments. The $20,000 federal student loan is currently on deferment¬†until March 2022. My question is should I wait until right before the deferment ends, take out my savings and mutual fund investments¬†to just pay it off - or should I just do this now? My thought process is that there is no cost to hold onto my federal loan, so I could earn some investment income to lessen to upfront charge. I pay $1,000 a month in private loans and my payment for federal is $288. On top of my private loan monthly amount, I am paying $1,000/month into my $20,000 federal student loan. Should I just pay it all upfront now or wait right before the deferment ends so I can earn some more income. I am somewhat emotionally attached to the mutual fund portfolio I have built up from $3,000. lol. Thank you!

CryptoCurrency,"Ok, we've established we don't like, China, banks and the SEC. What else don't we like?","So, China today announced for the 458th time that they're outright banning the use of crypto within the country - fair enough, I think they've got their point across.

Banks, well, I think it's obvious why they're bound to rub crypto advocates the wrong way - limiting access to and use of their customers' funds arbitrarily, condemning crypto for doing what they've been doing for 100 years and to a much greater degree; charging excessive fees, laughable interest rates and, by christ, it's difficult to find a decent parking spot close by.

The SEC...hmmm...give me a sec...oh, yeah! They help the banks and maintain the status quo - would probably advocate for feudalism if their overlords requested it of them.

personalfinance,Personal finance questions from an immigrant who moved recently to USA.,"Quick intro - 

1. Citizenship - Indian-origin US citizen; lived in India most of my life, recently moved back to the US.
2. Age - 21.
3. Annual income - $150k including salary, joining bonuses and RSUs.
4. Income tax - Only federal, no state income tax.
5. 401(k) - Employer matches 2% for 4% that I put in. Have chosen the Vanguard 2065 Target Date Fund through Fidelity.
6. Non-401(k) investments - Investing additional salary (might be around 6-7k per month; not sure exactly how much as I just moved to the US) into a 3/4 Fund Portfolio of VTI, VXUS and BND ETFs (or Mutual Fund equivalent) through Fidelity.
7. I am not very sure if I would like to continue to stay in the US after a couple of years. Might move back to India either 5/10/20 years down the line, may not as well (giving it a 50-50 chance of either scenario).

I have currently elected to contribute the 4% of my salary into the 401(k) account, just to get the employer match. I am not sure whether or not to contribute more into the 401(k) account or invest the money (after tax) that I receive as a salary into the 3/4 fund portfolio.

Pros of contributing more to 401(k) -

* Tax slab I will fall into when I retire and make no money will be much lower than now, so will save more in taxes later the more I contribute now.

Pros of investing the money by myself -

* The investment is more liquid and can be transferred to India if I choose to move.
* The investment can be liquidated to fund down-payment for a home within the US which can be used to generate a US-income even after I move to India.
* My income is only going to increase (expect it to double in 6-7 years time based on industry data). I can always invest the maximum amount (19.5k) later once I have decided whether or not to stay in the US.
* If I do retire in the US, though the tax slab I will fall into will be lower, I might not retire in a state that has 0 income tax (as someone in tech, California is always going to be the state one would aspire to move to. Since I am currently living in a state with no income tax, I can leverage that and accumulate more income right now.

For a lot of people the question is whether to invest in a 401(k) for their savings or not save/invest any money at all. But it is not that way for me, I understand that I am privileged and I am thankful for that. The question for me is whether I invest my money in a 401(k) or I invest it in a brokerage account in the 3/4 fund portfolio.

Since I am a person of Indian origin, I am also allowed to open an expat savings account with Indian banks / Indian brokerage accounts (I already have $20k saved up from since I was young there, all in the Indian stock markets). Since India is still a developing country, the rate-of-interest given in their savings accounts are much higher than in the US, at around 4.5-5% per year. I know that these aren't very great numbers as compared to SPY's growth rates per year, but its another option at hand.

India also has an expat account that allows me to pay no income taxes in India and pay only the ones in the US. I am confident in the Indian economy and stock market and would like to continue pumping my money into this account in case I decide to settle in the US.

Some questions that I have -

1. Would you recommend the 401(k) account or my individual account given my scenario for investing the additional money up-to 19.5k?
2. For someone who might liquidate some of their investments, what would you recommend the between ETFs and Mutual Funds that serve the same purpose (3/4 fund portfolio)?
3. In case I decide I also want to invest into individual stocks alongside my 3/4 fund portfolio, how would I go about it? How much percent of allocation should they be given?
4. What are your thoughts on investing in the Indian economy and stock-market as someone who already has 20k in it and is confident in it?
5. How should I modify the 3/4 fund portfolio to accommodate such an investment idea (please answer in % of allocation in 
   1. VTI,
   2. US individual stocks,
   3. VXUS,
   4. BND,
   5. Indian individual stocks,
   6. Indian ETFs,
   7. Indian Savings Account with 5% savings rate,
   8. Gold (well, I am of Indian origin after-all).
6. What should be my HSA and FSA annual/monthly contributions? I got myself (including vision and dental) checked in India before moving to the US and everything is normal. Should I also get a personal health insurance apart from the one my employer provides?
7. Any other suggestions for someone new into the system and in my situation?",finance
cybersecurity,Feasability of bare-metal vs AV sandbox behavior comparison for detecting evasion?,"An interesting malware detection method recently crossed my radar for detecting evasive behavior - critical capability, if proven fundamentally reliable. I saw it as a result in virus total, reporting a program behaves differently inside and outside of an emulator.

If the vendor reporting this actually tests on bare-metal, this would probably be accomplished by running a program in three identical environments:

- one malware detection VM
- one malware detection emulator
- one bare metal

If it runs different in a bare metal environment than within a VM or emulator, we can probably flag that as evasive program. There will be edge case false positives, but not many.

The first challenge that comes to mind is making sure the comparison is fair, but the platform is diverse: The hardware should attempt to spoof itself to appear:

1. Non-uniform in terms of hardware specs. If I buy a cluster of 20 [Rock Pi X](https://wiki.radxa.com/RockpiX)s (if only they were in-stock), the attacker can pretty safely perform evasion in that specific hardware if I can't effectively spoof signs of it. We could buy lots of random hardware to bypass this problem, but that sounds like a nightmare to administrate as a cluster for the analysis.

2. Identical in terms of OS environment. Obviously we need our environments to be as similar as possible if we want our comparisons to be fair and accurate.

There are some glaring issues I see as I probe this idea deeper. Emulators or specialized VMs must trick a program into believing a certain date or time has passed, since one of the first evasive behavior devised by attackers was to delay malicious behavior to make the AV give it the all clear, since it can't sandbox the program for however many weeks or months it might wait.

To go off the rails, even this seems weak at best, since a program could just start with a random value known to the C2 server, start computing a hash, and hash of the hash, enough iterations to take the necessary time before it reaches its condition (the solution of the Nth hash iteration) before executing bad stuff or even before calling out to recieve the bad code in the first place. An emulator or VM can't spoof a date to trick this....

To get back on the rails: hardware can't be spoofed against an attacker with kernel mode privilege escallation. A rare attacker perhaps, but worth considering. That said, never let perfect get in the way of better.

This morning I was pretty excited by this whole idea of bare-metal comparison to defeat emulator evasion, but now I'm back to thinking emulator and VM behavior analysis is as susceptible to evasion as it was [demonstrated to be in 2016](https://youtu.be/a6yOwvFds78).",technology
personalfinance,Why are mortgage fixed rates cheaper than trackers? (UK),"So looking to switch my current mortgage and trackers are showing more expensive than fixed rates?  Does anyone know why that is?  Normally you pay a premium to fix your rate, especially with interest rates so low there is an expectation they can only go up.

However currently the best fixed rates generally beat a tracker by \~0.5% (with a few exceptions only)?  Does anyone know why that is?

My only conclusion would be banks think interest rates will go down, however with a current rate (UK) of 0.1% this means banks would expect them to go negative?

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, September 24, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, September 24, 2021**

Despite opening the day in the red, the three major modestly extended gains after the best day since July. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) rose 0.16%, the Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 0.09%, and the Dow Jones (DIA) rose 0.09%. Despite all the volatility this week and the risks that are present, the SPY remarkably managed to close the week 2.13% higher after one of its worst weeks all year. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell a modest 0.48% today but closed the week out 2.66% higher. Honestly, I‚Äôm pretty surprised how well the market held up this week despite all the news. Next week will be interesting.

There‚Äôs a lot to unpack today. Two big news out of China today. First is the ongoing Evergrande situation which has been discussed in previous recaps. The company did not make its $83.5 million interest payment owed to bondholders and Chinese authorities have instructed the local government to prepare for the potential downfall if Evergrande fails. We‚Äôll see what happens,.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell played down concerns of a contagion spreading to the US, saying ‚ÄúThe Evergrande situation seems very particular to China, which has very high debt for an emerging economy‚Äù. He also added, ‚ÄúIn terms of the implications for us, there's not a lot of direct United States exposure. The big Chinese banks are not tremendously exposed, but you would worry it would affect global financial conditions through global confidence channels and that kind of thing. But I wouldn't draw a parallel to the United States corporate sector.""

In other news, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the country‚Äôs central bank, announced it was banning the transaction and mining of ‚Ä¶ sending prices of those assets falling. Here is the link to the announcement by the PBOC. Google translate worked for me.

In other news, the US government is close to reaching its ‚Äúdebt limit‚Äù if Congress doesn‚Äôt finally agree to either raise or temporarily suspend it. Unfortunately, something that is fairly routine (the debt ceiling has been raised 80 times 1960 and three times under President Trump, with the latest suspension in 2019) has become a headline with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stating that he would oppose raising the debt ceiling. Put simply, if Congress doesn‚Äôt get their act together it would be catastrophic for the US economy. Despite their refusal, Republicans agree that a default must be avoided. On Wednesday, McConnell said, ‚ÄúAmerica must never default -- we never have and we never will‚Äù, as he then voiced his opposition to a bipartisan increase.

Here is a very informative article by the Associated Press: [https://apnews.com/article/debt-limit-explained-8c9cbcd3d0c4a8fe989a0110f5159f7c](https://apnews.com/article/debt-limit-explained-8c9cbcd3d0c4a8fe989a0110f5159f7c)

Earlier in the week, Fed officials said that by the end of the year, the economy will have likely hit the ‚Äúsubstantial further progress‚Äù milestone indicated last December needed for the central bank to begin slowing the pace of those purchases.

The Fed signaled in their September monthly monetary policy meeting, ‚ÄúParticipants generally view that as long as the recovery remains on track, a gradual tapering process that concludes around the middle of next year is likely to be appropriate‚Äù.

Here is the full transcript: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20210922a1.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20210922a1.pdf)

Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income said,  ""Though markets have been nervously eyeing the start to tapering for months, it is ultimately ""...likely to have minimal market impact at this stage. This is partly because the Fed has done a decent job of telegraphing when tapering is likely to begin (most market participants believe the announcement will come this year). But more importantly it‚Äôs because the asset purchase reductions are likely to be trivial when seen in the context of how large the fixed income markets are today, and how overwhelming the demand for income has become.""

personalfinance,Should I rent out or should I sell?,"Hello all,

I own a condo in an area that is increasing in value. I have lived there for some time and took advantage of refinancing to a 2.4% 15year on a 150k loan. My monthly payments with condo fee is $1700. At the moment, if I was to rent the property out, I could expect $1500-$1600. 

Should I rent it out and eat the $100-$200 monthly loss in favor of paying off the home soon and having a great monthly payment that is 2/3 principal, 1/3 interest?

Should I rent it out and refinance to a 30 year where monthly payments plus condo fee would be about $1000? With this option, I would bank $500-$600 but the interest rate would be higher and take longer to pay off.

Or should I sell it, bank the equity, and put it towards another property?

Thank you for your thoughts",finance
personalfinance,Investing or Mortgage?,"My wife and I have a decent amount of money sitting in our bank that we don't want sitting there anymore, about 15k. We were thinking of using this money in one of two ways: adding to our current investments or using it on our mortgage principal.

Some background, a year and a half ago we bought our first home with a 240k loan for 30years with a fairly good interest rate. Our investments we just add a monthly sum and let it be.

We are kind of on the fence and would like some input.",finance
personalfinance,Buying a rental property at age 46 as a mid level programmer (USA),"Currently, I live in San Francisco Bay Area, 45m. I am a mid level programmer. I own a single family home, which I bought 2016 for 930k. 5 years later, after remodeling and refinancing, I have about 390k in cash, and the house is valued at 1.75M and 960k loan outstanding.


I am definitely a under achiever in my career, at age 45 still not in a management position. And I worked for a public company, recently the stock price went from 60ish to 10ish. The senior management already announced there will be staff reduction coming soon. And I feel the job market in SF bay is hard and easy at the same time. My only income is my salary. My salary currently comes at 160k/y, not counting the stocks and options, which currently sits close to few thousand dollars.


My partner, 40f, working at a private company, making about 75k/y, with about 250k in savings. Now my partner wanted us to buy a rental property nearby together, she specifically asked for single family home. I personally feel it is a very big risk for me, the main reason is that my job security. In my current situation, even when I am fired, I think I can still service the loan by finding jobs not paying as high as I currently earn and with investment income from the cash I have. I am willing to work on jobs, such as delivery driver, or waiting tables, which I did when I was in school. 


I bought my house because it is cheaper than renting, and also I can get tax break on mortgage interest and state property tax. And with luck, my fix-upper turns to be good investment. But buying rental place is different story, with my current situation, do you think I should buy the rental or not? do you think whether I can afford the rental priced at 1M, with estimated 3.5k max rent per month? Will buying the property make my financial health better?


She insisted buying rental is far better than long term stock investment. I feel the housing price has been far disconnected from salaries of regular people. After 2008, the interest rate has been low, and hourly wages has not been increasing, and with the boost of pandemic stimulus, the housing price has already soared, How sustainable would this be ? and what kind of economy outlook will make the buying a no-brainier?",finance

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 27th, 2021.

# **Stocks face another turbulent week as the third quarter winds down - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/24/stocks-face-another-turbulent-week-as-the-third-quarter-winds-down.html)**
*****
&gt; After recent turbulence, markets are likely to close out the final week of the third quarter with another bout of volatility.
*****
&gt; Stocks posted big moves in the past week. First, fears of financial contagion coming from Chinese developer Evergrande sent stocks skidding Monday. Those losses were reversed by Thursday, when the market ripped higher. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were positive for the week, while the Nasdaq was flat.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think this market turmoil has yet to conclude,‚Äù CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall said. ‚ÄúCertainly September is doing what it normally does. It frustrates investors.‚Äù
*****
&gt; The three major stock indexes are also higher for the third quarter.
*****
&gt; Strategists say how the market trades in the coming week may be the most important development, after the wild swings in stocks and also the rapid rise in Treasury yields late in the week. The 10-year rate had shot up to 1.46% by Friday after trading at about 1.31% on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; https://i.imgur.com/cw3qZgY.png
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down about 1.5% for September.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe are getting long in the tooth. The technical indicators are pointing to distribution. We‚Äôre seeing prices roll over, breadth roll over. You‚Äôre seeing sentiment roll over,‚Äù Stovall said, noting the market‚Äôs breadth needs to improve, and many stocks are trading below their 200-day moving average.
*****
&gt; # October is a ‚Äòseismic‚Äô month
‚ÄúI think October will be true to itself, which is a very volatile month. October‚Äôs volatility is 36% higher than the average of the other 11 months of the year,‚Äù Stovall added. ‚ÄúVolatility is higher and you have a greater number of pullbacks, corrections and bear markets that either start or end in the month. It is a seismic month.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Wealth management firm Wellington Shields warns that the fact many stocks have fallen below their 200-day moving average is a negative for the market. Just 59% of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange remain above it, or in an uptrend, according to the firm. The 200-day moving average is the average of the last 200 closing prices of a stock or index, and it‚Äôs viewed as a momentum indicator.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe rule is that when this 200-day number drops from above 80% to below 60%, it usually goes below 30%. Forgetting that, the real point is that while most stocks may be advancing, barely more than half are advancing enough to be in uptrends. With the market just a few percent below its highs, this is a concern,‚Äù Wellington said in a note.
*****
&gt; # What to watch
In the coming week, there are a few key economic reports including including durable goods Monday and ISM manufacturing Friday. There is also personal consumption expenditure data Friday, which the Federal Reserve monitors for its inflation index.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve will remain a big focus in the week ahead. There will be a host of Fed speakers, including Chairman Jerome Powell, who testifies twice before Congress on the pandemic and the policy response to it. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will join him for the hearings Tuesday and Thursday. Powell also appears on a European Central Bank panel with other central bank leaders Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Investors will also be watching Congress in the week ahead, as lawmakers attempts to pass a funding plan in time to avert a government shutdown Oct. 1. The debt ceiling is expected to be part of that debate, but strategists do not expect it to be resolved at the same time. They say this could hang over the markets for several weeks before Congress raises the debt ceiling.
*****
&gt; Fed speakers are not expected to provide any new information, but they could fine tune their message after the central bank signaled this past Wednesday that it expects to begin paring down its $120 billion in in monthly bond purchases soon. The Fed also released a new forecast for interest rates, which revealed that half of the 18 Fed officials expect to raise interest rates next year.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think what the Fed‚Äôs achieved so far is a taper without a tantrum,‚Äù Bannockburn Global Forex chief market strategist Marc Chandler said.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think a lot of people who invest in the market have a sense they are skating on thin ice, and any crack could be a big one. ... People are highly sensitive and nervous because they know valuations are stretched,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat means we should expect these episodic jumps in volatility.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Chandler said the market will need to digest the recent moves, particularly the move higher in Treasury yields.
*****
&gt; https://i.imgur.com/04o6okR.png
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôve got to wait for now is finding this new equilibrium. What kind of market should we expect? Trending? Or do we try to find a range?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think we find a range. We need some hurdles to pass.‚Äù Chandler added that one hurdle is the September jobs report on Oct. 8.
*****
&gt; The Fed is expected to taper its $120 billion monthly bond purchases unless there is shockingly weak employment data. ‚ÄúThat is the only thing that stands in the way of Fed tapering,‚Äù Chandler said.
*****
&gt; Wells Fargo‚Äôs Michael Schumacher said the quarter end could be quiet in terms of big funds rebalancing. ‚ÄúThe equity market bounced around. It‚Äôs up on the quarter. That wasn‚Äôt much when you compare it to the bond performance,‚Äù he said.
*****
&gt; The 10-year yield made an unusually volatile round trip move in the third quarter. It was 1.47% on June 30, and it was as high as 1.46% on Friday. In between, it dipped to 1.12% in early August. Schumacher said the bond market could be quieter ahead of the quarter end, and the 10-year yield could then resume its move higher.
*****
&gt; Some strategists watch the 10-year Treasury yield as a leading indicator for stocks. It is also linked to moves in technology and other high-growth stocks.
*****
&gt;  # What‚Äôs next
Fairlead Strategies founder Katie Stockton said high growth and tech are susceptible now to moves in the 10-year Treasury yield. She said the technology sector is the most overbought in relative terms, when comparing the sector to the S&amp;P 500. The S&amp;P 500 tech sector was up nearly 1% for the week, and it was up nearly 6% for the quarter.
*****
&gt; ""We would consider reducing exposure to growthy ETFs like ARKK and would be respectful of any breakdowns,‚Äù Stockton said.
*****
&gt; Investors have been fixated on the S&amp;P 500‚Ä≤s 50-day moving average, which sat at 4,439 on Friday. For the first time this year, the index broke below and closed under the average for multiple sessions this past week. By Thursday, it regained the 50-day and finished above it. The broad-market index closed above the 50-day moving average on Friday, at 4,455.
*****
&gt; The 50-day is literally the average of the last 50 closing prices, and it is viewed as an important momentum indicator, just as the 200-day moving average is. A break above could signal a positive move, and a break below it could mean more downside.
*****
&gt; Stockton said the relief rally in the S&amp;P 500 could resume in the coming week. ‚ÄúBut we think it will fade by the end of the week given the downturns in our intermediate-term indicators. We expect the SPX to make a lower high,‚Äù she wrote in a note.
*****
&gt; She expects the 10-year Treasury yield could continue higher. ‚ÄúMomentum appears to be shifting to the upside and next resistance is near 1.53%. The breakout should benefit the financial sector, which saw significant outperformance [Thursday],‚Äù Stockton noted.

&gt; # September Seasonality Update

&gt; Well. Seasonality is back. Everyone in the financial media has been talking about September seasonal weakness lately. And here we are in September and the market has sold off the 5% or so we projected last month. And it did so in the notoriously treacherous week after September quarterly options and futures expiration.

&gt; Then as expected traders and fund managers bought the 5% dip as they have throughout this bull market rally with the blessing of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs continuing dovish tone and accommodative policy that they reinforced at the conclusion of yesterday‚Äôs FOMC meeting.

&gt; We do not expect stocks to succumb to the October curse this year. That doesn‚Äôt rule out some downside disturbance, but we do not foresee an impending crash, massacre or big selloff of the sort that have given October it‚Äôs dubious reputation as the jinx month.

&gt; Many of the same geopolitical, political, fundamental and technical headwinds we highlighted last month remain, as well as some others, so another 5% or so pullback is quite likely as Wall Street still may suffer from chronic ‚ÄúOctoberphobia.‚Äù

&gt; We‚Äôve been doing this for decades and this pullback was prototypical end of Q3 window dressing and institutional selling. Several factors weighed on the markets, but most had been there all year. So why did the market selling off this month? Seasonality.

&gt; # Individual Investor Sentiment Bounces Back

&gt; Last week saw a massive decline in optimism according to the AAII's weekly investor sentiment survey. In fact, bullish sentiment saw its largest one-week decline in over two years. Even though the S&amp;P 500 has technically declined more in the week leading up to this week's survey than last week's, sentiment actually improved with the percentage of respondents reporting as bullish rising from 22.4% to 29.9%. That was the biggest one-week increase since the first week of July, but the percentage of bullish respondents is still well below the past year's range.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/092321-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; Even though there was a big pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment was only little changed. This reading only fell 0.1 percentage points to 39.3%. That remains at a level above anything observed since last fall.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/092321-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; That means that mostly all of the gains to bullish sentiment this week borrowed heavily from the neutral camp. Neutral sentiment fell sharply this week shedding 7.4 percentage points. That was the biggest one-week decline since a 7.5 percentage point drop in the first week of August.

&gt; We'd also note that while last week saw a big shift in sentiment among individual investors, this week, newsletter writers followed suit as bullish sentiment among that group fell below 50% to 47.1% for the lowest reading since May. Bearish sentiment meanwhile rose to 22.3% which is the highest reading since October 7th of last year.

personalfinance,I'm 19 and I'm trying to get my first car loan!!! Help,"Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

I am I'm a little older than what I would like to be but whatever lol. For starters, I have good credit going on very good credit ( currently a 726 and, probably will be 735 by next month ). I've been working as a vet tech for going on a year next month and I'm in 0 debt. I've been saving up for months for my car, I have my driver's lience, and I'm going to start reaching out to dealers ( I like Auto Trader, True Car, and Car Gurus ) asking for the carfax, test drive, getting a feel for the car, and negotiating for the best deal! I'm looking at getting a Mazda 3 ( 2016 or 2017 ) and my price range is 15k to 16k, no accidents, under 100,000 miles, no fleet use, lemon, or salvage cars ( and no red cars ). Luckily I found 2 and I'm trying to get 1 before someone else does. My only issue is getting a car loan...I've never had a car at all but I have good credit and no history so I'm a huge risk and I know I'm gonna get a bad deal. I am a Navy Federal member tho, I'm just nervous about applying to Navy Federal first because I spoke to a woman today and she told me that they don't have a pre-approval. So that's a hard pull and I don't want to waste it. I'm also a Captial One member and have 2 credit cars with them, and I tried their pre-approval and of course, I was denied! So I'm just lost on who should I go too far for a car loan ( Since I have no history I'm not expecting a good rate ). What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

Should I use my parents as a co-signer to increase my chances of getting to the car?

My mom uses Westlake and I was wondering if I should use them too and once I get my loan I get refinanced through Navy Federal?

solar,Solar production matching house consumption.,"Just had a Tesla powerwall 2 installed yesterday and I‚Äôm confused by the numbers.

We have a SMA Sunnyboy 10.0 inverter and 7.4kW LG panels on the roof. 

The Tesla app is showing the solar production correctly as it matches the SMA energy app, however our consumption is the same figure as the production and only 0.3 is ever fed to the powerwall. 

I noticed that if a cloud blocks the panels that both the consumption and production figures drop. 

Any ideas what would cause this or how I can fix the data?

I currently owe 5,500 on my student loans which start in March. TBD on the interest rate because it‚Äôs temporarily 0 from the pandemic. I plan to put $25/paycheck aside to lower my initial later. I also owe a larger sum to my parents for a plus loan, numbers tbd.

My rent is $925+$11 for rental insurance currently, and I‚Äôm going to ask for a potential rent reduction due to my financial situation changing. This eats around half my monthly income at the most, maybe a quarter at the least. 

I then am saving around $100/month where $50 is going towards a high yields savings account for emergencies and another $50 for a trip this summer/spring. 

I then plan to put $25/month towards my investment account using acorns. I also use round-up which is a variable amount that I won‚Äôt count towards my budget.

I work 2 part time jobs atm, and I am paid hourly for both. They both have a sales bonus which essentially pays another dollar per hour I worked.

ethereum,Analysis of DEX Inflation Via Yield Farming Vs. Token Price,"# General Conclusion

Inflation is not only an important variable in monetary policy in the economy, but also important in crypto. Inflation is the easiest way to fund development. This forces holders to indirectly pay for development through the loss of value or ownership of the token over time to the protocol.

Inflation is usually referred to via a token release schedule; the researcher actively recalculates it.

# What Is Inflation?

&gt;Inflation in traditional economics refers to the **increase in prices of goods.** Inflation in token economics refers to the **increase in token supply.**

Inflation is the persistent increase in the general price level of goods and services over time and the value loss of a currency. When the general price level rises, **a unit of currency buys fewer goods and services than in the past.** Thus, inflation reflects a decrease in purchasing power per unit of a currency. In the economy, inflation is affected by many factors such as **demand-pull, cost-push, structural changes and import and export, etc.**

In the crypto space, inflation is the issuing of new crypto/tokens into circulation which puts selling pressure on them. In theory, their value should decrease with an increase in supply, if demand is constant. Inflation in the crypto space is mainly affected by **the increase in the supply of circulating tokens**.

# Token Issuance Model

The only impact on inflation is the issuance of tokens into circulation. Token inflation is used to bootstrap growth or to start a community. In this section we are going to find the answer to this question: which issuance models have been used so far in crypto space?

* Algo Supply
* Scheduled Supply
* Governed Supply

 

**TLDR**:

While inflation should theoretically reduce the value of a particular asset, in a strong bull market, enough demand can still outweigh the selling pressure from inflation.

You can clearly see this in the inflation chart (monthly) of Sushiswap. Despite the huge inflation in the early stages to incentivise users, the value of $SUSHI is increasing rapidly. This is something interesting in the crypto space.

CryptoCurrency,"How Tinyman Powers Secure, Decentralized Trading on Algorand","Centralized exchanges have done a great job at promoting cryptocurrencies, enabling individuals across the globe - including the 1.7 billion unbanked people in developing nations - to access alternative assets and new forms of money.

However, it‚Äôs decentralized exchanges (DEXes) that further build on the promise of decentralization. DEXes, along with the entire Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector, give users even more freedom and control over their finances. 

Tinyman, a new DEX platform built on Algorand, has the ambitious goal of empowering communities of regular people like you and me by encouraging a fair economy that is built upon inclusion and equality. Read on to find out more about Tinyman, the latest DeFi application to launch on Algorand. 

The Origin Story of Tinyman

Tinyman is the result of a confluence of factors, such as the existence of a truly decentralized blockchain network, like Algorand, and the ambition of a talented team led by founder Kaan Eryƒ±lmaz. However, the main driving force that led to the development of the DEX, which is expected to grow into an entire DeFi ecosystem, is the need for an equitable economic environment in which everyone could benefit.

Unfortunately, the traditional financial system is creating wealth inequality and economic instability through inflation and debt. According to Oxfam, the world‚Äôs richest 1% has more than twice as much wealth as 6.9 billion people. Elsewhere, Credit Suisse said in its Global Wealth Report that adults with less than $10,000 in wealth make up 53.6% of the population but hold only 1.4% of global wealth.

The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively contributed to wealth inequality. While central banks‚Äô monetary policies of zero interest rates and bond-buying programs might have given an immediate boost to economies, these measures have led to accelerating inflation, resulting in the devaluation of national currencies and a widening wealth gap between rich and poor.

Thanks to blockchain, communities can develop alternative ecosystems, as the technology empowers decentralized stable economies where everyone can be a winner. This is the vision of Tinyman, which plans to embrace decentralization to every level. In fact, Kaan Eryƒ±lmaz doesn‚Äôt want to think about it as his project, as the DeFi ecosystem will focus on the community.

Kaan likes to think that Tinyman is a character in the metaverse that comes from the mystical galaxy ruined by financial debt and wealth inequality, and it comes to earth and falls in love with blockchain technology. Our hero wants to build a financial ecosystem on blockchain, and all Kaan‚Äôs team does is help it fulfill its vision.

Speaking about the team, Kaan is supported by two back-end developers, a front-end developer, a smart contract developer, and a designer. The team has a strong background, as Kaan has worked at HipoLabs, which has created UX and UI designs and apps for fintechs, neobanks, trading platforms, and other companies for over ten years. At one point, when Hipo was doing work for Algorand, Kaan, who is in charge of design and crypto projects at Hipo, experienced the blockchain‚Äôs great benefits and decided to build a DeFi product on it. 

That‚Äôs how Tinyman came out.

How Does Tinyman DEX Work?



The first major application of the Tinyman ecosystem envisioned by Kaan is the decentralized exchange (DEX), which allows users to swap assets at market rates. You can think about it as the Uniswap for Algorand assets. It acts as an automatic market maker (AMM), meaning that the smart contracts enforce all the rules and replace the typical order book function. Thus, Tinyman is a fully decentralized, non-custodial exchange.

As any typical DEX, the main players on the platform are swappers and poolers, or what we call liquidity providers. Swappers are the users who sell cryptoassets from their wallets in exchange for tokens from the platform‚Äôs pool. They pay a small fee for the exchange service. Elsewhere, poolers provide liquidity by locking a pair of assets in a smart contract to gain passive income from the transaction fees paid by swappers.

With Tinyman, you can easily exchange ALGO or an Algorand asset for another one. All you should do is connect your wallet with the platform and do the swap. The DEX doesn‚Äôt hold user funds, as the exchange operation happens directly between your wallet and the pool.

As a DEX, Tinyman doesn‚Äôt require you to go through KYC verification and lets you have full control over your cryptoassets.

Currently, Tinyman provides its testnet version, with the mainnet launch being scheduled for later this quarter.

In the first week of the testnet, the platform saw 4,729 transactions and 78 pools created, some of which had additional liquidity pouring in from multiple providers, reaching 1,169 pool operations and 1363 swaps. In total, 617 accounts were connected to the DEX with MyAlgo Wallets. This performance anticipates the rapid growth of the Tinyman ecosystem and reflects the increasing demand for an Algorand-oriented exchange.

Tinyman Benefits from Algorand Features

Tinyman is the first DEX platform built on Algorand, benefiting from all the unique features of this truly decentralized network. 

Algorand is currently the only network that solves the so-called Blockchain Trilemma by achieving unmatched scalability while not compromising on decentralization and security.

Additionally, Algorand has low transaction fees, enabling Tinyman to charge lower commissions that eventually benefit liquidity providers rather than the blockchain network itself. On top of that, Algorand is exceptionally fast, with each transaction reaching finality in less than 5 seconds.

Another great thing about Algorand is that it‚Äôs highly secure thanks to its Pure Proof of Stake (PPoS) algorithm. Another aspect that makes it secure is its programming language known as Transaction Execution Approval Language (TEAL), which allows developers to create smart contracts with fewer mistakes and thus fewer loopholes to be exploited by hackers.

With Algorand, Tinyman can go beyond the DEX and build an entire economic system that is user-oriented and benefits every member of the community.

For background info, my wife and I have two well paying jobs in which our combined income is &gt;250k. I graduated last August with about 79k SL total (this includes grad and undergrad). For some reason I am unable to see my interest rates but I'm thinking they are around 5-7.5% which are all federal through FedLoan. No significant debt besides mortgage. My wife and I both max out our 401k and HSA. The next thing I want to do is focus on is maxing out both ROTH's (via backdoor method for the first time). Both of our ROTHs are invested with Vanguard in VTWAX (one Roth IRA is at about 3,500 and another is about 13,600). I am expecting to have ~80,000 - 90,000 in savings (not including emergency funds) by January so here are the options I am running through my head...

Option 1: Do not worry about ROTHs for 2021. Pay all I can to SL in January before interest accrues. After lump sum payment, work on maxing out Roths for 2022.

Option 2: Max out one Roth IRA (likely the higher one) for 2021 and put the rest towards SL to bring the balance down as low as possible. Work on maxing out Roths for 2022.

Option 3: Max out both Roth IRAs for 2021. Aggressively pay the rest towards SL come January and then DCA 1k month throughout the year to max out 2022.

The transfer was anything but smooth. Shellpoint missed one of our payments and would not correct it.

After screaming at our loan agent, he did everything possible to resolve, and it turned out that Shellpoint missed one of our payments during the transfer. They never admitted to it, but made a mess of the payment history trying to correct it manually. Eventually after 4 months of back and forth it was finally corrected.

Recently I wanted to recast my loan with an approx 10% pay down of the principal. Shellpoint does not even have a way to make this request - the phone agent was struggling through the online website on the contact options and finally asked me to send it through another unrelated topic. A month goes by and I get a letter saying they are contacting the lender (Some trust fund). Another few weeks later, after I call again I get a secure message saying the trust fund does not allow recasting and my only option was to refinance. Unlucky us we paid down some points to guaranteed rate to get the interest rate down a notch and we are not even half way there.

I apologize for the rant, but I just wanted to let others know to stay away from Shellpoint/Newrez. Your loan will be kicked like a soccer ball everytime its convenient for them and terms and conditions will change widely as a result.

Bitcoin,Should Bitcoin have a minimal constant inflation (say 0.1% per year) to keep mining profitable?,"**TLDR: In the future, there is a chance that transaction fees would not be high enough to provide suffice mining revenue, and thus security, to Bitcoin as a global currency. With a 0.1% permanent inflation, Bitcoin mining would me much more profitable than today, the monetary policy would still be predictable long term and transparent, and hodlers may not notice such a rounding error in inflation, but rather still an increase in purchasing power thanks to lost coins/better economy.**

Hello Reddit.

I am a Bitcoin maximalist like no other. However, I have a question whose answer is still not clear to me: how mining would be profitable when the coinbase becomes negligible/zero?

I know the most commonly accepted answer is by transaction fees. But thinking thoughts about that, this answer does not convince me.

In a future where Bitcoin becomes a global currency, I assume that layer 2 and layer 3 solutions will be developed and secure enough to handle the vast majority of transactions. I am very optimistic with these developments, and I can imagine a future where these layers work so well and are so widely accepted, that in some cases they will be able to handle not just coffee payments, but also larger payments such as a car or a house.

Even more, I think the transaction size will be optimized over time with future updates (most recently with Taproot). So a layer 1 block will be able to handle more transactions than today, effectively reducing transaction fees.

This all sounds exciting, as it makes clear that the Bitcoin community is concerned about one of the mayor Bitcoin criticisms has, which is the high transaction fees.

However, this approach of reducing layer 1 congestion and optimizing block space, and thus minimizing transaction fees, conflicts with the idea of keeping mining profitable when the coinbase becomes negligible. We all want low fees, we all want PoW, but in that case, who will pay the miners? **Who will pay enough to keep Bitcoin secure?**

Today, the block reward is about ‚Çø6.25 (coinbase) + ~‚Çø0.2 (fees) = ‚Çø6.45. At the current value of ~$43,000, that's $277,350. To simplify, lets round up to about $300,000 each 10 minutes as the miner's current revenue. Also, let's assume that current block space allows about ~3,000 transactions per block. So, if today we had to pay miners only with transaction fees, the average on chain transaction fee should be about $100!! Imagine the FUD coming from the media and shitcoins in that scenario!

Well, if that seems expensive, let me express my unpopular opinion: I think that amount of fees **would not be high enough** to pay for the security a global monetary network such as Bitcoin deserves. Even more considering that we are also indirectly paying for the security of the Lightning Network, RGB, smart contracts and all the L2/L3 solutions on top of the Bitcoin protocol.

I want the Bitcoin mining to consume way more energy than today, 10x at least (renewable and wasted, ofc). In the medium term future, I have no worries about that, as with each halving the price of bitcoin more than doubles, so bitcoin mining is even more profitable, more miners appear and more energy is consumed. However, this trend cannot be perpetual. The day will arrive in which the price of Bitcoin stagnates due to global adoption, but the halving will still occur, eventually reducing the coinbase to zero.

In that hypothetical scenario of L2/L3 solutions widely adopted, block space very optimized, and negligible coinbase, who is going to pay not just $300,000 (at today's value) per 10min, but $1M/10min at the very least?

Ok, I admit it, I am making a ton of assumptions. Who knows how the future will look like, especially in such a long term (50 years? 60? 70?)? Maybe the base layer of Bitcoin will not be as unused as I am describing. Maybe the solution provided by Satoshi himself in his white paper is valid in this hypothetical future. I don't know, no one does, and I think even Satoshi himself didn't have such a level of foreshadowing.

What makes me comfortable is that, if this scenario happens, it will not be from a day to another, but slowly developed over time. For example, we will observe a decrease in hashrate over time (my biggest afraid), and a following debate about how could we make mining profitable again will occur within the community, very much like the blocksize war.

Well, I don't want to throw a problem without providing a solution, as that would be just FUD. Please, let me expose a couple of possible scenarios I have considered.

First, I thought about shrinking the block size, that is, artificially increasing transaction fees. However, this solution effectively does not help at all. Fees would be higher, sure, but less transactions would fit into a block, so in the end the block reward would not significantly change. In fact, increasing transaction fees would discourage base layer transactions, so people would prefer to use instead superior layers. In the end, transaction fees may be kept constant, and a block would handle less transactions, effectively reducing miners revenue. Remember, what we want to achieve is not higher transaction fees, but rather increase miners revenue each 10min.

So, if fees cannot keep mining profitable, what is their purpose? In my opinion, in Bitcoin, transaction fees are not a mechanism to fund miners (sorry, Satoshi). In my opinion, **fees are the mechanism by which a priority is established to the transactions in the mempool in order to be accepted in the next block, due to the nature of the blocksize limit**. That is, due to the nature of blockspace scarcity. This scarcity ensures a low enough blockchain size to be sufficiently decentralized, and thus, secure. I would not mind a future with a low layer 1 usage and zero transaction fees, as long as the blocksize is as restricted as today, and thus the blockchain is distributed enough.

But that raises, again, the question: how Bitcoin mining would be profitable in this hypothetical scenario?

As same as today it is: through **inflation.**

I know inflation is a very unpopular idea in this subreddit, but let me explain.

I hate fiat inflation as much as the other guy. That is in a big way, why I am a Bitcoin hodler and a maximalist. But not because I hate inflation per se. What I actually hate is the fiat monetary policy being controlled by a few people, unilaterally and arbitrary to satisfy their own interests. Think about this, Bitcoin is today inflationary, and will still be the rest of our lives. And still, we use it and believe in its future. At the same time, I am not a big fan of deflation per se. In fact, I would hate deflation as much as inflation if it was still controlled by a very few, unilaterally and arbitrary.

What I like about Bitcoin is not its deflation, nor inflation. It is its **public monetary policy**, known to all, set in stone from now for a 100 years, and no particular person can change that. We all must follow the same rules, no exceptions.

In that case, I am not against inflation. In fact, and following the theme of the post, I think it is the answer to keep the PoW in the hypothetical future I have described, and keep mining profitable.

In fact, that is exactly how Bitcoin works today. If the purpose of fees is to establish a priority to transactions to be confirmed into a scarce blocksize, I think inflation is what makes mining profitable, and thus, provides Bitcoin with tremendous security. And I think the opposite is also true: if Bitcoin had no inflation, there would be nearly no miners, and Bitcoin would be insecure, vulnerable.

I know, inflation is a tax to hodlers, as same as deflation is a reward to hodlers. Well, I, as a hodler, wouldn't mind to pay a small percentage of my holdings directly to a mining company to keep not only my funds, but all the Bitcoin network secure. That would be way cheaper than securing gold nowadays. However, I don't think altruism would be enough. First, because it is susceptible to malicious hodlers who would benefit from other people paying miners altruistically. Second, because there would also be non malicious hodlers who would benefit from this, like people in prison or in comma, unable to spend their coins, but still may be able to access them in the future.

So, imagine all 21M Bitcoin have been mined, there is no inflation, mining is not profitable and hashrate is worryingly low. Imagine we all discuss, debate, and accept through consensus a constant inflation of 0.1% a year. That would be 21,000 BTC created from nowhere every year, or about 0.4BTC every 10min. Imagine an arbitrary price of $10M as today's value per Bitcoin. That would be $4M every 10min which would go to miners revenue, plus negligible transaction fees. That would be 10x more block reward than today's!

For me, those numbers make absolutely total sense. I am telling you that, if you have $100,000 in Bitcoin holdings, you just have to pay indirectly a depreciation of $100 a year. Money that does not go to the minority controlling the monetary policy to satisfy their own interests, but rather **to the people who is actively working on securing your Bitcoins in a perfectly competitive industry.** Honestly, that seems very fair to me.

And now, if we consider the loss of bitcoin over time, the total inflation rate would be in the practice even lower. Also, consider the increase in purchasing power derived from global capitalism over time (I know, huge leapfrog there, but that is an entirely different topic to discuss). That 0.1% inflation becomes more and more of a rounding error.

To sum up, I think Bitcoin security should not be exclusively paid by those who permform on chain transactions, but also by those who hold Bictoin, and thus they benefit from the security provided by the PoW.

Anyway, I am looking for your opinions about what solution would you propose in this hypothetical future. Sorry if it ended up being a long post. I don't usually post much, but as much as I trust Bitcoin, this is my mayor long term concern, and I haven't found any paper or book providing a solution that convinces me. Also, I am not a native English speaker, so please sorry for any mistakes.

If you have reached here, thank you for reading me!

personalfinance,Pay Off or just Pay Down Car Loan to prep my credit score for a mortgage,"Hi, and a big thanks in advance to anyone who can answer my question.

I'm going to apply for a mortgage within the next few months and I'm trying to (1) get my credit score as high as possible for the best mortgage rates -- credit score currently 784, and (2) get my monthly obligations as low as possible so I'll qualify for the highest mortgage possible. I have a car loan of approximately $25k that I could pay off today. However, I'm afraid if I pay it off entirely, my credit score will drop because my credit mix will be down to just 1 type of credit -- credit cards. But I don't want to show a monthly car payment of $400 because that will reduce what lenders will give me. I have no credit card debt, though I do use the cards every month and pay them off monthly.

So my question is -- should I pay off the car loan completely -- or -- should I pay it down to around $5,000? If I leave a small balance, it could help my credit score (shows lower amount of debt while retaining the credit mix). Then when the underwriter starts asking for all the specifics about my debt, I could pay off the other $5k and show proof that it's paid off before it has a chance to lower my credit score(?).

Or am I overthinking it and paying off a car loan with a 784 credit score will still keep me in the top brackets for the best interest rates?

Again, thanks in advance for any insight here. This is all unchartered territory for me.",finance
cardano,Announcement: Building a new partnership ecosystem Summary,"Made a quick summary of the presentation. Feel free to add anything I might have missed!

Following Keynote speech is from Charles Hoskinson, Jerry Fragiskatos (Chief Commercial Officer for IOHK), Chris Ergen (head of innovation at DISH) Stephen Stokols (CEO, Boost Mobile)

\-DISH are the rebels from the telecom space. Always leading and transforming the entire industry they are in.

\-Teleco has the scale of tens of millions. Now they can innovate this in a cost-effective manner.

\-Loyalty programs, for consumers.

\-Blockchains are useless without connectivity. Bring the best of both worlds together. Metcalfe's network. Makes sense to have multiple networks work together to create better Interoperability.

\-Colab came through Charles and Chris through a mutual friend. DISH was One of the first to accept crypto as payment in 2014. 9-month process to get them on board. Two or three calls a  week for months to get this going.

\-Proof of bandwidth in the Cardano system is being created for this partnership.

\-Moving at silicon valley speed, but slow enough to make sure it's done right and safely.

\-8 million new users

\-Atala Prism mentioned, huge data protection with blockchain. Huge ability to increase scalability. More robust. (Atala Prism just announced that they will be partnering with Acuant)

\-Decentralized digital identity mentioned. Voting, medical records. OPM hack, which involved names and locations of people involved in the federal government. If this is hackable, what else is? This is where Cardano comes in.

\-Max business flexibility with this colab. These credentials can put DISH in the driver's seat to determine what is best for the company, customer, and growth. Microsoft had this closed mindset at first, where they didn't have colabs. once they opened up they had huge growth. Since this is one of the first huge mergers, this will create a balanced relationship with the customers based and the 10x growth that people are looking for with Cardano.

\-Creating Smart contracts will make paperwork and agreements much easier to do business.

\-So many of our accounts have been hacked and we've started to look at this as normal. Why is this normal? It's time to gain security for our digital identity once and for all.

\-How do we know customers? Like how do we know we can trust that the customer says who they are. This is 2021, this is a problem that needs a solution. Is the customer really owning their identity? Or is it the corporations that own that customer's identity?

\-Loyalty programs. Consumer value, as seen in airlines. DISH will be the first telecom to have this as a blockchain loyalty program. Redeem for cash, cryptos, and other third-party services. Blockchain will cause this loyalty program to grow with what it would take a normal airline loyalty program ten years to do. Because of the built-in programmability. All work on the phone and will be seamless.

\-Ecosystem will be huge and expand quickly. Far quicker than a normal airline loyalty program. Who knows what it entails down the road. You even be able to build up so many loyalty points, you could buy a house.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Staking and Compounded Interest Math Questions,"I'm currently (and often) refining and adding components/features to my personal investment spreadsheet that I use for my dashboard.  However, I've run into a minor snag with some math regarding compounded interest and how it is handled by a staking account.  I imagine (not sure though) that most providers in the crypto space would likely handle it the same way, but as of yet have been unsuccessful in finding any solid answers yet.

I understand the basic math behind compounded interest.  However, when it comes to creating an accurate formula in a spreadsheet, I'm faced with a number of uncertainties.

1. If a fixed investment is compounded daily, how do I account for leap year days without making the formula too long and convoluted?
2. In the crypto space (as in stocks), the initial investment amount does not always (nor should it) match the amount of value of the coins you have staked due to the price fluctuation.  How do they calculate the interest every day?  Is it based on the current value, or is it based on the initial investment?  Could it even be based on the number of coins in the wallet?

I am currently using the function for Future Value, but it doesn't appear to be quite accurate the way I'm using it.  I'm hoping that someone might be able to help correct the mistake(s) that I'm making with it and hopefully help some others that may be running into the same problems.

For instance, if I have $100 staked, the daily compounded interest is 3% and I want to see the future value after 24 months of staking...I use the following data fields for the FV function's formula:

Future Value after x years (I enter this manually in order to calculate results): 2

Periods per year (since interest is compounded daily, I input the number of days in a typical year): 365

Number of periods (I calculate this by multiplying the years by the periods per year): 730

Annual Interest Rate: 3% (I like to use 0.03 instead of a percentage format because it looks cleaner to me)

Payment: 0 (since I'm not adding or subtracting to the initial investment)

Present Value: -100 (I multiply my initial investment by -1 to prevent my result from showing a negative value)

My resulting formula would look like this:

=FV(RATE, NUMBER\_OF\_PERIODS, PAYMENT\_AMOUNT, PRESENT\_VALUE)

Replacing the cell references with actual values would look this way:

=FV(0.03/365, 730, 0, -100)

This returns $106.18.

Does this look correct to better-trained eyes?  That appears to be a 3.9% annual return each year for a 2-year stake.

1 year stake: 3.05%

2 year stake: 6.18%

3 year stake: 9.42%

...and so on.

I believe this to be accurate, but I wanted to run it by you folks before I run with it.

I'm still unsure of what to do about leap years, and although it won't occur again for a few years...I'd like to future-proof my forecasts.  Also still not sure how to compensate for the fluctuating value of the coin.

Basically, I have some cash on hand and some cash invested that I don't really know what to do with, or overall if I am managing my assets smartly. 

Background:

I have about $125k in a Fidelity taxable account that is currently managed and seems to be growing at a nice rate. 

I have 25k in a Roth IRA, but I'm wondering why I even have this account as the vast majority of my income comes from rental properties so I don't see myself as necessarily ever ""retiring"" at a certain age. I also do occasional contracted work and have never been in a situation where an employer offered a retirement plan that they / I could contribute to. Does it even make sense for me to continue to contribute to a Roth IRA? 

I have an additional $215k in cash that is a combination of emergency fund as well as funds for any necessary improvements needed for rental properties (roofs etc.) I realize this is probably more than necessary to have set aside which is why I'm asking for advise here. 

I have 0 debt aside from the mortgages, 2 of which are at a very high %. Unfortunately I have been declined 3 times now for a refinance, which is honestly baffling to me but my DTI ratio is a bit high because of mortgages, property taxes, homeowners insurance and rent on my apartment. So lets assume that refinancing is not an option for me. 

It **feels** unwise for me to use most of the cash I have to pay off / down the mortgages, as my understanding is mortgage payments are not typically considered a ""bad"" type of debt to have. But as I have no other debt, does it make sense to pay off the mortgages or just to continue paying down a bit aggressively? Is there another strategy here, or better options to manage the current funds listed above?

CryptoCurrency,"Facebook Libracoin Economics, solution to financial issues or another overpromise?","We covered the 2 foundational principles in the last episodes. Now, let's take a look at the case study of Facebook's Libracoin.

I'm sure you have heard about Facebook releasing its own token as a currency. It caused a lot of controversy with its initial plans. So they took some time and re-designed the economics of the libra token. Facebook released a new whitepaper for the Libra token.

Today, we will deconstruct the economics design of Libra token according to the framework to design your virtual economy.

* Why economics design of libra coin is the future
* Guideline to the economics design framework
* Applying libracoin to the framework

Note: we are going to use the words ""coin"" and ""token"" interchangeably.

# 1) Why economics design of libra coin is the future

Firstly, we are talking about libra as a use-case, the payment system. Not libra blockchain protocol. The libra protocol is the underlying technological stack that the payment system is built upon.

&gt;**Simplification**: It's like talking about making whisky. We need barley, the fermentation machine, yeast and water. But we are not talking about building the wooden casks for the whisky to ferment in. That wooden cask is the underlying tech stack, which is the libra blockchain protocol. We are talking about the ingredients to make the whisky.

This payment system is an economy on its own, with various users coming together and interacting. Here, we are talking about the design of this payment system's economy. The libra coin is the asset that represents value being transferred within this payment system. So when users come together and interact, the common asset that they are transacting is the libra token.

The **key takeaway** in economics design is that we are **creating programmable assets, programmable mechanisms, programmable economies** and even programmable supervision for compliance purposes.

The beauty of economics design is that we design 2 things: 1) libra token (which is the value representation) and 2) the environment in which this token will exist in.

What does it mean when we say ""the environment in which this token will exist in""?

It is

* who gets to interact with the token,
* what value is this token representing in the environment
* where are the various environments the token can be used (geographical constraints, judicial limits, legality)
* when is transactions being validated and accounted for, so as to avoid double-spending
* why or value-add that the token brings to the user,
* how users get to interact with each other

These are the factors that goes into economics design of the libra coin. It goes beyond just 1 jurisdiction to reach a global scale. It also exists in the digital world but interact with the ""real world"". That means the impact of this libra coin design is widespread ‚Äî in terms of geographical limits and application to our daily lives.

As the world becomes more digital, thanks to Covid19 and not your digital innovation department, this is the start of the future. We are designing the future.

## LibraCoin 101

the possible functions of a digital token can be SUMmed up as:

* Security
* Utility
* Money

This libracoin takes up the function of MONEY.

With money, you can divide it further to pegged money or not pegged money. Libracoin will have 2 types of coins: pegged money and not pegged money.

Pegged money just means 1 for 1 representation.

&gt;**Simplification**: Let's say 1 book means 1 dumbbell. So to generate 1 dumbbell, I need to put 5 books in my bank and create 5 dumbbells. To take 1 book out, I destroy that 1 dumbbell and retrieve 1 book. So the value of 1 dumbbell will always be equal to 1 book.

Not pegged money can be in different forms. For example,

1. The money can be representation of a basket of currencies. So let's say Lisa-Dollars is created by having a basket of 5 types of whisky. The 5 types of whisky can change in value, which affects Lisa-Dollars. (Fluctuates less) Real world example: Singapore Dollars
2. The money has value on it's own. Everyone believe that Lisa-Dollars is the new USD, so everyone just trades in Lisa-Dollars and there is a market for it. there is a supply and demand for it. and it has a value. It sounds like creating money out of nothing, as long as people believe in it. Yup, in simple words, yeah that is it. There is more complication to that, but that is the idea. (Fluctuates more) Real world example: US Dollars

In the Libra network, you have 2 types of these coins.

The pegged money will be pegged to major currencies like USD, GBP, EUR. 1 Libra-USD = 1 USD. They get this by putting 1 USD in the bank, and create 1 Libra-USD coin. It does not fluctuate.

The unpegged money will be defined by a basket of currencies. That is the LBR coin. It is a mix weightage of various currencies like USD, GBP, EUR, JPY, CHF. It fluctuates slightly.

So now that we have the general idea of Libracoin set in stone, let's understand the framework to economics design.

# 2) Framework to Economics Design

This is the framework to designing your economics model. It consists of 3 pillars, market design, mechanism design and token design. Token design is optional, because not every economy requires a token.

Market design is the design of the environment. This environment is where people interact with each other.

Mechanism design is the rules of the game. The rules that the people must adhere by. Without rules, it is nearly impossible to coordinate any transactions in your economy.

Token design is the design of the token itself. The token is a representation of value in your economy. The token can have various functions like security (representation of an underlying asset), utility (like a protocol token to transfer data and information) or money (as a means of payment, store of value or unit of account).

Token design is not always important because sometimes, you really don't need a token. It could be an economy of users or agents, inputing information into a database. And the information is used to coordinate transactions within your economy.

&gt;**Case in point**: maritime insurance and shipping. The users input data like volume of cargo, departure date, etc. When things happen, the insurer can use the information in the database and generate automated payouts to the companies. The payouts are finalised off the database, hence you no need tokens to represent payouts.

## Things to note

1. The factors have varying level of importance in the ecosystem. I would argue that governance is the most important of all factors, but then again, it depends on your objective of the ecosystem.
2. Not every factor is relevant. Sometimes, the entire column of token design is not necessary. Sometimes, bargaining protocol is not necessary. Sometimes, congestion issue is resolved in the underlying blockchain protocol layer, and hence not an issue in the use-case application layer.
3. These factors are mainly factors that can be designed and built from within the ecosystem. There are a lot of other factors like blockchain protocol layer, competency of the team, secondary market implications, etc.

# 3) Economics Design of Libra Network

Before we begin any design of anything, the first step is to define the objective of the design. Like in calculus and your first order condition, you need to know what you are optimising. Otherwise, you can design anything you want, and it makes no sense.

It's kinda like your life, where you have to know the objective in your life. Then design the kind of life you want, to achieve that objective.

Same thing over here, we have to set the objective before we begin the design.

The objective of this Libra network is to support global, cross-border exchanges. How? Through stabilisation of currency and value preservation. Its objective is not monetary sovereignty, as in a global currency to replace the USD.

Now, that is the overall objective. The economics design objective is more structured. It is to build trust in an efficient payment method. That is something much more concrete to work with.

## Market Design

Market design is the design of the environment. So that people can interact with each other. Libra, being part of Facebook has designed that in 2 layers: end-user and association.

For the end-user, it is the Facebook account holders. There's 2.5 billion of them. These people are regular people like you and me, using Libracoin to send money abroad.

For the association, it is the ""behind the scenes"" people. They are part of governance, various types of regulatory or compliance users, validators, etc. This is defined with the partnerships of companies in the Libra network.

Market design has 3 factors: thickness, reduced congestion and safety.

**Thickness**

Thickness just means how dense the network is, so that people can transact with each other easily.

1. **Currency**. Libra does it with having single currency for domestic use-cases and multi-currency LBR as a common denominator currency for cross-border transactions. It is then converted to local currency to spend. Instead of finding liquidity of a common asset to enable cross-currency transactions, Libra facilitates that with the LBR coin.
2. **Intermediaries**. Having the LBR coin to enable ease of exchange is not enough. It is also important to have a network of resellers and exchanges to buy and sell the coins. People like the money exchange shops on the streets, market makers, OTC desks, etc. There is enough demand and supply in the network that people can transact easily, not having to worry about not finding a market to trade.
3. **Participants**. For the end-user participants, Facebook brings enough network effects that it is good to go. For the association level, Libra has different types of participants. Like subsidiaries, members of association, market makers, asset service providers, and wallet users. These create a dense network to enable trading and transaction of the coins, beyond just end-users.
4. Standardisation of **database structure**. At the end of the day, blockchain is a database that cannot be edited. And one way to encourage the network users is to standardise the database structure. Imagine if everyone in the world spoke the same language. Life would be so much easier right? Currently, each company's system speaks a slightly different language. With Libra, it is trying to create that 1 common language that these company systems are speaking. And what's the benefit of this? It lowers the cost of compliance because you do not need 100 regulations for 100 different systems. This also means that smaller firms can join the network. That is increasing the thickness of the network.

**Reduced congestion**

Since Libra is building its own blockchain protocol too, this congestion issue is resolved at the protocol layer. Also, since it is a permissioned blockchain, it has much less issues to deal with.

On the payment system level, Libra reduces congestion by having more dealers, exchanges and market makers so people can transact anytime they want to. In a way, it is decentralised, because there is no 1 exchange or 1 market maker governing the LBR coins.

Because things are digital, we can program more mechanisms. Like automation at the protocol level for compliance control. Such as sanctioned addresses, jurisdictions, monetary limits, etc.

**Safety**

1. The entire purpose of having more dealers, exchanges and market makers is to assure the end-users that they can convert the LBR coins to their local currency. This is a very important step, because the objective of the Libra network is to enable cross-border payment, not monetary sovereignty. *(I told you that setting the objective is very important. Because it affects our design!)*
2. In the physical world, we have fractional banking. That means when we put our money in the bank, the bank lends a fraction of that money out. It's good because it creates money and allows the economy to expand. It's bad because when things happen, everyone rushes to get their money out, and banks do not have money to return everyone immediately. So like many projects in the cryptospace, Libra is 100% backed by the coins in circulation. With the pegged coin, 1 USD in the bank means 1 Libra-USD being minted. When 1 USD is removed, 1 Libra-USD is burned and destroyed. The similar concept is also used in the LBR coin. *(Once again, this design factor is due to the objective of being a cross-border solution, and not monetary sovereignty. That means Libra is not using the LBR coins to create a multiplier effect and grow the Libra economy. It is just used as a form of money.)*
3. There is KYC, AML and compliance programs for all participants to follow. There is also a written agreement with market makers, which I assume is legally binding. And there is a high level of due diligence at every level. *(Again, this is because the objective is to build trust in the network. And this is one way to build trust.)*
4. There is cross-border solutions in place already. But they are usually only available for users that have bank accounts. So one of the goals of Libra is to help the unbanked get access to funds. Think of someone going abroad to work, and sending money back to the family. The family doesn't have a bank account, so how do they receive money? Here's where Libra hopes to solve the problem. The solution is to have a transaction limit and max address balance on unhosted wallet addresses. Wallet addresses are basically your bank accounts.
5. Lastly, given that a single company can play many roles, like market-maker, member of association and a custodian wallet, the misconduct or moral hazard can be amplified. So this is done by having varying level of governance and participation. And to increase the skin in the game for entities to join by asking them to pay a hefty sum of money. Sure, this is not perfect and the system can still be rigged by the wealthy. The solution is to reduce such chances by increasing skin in the game. When people have more to lose, they think twice about their actions.

## Mechanism Design

Mechanism design is designing the rules of the game. This can be in terms of coded rules or rules that requires human inputs. There are 3 factors, each with other sub-factors: Governance, non-financial incentives, structure.

**Governance**

Good governance support the stability of the payment system and other public interests. I call it social optimisation function.

Where else is consensus used? In the weightage of the LBR coin. That is a basket of currencies with different weightage to give value to the LBR coin. This is governed by FINMA.

It is also used to validate transactions. Since the Libra network is a permissioned blockchain, people have to ""buy in"" to get a seat at the governance table. In general, these people are the ones that define the ongoing governance by having consensus with the decisions made and to validate transactions with 2/3 supermajority of the association members.

Everything else is governed by machines, which is smart contract. For example, FINMA determines the weightage and currencies, and the smart contract executes it. In the future, there could be other players like central banks, regulators, IMF.

Governance is not just about decision making. It is also to reduce problems occurring or to resolve problems when they occur. Like preparing for a pandemic and containing the pandemic.

I mentioned a few times about programmable systems. Here, we can embed programmable rules or supervision in the governance layer. That is the compliance monitoring and enforcement of regulatory rules. Regulatory rules would be legal rules and systems.

LBR coin is used as a unit of account and transferred between participants with smart contract. It is hardcoded, transparent and reduces double-spending.

Lastly, resolution is **key** when shit happens. Let's say there is a run on bank and everyone decides to withdraw all the money. In the real world, usually banks will close and stop people from withdrawing. But in cryptoworld, life goes on, 24/7. So, there are 2 ways to reduce the fire-sale, to slow the speed of people withdrawing instantly.

That is to delay redemption to 1) allow the network to liquidate their assets and 2) pay a fee if you want instant redemption. Even though the assets backing the network is highly liquid, it takes some time to liquidate them, and return the cash value to the users. Hence, time is required. We will go more into details in the token design section.

**Non-financial incentives**

The paper did not talk about about voting in the association level for governance.

They did mention a little on allocation mechanism. Coins are mint and burnt according to market demand. That means, when money is added in (via cash or short-term securities), coins are minted. When money with withdrawn, coins are burnt. I wish they spoke more about the minimum holdings in each participation level, like exchanges, market makers, dealers, OTC desks.

**Structure**

There is no bargaining or auction mechanisms involved, since prices are the same as real world. Hence, the interaction between real world and programmable digital world.

Due to the interaction, there is a need for external information defining the structure of the mechanism design, aka rules of the game. For example, a hard limit rule by the real world is capital control and foreign exchange limits. These rules need to be added into the transaction rules when users are doing cross-border transactions. Of course, this can be automated.

In the future, as central banks release CBDC and see an importance to take on a governance role in Libra, the central banks can manage their associate reserves in the Libra network, and replace fiat with CBDC.

## Token Design

Finally, the last pillar: design of the token. We look at token policy, financial incentives and architecture of the token. Once again, I must emphasise that **token design is more than finding a value for your token in the secondary market**. In fact, that should not even be in your top 5 priorities.

**Token policy**

Token policy is both monetary policy and token valuation.

When it comes to monetary policy, the coins in Libra network are backed by highly liquid assets. They function similar to the special drawing rights in the IMF.

&gt;Quick crash course: special drawing rights at the IMF  
In the IMF, SDR are a a unit of account to settle claims for accounting purposes. It consists of a few major currencies with different weightage. Each country in the IMF has some SDRs and they can trade with each other, to exchange for foreign currencies.

LBR function similar to the SDRs, and are used as a unit of account for accounting purposes. The LBR is made up of fixed amount of single currency stable coins (the pegged coins).

These pegged coins are backed by reserve assets. That means

1) there is no new money creation. 1 USD in the bank means 1 Libra-USD being created. It is a 1-for-1 exchange.

2) The reserve assets have to add up to the value of coins being minted. So the reserve has cash and short-term government securities like very safe government bonds.

Now, the split is important to how we value the LBR coin. The pegged coin's valuation is obvious, it is whatever your physical money is. $1 is $1. ¬£1 is ¬£1.

With the LBR token, it is a weighted basket of currencies. It is made up of a mix of 80% safe securities and 20% cash equivalents. The securities have short-term maturity, low risks and are highly liquid.

This is to ensure that the assets in the reserve is the same as the value of pegged coins minted.

&gt;**Simplification**: If that's confusing, just imagine LBR as a hamburger and pegged tokens as cheese, buns, lettuce and patty. And the LBR is combining these ingredients together to make a new asset called hamburger. Aka LBR coin. So you can trade with hamburger as a whole, or individually as in cheese, buns, lettuce and patty.

**Financial incentives**

Financial incentives for the end users are not evident, since we are not talking about ROIs and earning more coins via platform activities. However, there are financial incentives at the association level, to earn from the interest rates of the low risk securities.

**Architecture**

The coins' distribution channel is to distribute libra coin through regulated dealers. Coins are minted and distributed to the market via these dealers. Users can only access them via the dealers, and not from association members. It's a hierarchy system.

The dealers distribute the coins via exchanges and OTC dealers. So end-users like you and me get to use the coins.

# Conclusion

This episode summarises the framework for economics design and how Libra's economy is designed. In the next episode, I will share my thoughts, questions and conclusion of its design.

&gt;TL;DR: Libracoin is to facilitate existing payment infrastructure, not to compete with the USD and become a global currency. It functions similar to the Special Drawing Rights in the IMF, holding the money function of ""unit of account"". The design of Libra Network is in 3 layers: the blockchain protocol layer (to resolve network congestion and consensus), end-user layer (to ensure that users can trust the network) and governance hierarchy layer (to ensure proper decentralised governance).  
Economics design is important in the Libra network because we are programming the environment, rules, mechanisms, regulations and token for the future. We use the framework to understand how well the Libra economy is designed.",cryptocurrency
CryptoMarkets,"Facebook Libracoin Economics, solution to financial issues or another overpromise?","We covered the 2 foundational principles in the last episodes. Now, let's take a look at the case study of Facebook's Libracoin.I'm sure you have heard about Facebook releasing its own token as a currency. It caused a lot of controversy with its initial plans. So they took some time and re-designed the economics of the libra token. Facebook released a new whitepaper for the Libra token.Today, we will deconstruct the economics design of Libra token according to the framework to design your virtual economy.

* Why economics design of libra coin is the future
* Guideline to the economics design framework
* Applying libracoin to the framework

Note: we are going to use the words ""coin"" and ""token"" interchangeably.

# 1) Why economics design of libra coin is the future

Firstly, we are talking about libra as a use-case, the payment system. Not libra blockchain protocol. The libra protocol is the underlying technological stack that the payment system is built upon.

&gt;**Simplification**: It's like talking about making whisky. We need barley, the fermentation machine, yeast and water. But we are not talking about building the wooden casks for the whisky to ferment in. That wooden cask is the underlying tech stack, which is the libra blockchain protocol. We are talking about the ingredients to make the whisky.

This payment system is an economy on its own, with various users coming together and interacting. Here, we are talking about the design of this payment system's economy. The libra coin is the asset that represents value being transferred within this payment system. So when users come together and interact, the common asset that they are transacting is the libra token.The **key takeaway** in economics design is that we are **creating programmable assets, programmable mechanisms, programmable economies** and even programmable supervision for compliance purposes.The beauty of economics design is that we design 2 things: 1) libra token (which is the value representation) and 2) the environment in which this token will exist in.What does it mean when we say ""the environment in which this token will exist in""?It is

* who gets to interact with the token,
* what value is this token representing in the environment
* where are the various environments the token can be used (geographical constraints, judicial limits, legality)
* when is transactions being validated and accounted for, so as to avoid double-spending
* why or value-add that the token brings to the user,
* how users get to interact with each other

These are the factors that goes into economics design of the libra coin. It goes beyond just 1 jurisdiction to reach a global scale. It also exists in the digital world but interact with the ""real world"". That means the impact of this libra coin design is widespread ‚Äî in terms of geographical limits and application to our daily lives.As the world becomes more digital, thanks to Covid19 and not your digital innovation department, this is the start of the future. We are designing the future.

## LibraCoin 101

the possible functions of a digital token can be SUMmed up as:

* Security
* Utility
* Money

This libracoin takes up the function of MONEY.With money, you can divide it further to pegged money or not pegged money. Libracoin will have 2 types of coins: pegged money and not pegged money.Pegged money just means 1 for 1 representation.

&gt;**Simplification**: Let's say 1 book means 1 dumbbell. So to generate 1 dumbbell, I need to put 5 books in my bank and create 5 dumbbells. To take 1 book out, I destroy that 1 dumbbell and retrieve 1 book. So the value of 1 dumbbell will always be equal to 1 book.

Not pegged money can be in different forms. For example,

1. The money can be representation of a basket of currencies. So let's say Lisa-Dollars is created by having a basket of 5 types of whisky. The 5 types of whisky can change in value, which affects Lisa-Dollars. (Fluctuates less) Real world example: Singapore Dollars
2. The money has value on it's own. Everyone believe that Lisa-Dollars is the new USD, so everyone just trades in Lisa-Dollars and there is a market for it. there is a supply and demand for it. and it has a value. It sounds like creating money out of nothing, as long as people believe in it. Yup, in simple words, yeah that is it. There is more complication to that, but that is the idea. (Fluctuates more) Real world example: US Dollars

In the Libra network, you have 2 types of these coins.The pegged money will be pegged to major currencies like USD, GBP, EUR. 1 Libra-USD = 1 USD. They get this by putting 1 USD in the bank, and create 1 Libra-USD coin. It does not fluctuate.The unpegged money will be defined by a basket of currencies. That is the LBR coin. It is a mix weightage of various currencies like USD, GBP, EUR, JPY, CHF. It fluctuates slightly.So now that we have the general idea of Libracoin set in stone, let's understand the framework to economics design.

# 2) Framework to Economics Design

This is the framework to designing your economics model. It consists of 3 pillars, market design, mechanism design and token design. Token design is optional, because not every economy requires a token.Market design is the design of the environment. This environment is where people interact with each other.Mechanism design is the rules of the game. The rules that the people must adhere by. Without rules, it is nearly impossible to coordinate any transactions in your economy.Token design is the design of the token itself. The token is a representation of value in your economy. The token can have various functions like security (representation of an underlying asset), utility (like a protocol token to transfer data and information) or money (as a means of payment, store of value or unit of account).Token design is not always important because sometimes, you really don't need a token. It could be an economy of users or agents, inputing information into a database. And the information is used to coordinate transactions within your economy.

&gt;**Case in point**: maritime insurance and shipping. The users input data like volume of cargo, departure date, etc. When things happen, the insurer can use the information in the database and generate automated payouts to the companies. The payouts are finalised off the database, hence you no need tokens to represent payouts.

## Things to note

1. The factors have varying level of importance in the ecosystem. I would argue that governance is the most important of all factors, but then again, it depends on your objective of the ecosystem.
2. Not every factor is relevant. Sometimes, the entire column of token design is not necessary. Sometimes, bargaining protocol is not necessary. Sometimes, congestion issue is resolved in the underlying blockchain protocol layer, and hence not an issue in the use-case application layer.
3. These factors are mainly factors that can be designed and built from within the ecosystem. There are a lot of other factors like blockchain protocol layer, competency of the team, secondary market implications, etc.

# 3) Economics Design of Libra Network

Before we begin any design of anything, the first step is to define the objective of the design. Like in calculus and your first order condition, you need to know what you are optimising. Otherwise, you can design anything you want, and it makes no sense.It's kinda like your life, where you have to know the objective in your life. Then design the kind of life you want, to achieve that objective.Same thing over here, we have to set the objective before we begin the design.The objective of this Libra network is to support global, cross-border exchanges. How? Through stabilisation of currency and value preservation. Its objective is not monetary sovereignty, as in a global currency to replace the USD.Now, that is the overall objective. The economics design objective is more structured. It is to build trust in an efficient payment method. That is something much more concrete to work with.

## Market Design

Market design is the design of the environment. So that people can interact with each other. Libra, being part of Facebook has designed that in 2 layers: end-user and association.For the end-user, it is the Facebook account holders. There's 2.5 billion of them. These people are regular people like you and me, using Libracoin to send money abroad.For the association, it is the ""behind the scenes"" people. They are part of governance, various types of regulatory or compliance users, validators, etc. This is defined with the partnerships of companies in the Libra network.Market design has 3 factors: thickness, reduced congestion and safety.**Thickness**Thickness just means how dense the network is, so that people can transact with each other easily.

1. **Currency**. Libra does it with having single currency for domestic use-cases and multi-currency LBR as a common denominator currency for cross-border transactions. It is then converted to local currency to spend. Instead of finding liquidity of a common asset to enable cross-currency transactions, Libra facilitates that with the LBR coin.
2. **Intermediaries**. Having the LBR coin to enable ease of exchange is not enough. It is also important to have a network of resellers and exchanges to buy and sell the coins. People like the money exchange shops on the streets, market makers, OTC desks, etc. There is enough demand and supply in the network that people can transact easily, not having to worry about not finding a market to trade.
3. **Participants**. For the end-user participants, Facebook brings enough network effects that it is good to go. For the association level, Libra has different types of participants. Like subsidiaries, members of association, market makers, asset service providers, and wallet users. These create a dense network to enable trading and transaction of the coins, beyond just end-users.
4. Standardisation of **database structure**. At the end of the day, blockchain is a database that cannot be edited. And one way to encourage the network users is to standardise the database structure. Imagine if everyone in the world spoke the same language. Life would be so much easier right? Currently, each company's system speaks a slightly different language. With Libra, it is trying to create that 1 common language that these company systems are speaking. And what's the benefit of this? It lowers the cost of compliance because you do not need 100 regulations for 100 different systems. This also means that smaller firms can join the network. That is increasing the thickness of the network.

**Reduced congestion**Since Libra is building its own blockchain protocol too, this congestion issue is resolved at the protocol layer. Also, since it is a permissioned blockchain, it has much less issues to deal with.On the payment system level, Libra reduces congestion by having more dealers, exchanges and market makers so people can transact anytime they want to. In a way, it is decentralised, because there is no 1 exchange or 1 market maker governing the LBR coins.Because things are digital, we can program more mechanisms. Like automation at the protocol level for compliance control. Such as sanctioned addresses, jurisdictions, monetary limits, etc.**Safety**

1. The entire purpose of having more dealers, exchanges and market makers is to assure the end-users that they can convert the LBR coins to their local currency. This is a very important step, because the objective of the Libra network is to enable cross-border payment, not monetary sovereignty. *(I told you that setting the objective is very important. Because it affects our design!)*
2. In the physical world, we have fractional banking. That means when we put our money in the bank, the bank lends a fraction of that money out. It's good because it creates money and allows the economy to expand. It's bad because when things happen, everyone rushes to get their money out, and banks do not have money to return everyone immediately. So like many projects in the cryptospace, Libra is 100% backed by the coins in circulation. With the pegged coin, 1 USD in the bank means 1 Libra-USD being minted. When 1 USD is removed, 1 Libra-USD is burned and destroyed. The similar concept is also used in the LBR coin. *(Once again, this design factor is due to the objective of being a cross-border solution, and not monetary sovereignty. That means Libra is not using the LBR coins to create a multiplier effect and grow the Libra economy. It is just used as a form of money.)*
3. There is KYC, AML and compliance programs for all participants to follow. There is also a written agreement with market makers, which I assume is legally binding. And there is a high level of due diligence at every level. *(Again, this is because the objective is to build trust in the network. And this is one way to build trust.)*
4. There is cross-border solutions in place already. But they are usually only available for users that have bank accounts. So one of the goals of Libra is to help the unbanked get access to funds. Think of someone going abroad to work, and sending money back to the family. The family doesn't have a bank account, so how do they receive money? Here's where Libra hopes to solve the problem. The solution is to have a transaction limit and max address balance on unhosted wallet addresses. Wallet addresses are basically your bank accounts.
5. Lastly, given that a single company can play many roles, like market-maker, member of association and a custodian wallet, the misconduct or moral hazard can be amplified. So this is done by having varying level of governance and participation. And to increase the skin in the game for entities to join by asking them to pay a hefty sum of money. Sure, this is not perfect and the system can still be rigged by the wealthy. The solution is to reduce such chances by increasing skin in the game. When people have more to lose, they think twice about their actions.

ethereum,"My perfectionism (and ironically lack of attention to detail) caused me to burn about $700,000- $1M in NFTs on accident...","So I was a big collector of the Spells of Genesis cards on the BTC blockchain back in the day, and have been enjoying seeing NFTs take off in the Ethereum space as well.  I was delighted to see that Emblem Finance had found a way to create vaults to allow trading of these old BTC assets on opensea

I jumped on board and filled one vault with an entire set of cards.  It's the only full set available on Opensea that I know of.    I did a second vault with only 4 cards, including a satoshicard and an FDcard- two of the rarest cards in existence, and listed them for sale.  

HOWEVER-  In the description of the second vault, I listed some erroneous information about FDcard, stating that it was not divisible like the Satoshicard.  This drove me crazy, so I decided to claim that vault, take out the cards, and create another vault with the accurate information.  So I created the second vault, but then once it was created I noticed there was a small grammatical error (I repeated a phrase).  I hadn't put any cards in it yet, and the error bothered me, so I decided to just send that vault to the burn address and do it again.  So I did.  


I then created the third vault, and got the text just how I wanted.  Then I went to fill this new vault with the cards, and this is where I F\*\*ed up.  I apparently still had the tab open on emblem finance for the burned vault, and I took the BTC address from that one rather than the newest one.  Each card that I sent I checked and rechecked to make sure the address matched, which it did... but the vault was in the burn address.  So I sent away-  a Satoshicard, an FDcard, a Satoshilite, and and Ethereumcard.  

One by one the transactions confirmed.  And my vault remained empty.  Refresh refresh refresh.... nothing.  It must be a bug, I said.  But then I pulled up the address on the counterparty explorer, and all 4 cards were there.  And then the possibility of the worst case scenario leaked into my brain, and I rejected it.  I had triple checked!  But, I looked at the burn address account on opensea, and there it was.  ""My"" vault, and ""my"" cards.

[Here they are](https://opensea.io/assets/0x82c7a8f707110f5fbb16184a5933e9f78a34c6ab/31233817437325701) if anyone wishes to pay their respects.  ""Fewer complete cards complete cards....""  


They have now been sacrificed to the Gods of Stupidity.  I'm very happy that it was the 4 set rather than the full set.  I can only look on the bright side and realize that there are now 198 Satoshicards and 299 FDcards in existence, so my other cards are more rare.  And maybe I have a tax writeoff?  TBD.

NFT,How NFTs Will Change Enterprise Space; Use Cases and Opportunities,"Corporations can determine whether they should participate in NFT (Non Fungible Token) investment by focusing on explicit use cases and their market positioning and their business strategy. NFTs will be the future of everything and moving beyond just flex for collectors.

&amp;#x200B;

 Movies

Both independent movie producers and directors and also big Hollywood blockbuster movies can now be offered as NFTs and even in an auction to compete for higher value deal both from investors and also crowd funding. 

Independent movie producers are now offering their movies not just for profit, but only as resume builder pieces to get the attention of high ranked producers and movie companies for future projects.

Their strategy is based on hope. 

Meaning that these directors and producers are hoping that they can get enough attention during their life so that they can be head hunted for bigger projects.

Movie studios, agents and named producers are acting as middle man to go after new generation of directors to make more exciting movies.

However, the reality is that very small percentage of these young directors can make it to the top.

The rest are doomed to work on small projects for the rest of their life.

Not anymore.

With NFTs now sky rocketing, now each single director and producer now can offer their movies and projects to the crowd and even collectors and investors and expect massive success.

The new generation of directors are now can compete for funding just like big names in the industry and have a great chance of making something meaningful.

## Sport

The opportunities in sport is endless.

Imagine that now athletes can share their top moments and peak performances as a NFT and put them on auction. The magical moments in top athlete lives can now become a collectable and be sold on NFT marketplaces.

Imagine having a rare collectable of the moment that Roger Federer become champion in yet another grand slam.

Or when Christiano Rolando scores another goal for Manchester United football club. 

This is yet another revenue stream for top athletes around the world on top of sponsorship contacts, social media engagement and now NFT market place.

The same opportunity is available for sporting clubs as well. Now, they can share their top team success moments as a collectable piece of art on NFT market places and again without relying on sporting distribution channels, offer these rare moments to a group of hard core fans online.

## Fortune 500

I want to personally see this happens soon. 

Fortune 500 companies are leading the global tech transformation for all of us. We are heavily relying on these companies to get things done.

Fortune 500 companies can offer their history and grand moments on NFT market place as well. 

For instance, IBM can now offer photos / films or voices of their classic inventions as a NFT and generate another stream of revenue.

Another option might be to offer the beta releases to the hard core fans as NFT for testing and feedback analysis.

This way, companies can make money while they test their products and also flex as well.  

## Healthcare

Just like Fortune 500 companies, healthcare startups and enterprises can offer their art works as NFTs as well.

This can be a classic medicine formula, documents, important discoveries (COVID-19 vaccine discovery moments) or any significant achievement that is documented over the course of history, can be offered as NFT.

## Real Estate

Now that you have reached this part of the blog, you may guess what I am trying to say again.

Either architects and / or real estate companies can release their significant design as NFT to the market place and benefit from the huge market that is available for them.

Obviously, big brand architects can lead in this space. But the opportunity is there for anybody with a bit of story telling skills to unlock the opportunity in this space.

## Government

This will be one of my favorite areas. Given the fact that government is more slower than other industries, but when they come on board, things will become very interesting.

Imagine all those political documents, rare photos and footages, can be released as NFTs!

What an impact.

I personally predict that if government enter NFTs, which they eventually do, they can beat everybody in this space.

The nature of their media is so exclusive that their artwork can sky high all the auctions and bids.

I will write more on this in the future.

## Conclusion

NFTs are artworks that shared by the creators and investors are happy to pay big price for them to have them on their collections.

Any industry can become a creator and offer their peak moments as NFTs not just to build another revenue stream, but to make a more positive impact and publicize the moments of history that people may have forgot.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Does anyone here put the absolute maximum in their 401K and IRA even if you have to pull money out of savings to do it?,"Being over 50 years old, my spouse and I can put $26,000 each in our employer's 401K and up to $7000 each into our IRA.  Combined this is  $33,000 apiece or $66,000 combined as a couple.

The sad story is we have not been doing this up to recently because we did realize the maximum amounts for 401ks and IRAs were so high and exactly how much money we could save in taxes from the maximum contribution.

I figured that for every $100 we earn in our jobs- based on our income as a couple, the Government takes 19% in Federal and State Taxes.  So for every $100 we contribute to a 401k and IRA we save $19.00 in taxes.  So if we contributed the limit of $66,000 we would save $12,540.00 a year in Federal and State Taxes.

(We have savings to cover the cost of the greatly reduced paychecks due to the massive retirement plan contributions.)

Am I missing something?  Do you do this?  It almost sounds too good to be true!",finance
CryptoCurrency,"The crackdown on cryptocurrencies is not limited to China - All central banks want to control them ‚Äì People‚Äôs Bank of China, US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England.","###An economy is always political 

A governments exclusive right to issue a currency is in order to maintain economic, social, and political stability. They have no interest in parallel currencies floating around that may threaten this control. Especially currencies which are not bound to national frameworks and governance. 

Some countries may not be overly worried about cryptocurrencies, such as EL Salvador, which has been using the US dollar since the collapse of it‚Äôs own currency in 2001 (hence they have had less control over their economy and adopting crypto may give them more control again or at least a separation from control from the US). But there may be reasons why other countries and especially China is particularly concerned. 

###Reasons why China is particularly threatened by cryptocurrencies

- The People‚Äôs Bank of China has become the first major central bank to issue a central bank digital currency, the digital Renminbi RMB also known as the e-CNY or Digital Currency Electronic Payment DCEP and is undergoing public testing as of April 2021. China believes that by internationalising the yuan it can reduce its dependence on the dollar-dominated global banking system.

- Private cryptocurrency has been criticised for its potential to enable untraceable illegal transactions. In contrast, China‚Äôs DCEP leaves a complete account of cash transactions in the hands of the state.¬†

- Most cryptocurrencies are still exceedingly volatile in nature, which is considered a threat to the financial system; speculation as gambling etc

- There‚Äôs also speculation about crypto mining‚Äôs environmental impact and electricity usage, which doesn‚Äôt square with the China‚Äôs desire to be seen as a leader in green energy; pledging that the country will be carbon-neutral by 2060.

###So what of US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England?

Governments at the highest levels (G20) commissioned an organisation called **Financial Action Task Force (FATF)** to come up with international regulations for cryptocurrencies or as they call them virtual assets (VA) and virtual asset service providers (VASP) - **‚Äúto prevent money laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.‚Äù** They are using international law that supersede national legislation and will force every country in the world to comply - countries that refuse will be targeted with financial and political restrictions. Stated aims include:

- **Peer-to-Peer transactions:** requiring increased monitoring and restriction

- **Stablecoins:** considered a major risk because they think they are more likely to reach mass adoption.

- **Unhosted Wallets:** or private wallets (not online) requiring enhanced scrutiny and limitations.

- **KYC rules**: client Information such as the customer‚Äôs name and further identifiers such as physical address, date of birth, and national identity number or passport number.

- **Travel Rule:** applying traditional bank wire transfer requirements on crypto currency transactions; this is called the travel rule.

- **Decentralized Exchanges:** in their opinion the concept of a DEX doesn‚Äôt exist, hence those running the exchange can be held liable for implementing regulations.

- **Freezing of Assets:** Cryptos can be frozen when the holder is suspect of a crime, or as part of other investigations related to terrorist financing or otherwise unspecified ‚Äòfinancial sanctions‚Äô. Most troubling this may happen regardless of the property laws of national legal frameworks, and it will not be necessary that a person be convicted of a crime.


Their main goal is to keep crypto activity restricted to licensed and regulated service providers. A long list of ordinary crypto activities are now labeled a ‚Äúrisk.‚Äù Engaging in them will result in increased scrutiny and possible difficulties accessing the wider financial system.

###In other words their goal is not to ‚Äòban‚Äô cryptocurrencies but to centralise them - by monitoring and imposing strict restrictions and limitations on who can ‚Äòlegally‚Äô use them and how and where they can be used. In this way they will hope to maintain control over the economy.

personalfinance,Do I go with the 20 fixed or a 30 fixed?,"Here‚Äôs my situation.  I got a new job making an additional 25k a year and am moving because it‚Äôs too long a drive from where I currently live. I have a spouse who also works (more on that in a sec) and we have a 1 year old. I‚Äôm going to make about 110k on the sale of my home.    The home we are buying is 325k and I got approved solely on my income.  I have no real purpose for the funds beyond potentially investing them or using them towards the new home, though I will want to make some minor upgrades and buy new furniture, etc.  I anticipate that altogether that stuff will be about 20-25k.  

Option 1: I have been approved with a company for a 20 year at 2.5% with no PMI if I put down 20%.  The payment should be about $1,560 including escrow and will save us considerable interest over the life of the loan.  If I go with this option and end up needing the funds I can access them through a heloc pretty reliably.

Option 2: I haven‚Äôt bothered shopping/getting approved for a 30-year but my local credit union offers one at 3.25 with no PMI and 10% down, which would be ~$1,460 a month.  Doing this doesn‚Äôt change the cash flow much but it does leave an additional 32k in my pocket.

Typically I would think the 20 year was a no brainer here, but I wanted to check in and see if I had any better 30 year options (no PMI with lower interest rates or etc), and I have one other big qualm I haven‚Äôt mentioned yet.  My wife isn‚Äôt in the greatest of health and has been historically inconsistent with her work.  There‚Äôs significant potential that at some point I end up the only income in the household for stretches at a time, and when I do things will be very tight.  That 30k could pay off all our other debt and increase our cash flow by about $500 a month (she brings home maybe 2,500 a month).

personalfinance,In need of mortgage advice in NY - struggling with Chase bank,"Hi guys, I hope this is the right place to post this as the HomeLoans subreddit doesn‚Äôt allow me to post. We are having a horrible experience trying to secure a mortgage with chase bank. We are first time home buyers so I guess we aren‚Äôt as savvy as those who have been through this process before. Chase initially roped us in with a great interest rate and preapproval followed by a conditional preapproval. Our contract states that closing must happen 45 days after signing of the contract. The appraisal happened on 9/10 and then there was no communication from Chase for the next week. We figured that is normal and we would check in with our mortgage advisor at the start of last week. The advisor is unresponsive to our calls and chase‚Äôs general mortgage line informs us that they don‚Äôt even have our loan number on file. Then finally he calls us back on Tuesday night to tell us a new underwriter is working on our file and that he needs a bunch of other documents. My husband owns a startup and he now wants to see the startup‚Äôs profit and loss statements from last year because he was 26% owner of the company last year. Because this is a startup funded by venture capital, it shows the company to be at a loss last year. These guys don‚Äôt seem to care about how much money we or the company have in the bank. Furthermore my husband is no longer 26% owner but rather 22% owner this year as he fundraised and sold some of his equity to investors earlier this year yet they are still looking into his company‚Äôs finances as though he were self employed. Interestingly they drew a clear distinction between him being self employed at above 25% but no longer now that he is under 25% when it came to determining the preapproved loan amount. 

So now we are two weeks away from our closing deadline of 45 days from the signing of contract, and chase will not communicate with us whether or not we can expect this loan to go through. Our advisor is rarely reachable. For one thing I would never ever recommend anyone to seek a loan through chase given our experience, but I have also heard this is all too common. In the meantime are there any other local lenders we can start the process with who would be able to meet a closing deadline of 10/9? Is this realistic or is chase approving us our only hope now?",finance
CryptoCurrency,Do tell your kids about crypto.,"This seems like an obvious exception to the ""Don't talk about crypto"" rule. We all want our kids to do better than we did and a big part of them is giving them a good financial education.

Basic things like the dangers of high credit card interest rates, or the importance of an IRA or a 401K are never brought up. This is not something you want kids/young adults to figure it out as they go.

CryptoCurrency,"Crypto, justice and geopolitics set to collide at landmark trial of Virgil Griffith this Monday","# Crypto, justice and geopolitics set to collide at landmark trial of Virgil Griffith

*Ethan Lou: Case alleging that young American tried to help North Korea evade sanctions cuts to the heart of U.S. government's unease about crypto*

 In 2019, I went to North Korea for a cryptocurrency conference. It was unforgettable, largely because of what happened afterward: an American from that trip later ended up arrested by his country over remarks he made at the event. 

 I am talking, of course, about Virgil Griffith, the Alabama native who, at the time, headed special projects at the Ethereum Foundation. Griffith, then 36, is accused of trying to help North Korea evade economic sanctions by imparting the sacred fire of blockchain knowledge. While the defence has requested a postponement, his trial is scheduled to begin next Monday, and he faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted. 

Not surprisingly, I have been paying close attention to the case. Because of that unexpected arrest, I ended up depicting the trip in my upcoming book, *Once a Bitcoin Miner: Scandal and Turmoil in the Cryptocurrency Wild West*. And I will be watching the trial closely.

The issue at hand is not simple. The defence does not dispute that Griffith spoke at the North Korean conference. Rather, it is expected to say that he had presented only surface-level, publicly available crypto information. Having been there, I am inclined to agree. But how relevant that is in terms of getting an acquittal can be quite subjective.

In any case, my interest is not just because of my front-row seat to the events. In American terms, this trial lies at the rare intersection of Silicon Valley, New York and Washington ‚Äî the unique confluence of technology, finance and geopolitics. It marks how cryptocurrency and blockchain are increasingly blurring the borders between disparate fields, upending practices and norms long taken for granted.

The case against Griffith centres on the idea of economic sanctions. Such actions, often U.S.-led, punish targeted countries by restricting their international trade. Critics argue that sanctions do not work and that it is only the ordinary people in the targeted countries that suffer. But Iran has been forced to the negotiating table to curb its nuclear program. And Russia has an economy smaller than Canada‚Äôs, while North Korea ranks below Afghanistan. Those sanctioned countries remain hostile toward the West, but they would arguably be a greater threat if they had their full economic capabilities.

And sanctions are easy. With the U.S. dollar as the most transacted international currency, the American government exerts wide control over the infrastructure used to move it. The effort is low and so is the risk. So, such measures have been increasingly used. North Korea, accused of rampant human rights violations, was sanctioned more times in the two years of 2016 and 2017 than in the previous two decades.

Enter cryptocurrency. It is outside the traditional financial system and can be moved without centralized control. North Korea has allegedly hacked exchange platforms in South Korea, operated large-scale mining efforts and deployed ransomware attacks that demanded payment in digital coins. The totalitarian state has reportedly amassed hundreds of millions worth of cryptocurrency. To the Americans, that represents a grave threat to their favored tool of the sanction, and that‚Äôs where the justice department comes in.

There are always more laws than resources, so the latter are selectively used. San Francisco has deprioritized marijuana possession. Nearly every top prosecutor at the prestigious Southern District of New York is known for a focus: Rudy Giuliani, the mafia; Preet Bharara, Wall Street. Under the last U.S. president, the administration went hard on immigration. Griffith‚Äôs prosecution is a reflection of bigger-picture priorities.

In the press release that followed Griffith‚Äôs arrest, with respect to the sanctity of sanctions, government officials beat the message in with a stick. The then-head of the Southern District said Griffith had ‚Äújeopardized‚Äù the government‚Äôs plan to ‚Äúplace maximum pressure on North Korea‚Äôs dangerous regime.‚Äù A top agent from the Federal Bureau of Investigation said, ‚ÄúWe cannot allow anyone to evade sanctions, because the consequences ‚Ä¶ put the world at risk.‚Äù

Tellingly, the charge against Griffith isn‚Äôt necessarily that he succeeded in benefitting North Korea ‚Äî just that he tried to do so. Cryptocurrency is young, and North Korea is poor. There has been little evidence that either is yet sophisticated enough to meaningfully affect sanctions. For all North Korea‚Äôs alleged amassing of cryptocurrency, any higher-order use of it by the country is still largely theoretical. But theory is scary.

Nearly every country hostile to the West has been looking into its own digital currency, with China blazing the trail. El Salvador has adopted Bitcoin as legal tender. Dollar dominance is widely under threat, and with that, the future power of sanctions is uncertain. If and when North Korea actually uses crypto to dodge sanctions, any enforcement will be too late.

A chief pillar of justice is deterrence, to show the consequences of an act so that others do not attempt it. Regardless of whether Griffith has broken the letter of the law, he is but an unfortunate bit player caught in bigger tides, and this trial will not be the last of its kind.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Purchasing ‚ÄúPet adoption NFTs‚Äù as a vehicle to financially support local pet shelters?,"I do UX/UI design and from time to time I do the odd pro-bono job. I was approached by a local pet shelter, they want new site, one of the the goals is to enable them to collect donations as they struggle financially.

I‚Äôve been thinking about alternative ways enabling them to generate income, and‚Ä¶ hear me out - pet adoption NFTs.

How could this work?

1. We create a collection of NFTs, each for one pet in the shelter. The NFTs are jpgs of those pets, with a hidden link inside.
2. That hidden link takes the NFT owner to a text/media feed, with updates from that pet. Shenanigans in the yard, walks with volunteers, meeting a family interested in adoption, etc.
3. Once the pet is physically adopted, a last pic appears in the feed, with the person that adopts it. Perhaps, we could optionally enable that person to continue posting (if there is will on their end)
4. People trade the NFTs to support the shelter, but also check different stories of different pupers. Proceed from each sale make a buck for the shelter as well.

My question:

1. NFT people, what do you think? Up until now, I‚Äôve never bought/sold/traded an NFT - is that an interesting concept for you? What else could I do to make this more attractive to buyers?

One other problem I have is that the shelter owners are hesitant of the idea. Their understanding of NFTs is limited, and they‚Äôre also skeptical as to the time the would have to sacrifice to squeeze out content (say 1 pic a week per pet) - they‚Äôre understaffed as it is. As a test, I‚Äôve done a sort of MVP NFT, with one of their dogs and a link to its story (without the whole feed thing, which I‚Äôm working to create). I‚Äôve listed in on OpenSea (paying an extraorbitant fee of $100+ to list it, wtf!). My hope is this will sell for $100 which I could use as an argument to convince them it‚Äôs worth pursuing this. I realize $100 isn‚Äôt much in NFT monies, but both me and the shelter are based in Eastern Europe, so it goes a long way here.

personalfinance,A few nub questions related to debt,"I read the recommended reading, and have the following q's:

\- I have a ton of debt (ranging from credit card debt to private student loans to federal student loans) but I went ahead and bought stock in Pinterest some months ago (which I know was dumb, woops). I spent 500 dollars; it's worth 350 now. Should I sell it? I told myself I would hold it forever and ever, but thinking now that the money would be better used elsewhere i.e. in my emergency fund so I can be safer/more aggressive in attacking my debts.

\-I also recently discovered that the minimum payments on many of my loans don't touch the principal, so I increased all my autopayments to be enough that they would at least be making a tiny bit of progress. Was that a bad idea i.e. should I just make minimum payments on everything and just try to murder my highest interest loans?

\-I have a bunch of credit cards, many of which I've already paid off but am leaving open to help my credit score. Should I make any effort to spend a small amount of money that I would spend anyway i.e. grocery budget or whatever so that those lines remain active? Also, somewhat related, I've heard people say you should carry a balance on your cards but also pay it off every month. How long do you have to have a charge on a card for it to be considered carrying a balance, or is just using the card at all sufficient?

\-My two remaining credit cards are (1) card that has a 15 month grace period (took it out approx 3 months ago) before the APR becomes 25% or something like that, which is currently carrying a \~5k balance, and (2) a card that has a 7% APR that has just under 6k on it. My plan was to pay off the second card before the grace period on the first one ends, and then buy out the debt on the first card with the second card. Is that a good plan?

economy,Why does the FED care about stock market?,"sorry if this is a dumb question, I just can't really find an explanation

So the Fed is mandated to maximize employment, and control inflation. Where in this does it state that the FED has a duty to maintain liquidity in assets? Wouldn't the system be a lot easier to control if the fed ignored speculators, and just focused on their dual mandate?

I'm learning about cycles of QE that are supposed to be followed by cycles of QT, and how in recent decades the tightening process has been cut short because markets were reacting too poorly to it.

So why exactly have asset markets become so important to the Fed? Isn't it like a vicious cycle when they do this. Fed starts interfering with markets, propping them up, so then more investors pile in, so Fed supports them as well, and it keeps becoming a bigger and bigger problem, because you can't remove the support or it becomes more catastrophic collapse than if you never interfered in first place?

CryptoMarkets,International Bitcoin (Gold) Standard?,"# General Conclusion

&gt;Did you know how money was once backed by gold? That was called the International Gold Standard. Since Bitcoin is ""digital gold"", can we go back to the system and create an International Bitcoin Standard?

In this episode, we will uncover why Bitcoin will never play a role in the international monetary order. We do this by uncovering the various international monetary order the world has seen ‚Äî International Gold Standard, Bretton Woods, Plaza Louvre Accord.

# 1. Lessons Learnt from International Monetary Order (IMO)

We need an international monetary order to coordinate countries' monetary policy and macro-policies.How? We do that by having rules and countries must follow.At the end of the day, we need price stability and financial stability in an IMO.

# 2. Bitcoin's Role in IMO

Bitcoin has the function as a store of value due to people's believe in the price level. Yet, it is difficult to be a medium of exchange nor unit if account due to the price volatility.It will still function on a P2P level, but not on an international trade level. Because it is not meant to do so, as much as the neolibertarians would love for it to be true.

# 3. Why Bitcoin will never be part of IMO?

Bitcoin's in-code governance of monetary policy is unlike that of central banks. It does not have any nominal anchor to target price stability. So, it will be difficult for it to play a role in the IMO, and replace like the USD.Also, Bitcoin does not have a discretionary control over its monetary base (which is good!). So if we use Bitcoin like gold and have money backed by gold, it will work for a while until it stops working, like how the international gold standard failed.And because of that, other countries will not want to anchor their currencies to bitcoin. And you also do not see bitcoin anchoring the exchange rates to other countries due to the in-code governance.

## What Else You've Missed

* Rules of the game and monetary policy rules countries must abide by
* Failure of the various international monetary order
* Problems and solutions to the various orders
* What's next for international monetary order, considering that things like Facebook's Libra and stable coins exist
* Why it is important to have such coordination from an international level? Because otherwise, the casualty in this financial playing field is people like you and me!

**TLDR**:Bitcoin's automated monetary policy does not have a nominal anchor and thus does not strive for price nor financial stability. It will continue to function on a P2P level, as it was meant to be. But not on an international trade and finance level, as it was not designed to do so",cryptocurrency

financialindependence,My tax strategy as I approach the RE portion of FIRE,"I started working towards FIRE before I even knew such a thing existed.  My spouse and I have been saving at least a third of our income since the first moment we had income and now we're about 5 years from hitting our very conservative number (we want 40x)

I wanted to discuss my tax strategy with the group, hopefully as a learning exercise for those who are just starting off and also as a way to see if I'm missing anything.  

When I started working, my savings plan was pretty simple ""Max 401k, Max Roth IRA, save any other money I have in taxable accounts"" When Roth 401k became an option for me, I used it when I felt I had extra cash flow and used traditional when I needed a little more cash flow.  I didn't have any real plan for how to access my money when I retired, and now that the time is approaching I'm figuring it out.  I'm especially worried about the period of time in my 40's and 50's when Uncle Sam wants me not to touch my retirement accounts.

Anyhow, here's my situation:

* Early 40's
* ~5 years from retirement
* $600k in taxable investments
* $1.25m in traditional retirement accounts
* $850k in Roth retirement accounts
* FIRE number of $4m and $80k-$120k yearly spending target
* I'll have 2 dependents for the first handful of years of my retirement

*Ideally* I would have enough in taxable accounts to just live off of those until I hit 59.5 and can pull money from my retirement accounts without any overhead, but I don't think I'll have enough in taxable accounts, and even if I did, there are better choices for helping my money last longer via conversion to roth.  I'm also pretty fortunate that my taxable accounts have all different sorts of capital gains, so I could take out some money that's 80%+ gains, while other newer investments are only 20% gains.  So at least for a bit, I'll be able to choose how much gains I pay for a given amount of money.

Before I get to my plan, here's the tool I used from AARP to confirm numbers (I'm also using the current year's number, but obviously I'd adjust to the actual tax situation in the year I encounter it): https://www.aarp.org/money/taxes/1040_tax_calculator.html

**THE PLAN**

My plan is to just not pay taxes (legally!) for the first ~15 years of my retirement.  This has obvious advantages because money goes a lot further if you get to keep it all.  

**The Plan: Live on $100k+ a year and pay no taxes**

The calculator above is our friend, but basically I can make use of the fact that long term capital gains tax is *very* low if you have a low income combined with the high standard deduction, child tax credits and a bunch of Roth conversions to control how little tax I pay (I plan to leave the money in the Roth for the minimum 5 years, but ideally until I run out of taxable accounts or I otherwise need to access it).  For the first ~3 years while I still have two dependent children my yearly zero tax numbers look like this:

* Convert $72k from traditional to Roth IRA.
* Sell ~$100k worth of investments that have ~$39k capital gains

With standard deduction and 2 kids I will have an AGI of $111,000 and $85,900 of taxable income, $6000 in taxes and $6000 in tax credits.  Total Federal taxes due: $0.

Once my kids age out of being kids, if I want to keep paying $0 in taxes, I'm going to have to drastically cut back on my conversions.  With no kids, I lose tax credits, so I can only convert the standard deduction amount of $25,100.  But this has an amazing silver lining, since all of my taxed income would be capital gains and as long as total taxable income (after deduction) is under $80k, the long term capital gains rate is...0%!!!!  If I can't or don't want to sell $80k of capital gains worth of long term investments, I can instead increase my conversion amount by how much capital gains I don't use and only pay the 10 to 12% rate on that extra money.

So in years without dependents, I can live large on my taxable accounts, pulling $80k of long term capital gains while socking away $25,100 into my Roth.  If my $80k in capital gains results in more than I want being pulled out of long term investments, I can just go and put the rest in another taxable account, having allowed me to zero out those capital gains for no cost!

Results of this plan: $0 in taxes paid, ~$100k a year to live off of and approximately $500k moved into Roth.  This should drain my taxable accounts (unless I get really lucky) but by that point, I can take out any of my conversions tax-free (as you can for all Roth contributions, see Roth Conversion Ladder for more information, although I won't be doing a standard ladder).

**Advice for people starting out**

Having a mixture of taxable, roth and traditional is really useful, especially if you are going to retire before 59.5.  I feel like I really underfunded my taxable accounts, because that 0% capital gains hack is amazing for this period of your early retirement life.  If I could do it again, I'd probably look for a more even split, 1/3rd in each.  Of course, a lot of this depends on when you are going to retire.  If you are retiring earlier, you'll probably want more taxable accounts.  If you are retiring later, more roth/traditional accounts will be better.

I feel like I'm rambling now, so let me know what you think, if you think I've missed anything or if you have any suggestions.  Also play with that calculator, it is pretty great.

**TL;DR**: If you can control where your ""income"" comes from, you can make use of the tax law to have a pretty good income while paying $0 in taxes, unlike those schmucks still working and getting w-2s.  Also, this calculator is great for planning: https://www.aarp.org/money/taxes/1040_tax_calculator.html",finance

personalfinance,Cash for down payment during stock blackout period,"Due to some recent changes in policy at the company I work for, my wife and I are in a position to settle down quicker than anticipated, and we have identified a lot that we would like to build a home on.  The issue is that most of our net worth is tied up either in retirement accounts or company stock, and the company stock is currently in a blackout period until November, by which point I‚Äôm not sure if the lot we like will still be available.

Land is $100k and anticipated build cost is $500k-$600k, and while we have enough to cover a 20% down payment + reserves for a construction-to-permanent loan, most of this is inaccessible for another month, and our checking account only has $50k in it currently.

There is a local credit union that is offering a really good const-to-perm locked rate for both the construction (interest only payments) and 30 yr. fixed term at 2.625% for 20% down and 2.875% for anything less (down to a minimum of 5%) with very few other fees and closing costs.  I‚Äôm actually a bit surprised because their terms are significantly better than other local lenders and anything I‚Äôve read about online concerning construction lending, although they are well known around town and have good reviews, so I suppose they‚Äôre trustworthy.

It looks like we could do the 5% down no problem and save for a few months to eliminate PMI before construction is even finished, but the mortgage rate will permanently be a bit higher by 0.25%.

I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs worth it to try to find a temporary loan of some sort to reach a 20% down payment. We would need to borrow $80k-$100k for about one month, and then I would use an RSU vesting event in November to pay for some of that (since there are no capital gains taxes if I sell immediately) and sell older investments + pay capital gains taxes to cover the remainder of the loan.  But I have two concerns: 1) I don‚Äôt even know how to find a short term loan like that (if they exist or whether another loan would interfere with the financial check for the credit union loan), and 2) I‚Äôm not sure paying the capital gains taxes is even worth saving another 0.25% off of an already good mortgage rate. We likely would not be in this home for more than a decade at most, so is it really worth trying to squeeze out the lowest possible interest rate?

Another thought I had is maybe negotiating with the credit union to make a 5% down payment now and pay the remaining 15% in a few months in exchange for a rate somewhere in between, but I don‚Äôt know how amenable lenders are to ideas like that.

We‚Äôre also new to the process of building a home and are not quite sure what else is important to know that we might be missing.",finance

personalfinance,Break Apartment Lease Early to Move into House Sooner,"Hello all. I'm looking to find out if this is a good idea.

My wife and I have been saving for a house. We signed a one year lease that started April of 2021 at our current apartment complex. Since then we have been driven nuts by the constant squeaking floorboards above us. We have difficulty sleeping at night, TV is hard to watch during the day etc, due to the issues. Our neighbors above us can't really help it. It was poor construction told to us directly by maintenance at the apartment complex who said it's too expensive to fix. 

We originally intended to start looing for a house in January of 2022 (lease up April 1st 2022). But we really would rather get into a house now given the problems we experienced. Our lease dictates that if we break the lease early we give them back $1000 rent credit, pay for cleaning expenses, security deposit, and continue paying rent until they fill the place - if they do. So that means we could potentially end up paying more than if we had just moved out and not told them. Our current rent is $985 a month including water, without the credit it's about $1065. 

Do we start looking for a house now with the understanding we aren't going to find a place tomorrow? It'll still take a good amount of time. Our finances are as follows: $100k income (just my income, my wife works but we aren't counting her income into the equation because she'll be a stay at home mom one day). Target price, no more than $350k. Cash in bank $75k. Wife has $20k of student loans we haven't paid on since it went into forbearance, but we intend to pay it off in full after payments start again. We don't want to put more than 10% down to keep a good buffer of cash and because interest rates are so low. 

tldr: Our current apartment is affecting our mental health. Should we break our lease, potentially up to six months early and buy a house now?",finance

I owe $30,000 in back taxes to the IRS and state from 2016 when I was making $120,000 a year as an art director and also recently discovered that my 2017-2020 returns were rejected because I attempted (and failed) at doing it myself on Turbotax for those years, which means I realistically owe the IRS a lot more than that. 

I was then making 68k a year up until 2018 when my company closed and I was laid off. Now I only make $3500/mo as a 1099 freelancer, half of which goes towards my mortgage and the other half towards utilities, gas, food, etc. At the end of the month I barely have anything left.

I feel like I'm so screwed and don't have many other options. Between the inevitable garnishment from my back taxes and student loans (Neither which can be discharged in bankruptcy apparently) I know my financial future is grim. Competition in my line of work has become incredibly fierce (graphic design) and making more than I currently do as a remote graphic design worker is unlikely.

#Income

* $80,000/yr (of which 7%, or $5,600, is contributed to my 401k)

* $5,600/yr in company 401k matches

#Expenses

* Minimal. I'm lucky to be living rent-free at home with my parents, so virtually all of my expenses (besides loan payments) are discretionary. I really love traveling around the region and visiting friends, so one of my largest expenses for the time being is gas/tolls/eating out/drinking.

#Current Strategy

Paycheck is deposited. Pay both credit cards down to zero, then top off my checking account to $2,000. Set aside some money for an upcoming big purchase (if applicable). Leftovers get put towards loans in the following order:

Avalanche method. Skip federal loans until Feb 2022 since they are not currently accumulating any interest. That leaves the car loan as my next highest interest loan for the next few months. Once February hits, attack the 4.45+% federal loans. Once they're paid, resume focusing on the car, then the private loan. The added benefit of this order is leaving 
$7,500 in federal loans as my last loan to pay off, which leaves the door open for possible forgiveness.

Monthly Payment Total | Debt Free By | Total Interest Paid
---------------------|------------|-------------------
$921 (min) | January 2031 | $15,694
$1,200 | October 2028 | $11,593

$1,800 | April 2026 | $7,293
$2,000 | October 2025 | $6,500

Note: about 1/3 of my minimum payments is tied to each of the following: Federal student loans (collectively), private student loan, and car loan. If I wanted to reduce the total of my minimum payments, the fastest route would be to pay off the car.

#My Thoughts

I'm working with something like ~$4,600 in monthly take-home pay after accounting for taxes and 401k contributions, which leaves me with plenty of spending money even if I do pay upwards of $2,000/mo towards loans.

I just don't know if that's the best strategy. There are clearly some diminishing returns on increasing monthly payments.

Here are my overall thoughts:

* Investment returns are uncertain. The fact that I am paying interest on these balances is certain.

* Psychologically, I hate things being incomplete. I feel strongly compelled to be debt-free as fast as possible.

* The faster I rid myself of debt, the faster I rid myself of the payments that go along with having debt. I don't want to call it a zero-sum game because compounding interest makes it more complicated than that - but if my goal is to become debt-free ASAP, I can then pivot to investing at a rate higher than I could if I was still burdened with minimum payments, which could potentially make up for the fact that I wasn't investing quite as early.

* All that being said, I realize steamrolling my debt might not be the optimal strategy, if my investments were to give higher returns than the interest on the loans.

Basically, I just want to know if there's any aspects to this that I'm not currently considering, or if there's a tried and true method to optimizing this equation.",finance
personalfinance,Way out of depth on student loan repayment.,"I'll preface this post with an admission of me being a dumbass when it comes to this stuff and I probably just willfully ignored a fair amount because I'm terrified of finances. Ok, so to give some background on this complete mess:

I graduated from college in 2007. The original principle of the loan was 91k and a fixed interest rate of 7.125%. My parents took out the loan in their name and I had a separate smaller loan of 23k or so in my name. I've long since paid off the loan in my name. I've been paying my parents back every month since 2013 and the amount has increased every so often for reasons I was never fully aware of, they just said the amount per month needed to increase to help cover the loan. Currently my monthly payments to my parents are $925 since around 2018 and $650 before that. I finally asked the status of the loan (as I have to start saving for my own kids' college) and the current balance is 132k. The loan details the estimated total amount to be repaid is 278k paid off in 2043. I've paid a total of 68k to my parents and 23k to my personal loan and I'm utterly confused how I could owe so much more than the original 91k. I'm having a bit of a meltdown and I'm not sure where to get additional information as my parents are not the easiest people to deal with and I want as much information before going into a long discussion about the loan. Any insight would be insanely helpful to sort out how screwed I am. Thank you.

CryptoCurrency,Always diversify your portfolio. Having only one coin is never good idea.,"One of main rules of crypto is diversification of portfolio.  Other rules can be bend or broken from time to time, but there is no good explanation to have only one coin portfolio. Not even if you invest in BTC or ETH. Those are great and safe coins, but only maximalist have whole BTC or  whole ETH or whole "" put here other good coin""  portfolios.  You don't want to be maximalist, cause it will hurt you in long term and most maximalists sooner or later bacome fanatics, dinosaurs of crypto that miss profits. Unfortunately  I saw few people here that proudly say they have only one  coin.

Crypto market is unpredictable, I believe it is  great investment, but if you want to have big, not just average profits you still need either huge luck or good strategy. Most of us suck in having  luck, so we should have good stretegy instead. Best strategy to not miss best coins and not be hurt by some bad news  is to have diversifed portfolio. One coin can or can not grow, even if you believe it will. If you have  few coins, chances that at least one of them will grow a lot are much bigger. In last 2/3 months many coins pumped and people made great profits. I missed some of those coins, but also was correct many times. Not all my coins did grow, but it just happen, some of them are almost stable.  If I would invest in only one of them I would be frustrated for months or years. Cause I have diversifed portfolio, not all eggs in one basket, I can enjoy supporting many great projects. I believe  all my coins will succeed in long term. But even if one or two of them will not, I still will be fine. If you chose 5-10 good coins  in long term you will be in much better situation than people that chosen only one or two coins.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Low experience and worried about leaving my job for more money,"So background on me. 32 years old, 4 year degree in accounting with minor in finance with a weak resume. Mostly restaurant work with 2 seasons as a tax preparer for a retail tax service similar to HR block.

Took a temporary position in May through an agency working in indirect lending for a credit union. Applied and was offered a permanent position as a Universal banking associate. This position is sort of a hybrid teller / financial services rep that fits the new model branch banking is moving towards.

Pay sucks (40k in southern NY) but the benefits are decent. 160 hours PTO, health, dental, vision, federal holidays paid off. 401k match of 3% if I contribute 6% of my salary plus 2% of my base. Those benefits seem strictly tied to years of service and aren't negotiable as you move up within the credit union.

Other than my pay I'm happy with the job. I've met many people in my time as a temp that have chosen to build their career with the credit union and have risen to respectable positions having begun as bank tellers. The credit union is expanding and they seem to legitimately foster a culture of promoting from within and recognizing talent / competency vs a more stifling corporate culture. 

The job I'm applying for is with a boutique wealth manager. They want to bring someone in who is going to help them build an in house tax service for their clients from scratch. Estimated at about 100 clients this year. If I were hired I have been given the impression I will be highly involved in trying to build that side of the business. 

The rest of the year I would be performing the same duties as another new hire with the title of associate wealth manager. The main duties are research and helping to prepare presentations for clients.

My tax experience and knowledge are limited and I have expressed this in a previous interview and reassured that my level of experience is adequate for what they are trying to accomplish this year, and they would have me work towards getting certified as an EA.

The pay expectation is between 50-60k, with the pay being able to reach as high as 80k after I receive my EA credential, and benefits are currently unknown.

My biggest concern is this is a small firm of less than 10 employees. My big fear is that despite their assurances that I don't live up to expectations and I burn my opportunity with the credit union by leaving for a new job in my training period. 

If the wealth management firm makes me an offer with comparable benefits and a significant pay bump would it be crazy of me to turn it down and take a slower but potentially more stable route by trying to build my career with the credit union?",finance
CryptoCurrency,Why Stablecoin Regulation or Banning Doesn‚Äôt Matter...,"It is important to have a complete picture of stablecoins and their continued innovation to understand why regulation will have no effect and not change what is inevitably going to happen, a complete replacement of centralized fiat currency.

We‚Äôll cover the uses of stablecoins, legacy banking (business model and asset erosion), how stablecoins work, the advantages and disadvantages of the different stablecoin solutions, how money is made with stablecoins, why they are the target of regulation and what does an unstoppable, regulation-proof stablecoin look like.

**How are Stablecoins Used?**

Cross-border payments occur in smaller, closed financial networks requiring middlemen to facilitate these transactions. These middlemen have made cross-border payments expensive, slow and restrictive. McKinsey &amp; Company estimates that the financial system generates $2T annually from these payments. Ridiculous.

Cross-border payments are made fast, easy and considerably less expensive than legacy banking systems by using stablecoins.

With stablecoins, you can ‚Äústay in crypto‚Äù without having to go into a fiat currency to store value. This saves time, cost and keeps you in full control of your money because you are no longer in the banking system, while maintaining price stability.

Leverage: Crypto-collateralized stablecoins can be used to increase your position in a particular cryptocurrency. If you own ETH, you can ‚Äúmint‚Äù a stablecoin by pledging ETH as collateral to mint a stablecoin. With that stablecoin, you can now buy more ETH to mint more stablecoin and so on. This is a technique to leverage your crypto position.

This yield farming concept became popular in the summer of 2020 when crypto traders and stakers were accelerating their returns in staking pools by leveraging up their position (to then stake in proof of stake and liquidity pools).

**Legacy Banking:** **Middlemen And The Money Printer**

The entire legacy banking system is built on fees and interest on money they don‚Äôt own. Many think that banks accept deposits to lend it back to you at a higher rate. There is more going on here. Banks take your deposits and use that as their reserve requirement so that they can borrow many times that amount from the federal reserve bank. Then, that capital is used for lending to yield much higher returns (because they leveraged up their lending capacity). It is ALL inflation. Meanwhile, you get sub 1% on your deposits.

30-40% of all the U.S. dollars in existence today were printed out of thin air in a 12-month period.  If the USD was a cryptocurrency, it might be one of the worse ones.  With this and the talk of stablecoin regulation, stablecoins backed by the USD may not be so ‚Äústable‚Äù in the future.

With the ‚Äúbail in‚Äù laws passed by the Obama administration, depositors can have their capital seized if their bank fails. This law puts depositors first in line to cover any insolvencies a failed bank will have.

It is unfair and dishonest that you may have to pay for a banker‚Äôs risk taking and not get the benefit from the endless inflation of fiat currency that is printed out of thin air.

Yields in cryptocurrency are quickly eroding at the asset base (reserves they can use to borrow from the fed) of traditional banks. Consumers are moving to much higher yielding cryptocurrency staking to earn transaction fees in liquidity pools and rewards/interest for staking to validate blockchain transactions (Ex. Proof Of Stake Blockchain Consensus).

**Types Of Stablecoins And How They Work**

Understanding stablecoin innovation as the race to decentralization continues:

**1. Centralized and Physically Asset-Backed.**

Stablecoins like Tether and Paxos Gold physically back their cryptocurrency with USD and physical gold, respectively. You buy these on the open market or supply the physical collateral/USD for these protocols to ‚Äúmint‚Äù new stablecoin. This is a great way to store value. However, centralized systems require faith that 1 Tether actually returns 1 USD when you redeem. Tether has come under scrutiny with claims that there is not actually a 1:1 Tether/USD ratio. Furthermore, systems like this are easily shut down by banks or regulators. Physical asset-backed stablecoins provide an attractive alternative to invest in the cryptocurrency market, while giving you exposure to another asset like gold.

**2. Crypto-Collateralized.**

The stablecoin market, then, evolved to take a step to further decentralization. Stablecoins like MakeDAO use ETH-based cryptocurrencies as collateral to mint their stablecoin. With systems like this, you are not relying on a centralized authority or entity to ‚Äúback‚Äù the stablecoin. It is only you pledging collateral to a smart contract which is public proof that it exists as collateral on the blockchain. This gives you certainty that the system truly has underlying value that can‚Äôt be taken away or falsified (like the Tether accusations).  However, in times of market volatility, your collateral can be liquidated if the ‚Äúloan to value‚Äù ratio breaks a threshold.

**3. Algorithmic**

Purely algorithmic stablecoins rely on market forces and smart contract software rules to maintain the price of the dollar or whatever asset they are tracking. Terra Luna is a 2-token system (utility token and stablecoin) that allows you to burn one of the tokens to mint the other in times of stablecoin price instability. For example, if the price of TerraUSD is above the dollar, you can burn the utility token for TerraUSD at the exchange rate at the price it should be.  Then, you can sell for a profit helping to bring the price back down of 1 TerraUSD equal to 1 USD. Incentivizing the market keeps the stablecoin at the price it should be. Purely algorithmic stablecoins have no underlying collateral.  If market forces fail or there are issues with the software code, there is no recourse to get your money back.

**How do you make money with stablecoins?**

There are two ways:

**Leverage and Trading. Staking.**

**1. Leverage and Trading**

Cryptocurrency traders use crypto-backed stablecoins to leverage up their position in a particular crypto as described in the MakeDAO example.  This accelerates returns if the price goes their way. If not, liquidation and loss can happen quickly during market downturns.

Stablecoins provide a ‚Äúneutral‚Äù position for crypto traders so they can capture profits and be ready for the next trade.

**2. Staking**

Staking involves locking up your fiat-backed stablecoins where you will earn interest or rewards. The most well-known staking is in proof of stake blockchain protocols where you earn part of the transaction fees of the network. You could also stake in a decentralized lending platform like AAVE to earn interest or stake in a liquidity pool in a decentralized exchange like UniSwap.  In UniSwap, you earn transaction fees for providing liquidity to traders of that decentralized exchange.

**A Regulation Target**

Let‚Äôs face it. Regulation of crypto is all about trying to maintain control and the threat to the US Dollar World Reserve Currency status. The US government would lose the ability to print money out of thin air for political control and to loan/donate to countries for ‚Äúfavors‚Äù and decisions that could potentially benefit the US.

Crypto makes it more difficult to track transactions and people. This is not acceptable to the US government. Biden recently began tracking all USD bank accounts with more than $600, a complete violation of the 4th amendment and many other things.

The ‚Äúinfrastructure bill‚Äù has provisions where everyone in crypto is a broker and subject to KYC compliance. How can a blockchain developer track who is using software that has been released to the world and has a life of its own (the nature of decentralization)?

Stablecoins are the target because they remove the need to go back into fiat, where KYC and tracking can occur. Stablecoins are also widely used. SEC Chairman Gensler said **‚Äúthat roughly 75% of all crypto trades involve some kind of stablecoin‚Äù**.

For the first time in history, we have a technology that has the potential to change the relationship between man and government. This change is in favor of the individual so governments are fighting it.

**Effects of Regulation Overreach**

1. Innovation moves to countries that embrace the change. If the USA regulations go too far, it will cripple the chances of continued financial dominance and move it to other countries. The economic impact of the convergence of a multitude of technological platforms is going to have a 20X+ the impact of the Internet. (Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Energy Storage and Genome Sequencing) No country can afford to push innovation in this areas to other countries.
2. Blockchain protocol creators go dark and release anonymous projects.
3. Blockchain systems will move further to decentralization and be impossible to be captured.

**What does decentralized finance mean in this context?**

Since a stablecoin is a cryptocurrency in the government‚Äôs crosshairs, decentralization is crucial.  It means that every aspect of the protocol cannot be influenced, seized or shut down by any government, bank or organization. Every part of a defi protocol needs to be capture proof. This makes it a safer choice for many people who want to keep their money safe from governmental interference and manipulation.

**The process of decentralization**

This is not easy, but it can be achieved by using distributed ledger technology. This is the technology that is used to record transaction history and information on many computers or ‚Äúnodes‚Äù at once.  When all nodes are updated with the same information, this data cannot be changed or falsified.

This allows for a defi stablecoin to be fully transparent, unchangeable and accessible to all users. As you can imagine, this will be an excellent choice for anyone who wants to keep their money safe but also remain anonymous.

Despite the progress in defi, a vast majority if not all blockchain dApps (decentralized apps) are not fully decentralized. Website servers, domains and server access to blockchains, like Infura for ETH blockchain access, are still centralized and can be captured. Case in point is when UniSwap delisted all stablecoins from its ‚Äúdecentralized exchange‚Äù front end at the potential threat of the SEC regulating stablecoins and investigating UniSwap. Liquidity pools for these stablecoins plummeted even though they are decentralized on the blockchain. The front-end access is not.

Protocols like the Internet Computer and Cartesi have solutions to decentralize front servers and cloud computing. However, the crypto industry has yet to take the final step.

**TLDR:  A regulation proof stablecoin**

To be truly decentralized, a regulation proof stablecoin needs to be both crypto-collaterallized and algorithmic. It cannot have any single entity in the process like what we see in all of the physically asset or USD-backed centralized systems. Having the stablecoin backed by other cryptocurrencies gives faith in the system that there is underlying value that can be redeemed at any time without centralization. Also, it must be algorithmic to provide further price stability. This is the best possible combination of stablecoin capabilities that exists in the market.

All of the processes must occur in the smart contract on the blockchain making it unchangeable and visible to everyone. Front end website, website server and blockchain access also must be decentralized with multiple, capture proof access points.

Furthermore, a stablecoin cannot be pegged to a fiat currency price since most will just be inflated into oblivion. Tracking the price of a physical asset, like precious metals, is a much better store of value.

Philosophically, the creation of currency should be decentralized rather than a single entity controlling the money supply for a nation. Since the best currencies have an underlying asset, the collateral owner should be the one earning the interest.

stocks,"Dallas Fed President Kaplan to retire early on Oct. 8, citing trading disclosure ‚Äòdistraction‚Äô","https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/27/dallas-fed-president-kaplan-to-retire-early-on-oct-8-citing-trading-disclosure-distraction.html

Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan became the second regional central bank leader to resign Monday, saying he was stepping down early following a recent controversy over stock market trades he made. Kaplan‚Äôs early retirement follows an announcement earlier in the day from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who said he will leave as well but cited health concerns and not the issue over his investment portfolio activity. ‚ÄúThe Federal Reserve is approaching a critical point in our economic recovery as it deliberates the future path of monetary policy. Unfortunately, the recent focus on my financial disclosure risks becoming a distraction to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs execution of that vital work,‚Äù Kaplan said in a statement.

His retirement takes effect Oct. 8. The resignations come a day before Fed Chair Jerome Powell is to spend two days on Capitol Hill updating legislators on the Fed‚Äôs efforts to combat the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Controversy had swirled over the issue following disclosures that Kaplan in particular had been executing large-dollar trades in big-name companies such as Amazon, Apple and Delta Airlines. The Wall Street Journal first reported the trades. Subsequent to the disclosures, both Kaplan and Rosengren said they would be selling their stocks to avoid the appearance of conflict. Questions were raised because the Fed has conducted trillions of dollars in asset purchases aimed at helping markets function, and has bought corporate bonds from mega-cap companies including Apple.

Kaplan insisted he had done nothing wrong. ‚ÄúDuring my tenure, I have adhered to all Federal Reserve ethical standards and policies,‚Äù he said in his monthly statement. ‚ÄúMy securities investing activities and disclosures met Bank compliance rules and standards.‚Äù Still, the issue has reverberated through the Fed, with officials pledging to tighten rules so that such potential conflicts don‚Äôt happen again. ‚ÄúWe need to make changes, and we‚Äôre going to do that as a consequence of this,‚Äù Powell said last week. ‚ÄúThis will be a thorough going and comprehensive review. We‚Äôre going to gather all the facts and look at ways to further tighten our rules and standards.‚Äù Powell vowed that changes would be made. ‚ÄúI want to be able to look back on this years from now and know that we rose to meet this challenge and handled the situation well and that what we did made a lot of sense and protected the public‚Äôs interest and the institution that we‚Äôre all a part of,‚Äù he said. Powell on Monday wished Kaplan well and praised his work at the Dallas Fed. ‚ÄúHe has been a passionate and forceful public voice on a wide range of issues, including the critical value of early childhood education and literacy,‚Äù the chairman said in a statement. Meredith Black, the first vice president at the Dallas Fed who herself was planning on retiring, will serve as interim head for the district until a permanent successor is chosen.",finance

Bitcoin,"I am a time traveler from the future, here to tell you to please keep going.","I am sending this message from the year 2089. Things have never been so good in all of human history, and some of you will still be here to see it.

If you don‚Äôt believe me, I don‚Äôt have the time to try to convince you, sorry.

I know you are all busy building, and I don‚Äôt want to waste your time, so I‚Äôll simply explain what happened.

On average, every year, the value of a bitcoin continued to grow at an over 250% annualized return, that is, of course, until hyperbitcoinization began in earnest. Arguably, hyperbitcoinization began with the genesis block, but when the US government started printing trillions of dollars during the old pandemic of 2019, the world, en masse, began to lose faith in their unit of account, the US dollar.

The largest demographic in the US, the Baby Boomers, began retiring. They held most of their wealth in their homes and retirement accounts (mostly equities), and as they watched the financial markets and real estate pump and dump continuously, due to money printing and government handouts, tempered by schizophrenic fiscal policy, they realized there would eventually be no demand for their overpriced homes and Amazon stock (I‚Äôm not sure what this company did, but I‚Äôve read about it being very large), and started to cash out.

This, coupled with small countries beginning to adopt Bitcoin as currency, led the way to broader de-dollarization. China, for a few years, attempted a digital Yuan, but a civil war ended their dream by destabilizing CBDC rollout, all the while debtor countries in the Chinese Belt and Road initiative realized they could simply convert their treasuries to Bitcoin, and clear their debts in the weakened Yuan currency after a year or two, thus securing their financial freedom.

Back in the US, all hell broke loose when Vanguard, Fidelity and Schwab  started metering retirement account redemptions. I don‚Äôt want to oversimplify those years, but scams abounded and confusion was the norm. Many lost their life savings while others 500x-ed what they had by buying Bitcoin as soon as possible. In all, it became clear when the dust had settled, that the digital scarcity of Bitcoin was the enforceable unit of account.

One famous couple, whose son had been telling them to buy Bitcoin since 2020, lost everything in their retirement accounts. That is, until one Thanksgiving when he logged into the long forgotten Swan website and realized their auto DCA of $50 a week had been running continuously for the last 10 years. They quickly bought a plane ticket and moved to a Bitcoin Citadel community for their remaining years.

‚ÄúWhat is a Citadel?‚Äù you might wonder.

The concept started as a term of art to describe a hard money response to the fiat world pre-BItcoin. Today you probably think of the ‚Äòfiat world‚Äô when you see over-processed foods, low quality imported products designed with planned obsolescence, or hyper bureaucratic organizations that seem to produce little. Those things are alien to us in my time, I‚Äôve only read about them, but I believe you‚Äôll understand what I mean when I mention them. The Citadel concept has become a cornerstone of Bitcoin and most people in my era see the concept of a Citadel as one of the following:

1. The Personal Bitcoin Citadel: This is the high standard of personal care and sovereignty that Bitcoiners (everyone nowadays) hold themselves to. It includes working out, eating clean foods, maintaining healthy relationships, and working on emotional and spiritual betterment. With Bitcoin as a standard, people started to realize that they were extremely capable of taking care of themselves and dove in headfirst. The Personal Citadel movement extended outside of the self to the immediate family, one‚Äôs home, and one‚Äôs work/schooling environment. People became empowered by the responsibility of earning and holding their own wealth and developed a culture of protecting it while respecting what others had.
2. The Bitcoin Citadel Community: These developed as both free and paid communities dedicated to both member improvement and extending the social mission of Bitcoin. Some organizations operated like what you would, in your time, call a ‚Äòmeetup group‚Äô, focused on particular skill development, self refinement or community issues, other organizations developed like what you would call ‚Äòinvestment clubs‚Äô. After hyperbitcoinization many Bitcoiners, now extremely wealthy, dedicated their lives to allocating capital to the building of a refined hard money world. These groups operated on principles of non-aggression, decentralization, permissionless-ness and opting-in. Sometimes they were meant to generate income and other times they were pure donations. The best example I can use is when I once read about the great capitalists of the 20th century, who often spent the latter halves of their lives giving away what they had earned. You may know Max Keiser and Michael Saylor, these two men, upon becoming some of the wealthiest individuals to have ever¬†existed, spent their later years in campaigns to bring self sovereignty, energy independence and universal education to the world. They are the reason every country on Earth now has both fully funded trade, liberal arts, and research institutions.
3. The Physical Citadel Community: During and immediately after hyperbitcoinization, the building of physical citadels became extremely popular for early adopters seeking to ‚Äòride out‚Äô the volatility and confusion that abounded. Some individuals lived in mountain homes with abundant security, some on tropical islands they purchased, and others simply bought entire city blocks and retrofitted them to become entirely self-sufficient. Many of the later adopters of Bitcoin initially hated these citadel builders, seeing them as elitists or isolationists, but as hyperbitcoinization completed, most came to understand that physical citadels were meant as protective and self-sustaining structures, and were never used to offensively harm or attack anyone. What‚Äôs more, many of these citadels, post hyperbitcoinization began operating on an ‚Äòopen door‚Äô policy to provide shelter, food and health care to both average citizens looking for something to eat for lunch or somewhere to stay on a road trip, as well as the few impoverished who still struggle in our day and age.

Initially governments tried to fight hyperbitcoinization by ostracizing early Bitcoiners and maligning them as dissidents or radicals. The Federal Reserve printed tens of trillions of dollars and distributed them widely, thinking that they could turn the average person away from Bitcoin. This provoked serious inflation and this plan backfired egregiously when the federal government shot and killed 25 peaceful protesters who had assembled in front of the White House to advocate for banking the underbanked in America‚Äôs major cities with Bitcoin. After this event, it became clear to nearly everyone that they could not stand for a government that enacted violence on those trying to improve the lives of others.

As more and more individuals opted out, government receipts faltered. The US, flush with cash but lacking any purchasing power, capitulated and announced they were buying Bitcoin. This announcement, combined with the flood of Baby Boomers retiring and smaller countries opting for a Bitcoin Standard is still seen today as the moment Bitcoin had won a peaceful revolution.

After governments realized they could not defeat Bitcoin as a network, they became obsessed with energy production and chip manufacturing as a way to participate in the network. Geopolitical advantage went to the country who was able to produce massive amounts of energy at a low cost and with low environmental impact. Natural gas and oil consumption are non-existent in my day and age. Some people still drive around in vintage internal combustion vehicles, but that is seen as an expensive hobby because oil is so difficult to find. Today we use various forms of fission and fusion reactors to power everything from our homes and devices, to our cities, planes and ships . Our chips are 100,000 times faster than your fastest quantum computers and fit in handheld devices that never require charging.

What you might call my ‚Äòcellphone‚Äô, the device I keep with me most often for communication, work and play, is running a full bitcoin node and mining bitcoin! It only generates three to six Sats a month. I chose this model, one of the most expensive in the market, because of the more powerful 350 tera-hash mining computer inside of it. It won‚Äôt pay for itself and is nowhere near as advanced as the 100,000 tera-hash units some of the larger energy companies have, but it is nice to have a few Sats a month to get lunch or go on a coffee date with.

Even the most staunch talking heads against Bitcoin capitulated when they saw what was happening in Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. With the introduction of a hard money standard and near limitless energy and computing power available to all, slavery and government tyranny disappeared entirely as the demand for goods produced on these continents for ‚Äòfiat‚Äô products dried up. These locations in particular flourished immensely as their people were able to utilize their skills and resources at home, own their own wealth and labor, and keep the rewards nearby. Service markets that used to rely on geo-arbitrage like design, programming, marketing strategy or website building, became more equitable when everyone was transacting in a shared currency and governments around the world had to compete for citizens. Some later scholars interpreted this as a global redistribution of wealth, while others saw it as the major social turning, when governments across the world started to think of their citizens as customers to be served and not taxpayers to be audited.

You might wonder, what is our plan now? To say we live in a utopia is incomplete. Some individuals have attempted to use their newfound wealth to create militias, take over lands, or attack and rule over others. But, these types of attacks work less and less as the years go on and Bitcoin becomes more and more decentralized.  As countries themselves fight mainly to innovate, they fight less and less to dominate. They focus more on serving their citizens and protecting fundamental rights. This has led to a mass de-radicalization of politics and media as businesses and governments insist on maintaining peace, otherwise their citizens will simply leave for a better country.

Of course, in some sense hyper-bitcoinization is not yet complete, but we are living in a far more just and peaceful world because of what you created in the early 2000s.

This is also the reason I contacted you.

Keep going. What you see now as a vision becomes a reality. I don‚Äôt know how to explain to you that it was all worth it, you won, and the human race itself has become something better for your work. I can‚Äôt imagine the difficulties that you have gone through, and the ones you are about to go through.

However, I have seen where it leads.

CryptoCurrency,A rising interest rate environment is uncharted territory for cryptocurrency.,"This is not a prediction, more of an observation and looking to discuss.

Since 2008 the federal reserve and governments around the world have supressed interest rates and  provided accomadative monetary policy such as bond buying. 

Bitcoin and cryptocurrency only came about after this environment was created. Some might even say that Bitcoin was a result of the great financial crisis.

So with the most recent FOMC meeting, the world got a road map to tapering of asset purchases (should be done mid next year), which will likely see interest rates rise in the subsequent months.

This monetary policy was the result of economic calamity and as the federal reserve was preparing to raise rates, the pandemic started and put the money printer into over drive. In order to incur this debt the interest rates remained low. Low interest rate environments encourage borrowing, building, growth, and consumption...at least in theory.

So given the above, and the fact that crypto hasn't seen an environment of rising rates, not really, how do you think the market would react? 

Seems uncharted territory and certainly going to be fascinating.",cryptocurrency

investing,The Great Market Wheeze is almost upon us,"I don't expect this to be super popular but I want to make it as a record to say I called it. 

The good times are almost up. 

Here's a long wall of text, don't apologise for it, no TLDR. Don't expect anyone to read this anyway.

--- **Everything depends on treasury bonds and inflation** ---

Don't look at the S&amp;P as a PE ratio, but as a yield, so it's 1:1 with bonds. For example the S&amp;P 500 has a 34.75 PE - in earnings yield 2.9% a year. The ratio between treasuries and the S&amp;P 500 is called BEER (bond equity earnings yield ratio). 

Currently a 10 year US treasury yields 1.4% and S&amp;P 2.9%. The yield on a treasury can't exceed stocks in the long run, who would buy stocks if they could do better in risk free bonds. S&amp;P comes with risk premium due to downturns. 

Treasury yield are near all-time lows due to a number of factors including COVID and the fed printing $120b/month to buy securities. Low treasury yields make S&amp;P look more attractive, driving up the price and down the yield. 2.9% is better then 1.4%.

This relationship between treasuries, inflation and stock yields determines *everything.*

Money supply has expanded rapidly due to massive printing. M1 massively, M2 slightly so far. As the velocity of money increases with reopening it guarantees M2 expansion.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL

Wages are up, commodity prices are up which in conjunction with massive money printing *guarantees* inflation will at the very least run hotter then it was pre-2020 for an extended period of time. How hot... who knows? In 2019 it was 1.8%, so at a minimum we're looking at 2%, probably higher. Not hyper-inflation but hotter then before. This is a certainty. 

--- **The debt burden** ---

The government funds itself with treasuries and so the yield it has to pay is a major deal. The US has $29t in debt, at a 1.4% yield that's $400b/year in interest payments. Manageable. At 14%, as it was in the 80s, that's $4t a year, almost as much as the entire yearly $6.5t budget. Unmanageable. 

This massive debt expansion gives very little room for the fed to manoeuvre, which makes it very predictable. The fed *cannot* allow inflation run too hot as it would bankrupt America. 

Given a choice between crashing the market and inflation it will crash the market. It does not have the option to do anything else, it cannot let yields rise significantly. 

--- **So what does this mean for stocks?** ---

Remember: Inflation rate &lt; Treasury yields &lt; S&amp;P yields

PE ratios going up over last 30 years is not the result of investors randomly deciding stocks are worth more. It's the result of low inflation, therefore low treasury yields, therefore low S&amp;P yields, therefore PE going up, therefore stocks going up. 

The US economy in real terms has been barely growing, a couple percent a year at best, the massive bull run over the last decade is not a sign of economic prosperity, it's almost purely multiple expansion. We're at one end of the pendulum and now it has to swing back.  

Inflation guaranteed to go up = treasury yields guaranteed to go up = S&amp;P yield guaranteed to go up (PE ratio going down). 

The yield on a treasury can't trail inflation significantly and historically has sat above inflation. There are less buyers for something guaranteed to lose purchasing power every year. 

That means if inflation sits at 2.5% we're looking at treasury yields at a minimum of 3-4%. Which means S&amp;P yield (currently 2.9%) has to sit up around 5-6%. This would involve the S&amp;P losing *half* its value from relatively small absolute changes to inflation. 

Even the fed estimates inflation to be 4% in 2021 and 2% going forward which will be the absolute best case scenario. 2% inflation would still cause at least a 20% drop in stocks, probably much more.

--- **Conclusion** ---

Inflation running hotter is a mathematic certainty. Treasury yields going up is a mathematic certainty. S&amp;P PE ratio (and therefore stock price) coming down is a mathematic certainty. 

The fed can choose to either fight inflation and crash the market, or let inflation run free and support the market. It will mostly choose the former, however we will see a bit of both. Inflation will run hotter then expected and stocks will fall.

The market won't crash all at once bar some unforeseeable event, this won't happen overnight, it will gradually wheeze down as treasury yields adjust to the asset purchase taper and inflation ticking up. I am naming the upcoming event **""The Great Wheeze""** and I expect everybody to call it this.

The underlying economy will keep ticking along relatively normal as before, so barely growing in real terms, but stocks will spend years in decline as treasury yields rise. People will recommend 60/40 stock/bond portfolios again. If you are looking to work in investment banks ask to join the bond division. 

I predict this will start within 12 months, probably accelerate early-mid next year and continue. 

--- **Is there a way to make money from this?** ---

The problem with everything bubbles is there's less opportunity. Almost everyone is going to take a hit.

Diversify away from US stocks, invest in low PE foreign markets with high underlying growth to counteract PE compression. Economies that aren't to dependant on exporting to the US is best. We're at the cusp of a new era in investment that will be defined by international markets. Commodity and defensive value stocks with decent dividends are probably solid.

The other option is to hedge with 20-40% of your portfolio. Hedge against treasury yields going up (hello Burry) and the market going down. Goofy valuation stocks will fall the most. The problem is the market can stay irrational for extended periods of time.

Holding cash is ok, but inflation will start to eat into its purchasing power. There's not going to be a sudden dip and then rebound, it will wheeze out for years, as it's not caused by some temporary recoverable event like COVID or the GFC, it's caused by the economic equivalent of gravity.  

The other option is markets don't collapse in uniform. Typically there's a cascade of collapse that starts at fringe markets and heads inwards towards the core. If you're holding stocks pre-collapse, selling them and buying in sectors that have already collapsed is another play.

Best of luck fellas, catch you on the other side.",finance

Banking,Help! Wire transfer stuck in federal review.,"I‚Äôm hoping someone can share their experience. 

We purchased a house and wired money to the title company for cash to close. It‚Äôs been one week of waiting and initiating a trace and we‚Äôve found out it‚Äôs in federal review currently. We are getting legal pressure from the seller to get them their money ASAP, but our bank is telling us we just have to wait. 

Questions:
1. If this happened to you- how long did it take for the money to push through to the receiving bank?

2. If we reverse the wire now, should we actually get the money back in 3-5 days?

Update: in hopes this can help someone else in the same situation. 

We got a lawyer involved and conferenced called in with the sending bank. It was a 30 min call in which our lawyer essentially highlighted legal ramifications of the delay (they sounded intimidated) which made them push this to top priority. Within 1.5 hours of the call our wire had been cleared and pushed through to the receiving bank. 

What I would have done had I known now: wire transfers should happen immediately, the moment something is wrong with the wire don‚Äôt assume it will get sorted out on its own. Take action and get a lawyer involved sooner.

When a security consolidates at a high, the odds are that it will break out and reach higher highs.

Who actually sees any additional upside exceeding its March '21 ATH? The Fed's timeline is already set: It is scheduled to begin tapering asset purchases and raising benchmark interest rates beginning as early as mid '22, early '23. 

Is the Russell going to trade within this range or break out to new highs until then? It's likely going to remain rangebound. 

The charade of supporting markets at the expense of everything else will continue as long as possible. The probability the Fed delays these plans is quite high, since it‚Äôs predicated on maximum employment and stable prices (symetric 2% inflation), and we are a long way from maximum employment.

I'm currently trying to cut back my monthly costs, and was considering trading my current vehicle in on another. I currently have a 2015 Ford Explorer Limited with about 110000 miles on it, but the unfortunate part is that I am upside down in it from negative equity from my past vehicle. I pay 366 a month with about a 5% interest rate and I owe about 18000 give or take a few hundred. My trade in on KBB says about 13-14k, and Carvana offered me about 12.2k.

I've been wanting to decrease my monthly payment and get a vehicle with better MPG but still looks decent with some nicer features. Currently, I'm looking at a 2014 Volkswagen Jetta GSI that is listed for about 12k with 97k miles on it. I've been doing a few calculations, and if I can get 13k in trade on my Ford, I could lower my monthly payment to around 300 a month hopefully, while getting better gas mileage.

I've been debating on whether this would be worth it, and in the pros and cons I have:

Pros -Lower monthly noteBetter MPG, therefore lower costs on fuelPotentially lower insurance costs (Not sure on that one, but I figured it would considering the new vehicle would cost less than my current one)

Cons-Would be adding negative equity again (Potentially about 5k)Starting over on loan

personalfinance,25 year old looking for some direction on my current financial status and goals!,"Hello. I‚Äôm looking for a bit of guidance on my current financial situation. I‚Äôve read the prime directive and have a bit of experience in budgeting, investing, etc. but I could use some advice on where I currently stand.
 
So, me: I‚Äôm a 25 year old male in the Philly burbs, living at my dad‚Äôs house with my girlfriend of 4 years. It‚Äôs just us 3 in the house. It‚Äôs a decent living arrangement with no rent or utilities, but I‚Äôm getting to the point where I‚Äôm about ready to move out. I have a very rough goal of buying a house next year. I will settle for an apartment temporarily if it‚Äôs best, but either way I‚Äôll be 26 next spring and it‚Äôs getting time to take the next step in my life.
 
I work two jobs, one main full time office type job and one weekend bartending gig. Both are stable but the hours are nuts, comes out to 10-12 hour shifts 6 days a week (fall is busiest, I‚Äôm working 12 hour shifts 7 days a week until thanksgiving). Income can vary as I work hourly and for tips. I expect to finish this year making $85k-$90k total. That is working 3,000 hours in the year. Shout out time and a half.
 
Assets: Drive a 2013 VW Passat that is totally paid off that I purchased. It has 90k miles on it, I‚Äôll have this car at least 2-3 more years if not longer. I like it enough and it‚Äôs still in half decent shape.
I have a 401k through work that I just started contributing to, has $3,000 in it right now. I also have $27,000 in stocks and index funds. Another $52,000 in cash. This I need to do something with.
 
Debts: $25,000 in federal student loans at 4.5%. $35,000 in parent plus student loans at 7.8%. That‚Äôs it, I have no credit card debt (do have credit history from loans and my discover card that I pay monthly, score is 753)
 
Expenses: I pay for my student loans, gas, groceries, gym, health insurance, and a few media services. That‚Äôs it, my parents cover things like car insurance and phone bill. Right now, even with going out sometimes, I spend about $1,200 a month. I will probably take on ALL my expenses next year. I know that‚Äôs not super specific, but it‚Äôs something I need to consider and account for. And my loans are the biggest expense at $550 a month between them both.
 
I am considering setting up a Roth IRA and throwing in $6k. Also, I know I should have an emergency fund no matter what I buy. I have not necessarily prioritized because I know if it comes to it for a bad or desperate situation, my dad will help me out. This is not my mentality to lean on that help forever, but if it frees up $10k to accelerate my goals then I can forgo that set aside emergency fund for now.
 
My plan: I‚Äôm considering making the $35k loan go away when interest resumes at the end of the year, and then continue to save through the year in hopes of having $40k-$50k left to buy a house going into 2022. I will probably have to spend $400k on a house in my area, which is where I want to be. Also, I can split the house with my girlfriend. Without going into all her specifics, she makes a little more than me but has a little more debt too. Assume she is good to match whatever housing costs I put up.
 
Am I close to buying a house or am I further than I think? What should I be doing differently? What suggestions would you have for me on handling the money I have? Happy to answer any questions you may have.",finance
CryptoCurrency,"IF THE RICH ARE NOT PAYING TAXES, NEITHER SHOULD YOU. This is how you can reduce your taxes with your crypto profits.","See if You Qualify for an Earned Income Tax Credit

Even if you aren't required to pay federal income taxes, you could get a refund from the government. The earned income tax credit is a refundable tax credit of up to $6,660 for tax year 2020.

The EITC is calculated with a formula that takes into consideration income and family size. The income limits for the credit range from $15,820 for single taxpayers with no children to $56,844 for married couples filing jointly who have three or more children.

The current federal income tax brackets range from 10% to 37%, but you can get away with paying less in taxes if you're smart about claiming deductions and credits.

However, there are still a number of ways for wage earners to lower their tax liability.

Tax credits and deductions¬†change regularly though, and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated some popular deductions and limited others.

Use Your Side Hustle to Claim Business Deductions

Self-employed individuals (full time or part time) are eligible for¬†scores of tax deductions. That means your freelance projects or side gig as a ride-share driver could land you considerable tax savings.

A few of the business deductions available include business-related vehicle mileage, shipping, advertising, website fees, percentage of home internet charges used for business, professional publications, dues, memberships, business-related travel, office supplies and any expenses incurred to run your business. If you pay for your own health, dental or long-term care insurance, those premiums may be deductible too.


Claim a Home Office Deduction

If you work for yourself or have a side business, don't be afraid to take the¬†home office deduction.

To qualify for the deduction, the space must be used regularly and exclusively for business purposes. For instance, if an extra bedroom is used exclusively as a home office and it constitutes one-fifth of your apartment's living space, you can deduct one-fifth of rent and utility fees.

Write Off Business Travel Expenses, Even While on Vacation

Combine a vacation with a business trip, and you could reduce vacation costs by deducting the percent of the expenses spent for business purposes. This could include airfare and part of your hotel bill, proportionate to the time spent on business activities. Talk to a tax professional about how to make this calculation correctly.

Deduct Half of Your Self-Employment Taxes

The government assesses a 15.3% Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax on all earnings to pay for the Social Security and Medicare programs.

While employers split the cost with their workers, self-employed individuals are responsible for paying the entire amount themselves. To compensate for the extra expense, the government will let you deduct 50% of the amount paid from your income taxes. You don't even need to itemize to claim this tax deduction.

Get a Credit for Higher Education

The government offers valuable¬†tax credits to offset the cost of higher education. The American opportunity tax credit can be claimed for the first four years of college and provides a maximum credit of $2,500 per student per year.

Since it's a credit, that amount is deducted from whatever tax you might owe the government. If it exceeds the amount of taxes you owe, up to $1,000 may be refundable to you.

Meanwhile, the lifetime learning credit is great for adults boosting their education and training. This credit is worth up to $2,000 per year and helps pay for college and educational expenses that improve your job skills.

See if You Qualify for an Earned Income Tax Credit

Even if you aren't required to pay federal income taxes, you could get a refund from the government. The earned income tax credit is a refundable tax credit of up to $6,660 for tax year 2020.

The EITC is calculated with a formula that takes into consideration income and family size. The income limits for the credit range from $15,820 for single taxpayers with no children to $56,844 for married couples filing jointly who have three or more children.

Itemize State Sales Tax

Taxpayers who itemize their deductions can include either their state income tax or state sales tax on their Schedule A form. The state sales tax break is a great option if you live in a state without income taxes.

The federal tax deduction for state and local taxes is capped at $10,000 from all sources.

Deduct Private Mortgage Insurance Premiums

If you have less than 20% equity in your home, chances are you pay private mortgage insurance. This coverage is required by lenders as a way to protect them in the event you stop making payments.

Until 2017, taxpayers could deduct the cost of private mortgage insurance on their itemized deductions.

While the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated the deduction, it was reinstated at the end of 2019 and is available for the 2020 tax year. It was made retroactive for 2018 as well. 

Make Charitable Donations

Charitable contributions made with payroll deductions, checks, cash and donations of goods and clothing are all deductible. These deductions add up and are often overlooked.

You generally need to itemize to claim a deduction, and since the 2017 tax reform nearly doubled the standard deduction, many people¬†choose not to itemize. However, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, allows taxpayers who don't itemize to deduct cash donations of up to $300 made before Dec. 31, 2020.

Adjust Your Basis for Capital Gains Tax

Investors: When calculating the cost basis after selling a financial asset, make sure to add in all of the reinvested dividends. That increases the cost basis and reduces your capital gain when you sell the investment.

If you sell your house, you may end up paying capital gains tax as well, particularly if your property's value has risen significantly.

Single taxpayers can¬†exempt up to $250,000 of their home's appreciation¬†from capital gains tax while married couples get a $500,000 exemption. The IRS only allows the exemption to be claimed once every two years.

However, you can reduce how much you owe if you've made home renovations or improvements.

Avoid Capital Gains Tax by Donating Stock

Another way to avoid capital gains is by using stocks to make charitable gifts.

Money moved into a donor-advised fund is not only exempt from capital gains tax but can also be deducted by those who itemize. Donor-advised funds can be started with as little as $5,000.

CryptoCurrency,Cryptocurrency expert pleads guilty to conspiring to help North Korea dodge sanctions.,"A cryptocurrency connoisseur admitted Monday that he conspired to coach North Korea on how to evade economic sanctions by using the popular financial technology to conceal illegal transactions.

A U.S. citizen, pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Manhattan to a count of conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a charge for which he could face up to two decades in prison. Griffith, who is scheduled to be sentenced in January, made a name for himself as a developer of Ethereum, a digital money purchasing platform.

Federal prosecutors say Griffith actively assisted North Korea in efforts to use cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to conceal its activities, including at the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference held in April 2019.

The State Department denied Griffith permission to travel to the conference, but he went anyway, traveling to Pyongyang via China, according to court documents filed at the time of his arrest.

At the event, he was a presenter and took part in discussions about how to help North Korea ‚Äî a closely watched U.S. adversary ‚Äî launder cash and get around commerce restrictions imposed on the country by Washington. Such restrictions have been in place since 2008, amid heightened concerns that North Korea was a national security threat.

Members of the North Korean government attended the conference, according to prosecutors.

Griffith was arrested in November 2019 after he allegedly devised a plan to help North Korea skirt sanctions by facilitating cryptocurrency transactions with South Korea. Through blockchains, cryptocurrency holders can conceal their identities, a source of frustration for law enforcement officials angling to stay ahead of the quickly evolving field.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Federal Reserve Corruption. Why is no one talking about this?,"If you don't know what I'm talking about, here's a brief summary. 

After the 2008 financial crisis (caused by corrupt bankers), the U.S. Govt stepped in and started this thing called ""Quantitative Easing"". This basically means to print money by several means to support the economy rather than let it heal naturally. 

In the spring on 2020, The Fed responded to the Covid Lockdown economic crisis by turning QE to turbo drive. 

The Feds bought stocks, bonds, corporate debt etc. They bought a lot of it. [About 4 trillion $USD since March 2020](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm)

About a month ago, it was discovered that Fed Presidents, Robert S Kaplan and Eric S. Rosengren among many others were buying assets with QE funny money that these individuals owned personally, hence pumping their own bags. [Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/17/fed-officials-owned-securities-it-was-buying-during-pandemic-raising-more-questions-about-conflicts.html)

Since then they announced that they would sell all their holdings to avoid any further conflict of interest [Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-09/fed-s-kaplan-rosengren-to-sell-all-stocks-amid-ethics-concerns)

Note the date they started selling was September 7th. The literal top of the S&amp;P500, after pumping their bags over 100% from the covid crash bottom. How fucking convenient.

Now one of the Fed Presidents caught is conveniently retiring 9 months earlier than planned citing health concerns [Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/27/eric-rosengren-boston-fed/)

Not so much as a slap on the wrist. Just get away with blatant corruption and walk away with all the money.

To dive deeper into this issue. The QE does nothing but raise U.S. debt and prop up assets to valuations that are bubble territory. The U.S. has already hit its debt ceiling and if you didn't know stocks have been dropping due to the looming economic doom if they don't raise the ceiling. We have till Oct 18th to do so. I assume this means a rocky road for stocks, crypto till we have resolution [Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/28/congress-must-raise-the-debt-limit-by-oct-18-yellen-warns.html)

**TL;DR:**: Feds pumped their bags, got caught, sold the top and are walking away scot-free. To add to this nonsense, the QE used has made us hit our debt ceiling which needs to be increased or we default. To take it one step further the current administration is trying to pass $3.5 Trillion using money printing in further stimulus when we're already at our debt limit.",cryptocurrency

solar,Solar off-set - Is my analysis correct?,"Solar Masters of Reddit!

Please check my math/logic

We want to install a small system to off-set our annual electrical usage.  We now own three EVs (yeah?) and installing an entire system to support this is cost prohibitive and we just don‚Äôt have the roof real estate.  Plus, we anticipate our usage declining as kids grow and move on (one of them has an EV).  So, we don‚Äôt want to oversize/over spend on the system.

In our research, Tesla appears to be the lowest cost (significantly) and their ‚Äòsmall‚Äô 4.25 kW system (10 panels) fits into the space on our roof we want to install.  The roof faces southwest and there is nothing blocking it.

We live in Colorado in the US (lots of sunny days) and our current electric provider is Xcel Energy.  Today, we pay .149 cents per kWh (fully loaded‚Ä¶tax, fees, etc.)

Here‚Äôs where I need help/confirmation:

I believe the 4.25 KW system would offset $633.25 / year in energy cost
My math is 4250 * .149 = $633.25
Cost of the 4.25 kW system AFTER federal tax incentive would be $6321
So, if I take $6321 and divide it by $633.25, I get a ROI of 9.98 years (10 years)

Further, if I assume that I only get 80% efficiency, this reduces my annual off-set to $506.60 (assume I‚Äôm off-setting 3.4 kW), I get a ROI of 12.47 years (12.5 years).

My questions:

Is my math correct?

Does a 10-12 year ROI for Solar make sense? 

Is my assumption of 80% efficiency fair?  What ROI do you see?

I suspect many of you are going to tell me that my energy costs are exceptionally low.  :-)

personalfinance,Should I pay extra toward my mortgage principal,"I'm in a position where I can afford to pay extra toward my mortgage (I could easily double my mortgage payment every month). I'm not great with finances tbh, so I'm wondering if this is a smart decision? Or is there something else I should be doing with the additional income?

I've already maxed out contributions on my 401k and have a healthy amount of savings (I could easily support myself and my wife for over a year just on savings without changing our lifestyle).

Should I contribute additional income to my mortgage? Should I contribute to an IRA? Should I invest in stocks? I guess I'm just looking for some general advice! TIA

personalfinance,Should I replace my old credit cards?,"Hey everyone, 

So I currently have several credit cards that I applied for years ago when I had crappy credit (620 range). Obviously the interest rates on these cards are terrible but I've managed them successfully (100% on time payments, never carrying a balance month to month) and my credit score has skyrocketed to the high 700s. 

Now I'm starting to wonder if I should replace these old cards with new cards that have better interest rates and more perks like cash back. My concern is that one of these cards are the oldest account that I hold (8 years) and that I'm hoping to apply for a mortgage in about 6 months so I don't want to do anything that will mess up my credit before then. 

Any suggestions? If i do get a new card, which cards should I look into?",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, Sept 28, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, September 28, 2021**

Stocks sank today, as technology stocks plummeted, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) having its worst day since March as investors nervously eye a swift rise in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, a disappointing consumer confidence report, and power shortages in China that threaten the global supply chain as the busy Christmas season approaches, along with the evolving Evergrande situation. 

Market participants continue to diest development coming out of Washington.  Congress members continue to race in order to pass legislation to fund the government until next year and prevent the government from defaulting and shutting down. This comes amid a backdrop of ongoing debates surrounding the bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure deal. Last night, Republicans refused to pass a bill to avert a government shutdown and raise or suspend the debt limit to prevent the US from defaulting on its debts. Unfortunately, something that is fairly routine (the debt ceiling has been raised 80 times since 1960 and three times under President Trump, with the latest suspension in 2019) has become a headline with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stating that he would not provide the Republican votes necessary.

https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-congress-government-funding-e7bfe8a6ffdb40a8d33e17ef11ded7a7

The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose to 1.54% at the time of writing, the highest level since June. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks, like technology, the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunities to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. While higher yields are generally seen as a bet on a strengthening economic environment, it does make it more expensive to borrow capital, which weighs heavily on growth stocks, which are valued heavily based on future earnings projections.

Chris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG Group, said ‚Äúthe prospect of higher energy prices, fueling inflation, and rises in bond yields appear to be pre-empting tighter monetary policy by central banks, have prompted widespread selling across global stock markets. Like yesterday, it is the highly-valued growth stocks that have taken the brunt of the selling, as investors fret that a lower growth, tighter policy environment will hurt these previous star performers.‚Äù 

According to a report by the Conference Board, a non-profit business research organization, US consumer confidence fell to a seven-month low amid the surge in coronavirus Delta variant cases (which are finally starting to fall again), supply chain issues, and a slowdown in growth rates moving forward. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped to a reading of 109.3 this month from 115.2 in August, the third straight monthly decline. Lynne Franco, Senior Director of Economic Indicators at the Conference Board said, ‚ÄúThese back-to-back declines suggest consumers have grown more cautious and are likely to curtail spending going forward‚Äù.

In other news,  a series of power cuts and even blackouts across eastern China, where most of the population lives as demand threatens to outstrip the country‚Äôs electrical supply, adding a new threat to the already slowing economy and likely further snarling already disrupted global supply chains ahead of the busy Christmas season. This can already be seen in the sky-high charter rates for container ships, which have risen 10 out of the last 13 days and have more than quadrupled since the beginning of the pandemic.

[https://www.tradewindsnews.com/bulkers/capesize-bulker-rates-remain-tight-amid-supply-demand-tension/2-1-1073904](https://www.tradewindsnews.com/bulkers/capesize-bulker-rates-remain-tight-amid-supply-demand-tension/2-1-1073904)

There are several reasons why electricity is in short supply. As more regions in the world reopen from pandemic-induced lockdowns, demand has skyrocketed, forcing already electricity-hungry companies to use more power. Export demand for aluminum, steel, and concrete, three of the most energy-intensive products, has been very strong domestically and abroad. Moreover, as electricity demand rises, it has pushed the price of coal, which is the main way China generates electricity, higher.

* U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said Tuesday the Chinese government is blocking its domestic airlines from buying ""tens of billions of dollars"" in airplanes. Raimondo said in remarks after a speech in Washington that China is not abiding by commitments to buy U.S. goods it made in 2020 as part of a trade deal. ""I don't know if Boeing is here...

personalfinance,ELI5 Help - Tax Questions for dividend investing,"Please excuse the stupid question here. I'm sorry if I'm breaking the rule with this post and I will remove it if I am.  


Would someone explain to me the difference between ROC (Return of Capital) vs Capital Gains Tax? (I'm in California)

Based on this article: [https://www.fool.com/research/capital-gains-tax-rates/](https://www.fool.com/research/capital-gains-tax-rates/)

Example for question

Works full time: 55k per year. Based on this website: (for California), [https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-paycheck-calculator#sd72y2Dcze](https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-paycheck-calculator#sd72y2Dcze)

\[Filing Single\] For 55k Salary in California, I'll pay 25.14% in taxes - I'm not sure if this matters for filing taxes for dividend but I am including this regular salary as the only income in this example.

&amp;#x200B;

I googled around for ""capital gains tax"" and I found this: [https://www.fool.com/research/capital-gains-tax-rates/](https://www.fool.com/research/capital-gains-tax-rates/)

Scrolled to the bottom for the California rates - Does this chart add up my regular salary income + any capital gains from stocks?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Example: Please let me know if i'm NOT understanding this correctly

Salary: 55k

Stock income (capital gains? Is every gain from stocks capital gains? except those ROC?): $1000 (Example in this scenario where $1,000 dividend payments were received and reinvested through this same year)

Does this mean that I am looking for the tax bracket of $55,000 + $1,000 (from dividends) = $56k?

&amp;#x200B;

According to the ""California Income and capital gains tax rates"" (Single), I would fall into the 8% tax rate. I don't get what this 8% is. According to the few things I've googled and mentioned above, It stated that at 55k annual salary (not including stock gains per year, just purely salary at $55k) in California, I would be paying 

Federal Income: 12.83%

State Income: 3.67%

Social Security: 6.20%

Medicare: 1.45%

State Disability Insurance Tax: 1%

Which all equals to the mentioned 25.14% for the annual salary of $55k. So my question is where and how does the 8% capital gains fit into this? I got stuck here.

&amp;#x200B;

Also what is the difference between capital gains tax and ROC? Why does everyone hate ROC (Return of Capital)?  


Please let me know if i'm not asking the right questions here and if there are other questions I should be researching when thinking about taxes.

personalfinance,Is selling my home to build an efficient one worth it?,"TLDR;
Selling our house and building a new house seems like it would save us $500 a month in utilities and fees, worth it or a pipe dream?

We bought some land and want to build a super efficient passive house on it. An architect firm quoted us a ballpark of 400k for the design and building of the new home. The new home would be solar electric with well and septic, so we wouldn‚Äôt have utility payments‚Ä¶ or at least they would be minimal. 

At our current property, our monthly utilities come to $500/mo including hoa fees. We still owe 200k on our home, but can probably sell for $500k in the current market. 

At first glance, it looks like if we built, we would come out ahead because we would save $500/mo in bills and our mortgage would be roughly the same but with a lower interest rate.

Does it seem like a good move to do it now, or wait until we pay off our current home?",finance

CryptoCurrency,USA government SHUTDOWN in a couple days. Crypto holders be CAUTIOUS.,"U.S. Senate Republicans for a second day in a row blocked a bid by President Joe Biden's Democrats to head off a potentially crippling U.S. credit default, as partisan tensions rattled an economy recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.

With federal government funding due to expire on Thursday and borrowing authority set to run out around Oct. 18, Democrats who narrowly control the Senate and House of Representatives are working to head off twin fiscal disasters while also trying to advance Biden's ambitious legislative agenda.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has insisted that Democrats use a parliamentary maneuver to temporarily lift the government's $28.4 trillion debt limit without Republican votes, although Democrats note that about $5 trillion of the nation's debt is the result of tax cuts and spending passed during Republican Donald Trump's presidency.

CryptoCurrency,Deeper Look Into Gov Debt Ceiling &amp; Why Its Broken,"TDLR: The gov lives off a credit card and everytime they max it out they just increase the spending limit after a quick 2 week vacation.

&amp;#x200B;

So with all the news of the gov running out of money and needing to raise their debt ceiling lets look at how this works.

The USA federal government is currently about $28 TRILLION in debt, the current debt ceiling is $28.4 trillion. About $6 trillion of this debt is due do the last 2 years because of COVID. Theres been a lot of news going on about the government running out of money in early October.

So whats in store for us when they run out? Well this has happened before and in reality its nothing to worry about. There will be a lot of panic and stories on the news about debt default and total economic collapse. We will hear about federal workers not getting paid such as cops, fireman etc. Places like Vietnam memorial closing down and so on.

This creates a lot of panic and drama so that when they come out and say its okay we ""fixed it"" we see them as heroes. In reality all they did was just raise the debt ceiling, and we will have the same issue in another few years.

&amp;#x200B;

Now lets analyze how its broken by comparing this to an everyday worker.

Imagine you used your credit card for every purchase. You have no savings, or cash in your bank account just a credit card. Every time you max the credit card you would panic and worry on what to do, then you just call the bank and they ALWAYS raise your limit. So then you just go back to spending more and only pay the min payment. The amount never gets smaller it only goes up. Best part is that your mom is the bank thats why she will always increase your limit.

This is how the gov has been operating, yes there more to dig in with the technicalities like how debt being 1.3-1.5x the GDP is okay and so on. But in the end the government keeps spending more and more without any penalties. They tell us to have 6 months in savings, work hard, not eat avocado toast. Yet the gov knows nothing of efficient spending, like the $400 billion F35 project. They will just keep increase this ceiling and life will go on.

EDIT: Forgot to mention they do have the option to default on all the debt. However the chance of this happening is very close to 0 since it will cause a catastrophe. So if the news or whoever says that they are just spreading panic",cryptocurrency

Is all of this debt worth it? I‚Äôve been seriously considering stopping college after the AA (at least for a little while) and see highest paying job I could get. The college debt really scares me. Honestly all I want is to make a decent living, but a house in my mid 20s, and start a family.

TL;DR - College debt really scares me. Is it worth it to continue?",finance
personalfinance,What to do with 50k when you have so many loans and needing a second car?,"First post here
Income: 6k after but after my taxes and Mortgage I am left with 4k for my living needs. I currently about to close my refinance and will start in December with the payments. I have a 394k loan amount with a 2.65% interest rate plus escrow for 30 years and has PMI of 40 dollars a month.
I have a student loan that will start next year using REPAYE plan with public loan forgiveness (8 years left)

I have 50k in the bank but I do not know what to do with it. Should I pay off my mortgage? Buy a car? Something else?

Can I afford a 40-60k car? I currently own a 2013 chevy cruze with 100k mile on it. Paid in full and no problem with the car. Both the wife and I work from home and she has expressesed that she wants a car for her own. She is willing to settle for 2019 chevy malibu used with 50k milage on it from carmax for 20k. My perspective is to get her a brand new 2022 car and pay more since this car that she is interested in does not have a warranty. Thoughts? This is more of a want than a need. I can wait several months bit eventually will have to buy a car.

P.s. I max out my 403b every year. Goal to not invest more than what I am already doing.

Edit: since people are not noticing my last line. I already invest about 3k a month in an Roth and 401k.    I get 6k after those investments every month in which 2k goes to mortgage",finance

stocks,Why is nobody talking about Regeneron REGN?,"Full disclosure I do own a little over 30 shares of this plus several call options expiring in January, but that's because I honestly think this is one of the best and most under appreciated companies on the market.

Some high level facts:

They're killing it on their ROE which is especially impressive considering how little debt the they have.

Their core drugs Eyelea and Dupixent have been growing sales non stop and are on track to to keep growing profits.

They have no less then 9 drugs in phase 3 trials.  Think about how much extra business that will drive in the near future.

The PE is the lowest it's been in a long time - as of today under 11.

PLUS

They just got a nearly 3 billion dollar federal contract for their covid mono clonal antibody treatment which   is the 2nd they've received this year.  Covid doesn't seem to be going anywhere and the world health organization just recommended this treatment which means there's probably even more potential for this on the horizon. 


Granted there's systemic market risk but I just don't see too much downside to this.  I increased my shares yesterday and I think this a winner.

Let me know what you all think!",finance
personalfinance,IBKR vs. Fidelity,"I've become very interested with InteractiveBrokers (IBKR) recently. All my retirement accounts are with Fidelity - two of them are workplace accounts and I seem to have no choice in this matter (it's either Fidelity, TIAA, Voya, or AIG). One is a rollover IRA which I assume I can move and then there's a cash account. This would essentially split my equity net worth into half but the IBKR account offers margin rates as low as 1.13% for the corresponding balance at the Fidelity which offers the best rate (one million) of 4%.   I've never traded on margin but this sounds very tempting to strike while the iron is hot in terms of low rates.   My situation is that over 20 years I'm obtaining a CAGR of \~20% and that to me seems like a 2% interest rate or lower would be totally worth expanding my ability on margin.

Has anyone else made this kind of a switch, from a major provider that is well known to IBKR which I only heard about a couple of months ago?

I signed up for the free trial account on the web and it seems very buggy - I think I verified my email but it's unclear if it is just taking long to arrive or if the email that did arrive is the right one. Maybe I need to try their exclusive software...",finance

I did a careful analysis online and determined that I have already had enough taxes taken out of my paycheck to cover my Federal Tax Obligation for 2021.  Yes, I could keep the current level of tax withholding and have a HUGE tax refund in April 2022.  But I would prefer to have a greatly reduced or no federal tax withholding from my paycheck for the rest of the year.  Why lend the Federal Government money for the next six months?

They say I should update my W4 Tax Form and send it to payroll.  But the new 2020 version of that form is confusing.  Unlike previous years I can't just list a high number of exemptions.  Instead, exemptions are only for children or other dependents.  I have no dependents.

I look at the W4 Form and see nowhere I can indicate I want to greatly reduce my Federal Tax Withholding.  Maybe Step 4 Section B of the form but that seems to be for people for are not using the Standard Deduction.  (I am using the Standard Deduction).  Step 4 Section B, asks for a $ amount.  What figure would I put in there to basically eliminate my withholding for the rest of the year? If in fact, that is the place to use.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Reminder: Don't invest any money you cannot afford to lose. If the worst case scenario happens, you won't feel helpless and you will still have money to DCA and recover your losses.","Especially at an uncertain stage of the market. You should never listen to shill celebrities and put all your eggs in one basket. Yes Crypto is solid, but the truth is, to most investors Crypto is still called a ""speculative asset"" and the from the moment you invest your money to it, you should always be ready to lose a big chunk of your money at a moment's notice.

This is not to say that Crypto can't make you rich at a moment's notice either. But the fact is, Crypto is still extremely volatile. You should never borrow a large sum of money, or put your life savings entirely into Crypto. Always invest what you are comfortable being risky with. You can also just simply stake your fiat on Crypto exchanges for interest rates upto 2000x higher than banks. Trust me, there is much less anxiety when you know you were going to lose that money anyway if the worst case happens.

It makes me disappointed to see a lot of people being just salty or commenting nonsense about Crypto after any dip or a bear market. I for myself will never complain even if I lost 100% of my money. I've invested into Crypto knowing that it is an extremely volatile market. And I'm ready to lose it all on a moment's notice. This has so far paid off for me. After a -52% crash in May, and again in June with a -30% crash, It didn't bother me a bit. I actually had money left to DCA, which actually puts me +85% as I'm writing this. If I went all in, I would still be down.

TLDR: Don't risk your entire life away, it's not worth it. Invest modestly, so even when the worst case scenario happens, you have spare to live, and to recover losses through DCAing. It also gives you much less anxiety. The only person liable for your financial decisions is you at the end of the day.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,What are crypto banks and how do they work?,"So before analyzing whether crypto banks are good or bad. Let us first understand what crypto banks are and how they work. 

**Crypto banks:** 

Crypto banking is a process of providing and managing various digital currencies services by any financial firm or organization. These services can include holding a balance, making payments, and even earning interest

Crypto banking is a banking institution that allows users to avail all digital-money services such as deposit, withdrawal, lending, saving, borrowing, and investment in a wide range of markets. 

**How does it work?** 

Generally, crypto banking is similar to traditional banking. Instead of fiat currency, cryptos are used for transactions. 

There will be no intermediary involvement so as a  result high interest rates are reduced. 

If the transaction should be in cryptos, he should share his public keys to initiate the transaction. So this will be the transactional workflow of any crypto banking.

Smart Contract takes care of the process and this is secured &amp; reduces high-interest rates. These smart contracts automate all financial transactions in a matter of minutes which reduces long time duration for any loans and lendings.

So this is how the crypto banks work better than traditional banks.

**The future of crypto banking:** 

Both blockchain &amp; cryptocurrency are on their way to disrupt all the existing systems. So this will eventually increase the adaptation of crypto-related implementations and innovations in the near future. 

Thus the coming digital economy will adapt and globally accept crypto banking for its features such as easy, safe, fast, and transparent financial and banking services.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Looking for a low(er) risk way to get rid of my fiat,"A while back (still mid pandemic here) I wanted to go deposit some money and change some things for my bank account. So I went to my local bank to do so. But qhen I arrived there, the friendly teller shooed me away because the bank I went to was not my account holder so they coulsnt help me.

The problem is though the I am a student who goes to the big city to study for a whole week and only comes home in the weekends BUT the bank osnt open in the weekends. And if I were to change my account holder to that one in the big city it would take quite a while. So I cant deposit any money, great. Eventually I give the money to my parents and let them deposit to me (lets go p2p bank) but Im still left with the foul stench of time wasted. 

So I get to thinking, wouldnt it be great if I could choose whatever the fuck I want, hence my question. 

How can I ditch all my fiat into an crypto wallet and still use it. For instance: right now I am transferring part of my bank account to celsius to get a better interest rate for a savings account, but thats (for obvious security reasons) in hodl mode ao I cant use that on a daily basis. 

I have been thinking about those crypto debit cards but I dont trust credit card rates and dont understand them. 

So Im left wondering if there are stablecoin banks which offer low(er) fees for withdrawing/depositing money on a daily/weekly basis with a possibility to pay for common products like groceries. Because most stores dont really do well with crypto buying/selling. 

Id really love to hear your 2cents about my problem, any advice (or criticism) is appreciated in advance because like most people I dont actually know alot about the crypto space even though I try to sound interesting.

CryptoCurrency,"Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, and their relationship with the US Dollar Currency Index (DXY)","If any of you follow Benjamin Cowen on YouTube (highly, highly recommend if you don't already), you may have seen his most recent video on Bitcoin and the impact of the valuation of the U.S. dollar on the price of the crypto. [Link to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg-OmJnXyHI&amp;ab_channel=BenjaminCowen). I thought the topic was extremely interesting and wanted to share this with the sub.

While Ben explains everything a hell of a lot better than I'd be able to, I'll give a quick rundown for those unable to or don't feel like watching the video.... 

* [The U.S. Dollar Index \(DXY\)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy) measures the value of the dollar compared to key foreign currencies (i.e. if the index drops a bunch the dollar is losing value, and if it goes up the dollar is gaining value). 

* Based on what has historically happened, when the U.S. Dollar Index decreases, cryptocurrency (and stocks) tends to rise, and when the USD gains in value, crypto doesn't do quite as well.

* This has played out especially notably in 2017.... DXY shows a steady 10% decrease of the dollar pretty much throughout the whole year. Meanwhile, crypto had one of its best years!

* More recently, the DXY was grinding to 3 year lows in November-December of 2020. In this period, BTC went from roughly 16k to 30k, starting an enormous bull run leading into 2021.

* By the end of June, DXY rebounds a little, and has a particularly good September (up 2 points). Crypto had a little pump end of July but overall June-September has been not great for us. Especially September, while the dollar has been steadily climbing. 

What does this mean? Well, if the dollar keeps performing well in the short term (currently holding support, just put in a local high), we're likely to keep crabbing. But when the dollar starts to go back down, we're likely to see some gains. 

This is particularly interesting considering the unfolding economic situation in the United States, with the federal gov't potentially [running out of money](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/28/economy/debt-ceiling-deadline-yellen/index.html) on October 18th. I'm getting way out of my wheelhouse here (correct me if I'm wrong), but the solution to this partly involves printing more money, and thus devaluing the dollar. Food for thought.

To clarify, this is not guaranteed and is just based on historical data. Nothing is certain. Also keep in mind that none of us are experts and any breaking news/info about the USD is probably already accurately priced into the selling point of the coin. 

TL;DR - the US Dollar Index ([DXY](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy)) is a decent benchmark to follow. When the dollar loses value, it's good for crypto. When the dollar does well, it's bad for crypto... At least HISTORICALLY.",cryptocurrency

Title speaks for itself, I recently downloaded authy on my desktop to better safe-guard myself against any potential mishaps happening with my phone where I currently have authy, all fine and dandy.

So I didn't really do much more regarding this secondary authy app and just let it sit.

Initially I didn't really care about this since I had my phone and authy was working on it, so everything was fine.

**Fuck up nr.2: Phone is destroyed**

So yeah, title speaks for itself again. I lost my phone into the sink and everything got properly fucked from that point onward. I didn't have my functioning 2FA anymore, which meant.. all my crypto was inaccessible! \*Panic mode initiated\*

I had to start scrambling to contact my respective wallet / account companies / projects to try and regain control of my accounts. 

Luckily, and I say this with every meaning of the word, the majority of my holdings was in a CeFI-company (centralized finance) which meant that almost all my crypto was recovered after resetting my 2FA by contacting them \*phew\*. So in this ONE instance, centralization was a good thing for me personally. But only this one time.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I still lost a good chunk of my crypto which will never be recovered and is now locked-up in a wallet for good. The coldest of cold wallets, a dead one.

So don't do what I did, here is my advice to my future self:

*  Write down your passwords on multiple locations, preferrably on a rock tablet.
* Try and make the password memorable so that you don't need a piece of paper to remember it (mine was too complicated to memorize)
* Set up two 2FA accounts today while you still can!! 
* When setting up 2FA initially save the QR-code somewhere safe so that you can access the account at a later date with a new device without having the initial 2FA (I didn't do this, sadly...).

personalfinance,Few questions about buying a NEW car regarding price and interest rates.,"I know it's the worst time to buy a car but I need one.  I can't wait any longer.

1. Is there any wiggle room on price or do I get what I get and don't get upset?
2. Since this would be a 2022 vehicle, should I assume the dealership will have best interest rates or is it worth it to try a few large banks and local credit unions?  If online rates are potentially better, where can I look?

dogecoin,Today we are proud to announce the rebooting of the Dogeparty platform! Dogeparty is a smart contract built on top of the Dogecoin (DOGE) network for minting tokens and NFTs.,"https://dogeparty.net/dogeparty-platform-announcement

Today we are proud to announce the rebooting of the Dogeparty platform! Dogeparty is a smart contract built on top of the Dogecoin (DOGE) network for minting tokens and NFTs.  It was initially launched in August/September 2014.

**What is Dogeparty?**

In January 2014, the Counterparty smart contract (counterparty.io) was released which allowed anyone to mint tokens on Bitcoin (BTC).  However, as the months went by, Counterparty users became increasingly concerned that the fees on Bitcoin (~ $1 to $2 at the time) would make token applications unworkable.  As a result of this bitcoin fee crisis, the Counterparty smart contract was forked and deployed on the Dogecoin blockchain in August 2014 and renamed to Dogeparty.  After almost 2 years, and with the crypto bear market in full swing, Dogeparty was slowly abandoned and nodes began shutting down, due to lack of funds to support and maintain the platform, until the last Dogeparty transaction was sent December 2016.

Now in 2021, the year of the NFT, several seasoned Counterparty developers have resurrected Dogeparty and upgraded the smart contract to use the latest version of Counterparty federated node software rewired for Doge compatibility.  Dogeparty allows the Dogecoin community to tap into memetic potential of NFTs minted directly on Dogecoin.

This current version of Dogeparty will also implement a Proof of Bern (as opposed to a Proof of Burn) to create additional supply of XDP, the native token of Dogeparty.  Unlike a proof of burn, berned funds are not destroyed but sent to a community fund to resurrect Dogeparty and help ensure its future survival. 

The Dogeparty Bern Period will begin on October 1st, 2021 (block #3,919,346) and run for approximately 60 days, concluding on December 1st, 2021 (block #4,007,186). During the bern period, users will be able to bern DOGE at a ratio of 10:1, where berning 10 DOGE will get you at least 1 XDP token. There is also a 50% bern bonus which will be awarded to people who bern earlier. This bonus gets a little bit lower with each block that passes, by the end of the bern the bern ratio will be exactly 10:1 XDP.

personalfinance,Need Help: Creating a Plan to Mathematically Pay Off Student Loans,"Hey everyone. I tried my best to search the internet but couldn't find exactly the scenario I am trying to formulate.   
Quick background info. I have multiple students loans with varying interest rates and balances. I am currently on the income driver repayment plan. I would like to pay down the loans as quickly as possible and saving the most money. 

I found the avalanche method but I feel it may not be the best way to save on interest. 

Example: 

Loan 1 has 5.84% APR and $20,727.59 balance resulting in about $100 of interest accrued each month.

Loan 2 has 7.9% APR and $11,519.88 balance resulting in about $75 of interest accrued each month. 

Loan 3 has 5.84% APR and $12,466.28 balance resulting in about $60 of interest accrued each month.

The avalanche method says to pay off Loan 2 first and then 1 then 3, however, the amount of interest being paid is more on Loan 1. 

Should I pay down Loan 1 to match the interest of Loan 2 then pay Loan 2 down? Then what? 

I hope my question makes sense, thanks for the help!",finance

personalfinance,Need someone to poke some holes in this life/retirement strategy,"So I've recently been thinking about a potential strategy for long term living, up to and into retirement.  It's based off of some stuff I'd read a little while ago on Reddit, though certainly it is different in some functional ways.  Since context definitely matters, I'm 37 and Canadian.  I've read a little bit to suggest that an RRSP can be used to secure a LOC, but I haven't called any banks to validate this assumption.

In a nutshell:

* Two investment accounts, one an RRSP and the other unregistered.  Two, because RRSPs have contribution limits of 18% of income which I'll clearly run into, but RRSPs offer income tax deferral which is advantageous.  The contribution is also tax deductible, allowing for additional investment of tax return.
* Secure a low interest line of credit against each investment account.  Alternatively if the bank will secure one LOC against both investment accounts, then one LOC.
* **All** income gets deposited into the equity accounts, maxing out the RRSP limits first before rolling over to the unregistered when I run out of contribution room
* **All** expenses get withdrawn from the secured LOC.  This includes interest-only payments for the LOCs, mortgage payments, everything.
* The LOCs are intended to grow alongside the equity accounts, not to be paid down until it's time to flatten out the RRSP due to old age.

I've run the numbers again and again, and it seems too good to be true.  Which means I'm overlooking something.

I'm finding that because of the variance in rates (estimating a long term average of 6% market return, and a 2.5% loan interest rate which is on par with my current HELOC), the investment accounts invariably grow WAY faster than the debt does, leading to scenarios where even just 5 years down the road I'm sitting on a pile of money well in excess of the attached debt.  The longer it goes, the better the outlook gets.

Long term, 6% market return seems reasonable.  Short term losses are of course bound to happen, but my regular contributions are enough to offset my regular cost of living, and unless I get hammered hard for years, I cannot see it reaching a point where the bank is going to try and call the debt due to being overdrawn.

Likewise, even when I double the bank's interest rate to 5%, I find I'm still able to remain viable, though certainly that cuts into my gains considerably.",finance

personalfinance,How common is it to claim exemption from withholding on your W4?,"Honestly I don't remember running into this in my past jobs and I have been employed for years. I assume it's because I just started a new job and the W4 is online this time around. I've never had to pay the government anything out of pocket when I've done my taxes, but I just figured that was because my tax return covered whatever I did owe and I got the remaining amount. 

What makes someone owe federal income tax when tax filing time comes around? I've never been knowledgeable of how the tax thing goes because my filing is simple. Single, no kids/dependants or anything, when I do my taxes online it's mainly just me clicking ""next"" until I'm done. Even had someone at H&amp;R Block help me last year to make sure I wasn't missing anything and they said my taxes are pretty straightforward. 

Anyway, I went off topic there. I was just wondering who this claim exemption applies to? What are the benefits?

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, Sept 29, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 29, 2021**

After suffering one of the worst days all year yesterday, stocks stabilized today, with the three major indexes trading modestly green as Treasury yields pulled back from multi-month highs. Lots of dynamics affecting the market right, with market participants closely monitoring developments out of Washington D.C, communications from the Fed, and ongoing situations in China. 

Yesterday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield spiked to as much as 1.56%, the highest level since June, which pressured tech stocks, causing the Nasdaq (QQQ) to fall by more than 2.5% yesterday. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks, like technology, the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunities to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. While higher yields are generally seen as a bet on a strengthening economic environment, it does make it more expensive to borrow capital, which weighs heavily on growth stocks, which are valued heavily based on future earnings projections.

Timothy Chubb, Chief Investment Officer at advisory firm Girard, said ‚ÄúYesterday‚Äôs selloff was really largely driven by rate movement. It wasn‚Äôt necessarily the size of the rate movement, but the speed that it took place.‚Äù The yield gained more than 16 basis points from its low last Friday to yesterday‚Äôs peak. 

Congress members continue to race in order to pass legislation to fund the government until next year and prevent the government from defaulting and shutting down, which Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warning the US must raise the debt limit by October 18 in order to avoid a default. This comes amid a backdrop of ongoing debates surrounding the bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure deal. Last night, Republicans refused to pass a bill to avert a government shutdown and raise or suspend the debt limit to prevent the US from defaulting on its debts. Unfortunately, something that is fairly routine (the debt ceiling has been raised 80 times since 1960 and three times under President Trump, with the latest suspension in 2019) has become a headline with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stating that he would not provide the Republican votes necessary.

Jason Grumet, Bipartisan Policy Center President, said ‚ÄúIt is really important that we separate the shutdown, which is terrible, from the debt limit, which is catastrophic. There could be, I think, a very short shutdown of the government Friday night going into Saturday, Sunday. And I think that you would then see a short continuing resolution to get the government running again. The government shutdown really isn‚Äôt the problem we‚Äôre grappling with. The problem we're grappling with really is the debt ceiling. Democrats tried to join them together. That did not make the sale for Republicans. Some Democrats have a different approach to the debt ceiling. But I am not particularly concerned about a government shutdown."" 

Penduing home sales have greatly exceed expectations in August, rebounding spectacularly from the July dip to jump to the highest level in seven-months. Pending home sales rose 8.1% in August month-on-month, according to the [National Association of Realtors](https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/pending-home-sales-recover-8-1-in-august). This exceeded estimates for a 1.4% monthly rise, based on Bloomberg consensus data. In July, pending home sales fell by 2.0%. Pending home sales are -6.3% down compared to last year.

personalfinance,Job with good 401k match vs job with equity awards? Pros/cons?,"I am currently employed at a company (Job A) and recently received an offer from a company in another state (Job B). During the interview process I worked out some scenarios since I had no clue what they would offer. Their max offer--we have gone back and forth a few times now--is about 15k over what I make now, but about 7k less than I was hoping for. Nearly all of the increase will be eaten up in housing at the new location since my current mortgage is very low. After accounting for housing, insurance, state/federal taxes, 401k contribution, etc at each company the income-less-expense amount is nearly identical.

The major variable that I haven't been able to quantify in my analysis is that Job A offers a 7% 401k match which I have taken advantage of since I was hired. Job B does not offer any 401k match, but they offer equity (stock) which they review and award more frequently. My offer includes 50% of my proposed salary in stock (in addition to the salary), vested over four years. I confirmed that additional equity is awarded at reviews during the vestment time, and any additional awarded equity is not subject to the vesting period. Their stock is far more valuable than Job A's stock (~50 vs ~600), as are their long term prospects for growth. Job B offers a meager relocation package, but nothing to write home about.

What would be some pros/cons to taking Job B with the equity plan instead of the 401k match? My figures still account for a 401k contribution at Job B, which they offer but just don't match, so I would not be foregoing a 401k account entirely. Is it worth it? Job A has only been awarding 1-2% pay increases annually with a small bonus, so it would take me a while to make it to that 15k increase that Job B offers.",finance

It always bothered me to how anytime you would bring up some concerns the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù on the discord, or telegram, or their sub. would start justifying what the devs said and explaining how it can‚Äôt be a rug pull and their project is different than all the other crap on Binance Scam Chain. I am now convinced that these people are all bots there to reassure the holders to keep holding. Because I refuse to believe people can be dumb enough to just blindly believe the crap they are fed. 

Anyways yeah if people are telling you that the Crypto can‚Äôt be a rug pull because of X,Y,Z run because it is a guaranteed rug pull",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,China crackdown on cryptocurrency is highlighting need for fully decentralized DEFI more than ever,"Not sure if you are aware but in China there is a big issue with the younger generation vs. the rich Boomers much like here in the US.    Rich boomers follow the old ways but they are flush with easy money from the big 90's boom.  This latest ban in China isn't affecting them so much as its the young, tech savvy, freedom seeking entrepreneurs..  is so severe its going to cutoff the only financial way out you could have from the mainland.  Bitcoin and crypto in general allowed young Chinese people to show off their coding skills, invest, send money out of the country without restrictions, and to essentially explore individualism.    

Now that the ban is in place and the CCP has approved enforcement by multiple state security agencies Its going to mandatory to connect via anon sites and transact using things like Tornado cash, dex's such as GMX and Mango, and  anything that is ACTUALLY robust against state sponsored attacks.    Because if they can't survive the hack, their identities will be exposed potentially this could be life ending.   Seems like overkill now but soon it will be part of their behavior score. and they will be trapped  

Will Defi step up?  Will great sites like Tornado cash survive the federal takeover and shutdown attempts?  will privacy chains like Monero survive?  Decentralization is now everything in DEFI, we must protect our Chinese crypto family from doom.   Any thoughts appreciated.   Right now i think the only thing that could be a persistent stop against complete loss of liberty is Defi and Web 3.  Thoughts appreciated.",cryptocurrency
vet,Aggressive without aggression (goes looking to pick a fight but almost...calmly),"My cat Atlas is an orange tabby American short-hair. He's about 13 lbs (little over 6 kg) and is a few months over 2 years old. He's a sweet boy when he wants to be, and we have a few other cats that he may play a bit rough with we, but he is always playing unless they're trying to get one up on him. He doesn't really have to try to beat themselves, especially the two youngest because he can just flatten them out with a paw or lay on top of them if they're being too much. He'll throw his weight around but never ever aggressively or with ill will. He is not out to hurt themselves, just show them who's boss if they want to push his buttons.


We didn't have a problem with him and other cats, and honestly he's usually our tester of whether another animal (cat, dog, etc.) is okay with cats because he doesn't care and he's never really afraid of anything. We didn't have a problem with him fighting other cats until we moved into a new house with some roommates who have two cats of their own, both female. Of course, I know. Cats fight over territory especially if you don't introduce them correctly.


We did all that, and the other cats are fine, but now when we're not there we have to put him up. If he's out, especially if he knows they're out, he will actively hunt them down and back them into a corner. The smallest of the two is Caramel and she'll stand her ground, but is easily overpowered by him if he wants to, but his main target is Cleo who is a big girl (chonky) and formerly an outdoor cat who knows how to throw down if she wanted. He'll slowly stalk up to them whenever he finds them and then pounces if not smacks them first, and they've gotten each other at times.


The thing is...he doesn't do it *aggressively*. His face is very expressive, and he has no qualms voicing when he's mad. He always gives clear warning well before he ever does anything...to humans or his fur siblings (including the dogs). However, his expression and manner is neutral and calm whenever he goes hunting them down or attacking the other cats. He only gets puffy at two points: 1) if they start kicking *his* ass and 2) if they yelled at one of his siblings because they're grumpy even if it's the fault of one of Atlas's siblings by picking a fight with them. (None of our animals are biologically related, it's just easier to reference)


I'm wondering if there may be something psychological with him (or a thyroid problem) that could cause him to actively go looking for fights. Is there some over the counter stuff I can give Atlas that may help calm him down? Do pheromones help? Or is it best for a vet to take a look at him and determine if he's got something going on in his head?


Edit: [This is Atlas,](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/py90ak/what_big_round_eyes_you_have/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) and honestly, this is the expression he always has. Maybe curious. Always wide eyed and round. Never aggressive nor angry or anything, even after bullying the others.


Added note: Please don't mistake. He really is a sweet boy when he wants to be especially when it comes to affection. He always takes care of the foster kittens and teaches them right from wrong and knowing their boundaries. He comes for cuddles from humans and cats alike and cleans his brothers and sister. He's wide-eyed and curious and loves to explore unafraid. Sometimes it seems like he legitimately has two sides...I don't know. My roommates are fed up with his antics, but he's not evil. He can be short-tempered, but not evil.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Everybody in crypto may want to check out this article‚Ä¶,"https://decentralizedlegalsystem.com/us-crypto-currency-regulation/

First of all I just want to start out by saying I‚Äôm not trying to produce FUD. I am long term very bullish on crypto and we know as some point the US government is going to get their greasy fingers into regulating crypto, but to what extent? We are all wary of regulation in crypto and according to this article it seems like the US is trying to put a stranglehold on crypto. Here‚Äôs the main key points the US is trying to accomplish with this regulation. 

Bitcoin and Ethereum and their hard forks are the only crypto currencies that will be considered a commodity and regulate their transactions accordingly. This will create legal uncertainty for all the other coins by allowing them to be labeled as securities. 

Ban the use of (unauthorized) stablecoins

Introduce prison sentences for the use of mixers and privacy coins 

Rebrand smart contracts that take 24 hrs to deliver as futures contracts and regulate them accordingly

Redefine legal tender and change the way money is created by the Federal Reserve; and authorize the issuing of a digital usd of which all transactions are recorded 

Introduce foreign regulations into US law for all virtual asset providers in the US

TLDR: the US is trying to regulate the hell out of crypto and if these regulations go through it will kill a lot of coins. Again not here to spread FUD but if this is true and the US has their way with regulation things could get really interesting. The article expands on these thoughts in detail if you are curious about reading more Thoughts? Do you think this can or will happen? Link to the article is below.

worldpolitics,Japan is keeping up the pace,"Japan is keeping up the pace of conducting military exercises, what causes increased worry for Russia and China. In July 2021, the Eastern Shield 2021 exercise took place, the largest bilateral field exercise of the U.S. and Japanese land self-defense forces. Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi, who visited Hokkaido during the exercises, officially announced that the northern direction was of ""critical importance. Incidentally, Japan has only one neighbor to the north: the Russian Federation. This statement makes it clear that the Japanese see Russia as a potential target in the north, particularly in the southern Kuril Islands.  
September 2021, Japan‚Äôs Self-defense forces are mobilizing for the largest exercise since the Cold War. They will involve 100,000 personnel, 20,000 pieces of equipment, 120 aircraft, and a U.S. Army landing craft. This time the exercises have an anti-Chinese focus, connected with the territorial claims of Japan to the People's Republic of China around the Senkaku Islands. So naturally, the question arises: What is the country that has voluntarily abandoned its armed forces preparing and hoping for?  
Russia is a nuclear power capable of defending the sovereignty of its territories by dialogue and, if necessary, with its own armed forces. If Japan is preparing to resolve the territorial issue in the North, which is of ""critical importance"" to them, by force, it should be noted that modern Russia has quite enough forces and means to repel aggression. The PRC also has nuclear weapons and modern means of delivery, and the U.S. Aegis missile defense systems will not be able to block it. In addition, the Japanese do not want to rely on the United States. The Americans can use Japan to their advantage, but they will not engage in World War III just for a distant eastern country. An open armed confrontation, with both Russia and China, would lead to enormous losses, primarily on the part of Japan. A small piece of land should not be equal to the lives of millions of people, including civilians, and unleashing a nuclear war.",energy

As I read through the IRS website, I get the impression that I can just hire her to do what she is already doing.  If I just pay her $6,000 and provide her with benefits (that she already gets from my job), it sounds like I can just claim a $6,000 tax credit.

personalfinance,Use HELOC to Pay for (part of) Student Loans,"The wife and I are considering taking out a HELOC (in Jan) to pay down our student loans.

The loans are at a blended \~5.5%, while the HELOC would be \~3.25% with no fees to take out the loan.

We diligently pay our bills / mortgage / cc bills so that we have no revolving debt.  We've been abstaining from paying student loan bills for the last 1.5 years because no interest and instead shoving the money into our retirement accounts.  And we have no issues with the actual payments of the student loans, we're more just considering ways to reduce interest.

I'm aware of the concept of not trading unsecured debt for secure debt (no one wants to lose their house due to not paying their student loans), but the opportunity to reduce our interest rate is tempting.

We have also considered using a private company to refi the loans into something with a lower interest but most of what I can find is either 4.00%+ or includes fees to refi which feels like throwing away money.  If it matters at all, on our current time table, the student loans will be paid off in \~5.5 or 6 years.  Alternatively if my research just sucks, and there's somewhere I should look to refi them with better rates / lower fees, that would be great too!

Once the CD's matured I would transfer them into the T-Mobile account (a few reach maturity in Dec, most early next year, and the rest in 4 years).

Now essentially just have to pay for it then get zapped. I am in good financial standing, but am unclear on the best approach and how it might impact my credit.

Background:

-Excellent credit rating, though has been recently dinged for increase in credit usage (put a set of new tires on auto card). Currently in the low-Excellent rating.

-have credit card with about 1500 balance. have enough credit limit on my own credit card to put it on there but would be looking at those higher interest rates

-have enough in savings to cover credit debt and Lasik but that would about empty the tank which I dont want to do.

-have some cash to tap into

-Surgery place offers a medical credit card which is 12 months same as cash. So no interest for first 12 months. And monthly balance would just be whatever isnt paid up front ammortized to 12 months.

So I am unclear what the impact to my creditscore openning up another card would be. I currently use Mint to track my finances and gives info on credit score. It provides limited information on what impacts the credit score. Case it point it says limit opening new credit cards. But does not reveal how this will impact score. 

My current strategy is to combine some assets (cash, savings, Acorns) to hit maybe half of the Lasik bill. Then for the other half either throw it on my existinf credit card or open the medical card. 

Really appreciate any insight. Understand its somewhat limited info.

60. A Weiss Crypto analyst calls the smart contract launch an alleged event and also doesn‚Äôt realize we already have NFTS. The Cardano community was quick to correct the analyst.

63. One of Cardano‚Äôs biggest competitors is once again suffering network problems. This time it started out as just being characterized as (more) ‚Äúinstability‚Äù, then they started saying that something had caused the blockchain to ‚Äústart forking‚Äù.

It‚Äôll be interesting to see how well their community tolerates this in the future if it‚Äôs happening with their planned slashing model in effect.

69. Now one of Cardano‚Äôs most highly visible critics is implying that the Cardano community has something in common with anti-vaxxers.

75. After the Senate hearing on Tuesday September 14th, Gary Gensler (SEC Chairman) gave a quote to a crypto publication indicating that custodial lending and possibly even staking platforms might be considered securities.

TLDR:

- 4% rule is often misunderstood
  - ""finance not a natural science ... should not be treated like Newton ... is not a law of nature""
- 4% rule was created in 1991 as worst-case scenario based on retiring in Oct 1968 into high inflationary period
  - Based on portfolio of: 30% S&amp;P, 20% US small-cap, 50% intermediate US Treasury bonds
- The _average_ SWR historically is 7%, has hit 13% at times
- Bengen adjusted it to 4.5% in 2006 and 5% in 2020, which he now personally uses

Inflation is more damaging to retirees than bear markets, because bear markets recover while inflation eats purchasing power in only one direction.

Also buried near the bottom: TIPS performance may be unexpected because its never actually been tested in an inflationary period.

&gt; There are plenty of unknowns‚Äîboth known unknowns and unknown unknowns. We don‚Äôt know if the Fed can prevent deflation, let alone get prices higher. We don‚Äôt know what Covid is going to do to long-term returns. We also don‚Äôt know, for example, whether inflation-protected TIPS bonds would work better than regular government bonds. Although TIPS are designed to adjust their prices to reflect rises in the Consumer Price Index, they weren‚Äôt around in the 1970s, so we don‚Äôt know how exactly they would have done.

Dispensaries will be able to use a fast, low fee transaction network (so many to choose from including Bitcoin-Lightning, BitPay, Coinbase Debit, XLM, ALGO, BCH, LTC), and then transfer their earnings to stablecoins.

Meanwhile they wait to see what the federal government does‚Äîthere's a slow moving banking bill that could allow access in states where marijuana is already legal. And they reduce their cash holding risks by accepting crypto.

CryptoCurrency,"Staking, Yield Farming in Crypto for beginners","Thought the links in this post might be useful to newbies trying to figure what it means to stake or farm their coins/tokens

STAKING
[Link](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/cryptocurrency-stocks/what-is-staking/)

Staking cryptocurrencies is a process that involves committing your crypto assets to support a blockchain network and confirm transactions.

It's available with cryptocurrencies that use the proof-of-stake model to process payments. This is a more energy-efficient alternative to the proof-of-work model, which requires mining devices that use computing power to solve mathematical equations.

Staking can be a great way to use your crypto to generate¬†passive income, especially because some cryptocurrencies offer high interest rates for staking. Before you get started, it's important to fully understand how crypto staking works.

YIELD FARMING
[Link ](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-yield-farming-beginners-guide)

At its core, yield farming is a process that allows cryptocurrency holders to lock up their holdings, which in turn provides them with rewards. More specifically, it‚Äôs a process that lets you earn either fixed or variable interest by investing crypto in a DeFi market.

Simply put, yield farming involves lending cryptocurrency via the¬†Ethereum¬†network. When loans are made via banks using fiat money, the amount lent out is paid back with interest. With yield farming, the concept is the same: cryptocurrency that would otherwise be sitting in an exchange or in a wallet is lent out via DeFi protocols (or locked into¬†smart contracts, in Ethereum terms) in order to get a return.

Yield farming is normally carried out using¬†ERC-20 tokens¬†on Ethereum, with the rewards being a form of ERC-20 token. While this might change in future, almost all current yield farming transactions take place in the Ethereum ecosystem.

personalfinance,Student loan repayment options,"Hi all,

I recently graduated from graduate school with 120k in federal student loans. Currently employed as a physical therapist earning 70k/year salary with 1-2% raises/year. 29 and single right now, but may get married in a few years. Currently renting an apartment in Las Vegas for about $1100. With utilities, car insurance, and other bills it works out to be about $1500/month.

My main question is should I go on a PAYE repayment plan for my student loans with an estimated pay off date of 2042, totaling ~$52k in payments with the rest forgiven? Or go with a more aggressive repayment strategy and try to repay the balance+interest in about 5ish years?

My main concern is if I plan to buy a house in the next 3-5 years and start a family, will going with the PAYE long term plan affect my ability to get a mortgage? I'm assuming it will.

I know the saying out there is that no debt is good debt, and I agree. I want to be done with my student loans as soon as possible. But the thought of potentially paying $100k less in loans by riding it out long term is enticing. The other thing is after 3-5 years I may also transition into a hospital based job where I can make 90k/year.",finance

politics,"Discussion Thread: Congress votes on Debt Ceiling, Budget, BIF and Reconciliation","This week, Congress is set to consider several major bills, one of which has significant consequences on the American economy if not timely passed.

First, President Biden‚Äôs signature infrastructure legislation heads to an uncertain future as Congressional Democrats fight to finalize the spending parameters between moderate and more left-leaning members. In August, the Senate passed the [Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework](&lt;https://www.npr.org/2021/08/10/1026081880/senate-passes-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill&gt;), or ""BIF"", by a wide 69-30 margin, a $1 trillion spending package, including $550 billion in new spending, that would pay for upgrading critical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, the power grid, and also provide funding for rural broadband. This was only part of President Biden‚Äôs agenda, however, and the Senate subsequently passed a Reconciliation resolution on a party line vote to begin the Reconciliation process. The anticipated spending for this initiative was initially expected to be a much larger $3.5 trillion package, and included spending on climate goals, further spending on Medicare including dental coverage, and lowering the eligibility age for Medicare to 60. The Reconciliation resolution set into motion a process by which committees of jurisdiction in both houses would mark up the bill with spending and taxing, and the proposed Reconciliation bill was set to be voted on.

The BIF has not passed the House yet, and Speaker Pelosi had initially indicated that she would not bring it to a vote until the Senate had also passed the Reconciliation bill, in order to retain leverage that House progressive caucus members believe is necessary to ensure that the Reconciliation bill passes without significant cuts. Moderate Democrats in the Senate, particularly Sen. Manchin of West Virginia and Sen. Sinema of Arizona, however, have insisted that the BIF pass first before Reconciliation negotiations proceed. With neither wing of the Democratic Party inclined to concede their positions, both bills now face uncertain futures as Democratic party leaders, including President Biden, scramble to discuss terms amongst the groups.

Separately, the annual federal budget is set to expire today. The [Senate](&lt;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-shutdown-continuing-resolution-agree-vote-thursday/&gt;) has advanced a temporary stopgap spending measure that would fund the federal government until December 3, as negotiations continue for a longer funding bill. The bill heads to the House, which is expected to pass the legislation in order to avert a government shutdown.

Finally, Democrats and Republicans continue to negotiate on the debt ceiling, legislation enacted by Congress that places a limit on how much debt the US federal government can accrue. An increase to the debt ceiling was originally intended to be a part of the continuing resolution (budget) to fund the federal government, but Republicans have held firm against providing the necessary votes to raise the limit, forcing Democrats to separate the legislation. Democrats have pushed for a suspension of the debt ceiling until after the 2022 midterms, but Republicans have resisted, insisting that Democrats raise the limit on their own through a separate Reconciliation bill in order to fund the trillions in new spending that are a part of President Biden‚Äôs agenda.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen estimates that Congress has until October 18 to find a solution to the debt ceiling impasse before the Treasury Department‚Äôs extraordinary measures exhaust and the federal government is unable to pay its creditors on debts owed. US treasury bonds are a linch pin in international finance, and are often used in the calculation of ""risk-free rates"" for investments. Other than an [accidental default in 1979](&lt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/beltway/2013/10/08/actually-the-united-states-has-defaulted-before/&gt;) on certain bonds, the US federal government has never defaulted on its debt obligations, and the 14th Amendment guarantees US federal debt. Congress failing to pass necessary legislation to raise the debt ceiling would potentially have significant consequences on the US and global economy.

Please discuss these bills here. If the need arises, we may also have standalone megathreads to discuss any developments in the legislative process.

personalfinance,"A few questions about retirement savings (401k, Roth IRA, etc)","Hey Reddit,

I am 24 years old. I make about 50k a year and I just want to make sure what I have setup is good. My checks are about $2200 before tax (this varies as I'm commission based). Right now, I have 15% of my check go into a pre-tax NON MATCHED 401K which averages to about $250 a check into my 401k. I have about $10,000 in savings as liquid cash, this is my primary savings and other than my 401k that's all of the money I have. Here's my question: Should I focus more on my 401k and dumping as much into it as I can for retirement to get the compounding effect (is the compound worth it?) or should I put some money into a Roth IRA seperately as well and put less into the 401k? I have a Vangaurd Roth IRA account with 0$ in it, would it be a worth while investment to put $100 a month into it or would that $100 go further in my 401k to help the 401k compound faster? I'm very dumb when it comes to investing, for my 401k I chose the play it safe option and for my Roth IRA I put the slightly risky option.  Both the 401k and Roth IRA and powered by Vangaurd. I hope this all makes sense, I'm sorry if it doesn't, investing really isn't my thing I just want to make sure I have money in the future so I can retire.

EDIT: I have one last question sorry, is it worth putting that $100 into the Roth if I'm never going to max it out annually? (the 6k max, I'll only be putting in 1200 a year). The current fund is ""Federal Money Market""

Thanks",finance

Optionally it's a real forecast. A lot of season factors will move market up till new year.

Another problems we can see also in Chinese economy. So many risks around us can call ""avalanche effect"".

But I've heard about new market declines last year, so I don't believe in it.

**TLDR**:

Understanding the two terms of APR  
 and APY  
 becomes even more important in DeFi today, as nearly all protocols with yield farming fields display these numbers. Knowing them well is not only for understanding and executing different strategies and calculating real profits.

# General Conclusion

APR and APY are used in many yield farming programs in DeFi protocols. However, they are not the same thing! We, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking DeFi tokens. So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.

Both are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.

# Definition

APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.

APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.

Who uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.

&gt;Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.

# What Are They Different?

## APR

For example, a yield farming program offers an APR  
 of 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  
.

Once you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.

### Formular

APR = r x N

Where:

r: The interest rate of the year;

N: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).

## APY

APY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.

&gt;What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?

If you have an APR  
 of 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  
 by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  
.

Assuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  
 and APY  
 of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.

### Formular

APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

In which:

r: The interest rate of the period;

n: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).

# Awareness

As such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:

* First, displaying APY  
 will produce a larger percentage than APR  
, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.
* Secondly, the APY  
 interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).

Today we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.",cryptocurrency
