personalfinance,Feel like I'm getting jerked around trying to get out of PMI on home loan,"Hi guys.  Here's the situation.  We bought our house just shy of 5 years ago.  We didn't have the resources to pay 20% when we bought the house so we only did 5% and kept the rest in the bank for a rainy day.  I called about 6 months ago to get more details about our current standing so I could figure out a way to get out of PMI.  I hate throwing away money.  I was told that since our loan was less than 5 years old, we had to pay it down (or get an increased appraisal) so that we were to 75% Loan-To-Value.  I blew up about that.  She said that it was in our closing paperwork.  I told her that it wasn't when I read everything at closing.  We didn't do anything weird to get our loan.  It was a very standard straightforward (to my knowledge) loan.  It was explained to me that if we had the house reappraised and waited till our loan was 5 years old, then I could get out of PMI.  

So I called today and spoke with the bank again.  I explained what I had been told previously, and they had no idea about that 75% BS.  However, what I'm being told now is that if I pay it down to 80%, I have to pay for an appraisal to get rid of PMI, or I pay it down to 78% and it falls right off.  The other option is to get an appraisal now to see if I can get the loan down to 80% LTV (very likely as home prices in my area have spiked).  But here's the kicker.  They're telling me I have to refinance once I prove my increased home worth which will cause me to lose my awesome interest rate of 3.5%.  

What would you guys suggest we do?  We have no outstanding credit card debt and no car payments.  Just student loans and the this mortgage.",finance
personalfinance,Bankruptcy an option?,"Hi everyone, 
Thanks for reading this post. I am in a situation in which I feel like I cannot get out of it. It seems like everything I do to try and pay off my debts just fails and I end up with something else coming up. A little background...

I put an account for heating oil (expensive) in my name for my sig other at the time (about 4 years ago). He ended up never paying it and I couldn’t pay it as I wasn’t working and attending college at the time ($1200). They ended up obtaining a judgment which tanked my score like 60 points. Flash forward a few months I got into a car accident, which my mom had not paid the insurance and did not tell me. I was sued for 4,000, they obtained a judgment and I ended up settling it for about 3,000 last year. Well come to find out - not long after I pay off those debts I thought I was free and clear. I co-signed on an apartment for my grandmother who then subsequently died and the complex told me I was responsible for the rest of her lease and has obtained a collection for 4500, which I have no intentions to pay. And I did a bail for my mom a few years back and now the bail bondsman is saying we owe them $1000 and are attempting to obtain a judgment. So last year, I pay of $4,000 in debt, plus $1500 on my credit card and paid that off only now to be in the same position I was in last year in which I owe $5000 more dollars. At this point I am literally ready to throw in the towel and just say fuck it. 

I have on time payments on my credit cards. But the collections and judgments are killing my credit score. It’s in the high 500s and at this point I’m considering just filing bankruptcy. Is this a smart option or should I consider settling the debts and just letting them age off? Both collection agencies have made it clear they are not willing to do a pay for delete. Also, I have federal student subsidized loans which I will start paying in June. That is about $30,000. I know bankruptcy will not wipe those away but I’m not sure if filing for bankruptcy would be worth it considering my debt to income will still be considered high.",finance
personalfinance,"Stuck in a transition job, never went anywhere with my degree, too much debt","I'm a long time lurker here and have learned some stuff along the way but never figured my self out in the process. I had (and sometimes still have) poor impulse habits that I've started to get under control since diagnosed with adult ADD (I am 26).


I went to a tech school in Wisconsin and got an AAS in Computer Engineering Technology which is a fancy way of saying we learned very minimal programming and the basic principals of electricity and circuit design, I graduated around 4 years ago. My work history is complete garbage, I've never held a job besides for my current one for more than 1.5 years. My resume screams unreliable.


I went to school (gather about $12,600 along the way) to attempt my BS in Comp. Sci., I hated it completely and left my internship and wanted nothing more to do with school (and still don't).


Where am I now? I've worked at Jimmy John's as a delivery driver off and on since 2012 and am there again for about a year now. I have a 2015 Civic ($17,000) and two credit cards that I have started to get serious about paying off ($4k @ 15% and $2k @ 23%). I work as much as my boss will allow so that basically my hourly wage alone pays for the bill and my tip money goes towards gas, car repair fund, and extras. I receive government assistance in the form of health care and SNAP. Here's what my typical month looks like...

* Paychecks: ~$800

* Tips: ~$866

* Bills: ~$850 (varies with Heat, this includes min. payments for cards and everything)


I typically try to pay $100/mo extra towards the card carrying the highest interest rate, more when I can.


The truth is I HATE working with customers and everyday is semi painful to get through work. I don't really like what I do but the reality is I need a job that pays $14+/hr but with my lack of good reliable work history and my degree I did nothing with, I don't know what to do. I'm 26 but I have never been more lost in my life. I also cannot move from my small Wisconsin city (50K+ pop.) and can't really deviate much outside of 9 - 5. So where does this leave me?


I am not looking for the ""magic answer"" because I know there isn't one, but I do know there are wonderful people on here with far more life experience than my self. I'm hoping you can all give a 26 year old in too much debt with no interest in school or retail some ideas of where to go.",finance

personalfinance,Loan to help cleanup debt,"I'm in a real jam right now. Through my stupidity I've managed to rack up about $25k in damages over 3 cards, a Best Buy card, and existing loan. Interest rates on these cards are terrible. I used to buy everything with cards and pay them off at the end of the month and started slacking off. At the moment, I'm paying an arm and a leg on interest every month and it'll take me forever to pay it off. I'm cutting the cards so ringing up more charges isn't a problem. My credit is okay (negatives being debt, I pay my bills on time). My income is also fairly good (maybe top 10/20 percent of US households). I can even have my wife co-sign (she makes a good deal of money too). This way I can do hopefully ~$600+ a month 48 month kind of deal (pay more as I can to pay this off sooner) with a lower interest rate, and in a timely manner.     
      
Does anyone work in the industry or can help point me in the right direction? I'm looking to get the best interest rate to help get this taken care of and get things back on track.",finance
personalfinance,(CAN) - Someone is attempting the Fake Cheque Fraud on me - what can I do,"Greetings PF,

I run a business where I tutor students across various ages. Have run it for years with no issue. I show up, parents pay me cash, I tutor, I leave. I was recently contacted by a father who wanted me to tutor his son, and wanted to pay me for a month of lessons in advance. After giving him my rate for the month, he FedEx'd me a cheque a few days later for almost 3 times the agreed amount, asking that I just cash it and give him back the rest. Obviously this smells of a scam. What are my options, and is there a best course of action? My current thought is to cash the cheque, wait until I get confirmation from the bank that the cheque has indeed gone through (small chance) then proceed from there. Any advice at all would be much appreciated, thank you!

Edit - Thank you everyone for the advice! It looks like I was wrong about my thoughts to cash it. I never considered about getting hit with additional fees. Thank you all!",finance
personalfinance,Finally paid off my Credit Cards. On to student loans and life savings. What should I do?,"Been lurking r/personalfinance and learned a lot of great tips from you guys. Thanks to you guys, I've been budgeting, using Mint religiously, waterfall method.. and finally paid off all of my credit cards ($23,000) in the period of over a year. Now that I'm over that hump, I need advice on what steps I should take next. 

This is my first year working after 2 years of residency so I'm finally making stable income. I'm a healthcare provider (yearly salary of 125k) at a startup company. 

My current goals:

* Starting to contribute 7% to a Roth 401K with my company contributing 3%. 100% of this is going to Vanguard Total Stock Mkt Idx Adm
* Starting to save my emergency fund with a goal of $15000 (~6months expenses) with Ally saving 

Currently, I have the following student loans:

*  Direct Subsidized Consolidation Loan: $25,194.67 at 7.25%
*  Direct Unsubsidized Consolidation Loan : $226,253. 92 at 7.25%
*  My Campus Loan: $17,597.40 at 5% 

The Direct Sub and Direct Unsub are currently in forbearance until January while they are processing my Income-Driven-Repayment plan renewal application. Im unsure whether I should continue with IDR (Cons: high interest rate, not sure of monthly amount until application goes through. Pros: fed loans benefits like forbearance, forgiveness after 20-25 years) or if I should refinance (Pros: possible lower interest. Cons: loose out on the fed loans benefits). I’m making minimum payments monthly for the My Campus Loan. 

Questions: 

1. Any recommendations on how I should approach my student loans?

personalfinance,"Need your help! I read the Wiki, but I want to make sure I don't screw up my retirement/investment plan!","Hello and thank you in advance!

I am in my early 30s, and trying to ""right the ship"" when it comes to my retirement planning/investing.  I read the wiki, as well as the links within it - very helpful document.  I still have questions about how best to setup my 401k, an IRA, and take advantage of my company's stock options. If I am honest with myself, I think my insecurity on my lack of financial knowledge/feeling of deep shame for having not started has caused me to procrastinate getting started.  These days are over now though!  No more excuses.

My situation: I am stably employed.  I make a salary of $105,000 yearly, with commission.  This commission is paid out monthly, and can be unpredictable.  I typically make $25k-$30k in commission, and will likely make this next year.  However, I anticipate this figure rising in the future.  I already have a 6 month emergency fund established.

401k (suntrust):   

- From reading the wiki, I understand that I should contribute enough to max the match that my employer provides.  They provide 2% match.  Is this figure based off of my salary, or gross income?  If it is gross income, how do I plan ahead for this when my income can change due to commission?

- I have enough money in savings now to contribute enough to max the match that my employer provides.  However, it is very close to year end.  I would like to do this, and have it count for 2017.  How do I do this given that the contributions to the 401k come from my paycheck?   

- I am having trouble figuring out if my 401k is ""bad"" 401k or not.  I see one fund with a gross expense ratio below .1, but the others are .5 or higher.  I can afford to max my 401k and an IRA – I am assuming, even if the funds are crap, it is still advisable to do this.  Is this correct, or should I be investing elsewhere?

- How do I differentiate between the funds in my plan?  Any advice on which ones to go with?  I know that having 30% bonds, 20% international stocks, and 50% US stocks is advisable, but how do I tell which funds accomplish this?  I have included the funds below:

- the net expense ratio is paid to fund company from fund assets
- the revenue type and amount are revenue paid from the net expense ratio

IRA:

- With my income sometimes above or below the IRA cap ($133,000), how do I determine whether or not a backdoor IRA is necessary?  I cannot 100% predict my income due to commission.  Should I just go with the backdoor IRA due to this?

- If I go with the backdoor IRA option, is it still smarter to max my IRA before my 401k?  I can afford to max both – is this the best option?

- I have enough in savings to max an IRA for 2017, but time is running short.  First, does this make sense to do with a backdoor IRA, or should I just dump this money in my 401k?  Second, if going the IRA route makes sense, can I still accomplish this before the year is over?

- Any recommendations on an IRA given my situation?

Stock Options:

- I have no idea what I am doing with this.  What is the difference between a share and an option?  What do I need to do to take advantage of this?

Bitcoin,"Despite the price swings and volatility, I just like hodling Bitcoin. I feel a real sense of ownership. (My experience with Bitcoin since 2012).","I've been with Bitcoin since nearly the beginning (relatively speaking), back when each one was approximately $5.  I remember the rise up to $1,200 during the MtGox craze and the subsequent crash to $200.  I remember the feelings of euphoria and gloom.  However, I didn't sell.  I hung on simply because I just like hodling it.  Many 'experts' argue that Bitcoin is a bubble and its only value is the result of unchecked speculation.  But I know this is not true because I don't feel it.  Bitcoin has value to me personally. And here's the beauty -- no one can tell me I'm wrong.  No one can tell me what I should or should not value.  I just enjoy having it.  I hate parting with it.  

I've often asked myself why I obtain more joy from holding Bitcoin than from the dollars in my bank account.  Maybe it's a hoarding mentality?  That could be part of it, but I don't hoard anything else in my life.  I think the real reason is, with the former, I have a sense of true ownership.  Like it's legitimately mine.  And it's not being monitored. And it's not being continually devalued through deficit spending by the federal government. And I can carry it in my pocket through customs and no one is the wiser.

I think I discovered the other reason why I like hodling Bitcoin.  Growing up in the 90s and early 2000s, I was told that I could have the American dream by simply working hard, obtaining a degree, and moving up through a company.  I graduated in 2008.  We all know the market crashed that year and our economy hasn't been the same since -- that the American dream is not really an option for most people anymore (with the exception of computer scientists, engineers, accountants, and a few other professions in high-demand industries).  While things get harder for the middle class in America, the wealthy and politicians increase their holdings and power.  I like hodling Bitcoin because it's a giant FUCK YOU.  It's a fuck you to the banks (Wells Fargo).  It's a fuck you to student loans.  It's a fuck you to our government.  It's a fuck you to the baby boomers.  It's a fuck you to all of the quixotic platitudes millennials have to listen to from older, 'harder-working' generations.  It's a fuck you to credit card companies for not allowing my card to be used on online poker sites (side note: this is how I discovered Bitcoin).  It's a fuck you to unaffordable housing.  It's just a giant fuck you to the shitty hand many people in my generation were dealt.

Bitcoin could crash to nothing.  If it does, I'm going down with the ship.

Bitcoin,Keep hating Coinbase,"The OP of the ""Stop hating Coinbase"" thread would be *slightly* justified in his arguments and opinions if this was the first time this happened, or a one-off occurrence. But this has been happening since at least May. And it happens any time a big rise, or a big drop happens in the market. That's unacceptable no matter how you cut it.

This isn't some minor inconvenience either, they're a money exchange platform that buckles under the slightest breeze. When your bugs or hiccups routinely cost your customers thousands of dollars or more, fixing it should be your highest priority. Your *only* priority.  I mean, if they were trading stocks, bonds or futures, there would almost certainly be a federal investigation, because it looks to me like it could even be purposeful - this has happened what, a dozen times now this year? How much money is coinbase saving by ceasing trading when the price drops by double digits percentages? I'd imagine it's a lot given a lot if their activity happens off-chain within their own network. When people sell or send BTC of their network, that costs coinbase. 

If it's not purposeful, it's extreme negligence. Yes, it's not easy to scale, but this is 2017, it's not that hard either. This isn't a cutting edge industry - money exchanges and markets have been around since the internet has. It's a relatively mature niche. 

All of that aside, the louder we are as customers, the more we voice our displeasure, that's how we get them and anyone else to hear us and hopefully act. **Being silent solves nothing**.

Bitcoin,Story on how I turned $5000 into $32000 in 6 months.,"So I used to ping the Alpha bay servers at least once a week back when it ruled the Dark net. It would usually take 190 ms to reach them (a ping is a command that emits a signal and tracks the length it takes to reach its destination). After doing this for a month, I one day noticed that it was taking 0.87 seconds to ping the servers. Now... their is no reason why such a drastic change in speed would take place. Unless the servers had been moved or reconfigured without as much anonymity but there were no updates or downtime from the alpha bay admins. Based on these calculations and data I had figured out that the feds had got hold of the Bay servers. This was HUGE news at the time as no one knew about it. The feds had ended up honey potting the Bay which means they took it over and were watching traffic from users, buyers and dealers to try catch a few of them. 
Here is where it gets interesting. The last time a big Market went down Bitcoin skyrocketed. Why ? because a huge amount of the currency went missing, leaving the remaining worth a lot more. Simple economics, same thing would happen if a whole lot of gold just disappeared. The remaining gold would become worth a lot more. So the moment I found this out I went and bought $5000 worth of Bitcoin. A week later the news was out. It was all over Reddit, Facebook etc Alpha went offline. within a span of  3 weeks the price of Bitcoin had nearly doubled. My 5 grand turned to 10. After that it just kept growing and growing until after 6 months it was worth more than $30000.

CryptoCurrency,"/r/CrC, I'm trying to figure out whether I should get into Ethereum, and I need your honest opinion about this.","I'm not sure if this sub is biased towards or against ETH, so I assume the response will be unbiased.

What do I do? I missed the bus back in January because I got fed up of following up with Coinbase, but now I'm more knowledgeable about things and the currency seems to have genuine utility. 

Why I'm still just as eager as I am hesitant is in cryptocurrencies, especially at this stage, there is no ceiling, and there is no floor during a frenzy. There's no doubt that Ethereum's going strong, and it seems like one of the few coins out there that has genuine utility. There are so many apps that are being built on Ethereum too, and that makes me want to jump in.

I know that hindsight's going to take a big bite out of my ass if I buy it today at $456 (I thought it was at $290 until I checked the price a few minutes ago, yikes) and it drops to $300 or so, given how there's twin peaks on the price chart. I feel like even if it does it'll recover, but I'm too unfamiliar with things to fully agree.

**tl;dr:** What do I do? Do I go ahead and buy some? Right now, or after two weeks? Is it worth holding through 2018? I know that I can't expect you to predict the future, but at least I'm sure that you can talk about it with enough confidence and experience.",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,The Value of Dollars in 21M Units,"Many people have trouble with the abstract concept of a Bitcoin unit being divisible and a Dollar unit being inflatable. Breaking a unit into smaller pieces versus simply minting more units. The trouble with Dollars, is that you can't cut them in half and try trade with them as 50 cent pieces.

So I got to thinking.. what is the value of Dollars if it came in a total supply of 21 million units?

Well there are different interpretations of how many dollars there are (surprise.. surprise.. lol). 

The Fed does track money supply in the form of M0, M1, M2, and M3.

- M0 is cash in circulation and in bank vaults, plus reserves which commercial banks hold
- M1 is M0 plus checkable deposits and travelers checks (this is what conforms to the definition of money)
- M2 is M1 plus savings deposits, time deposits under $100,000, and money market accounts for individuals
- M3 is M2 plus large-time deposits, institutional money-market funds, short-term repurchase agreements, and other larger liquid assets.

As I don't have an M3 figure on hand let's be conservative and go with M3. From the Fed's data (https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/default.htm), we see there are currently 13.8 Trillion Dollhairs.

So what would be the value in USD if they came in 21 million macro units?

13800000M/21M = 6571

A normalized 'macro dollar' is therefore worth $6,571 (considering the M2 measure of monetary supply.)

M0 and M1 are not worth even considering in a comparable context. I also just found the concept of MZM which likely is the fairest measure for comparison.

Unfortunately, (lolz again) since 2006, M3 is no longer published by the US central bank. Though there is this page (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MABMM301USM189S) showing the M3 figure as the same as the M2. (lol surprise surprise the Fed 'accidentally' publishes conflicting data).

Without considering the  negative credit money outstanding (MZM), let's just go with my macro dollar being worth $6,571. It is no more or less of an abstraction that you are going to get out of the fed and their notions.

The 3 day moving average will place the Bitcoin price at $6,500 on about December 14. A healthy place to correct to given the current overbought indicators.

Ergo, Bitcoin will have the same value as the total US money supply in two weeks.

I am not even outpacing interest so I will continue to be in a worse and worse situation until I die. I will never escape.

Starting as a nurse in NYC 
So I will make 92,000 when I work days which will become 98,000 when I switch to nights. this is gross income

I’m putting 10,000 dollars toward my 401K 

Insurance is 1800 for the year divided equally among 26 paychecks.

2400 for the year  (commuter plan pretax made sense -metro card) 

1000 flex dollars ( also pretax can be used for anything healthcare like copays, contacts etc)

It totals to 16,000 pre tax 

So my taxable income is 76,000 which then switch to 82,000

Using tax assesst I figured out my income is 33% taxable I live in nyc 

So my semi-monthly income is roughly 2000 dollars. 

Expenses for a month
Car insurance- 180
Phone bill- 120
Food- 100

Loans- have about 90,000 (20 from my first bachelors which is federal and 62 from nursing school which is private at 6.2% fixed) 
Calculating loan payments using student loan hero I can pay off in 

5 years if I pay a total of 1,700 dollars not realistic 
8 years if I pay 1200
10 years 950

So my loan payment can range from 950-1700. I can play around but I don’t know what amount I should aim for. I think I’m going to do the 10 years for the loans 


Savings so I plan on saving 2,000 dollars per month

We've crushed my husbands student debt in the past year using his side hustle income- was about $25,000, is now down to $9,000. Paid off his car, and my car loan is down to $2,800.  Student debt interest rate is 3.8%, Car is 0.9%. 

We recently purchased a townhome, so our ""homeowner costs"" are a bit more risky now. The townhouse is 3 years old, so pretty much brand new HVAC, etc... definitely less risky, but still a risk. 

Our net income is about $4,500 a month without his side job (that's real estate, so commission and sporadic). Grossing about $90k annually.

We have $5,000 in savings after the house purchase. Our budget leaves about $1000 leftover every month. My gut tells me I'd like to knock out that student loan debt. We could be done with it in 9 months! 

If one of us lost a job, our current savings would last us 6 months, as we'd only be ""in the hole"" about $800 a month. However, if both of us lost our jobs, we'd be screwed in about 2 months! I feel that both of our jobs are very stable.

I currently have about $450 in my checking account, I've never owned a credit card, and the only debt I have is from my student loans. I was wondering if I could get some advice to help me figure out how to finance this move.

    

Once I'm working I should be making about $2200 biweekly after taxes and will get my first paycheck on Jan. 19th which will come with a one time signing bonus of $1500. My father has agreed to lend me is Volvo until I get my own car (my Father's work is moving the rest of my Family up to the Milford, NH area so I should be close enough to return it). I have been looking at a lot of apartments online this week and called a few to get a general estimate on monthly and first month expenses. Through some online googling and looking through some past threads I'm guessing I can afford a rent in the $1200s, most of the places in Syracuse I have been looking at have been in that range or below and usually include 1 or 2 utilities. 


    

For the first month most places are asking for 1 month's rent upfront for a security deposit and usually an application fee ranging from $20-$50 plus that month's rent. My question is should I take out a loan or apply for a credit card or both to help finance this also should I be looking at cheaper apartments or could I maybe afford something more? If I take out a loan do I take out exactly the amount I'll need or should I take out extra? I am planning to do this through the credit union I'm part of, Central one federal credit union, unless advised otherwise. I have been looking at their [personal loan options](https://www.centralfcu.com/loans/consumer-loans) and their [credit card options](https://www.centralfcu.com/credit-cards/credit-cards) but I'm not sure which plans I best qualify for if any at all.

I am currently paying out the butt for a dream car (2015 Lexus RC350 F Sport AWD). 

$800/month, a little over 2 years out of the 5 year loan term.  I'd like to lower my monthly car payment. 

I started a new job and my commute has been reduced to a mere .6 miles round trip per day, opening up options to lease. I also moved to a new state, so I need to do my car registration ASAP, which is a pain the butt and costs money for inspection and for the rest of the DMV processes.

I see my options are: 

1.  Refinance my loan (has a $150 fee and will incur more interest over the term of the loan, and probably a higher interest rate. Currently have a 1.74% rate). It is a nice car with all the options I would like and with AWD. Add costs for switching states and such.
2.  Get a new car - lease. I've never done a lease as I used to drive ~20k miles a year from work. This would easily lower my payment, and i do not have to deal with anything related to the car's registration. I would most likely still lease a luxury car as the options are much nicer and AWD sedans are limited selection elsewhere.
3. Get a new car - finance. This option probably drops be into standard car selections and will have less options and maybe no AWD (we get snow in my area). 
4. Suck it up, I can afford it. Just less money into savings.",finance

personalfinance,Crushing Debt- Need Advice,"Hey r/personalfinance, I'm looking for advice or opinions on what to due to push myself out of debt. I am currently 30k in debt with minimal expenses and no savings. Its time for me to take control of my $ and my life. I am 25 years old and live at home. Below I have listed my assorted debts.

Debt:

Santander Line of Credit: $7,385.47 (12.49% APR $198.27 monthly payment)

Discover Card: $4,344.23 (23.99% $100 monthly payment)

Chase Slate Card: $1,935.00 (0% $25 monthly payment)

Nelnet Student Loans: $11,652.10 (Varied Interest rates $133.81 monthly payment)

Heartland ECSI Student Loan: $5,122.63 (No interest rate or payment plan yet)

Total: $30,439.43 ($456.27 Monthly) ($656.27 Monthly including living expenses)

Income: $515 weekly (After Taxes)

The Chase slate card was a balance transfer to help curb off interest on $2,000 worth of debt from the discover card and accrues no interest.

Outside of my monthly ""debt"" payments I have expenses of for food, gas, and phone which average another $200 a month. I don't require an entertainment budget or anything else. My main focus is paying down this debt. In the bank I have $900. That's it. I feel overwhelmed and beyond paying off the highest interests first I don't really know where to begin or what my best options are.",finance
personalfinance,"Finally approaching student loans that I've neglected since 2014. After lurking, I have just a few questions about the best way to navigate my debt, rebuild my credit.","At 18 I enrolled in a state college in 2013 and took out 2 loans on my own behalf. I completed 2 semesters, returned to my home city, and never made a single payment towards either of these loans. I just checked my credit score on credit karma for the first time and the results (both calculated using VantageScore 3.0) were as follows:

TRANSUNION: 527

EQUIFAX: 534

Yikes. Under accounts, it says I have zero active accounts, though I can dive deeper and see that I have four closed accounts, as follows:

US DEPT OF EDUCATION - Closed February 4th, 2017 - $3,774

US DEPT OF EDUCATION - Closed February 4th, 2017 - $2,212

FEDLOAN SERVICING - Closed December 22nd, 2015 - $0.00

FEDLOAN SERVICING - Closed December 22nd, 2015 - $0.00

Now I can see that the total amount of debt I'm looking at is $5,986. Years of neglect and the anxiety that comes with looming financial unknowns made this number HUGE in my head so at this point, though I'm still kicking myself for the damage I've done to my credit score, I'm relieved. I'm dedicated to budgeting and taking care of my outstanding balances as swiftly as possible, but browsing here I've read about people successfully disputing these accounts. 

First of all, I'm provided with a phone number for the US Department of Education in Greenville TX but from what I've read contacting the creditor only restarts the process. I'm assuming that I should dispute the account before I contact them? If I'm ever to contact them?

Second, on CreditKarma I can dispute for ownership or accuracy. Under each of these, there is a respective column of specifics that I'm supposed to pick from. Obviously these are my accounts and I haven't been following my finances so I wouldn't know what type of error to select from the list. If anyone has any inference here, that would be great.

Now I'm not counting on these balances just being magically brought to zero. For what ever I'm left with... I'm at a loss. Who do I contact to negotiate monthly payment? There was a long period of time (2014-2015) where I didn't work or only worked for 1-2 months at a time, and in 2016 I made under $7,000. Can I use this to my advantage? I'm in Nebraska and my current income is about $1400 a month.

1. LTC seems to ease some of BTC's problems, such as transaction time, but not actually solve them. Transaction times in the order of minutes is still bad compared to, say, Venmo or face recognition backed by a credit card.
2. Finite coins means they're a deflationary currency. How many people here use LTC in their day to day lives? What would make you actually use it, rather than speculate with it?
3. With no central authority how does the price stay stable enough to be practical for businesses?
4. If the Fed or a major bank released a cryptocurrency that they controlled supply of (ala Ripple), so that stability was more likely, why would people use existing cryptocurrencies?

This all assumes that the goal of LTC is as a cash alternative, which is my understanding.

Feel free to pick a question and just answer that one. Links also appreciated, I'm learning here!

personalfinance,I'm FINALLY an adult - now what?,"Hi PF, I've been lurking for the past couple of weeks for inspiration, and am finally posting. Basically I would like your feedback and constructive criticism to help me get/stay on the right track. 

Background:
I just turned 30. I have about $115k in student debt. Up until now I have been *scraping* by financially: no savings, no investments, no insurance, lots of depression. I started 2016 with my first salary job making $30k, but after loans and expenses, I was still losing money. In the fall, I moved back in with Mom, working remotely for the same company. In January 2017, we were bought up by a big company, and my pay went up to $33k. In May I got an adhoc increase to $36k. In July, the company asked me to move to the HQ in Maryland, and starting Sept 1, I make $63k. 

I feel a million times better than I did a year ago. For the first time, I'm not desperately poor, and can breathe just a little bit easier. But now I need your advice on where to focus my efforts next. 

My debts: 
$1500 @ 0% - me
$2400 @ 5% - fed
$7500 @ 0% - mom
$53500 @ 4.69% - citizens
$54600 @ 4.48% - citizens

In 2017, I managed to build up an E-fund of $5k, but I had to borrow from this when I moved, for rent etc, so I owe myself about $1500 now. The $7500 is a school loan from Mom. My last federal loan is at $2400, payment is $54, but I round up to $100. I refinanced from Nelnet in 2015 for the first 50k loan, and I just refinanced in Oct from WF for the other. Both are with Citizens. Payments are $344 &amp; $376, but I round both up to $400.

I contribute 6%, company match is 6% to 401k. I have been since January, so the amount has changed several times. I selected a wide range of Vanguard funds all with .0X fee ratios. Insurance is about $95/mo.

Budget:
Take Home = $3400
900 - for loans
150 - mom loan
200 - food
25 - phone
25 - car insurance
70 - gas
850 - rent&amp;utilities
200 - savings
200 - other expenses

This leaves me with about $800 and change. I designate $700 of it as my ""payoff money,"" to pay debt/save. I'm planning to first fill my E fund back to $5k, then mom, then fed loan. I have a $1k check waiting for me back home. In January I will cash out an annuity from Grandma worth about $5k, which I'll apply to the $7500. I'm expecting about $1k for tax refund. All together, the three small debts will be gone by May, or sooner. 

In 2018, I'm expecting at least a 3% salary increase, but my performance review was very positive, so possibly more. My company does bonuses, but I'm not certain about who gets them or how much. I'll leave it to be surprised. I'm planning to increase my 401k to 7%. Insurance premiums will stay the same.

I have a 2007 Mazda, but the mechanic says it will cost 3000+ to fix everything, so I'm just going to run it into the ground. I need to set up a car fund for a DP, but there is metro access to work, so it's not an emergency, (albeit a big big want). I'm very okay with another working beater.  

How does my overall situation look to y'all? Can you see areas to improve? Once the three small loans are paid off in spring '18, how much extra should I be throwing at the big loans? Ideally, I want to pay it off as soon as possible, but I need to think about house and car DPs, possible family building money, etc. I would be happier with an E-fund closer to 10 or 15k. Should I put more into the 401k?

Thanks for your advice and collective wisdom.",finance

With baby number two on the way, we figured there was no better time. We had managed to pay down all debt other than one credit card with a 6k limit and a 28% annual interest rate. Im aware that's ridiculously high and encourage others to stay away from offers like these! 

Fast forward to today and I receive another credit card offer in the mail. Usually I toss them without reading them, however, I was a bit bored and decided to read the terms on this specific one. Turns out this offer has zero fees on balance transfers and a fixed annual interest rate of 4.5% for 36 months. I thought, ""what the heck!"" and decided to give them a call. Within about 5 minutes, I'm all set, approved for the balance transfer, and saving a whopping 24% in my annual interest fees. Five minutes of time ended up saving my family and I a lot of money and allows us to pay off our debt even faster.

I say this to encourage anyone out there like myself who is trying to take control of their finances.. Take some time to explore these offers, to sit down and write out a budget and to listen to these amazing folks on r/personalfinance.

I'm really fortunate to have made it this far without any student loans, but I won't start my ""big kid"" job until September 2018.

Wells Fargo does offer student loans with a 6-month grace period, and I'd be able to pay it off shortly after I start working.

XRP,XRP will be the last cryptocurrency standing. Bitcoin will die. Stop stressing over price stagnation and HODL,"Before you read this - Yes, I'm invested in XRP and Bitcoin. 

I've been doing a ton of reading and research over the last few weeks and just quietly observing everything from news articles to the posts here on Reddit in different areas to tweets. Just gathering information about everything I can. 

My biggest fear, and I pray it isn't true, is that Bitcoin might suffer another 2011-esque event. Not because it's in a 'bubble'. Not because I think it's a 'scam', or anything market related. I believe that the currency itself is too vulnerable and that too many people that don't understand this shit are getting involved. The higher Bitcoin's value surges to, the more people will want to invest. Yes. However, what people are discounting is that this gives hackers a much more significant incentive to figure out to plan out a MASSIVE scale attack. I mean we're all but dangling a multi-million dollar prize in front of these guys and since it's so 'decentralized' and 'unregulated', there isn't really anything anyone can do about it if they succeed. And they are WELL aware of this fact.  

Think about ALL the times Bitcoin crashed. Which time was the worst? 2011, right? Why? Not because of normal market activity - it was because Bitcoin holders lost millions. Sure, WE might be smart enough to lock our shit up in offline wallets, but what about all the other casuals frequenting coinbase and these other sites? They're more than content to leave a few thousand up there. 

Be honest with yourself, do you really think Coinbase is unhackable? Bitstamp? Or any of these other exchanges? The bigger this whole crypto thing gets, the bigger the stakes. If this thing continues to grow like it is right now and God forbid Coinbase just gets completely hacked or there's an inside job or someone bombs their servers, there's a government raid, terrorist attack...whatever... tens of thousands of people are screwed. The losses could be in the billions. Except this isn't like Fiat where things can be FDIC insured, you can file claims, call the police and have them nab the bad guys then go home...Nope, you're screwed. And that startling concept has plummeted Bitcoin down to $2 before. 

Crypto has come a long way, but until it gets to the point where there are widespread, verifiable means of damn near guaranteeing or insuring someone's investment like Fiat, it will always be some marginalized niche-like world. The risks I mentioned above don't even factor in the number of pump and dump schemes, scam coins, etc., out there. And you can bet your ass if anything crazy happens to where people REALLY lose money, governments will regulate the HELL out of these currencies without hesitation. It's not 2011 anymore guys, there's some real money at stake here now.  

If you've read up to this point, bear with me (no pun intended) - 

This is where XRP can shine. 

The coin is unique. It's market value has remained consistent, which has elicited frustration out of a lot of you in here. You wonder why Bitcoin and every other altcoin is off to the races with 30%+ gains multiple days in a row and our little XRP just sits there content as if nothing is happening. It doesn't make sense right? Calm down. This is a GOOD thing. 

This means that when Bitcoin eventually sees its day (and it will), when everything starts falling to pot, XRP will shine. The fact that financial institutions are behind it is a HUGE positive. Think about this for a second...When, not if, but WHEN a major attack happens on one of these exchanges or elsewhere or some major screwup occurs and people get screwed out of millions, what do you think will happen? Blockchain isn't going to die. That's here to stay. But folks will want to invest in a SECURE coin. And XRP will become the new Bitcoin and that will be that. 

The problem with a lot of you in here and in the crypto community is you don't get that the regular person doesn't think like us. They don't care about all this decentralization crap. For this stuff to really take off, they want something easy that's safe. Soccer mom Jill doesn't want to spend two weeks reading all night about cryptocurrencies, wallets, addresses, and all that nonsense. You can't forget that we live in a world where there are a decent amount of the population that still haven't mastered Microsoft Suite. 

I don't mean to add a race or nationalist element in it, but let's be real - a lot of Western people aren't going to be gun-ho about throwing thousands of their hard-earned dollars toward something created by a random Asian (?) guy who went by some online alias and then disappeared like 9 years ago that uses some weird technology they don't understand that's also frequently associated with underworld stuff like human trafficking and hiring hitmen. 

Hear this prophecy: All of those 'decentralization!' chants will fall on deaf ears one day. Banks, governments, and financial institutions are going to find a way to give people all of the benefits associated with decentralization while centralizing the crypto at the same time. Guess what cryptocurrency is already in the PRIME position to be used that way? Be real about this, nobody is ever really going to use Litecoin, Bitcoin or any of these other coins on a widespread scale like paying for Gatorade at a gas station or buying ice cream out of a store. People don't trust this stuff like that. But they would if a bank were facilitating it. You can't limit the possibilities to what you're hearing in the news. Sure, they say they're using XRP to facilitate international transaction times and cut fees, but how do you know that's ALL they're doing. 

My prediction is they'll create an XRP credit/debit card and vendors will make this preferred means of payment over taking FIAT through electronic payment. This would completely eliminate the problem of chargeback fraud (which is ridiculously high), could potentially be scaled for a much faster transaction speed (think about how long it takes to swipe your card. It's like a solid 4-5 seconds), and they can probably lend this stuff at a MUCH lower interest rate because of the overall reduced fees. And VENDORS would have reduced fees too, so they'll be eager to adopt this. 

STAY invested in XRP. I hope someone comes back to this post in like 4-5 years when everything I say comes true because I believe in my heart that this WILL happen one day. Don't say I didn't warn you all. Have your fun with Bitcoin and the altcoins now, but know a lot of these are limited. The coin that wins will be the one that can get adopted by everyone and so far, the potential for XRP is enormous. 

Oh, and since they're banks and XRP is open-source, they can actually track things and one day they might even find a way to insure this stuff with fiat.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Home loan shopping a good idea?,Me and my long term gf recently moved and are planning on purchasing a house in Washington State.

I love the essential premisses of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. I think they have economical and philosophycal implications that will make a very positive impact in the way people interact in so many ways, and i like to think about those implications. 

Then sometimes i get me thinking if it will ever be possible for bitcoin to replace FIAT currency.  
Then i think about its limited supply, and i get that limited supply solves the problem of inflation being controlled at will by authoritarian institutions (like the Federal Reserve at the US, of the Banco Central at Brasil), but doenst limited supply generates another quieter, but a lot more dangerous scenario on the long run?

I read news about how more than 30 billion USD were already lost in Bitcoin forever due to wallet losses, tossed out HDs that contained coins, and i think this is an issue that wont ever stop. 
You cant stop people from making mistakes.

So after the mining phase is complete, and new bitcoin wont ever be produced again, after many years of accidents like people loosing their keys or their wallets, and a bit of coin being lost forever every now and then, doenst that imply that eventually, even if it takes a long time, all bitcoin generated will be lost forever and bitcoin will dissapear?

My concern is related to cryptocurrency exchanges that claim to have usd balances backed by the fdic

According to this article: https://www.coindesk.com/in-itbit-we-trust/

Relevant section:

""Despite being organized under New York's banking law, itBit is not a bank in the ordinary sense and it not regulated by any federal banking authority such as the Federal Reserve or the FDIC. Being regulated as a bank would be too expensive and require a level of regulation and oversight ill-suited for a digital currency exchange.

ItBit does, however, indirectly provide FDIC insurance to its clients' dollars by holding them at a separate FDIC-insured bank. **It might be subject to some degree of FDIC oversight or compliance obligations indirectly, but that depends on how closely itBit and its banking partner work together.** Bitcoin firms Coinbase and Circle similarly provide FDIC insurance to their customers' dollar accounts.""

A blind man can see that crypto is swept by tulip madness right now, and when the collapse comes, exchanges might collapse with it. So I'm looking to ensure my balances are held in fdic insured accounts offered by a few exchanges.

She was very clear before she went (was sick for a while so we were able to discuss everything) that we could do anything that we wanted with the inheritance and just wanted us to be happy. Obviously, this is not enough for us to retire early, but makes retirement easier for us in the future. 

Anyway, my situation:
-36, married, wife is 31.
-No children currently, plan to have 1-2 in the next few years, but maybe not?
-Own a home in up-and-coming area, fully paid off, worth probably $200k, probably $300k in 5-8 years if trend continues.
-Have $10k in savings
-Just recently began my own business which does not currently pay a large salary (maybe $25k/year?) but I don't lose money. Wife is in service industry, makes $35-40k/year.

What we inherited:
-$15k cash
-Apartment on Long Island, worth $180k, Mom was planning to sell it this year, it's a co-op.
-Fixed Annuity - $201k
-IRA - $130k
--Home full of old-lady stuff, worth probably $250-300k, fully paid off. No idea how much stuff is worth, but I do know it's awful emotionally to clean out and every day is pretty terrible, so probably won't be selling it anytime soon.

We live (and she lived) in NC, so there is no inheritance tax. We also got a bill the day after she died for about $20k in taxes (federal/state). 

NO idea what to do from here, we've spoken to a probate lawyer to get the stuff switched over or whatever, but that's a process, I guess. More curious about what I should do with IRA/annuity, just leave it? I don't think the economy is going to hold up, so the idea of having $400k in the market doesn't seem palatable, but it seems like it would make sense to leave it for our retirement. We'll probably sell her property so that will make for about ~$700k that needs to go somewhere, so I'm basically looking for advice on what to do with it, something that is fairly safe, but doesn't necessarily rely on the stock market booming to stay at it's value.

Instead of paying this off now I could put the money into the stock market, highly diversified in the S&amp;P 500. The S&amp;P has historically had returns averaging to 7%.

This means you should get a return of 5% that you can use while re-investing the other 2% to cover inflation and protect your wealth.

60,000 X .05 = $3000  

^ This number will slightly increase with the 2% re-invested for inflation.  

12 X 355 = $4260  

What I would need to pay out of pocket per year: $1260  

^ This number would slightly decrease over time  

60,000 X .02 compounded annually for 25 years = $98,436.36

I realize that this still requires me to pay $31,500 in total but I could wait until I have more cash in bitcoins or actually manage the funds in the stock market and probably get better than 7% returns.

The greatest part about this is that I will still have a big stack of cash after 25 years and will be able to put it towards my kids education or keep reaping the extra $3000 inflation adjusted per year in income.

Do yourself a favor and run these numbers before becoming debt free and poor! If you want help, post your debt total, the lowest monthly payment you would need to pay and the term. I'll reply with how much starting cash you would need to cover the monthly payment completely with a 5% return.

Edit: Formatting

Side note: You will also have to consider the interest rate of your loans. If the rate is high it might be better to just pay it off.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,25 - In a lot of debt,"So a little about me:

I graduated college 2 going on 3 years ago with a civil engineering degree, and accumulated a LOT of debt in college. I did not know how to spend money and ran into a lot of personal issues such as car accidents, paid rent with credit cards, etc.- but I took the necessary steps to help myself and try to get my life back on track. 

I currently make $65,000 a year in California. However, I took a bunch of loans and have 2 credit carts with big balances to help me in college. They are: 

* Credit Card 1 - $6170 
* Credit Card 2 - $4158
* Bank Loan 1 - $1776 
* Bank Loan 2 - $7343 
* Federal Student Loan - Monthly Minimum Payment of $270 for the next 8 years. 
*Rent - $900 a month roughly. 

What are the necessary steps for me to take to get out of this debt? It feels like I'm saving very little money with every paycheck, and I'm struggling to get by. I try to cook as much as I can, and stay away from big spending on useless things, but a big reason I'm in this hole was I was a huge, and stupid gambler. I've only just recently kicked the habit.

personalfinance,Using Cash app for saving?,"Hi pf! My best friend and I are going on vacation next summer and have started saving in advance. We both use Cash to send money to and from one another on a regular basis and had the idea of making another Cash account to hold our vacation funds. I made it with an email I created specifically for the account, and my friend is able to log in anytime by entering the email and then the authorization code sent to the email. 

I'm just wondering if this is a safe way to hold our money until vacation (Mid May 2018). We both have savings accounts but we would both rather keep our vacation savings separate from our regular savings. We also would prefer not to just have the money sitting in our checking accounts. We thought about doing old fashioned envelopes stuffed with cash, but we need the money to be accessible to both of us (we live in different states) and we need it to be available to use online for booking the hotel.

personalfinance,Question on a Personal Loan I took,"In January 2016 I was strapped for cash and needed an emergency loan.  I went to Circleback lending and took a loan out for ~$25,000 and had it set up for auto-withdrawals from a credit union account I had.  

Since the initiation of the loan, Circleback lending has gone under and sold all loans to another company.  Also, I have moved a significant distance from where I previous lived and I am thinking of closing my Credit Union account that is only located in my previous town.

Before I close my credit union account I would like to update my payment information for my Circleback Lending loan, however the website is now defunct and I cannot find information on who holds my loan or how to even access it.  I did a credit report for all three bureaus and the loan does not show up on my history/report.

What would be the best way to handle this?  I was thinking of closing my credit union account and when the lending company calls let them know the situation (moved, couldn't use the bank account anymore) and provide them with an updated bank account.  My concern is they will consider it a default and either increase the interest rate, demand the outstanding balance be paid in full, and/or put a negative item on my credit report, even though the loan itself is not on there.

Help is appreciated.

personalfinance,Advice for Multiple Short-term Loans over 3 Years,"Hey PF,

I'd like some input regarding my options when it comes to taking out short term loans for the purpose of financing a graduate school degree while I work. Here's some background info:

- At present, I have virtually 0 debt. I have no balance from prior student loans, I have no liens against my vehicle, and I rent. 
- I won't have to pay more than around $7,000 per semester starting with $5000 due at the start of next semester on 1/15. I should be able to complete the degree within 3 years or so. 
- I make $75k gross which translates to roughly $52.5k net or around $4350/month working full time. Between rent and other recurring expenses, etc., I pay around $2850/month leaving a potential $1500 in savings/loan payments per month. 

What I'd like to do is take out a loan at the beginning of each semester or perhaps every school year as necessary for tuition and pay it off within the year. My questions are as follows:

1. Should I attempt to minimize the number of loans I take out in order to avoid too many hard credit checks? Or should I focus on keeping individual loans small so that I can minimize interest accrual and pay each one off quickly?

2. If I take out multiple loans with the same financial institution, will they re-check my credit every time?

3. With regards to loan options, should I just ask for a private loan with one of my current financial institutions? Would it be wise to take out a loan against equity in my vehicle for a lower interest rate and pay it off instead?",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay off student debts? What do to with old pension and 401k from old job. Questioning my decision and moving forward,"Hello, wife and I are both 35 with a 2 year old and second on the way.  The only debt we have remaining other than the mortgage is her student loans which were almost 13,000 with an interest rate averaging 4%. We also have a car that is an interest free loan.

Today I set up a payment to settle all of the student loan debt.  That leaves us with 48,000 in savings.  We also have 11,000 in a Roth which I maxed out for this year (I wasn't too good about stocking it before).  

We both have pensions, I will likely be retiring at 50 and she will be retiring at 55-60 most likely.  The wife also has 24,000 in a 401k and 12,000 in a pension from an old job in another state. I would like to get those accounts consolidated but have to figure out how to do that.  

So here are my questions: 

1. Was it a smart move to pay off the student debt? Should I stop the payment and use the money elsewhere? 

2. With the debt paid off we have an extra $366 a month we can invest.  I think 48,000 plenty for an emergency fund and my job is pretty secure.  Where should be put the excess? 

3. Should I leave her 401k and pension alone or should I move it into another account.  Neither of us have 401k options where we work now.

btc,On the CME futures market,"So lot's of stuff going on regarding the CME market, and it seems a lot of disnfomation, figured I'd get my thoughts out there on the CME.

In my opinion, the CME market is pretty near unambiguously bullish. As in, there's a ton of positives and very little negatives. I've heard the arguments against, and it generally boils down to: shorters and manipulators.

Manipulation of the type many seem to talk about happens far less often then they think. Yes, a small market like a thinly traded alt coin or a penny stock on the pink sheets may be able to be purely manipulate by a single entity (or small group of collaborators). While Bitcoin is much smaller market then more mature markets like gold, oil, or stocks, it's still far too big for this kind of manipulation. It's not like there's a Secret Whales Club where all the whales get together and plot their nefarious shorting strategies. Could a whale enter a massive short and hope to profit? Sure, they could. But another whale (or just the collective action of the market) could just as easily have other ideas and despite the whales best efforts, price still rises, thus wiping out the unfortunate whale. And when this whale covers their huge short in a haste, we would expect to see huge rallies as the whale buys in a panic to cover their short. Whales get their asses handed to them by the markets just as often as everyone else. They just tend to lose more. There is no magicical ability for whales to remove their risk in the markets. Doesn't matter if you put $1 or $1 billion into a market, once you do it, you're subject to the same market forces as everyone else, and if you make a bad bet, you're going to get your teeth kicked in, just like everyone else. Markets are a great equalizer. It's just as happy to crush a plumber as it is a billionaire.

So sure, in theory, the possibility for this kind of manipulation exists. But it's just as likely it will fail (shorting a security in the midst of an extremely powerful multi year bull market isn't really a sound strategy)and if it fails, the whales panic covering will propel Bitcoin to even higher highs.

And of course, the same argument would apply to the other side. WE're all so worried about bogeymen manipulating the price down, but why couldn't they manipulate it up? That seems just as likely.

In any case, since we have no idea if this sort of thing is happening, since we would have no idea how to determine if it was, since it's questionable if it would even be successful, and since it's just as likely to be down to the upside as it is to the downside, the only rational thing to do is just discount this whole line of thinking as both unlikely and irrelevant. In theory, any market could be manipulated. If that's a major concern for you, you probably wouldn't be invested in anything. Just keep your money in the bank and enjoy that sweet sweet 0.015% interest rate. This sort of trade exists mostly in the minds of frustrated retail traders and not in the real world. Not because these people wouldn't do it if they thought they could get away with it, of course they would. It's that it's dumb, unlikely to work, and massively risky. THAT'S why it's not done in any significant way.

And if you're sitting there thinking about ""but how does he explain how the gold market is manipulated"" let me stop you right there. My type of analysis isn't for you. I don't subscribe to unproven conspiracy theories (i.e. gold market manipulation by globalist cabals, fraudulent Tethers etc) and I don't entertain ppl who do. If you have facts or hard data on the manipulation of the gold market or fraudulent Tether creation, by all means, post it below and we can analyze it. But if you want to be a successful trader you need to deal with facts, data, and objective reality. One of the primary reasons why the ""little guy"" tends to get crushed in the markets more often then not is that this type of trader is disproportionately likely to based their trading on conspiracy theories and other misinformation. This will get you killed. A good rule of thumb, if you heard about something on Zero Hedge or Info Wars, or any other similar source, it's almost certainly bullshit.

In addition, the bigger a market is, the harder it is for any single entity or cabal to manipulate it with predatory practices. Thus, any even that increases the size of the market will, by default, REDUCE the likelihood of it being manipulated.

As far as the concern about shorters, this is a little more valid in the sense that it actually does happen. That said, I think lots of people fundamentally misunderstand how important shorters are to a healthy, functioning market. They are an essential part of the price discovery mechanism, and making it easier to short something is a good thing and not a bad thing.

For one, shorters reduce volatility, and very often can prevent catastrophe, but the very act of cooling down an overheated market. Anybody who read The Big Short knows how difficult it was to short the subprime housing market in the mid 2000's. I don't think it's coincidence that subprime became such a massive bubble. I don't believe for a second that the 3 guys featured in TBS were the only 3 who saw this coming and wanted to short housing. I'm sure there were tons of ppl who saw it. The book documents how difficult it was to short. Would the subprime bubble have happened if there was a much easier way to short it (say, a bearish ETF or something)? Probably. But it's also very likely it wouldn't have been so painful because if shorters were allowed to do their thing, the bubble probably wouldn't have gotten so big in the first place. Shorters act as a relief valve on overheated markets, and this tends to reduce volatility and bring stability to markets.

In addition to this crucial service, shorters also provide another essential service by providing liquidity during corrections, bear markets and other sharp downturns. When the panic selling hits and all of a sudden the bulls are nowhere to be found, oftentimes the only people buying are shorts taking profits and covering their positions. This tends to make corrections less severe then they otherwise be, and end quicker then they otherwise would. So shorts aren't something to be feared. They keep markets from going up too far too fast (which tends to reduce the big corrections that Bitcoin is known for) and when markets DO correct, they tend to make for a softer landing.

Just look at the short interest over the recent big corrections, on November 13, and the most recent one, around November 29.

https://ibb.co/bC4PNw

The recent fall was around 25% and the November 13 correction was almost 40%. The most recent one saw shorters buy 10,000 coins during the correction to close their positions, and the November 13 one saw almost 15,000 during that correction. Those are massive numbers. How much more would the correction have been if those shorters weren't buying then? 50%? 60%? Obviously it's impossible to quantify. It would have been much worse without them though.

So, although it may be counter intuitive, allowing shorters easier access to the market is actually a positive for Bitcoin. I wouldn't call it ""bullish"" exactly, but I would definitely call it ""healthy"". Which can indirectly be bullish. A more stable, less volatile market with more steady gains and less huge corrections will likely, over time, attract more users who otherwise wouldn't be interested in it.

So we've looked at the two main worries, shorting, and manipulation. On the manipulation side, the CME market will make the overall BTC market bigger, which actually REDUCES the risk of manipulation. That risk still exists on some level, I guess, but it will be less after the 18th then it is before it, so this is not a valid concern. And as far as shorting, shorters are a crucial part of healthy price discovery, and we should be happy that more ppl will be able to short with this market. Not to mention that shorting is still niche trading behavior. MOST investors (and even many traders) will never short as a rule, preferring to be long only. Investors tend to have a bull bias as well. And traders are inherently trend followers as a group. Considering Bitcoin is still in a powerful multi year bull market, it is almost a certainty that the futures market will bring in much more buyers then sellers. CME traders aren't idiots. They're not going to look at the long term Bitcoin chart and be like ""yeah, gonna short this insane bull market"". They're far more likely to be like ""wow, now THIS is a bull market. Time to buy!""

So of all the concerns I'm hearing, none really worry me. On the bull side, you've got vastly increasing the universe of potential buyers which I fully expect will keep the long term bull rally in good shape. You've got the decreased volatility that will come with increased volume. You've got the increased brand awareness and prestige that comes with being listed on a major global financial exchange, crucial for building the credibility of Bitcoin into a mature, world class asset. Too many ppl today think Bitcoin is still a Wild West where anything goes. Things like this will go a long way to reducing that perception. And finally, the CME market is the precursor to a Bitcoin ETF, which will cause this thing to fucking explode. If the CME market will increase the universe of potential buyers significantly, an ETF will increase it exponentially.

All in all, I don't believe the CME market is anything else but unambiguously bullish. I cannot think of a single valid concern that is actually a problem.

I'm sure I'm missing a few other concerns, but if they get posted in the questions below I'll add them up here and try to address them. If I agree that they're valid concerns, I'll say so.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Not your average student loan application,"Hi I’m sorry for reposting this but I really need help with this and have received no feedback, I don’t currently have time to seek help from a student advisor so this is my only source of information.

I'm looking for some help in regards to my plan to apply for Canada Federal student loans in June and am wondering if I am on the right track with my current plan.

Just a little background, I'm 21 years old and currently work a full time job making roughly $36,000 annually. I have recently payed off my $12,000 car loan in preparation for starting university 1 next year in the fall semester.

I take home about $1080 bi-weekly and put approximately half of each paycheck into a separate savings account. The rest is split between bills, gas and personal expenses.

I have roughly $4000 in a trust fund for school and should have an additional $4000 of my own saved by the time I apply for my loans. I don't intend on using the $4000 of my own money towards school, but rather to keep it as an emergency fund.

I am planning on quitting my full time job to look for part time employment 3 months prior to applying for federal loans, partly because my income for the 17 weeks previous to my application is taken into consideration, and partly because I will need a part time job during the school year.

 Here is where things get tricky.

 I have to report my parents income on my application. My mom passed away and my dad is out of the picture (and makes barely any money anyways, close to $12,000 yearly from disability). I am wondering if i will still need to report his income and how i would go about doing that.

So my questions are:

1. How do i currently stand in terms of actually qualifying for a federal student loan?

2. How do i report my parents income in this situation?

3. Am i going about the job situation in the right way (quitting 3 months prior)?

4. Should i be applying for all 4 years tuition at once or take it year by year?

5. Should the trust fund be used towards tuition or other expenses such as books, parking pass, etc.?

I'm a little confused as to how they work. From what I understand, you purchase them at ""half-value"" and eventually, they become worth the value on the savings bond. Part of my confusion is that I checked their values and interest rates on treasury direct, and not all of the interest rates are the same. How are they supposed to each be worth $100 30 years from the issue date if they aren't even gaining the same amount of interest? Some look like they're earning way too little to ever reach $100 in my lifetime, let alone in 30 years. And what happens if the reverse is true? It looks like one of them will hit $100 before 30 years. Does that mean I still would only get $100? Or that I'd continue earning interest until year 30?

I have one savings bond from 2004, and the remaining are from 2007 to 2011. Interest rates range from 0.60% to 3.40%. My plan was is to invest the money, so they should all earn more than 3.4%.

personalfinance,New career planning. Best way to convert high infrequent pay into livable monthly income?,"Hi PF, looking for some help for 2018. Recently completed a job that will, over the next 3 months, pay out 160k +/- 10k.  I have already been paid some of this and I am withholding 30% for taxes. Total remaining net funds available to plan for are about 93k. TLDR: What should I do to best convert this one time payout to more monthly income, or less monthly expense? More financial details below. 


External factors: I am 26 and married with one child. This is 1099 contractor work so I have no benefits. Future work is impossible to predict, but will happen. It is weather based so frequency, intensity, and scale are factors in future pay. My spouse is a private school teacher netting  around 1,700/mo after deductions including 700/mo health for herself and our child. She does not have retirement or any other benefits other than healthcare. I have VA health insurance. 


Current financials: 15k savings account and 3k in checking. Approximately 3,500 in monthly expenses including an 810 mortgage, 200 and 400 for 2 car payments, and 120/week for childcare. Our loans total 145k for the house and 34k for the cars. The mortgage has the highest interest rate at 3.25%. There are no student loans or credit card debt. I have a business that the money will run through, and a tax account which I am contributing 30% into leaving me with the 93k.


My current plan: Pay off a 7k car loan to lower monthly expenses by 200. Set aside 10k for my daughter. Undecided on the type of account to use for this. I am leaning towards a Louisiana 529 plan, but unsure about what happens if she goes to school out of state or doesn't go at all. Use ~25k acquiring rental property. 10-15k properties are common here through sheriff sales. Remaining funds would be to make the property livable. The types of homes that can get you will rent from 500-750 here. In the event this jobs funds dry up prior to getting new work, rental income would put us close to breaking even on expenses. I am pretty set on the rental strategy, but wouldn't be asking for advice if I wasn't open to other ideas. Finally, pay myself 3,300/mo (based on 40k/year) to cover what my wife's salary can't and to start paying principal on outstanding loans. Finally, I am technically unemployed now until another job surfaces so I am considering substitute teaching. I have always been interested in teaching and I would retain the flexibility to leave when another weather event occurs. This could net me 60/day or up to 120/day if it is a ""long term"" assignment.

 I own a rental single family home in Los Angeles that gives me a positive cash flow of about $400 a month between the mortgage and rent, but between maintenance on the home and other things expenses related, I pretty much break even there too. 

My main question is, should I take out a home equity loan to pay down my balances and hold on to the house long term as an investment? Or, should I just sell the house (which I have about $180k in equity in......would probably go for around 660-680k on market right now) and throw the left over money into the stock market? Keep in mind since rental properties only have a 75% max home value you can tap into, I would only get about 40K if I did the loan. 

Really just looking for both the safer as well as smarter decision long term. I feel if I sell, sure I'd have access to a lot of cash and I could invest most of it, but would I regret selling the house if prices continue to climb in LA at current rate which is around 7-8% a year? Or, would I regret it more holding onto it, taking out the equity, having another balance to pay each month, then home values begin to flatline.......

personalfinance,[Los Angeles] Need help with figuring out apartment security deposit+interest balance,"Hi LA, my mom recently received back her security deposit + interest, and other fees (such as key deposit $15) after having lived at an apartment for about 20 years. The original security deposit was $300 and the interest included was $100.62. This is our first time moving, so we aren't really sure how the interest is accumulated. Is it correct that the interest is applied on a monthly basis after having lived at a residence for at least 1 year? If so, should we be receiving a lot more than $100.62? We were looking at this site for the interest rates: http://www.yourlegalcorner.com/articles.asp?id=102&amp; . I assume that our apartment was rent-controlled (built in the 1970's).

So we took all the necessary steps to enter in to a domestic partnership so that she could be covered under my company's health insurance. 

This past week I got an email from my HR department about imputed income that was going to be added in to my December's pay. What this email essentially said is that domestic partners may not meet the definition of a dependent in terms of healthcare coverage. Therefore, the cost of these benefits may be taxable to me at the Federal, State, and/or Local levels. Imputed income is defined as the ""full cost of employee plus domestic partner coverage, less the cost of the employee only coverage,"" so essentially just what the additional cost of adding her on to my plan came out to be over the course of the entire year. 

So my company is going to be paying me an additional $8k over my last two pay checks but will not withhold Federal, State, or Local taxes (but will withhold Social Security and Medicare employee tax). I guess I am kinda confused in general why I am getting this if I have been contributing to this every paycheck for the last year.

Current situation:

37 years old (turn 38 in 23 days)
Net income approx $24,000 per year (Underemployed—sucks, I know! This debt and uncertainty about what I want to pursue job wise have kept me from pursuing further education until now, and I am in a job now with possibilities for moving up, but not sure I want to stay with this line of work.

Per month, I will now have $356 more to save or put toward debt.
Zero emergency fund. Literally $5 in savings account. Very little in retirement accounts. Living paycheck to paycheck.
Approx $7500 in credit card debt on two cards. No other debts.

The Plan:
$200 per month toward savings—build emergency fund first, then save up for planned move to another part of the country by the time I’m 40 (two years from now), and put aside part for the first  REAL vacation of my adult life—airfare, hotel stay, guided sightseeing, the whole nine yards.  
$156–plan to put half toward reducing my credit card debt, and half toward making life between paychecks better until my credit card debt on one card is below $300 and on the other (larger balance) has been reduced by 2/3.

Wildcards:

Tax refund this year should be approx ~$1100.  Possible plans include putting it toward larger credit card debt reduction (has highest interest rate), elimination of entire smaller credit card debt balance (~$900), OR purchasing year’s worth of prepaid cell service (~$600), thus saving $60 per month in addition to the remaining ~$500 of the tax refund.

personalfinance,"60K behind on my mortgage. I can ask for a payment plan, or refinance. What's best?","I did my first \r\personalfinance post last week, and received excellent advice -- so I'm back at the well! Thanks for your expert help!

**Edit: Thanks for the feedback *and kick in the pants*, everyone!**

I didn't pay the mortgage on my rental property for a long time. I'm $60K in arrears; it goes up $4K/month. I can write a check for about half of what I owe immediately, and demonstrate that my income (social security plus rental income) will let me get the money to become current by April. The property has been referred to an attorney. I don't know how long it will be before the foreclosure gets serious. There is some danger that the foreclosure proceeds before April. 

There must be some public notice of the property's foreclosure status: a guy called up and offered ""private money"" to help me out. He'll loan me up to 40% of the building's value at 4.5% - a 30-year mortgage. My current interest rate is 5.75%. The property is worth about $1.2 million, and the mortgage is $260K, so 40% implies that I could take out ((1200000*0.4) - 260000=) $260K. I have no cash. The $260K could pay for a retirement home in a warmer locale. 

If I refinance, my P&amp;I would go from $2000 to $2600, reducing my retirement income of about $10,000/month by $600, which I can easily afford. My rental income will probably go up at least $600 next year. If I put the $260K in an index fund and earn the historical 7%, that will *add* about $1500/month (in unrealized income).

The rental property is a three-family, so I don't think a reverse mortgage is an option. I intend to keep the property until I die; it's my main source of retirement income (along with a lesser amount from another rental property), and I want to leave the building to my sons. AFAIK, refinancing is the only way to extract $$ from my $940K equity in the building.

My credit rating is about 500; I guess not paying the mortgage for 15 months looks bad on a credit report. ;)

Sorry for the long introduction! I'm trying to anticipate what you might consider important.

I'm inclined to take the refinance: I can take out $260 and pay a lower interest rate. If I do that, how would I look for a rate lower than 4.5% among private investors? The guy making the offer called me out of the blue. I imagine that there might be private investors who would offer a lower interest rate. Is there a web site where private investors bid for mortgages?

I am 65 years old. For planning purposes, I'm betting that I live to age 82, so I have 17 more years to live. Coincidentally, the existing mortgage will be paid off in 17 years. That means my sons will inherit $260K more than they would if I die tomorrow -- if I keep the current mortgage. If I refinance, then it looks like I'll add about $100K in equity by age 82, paying the refinanced mortgage for 17 years. That reduces the $520K refinanced amount to $420K; my sons would receive that much less upon my death. (Did I do the math right?)

I think it's OK if I only leave my sons ($1.2 million - 420K =) $780K instead of $1.2 million. I'll ponder that.

**I'm inclined to refinance. It stops the foreclosure process with certainty; and it lets me take out a big chunk of cash that will give me options. I don't know how to get any benefit from my $940 equity without refinancing.**

Good plan? Any advice? Suggestions?

TL;DR: Behind on my mortgage, I'm considering refinancing at a lower interest rate. I can extract $$$ from my equity with the refinance, which could be very useful. I wonder where I can find other private investors who might offer a better interest rate.",finance
personalfinance,Pay off Car vs IRA,"I'm a student, age 20, in retail management. 

I'm starting to question if I would benefit more from paying off my car or starting an IRA.

The car loan has $14k remaining, with a 5.19% interest rate. I could probably get this refinanced to ~3-4% through my bank, as my credit score has improved since buying the car a year ago. The maturity date is 10/2022.

I was thinking I could pay down the car fairly aggressively (1 year minimum, 2 years a more realistic time frame, 3 years would be sub-optimal but should be very doable.) But I could also take money and invest it into a Roth IRA (already do employer 401k to 6% match). 

I'm debating this more from a ""security point of view."" Paying off the car loan is a guaranteed return, gives me an asset in the value of the car rather than a debt, and it's a 2013 Civic so I could easily make the car last some time.

From a pure numbers point of view, however, the IRA could probably return more than 5.19% and I could do a large lump sum as late as (April?) for 2017. Compounding interest would work in my favor over the next 5 decades.

I've also considered finding a happy medium, where I make additional payments on the loan while also contributing some to an IRA. I'm simply looking for some others' thoughts on this, thoughts of those more experienced than I, and the only search result was from 2013 so I figured I could use some additional opinions.

Quick Edit: [Rates](https://i.imgur.com/IE0nK8J.png) through my bank are here. I have a 745 credit score according to Discover's FICO Credit Scorecard, so I imagine I'd get close to 3%.

I presently have $~1500 of disposable income and $2500 in my 401k. 401k options aren't the best, hence the desire for an IRA. I could probably come up with ~$2500 or $3000 to lump sum into a 2017 IRA before the deadline.",finance
investing,The new tax bill will cause the real estate market to rise.,"The [other](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/7h4qbw/the_new_tax_bill_will_cause_the_overall_real/) thread on this sub is filled with misinformation, and led to a very wrong conclusion on the potential impact of the new tax bill.

1. The other OP claims that property tax deduction is gone as part of the elimination of SALT (State and Local Tax) deduction, but it is [untrue](http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/02/pf/taxes/senate-tax-bill-passed/index.html). Both the last minute version passed by the Senate and the original version by the House keeps the property tax deduction alive, but capped at $10k. This will still benefit most homeowners in the country. Even here in high property valued SF Bay Area, due to the low property tax in CA, a $10k cap still means the first $1M in homevalue gets property tax deduction.

2. Mortgage interest deduction is *not* going away either. The recently passed Senate version of the bill kept the cap to be exactly the same as it is now, and the House version from earlier has a $500k cap on the mortgage (means only interest on the first $500k gets deducted). However it is widely expected that the Senate version to win and get passed as is.

Now getting two major misconceptions corrected, it leads to my somewhat incredulous sounding prediction: home values will go up, especially in high tax, high property value areas such as CA and NY.

The reason for that is now with the elimination of SALT deduction and most other personal deductions, home ownership is one of the few ways to get preferential tax treatment from the federal government. A combination of potential rental income, property tax deduction, mortgage interest deduction and the elimination of SALT deduction will make home ownership very appealing for high income owners in some areas.

Additionally, the new rule of owner only gets tax exemption if they live in a place for 5 years instead of 2, will actually hurt supply in the short term since some people will try to hold onto their place for a bit longer, despite healthy value gain. This will drive supply even lower in supply-limited markets like SF Bay Area.",finance

&gt;I am calling you to express my dissatisfaction with 

&gt;S.1241 - Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Counterfeiting Act of 2017

&gt;My dissatisfaction lies in its unfair and frankly reckless treatment of laws regarding digital currencies. This bill ""criminalizes Intentional concealment of ownership or control of a [digital currency/exchange] account."" The first concern which this statement should raise is how could such a law be enforced? Will the government smash in the doors of every American citizen who has ever purchased Bitcoin or even something as simple as downloaded digital currency software? If someone memorized the seed or password to their digital currency would they be charged with throught crime the likes of which seen in George Orwell's 1984? The recklessness of this statement truly meets no ends. Users of digital currencies would be stripped of their freedom an privacy.

&gt;Regardless of your stance towards digital currencies like Bitcoin, if this law were to pass shouldn't we expect dark money in the US dollar to be treated with the same level of militant enforcement? Should the government be able to invade the homes of private citizens in order to raid their mattresses stuffed with CASH. The Panama Papers and Paradise Papers prove that dark money and hidden cash is a major issue in this country.

&gt;Don't repeat the Executive Order 6102 which was meant to criminalize the possession of monetary gold by any individual, partnership, association or corporation. America is meant to be the land of the free and the home of the brave, not those scared of doing good old fashioned detective work to solve a crime. Law enforcement shouldn't need sweeping uncontrollable power to perform their duties as they have been done in the past.

personalfinance,Loans vs Home,"My husband and I are both attorneys, he makes $80k (plus 6k bonus last year) and I make $130k (plus 10k bonus last year). His company pays for health insurance and it's super subsidized, last year we had a baby and paid about $500 out of pocket. He puts away 6% of his income in 401k and I put away 4%. His company matches at 6% and throws in an additional 3%. Mine matches 2%. We put away $300/month in our savings on an ongoing basis. I have a decent budget going, and we don't spend on frivolous items, except the occasional treat. 

Sounds great so far except here is where the picture stops being rosy - I have over 300k in student loan debt and he has about 150k govt and 70k private loans. We also live in a super high property value state, where just to live in a decent school district, we shelled out $550k for a starter home. We are both on income based repayment but still pay about $2200 together in student loans a month to govt for both our federal loans and $600/month for his private loans, while not even making a dent in the govt loans. His private loans are refinanced and will be paid off in 9 years. Our mortgage is $3450. Miscel expenses add up to about 4k (cars, food, gas, fun). We essentially live paycheck to paycheck, with no money to spare at the end of the month. I have bills scheduled to a perfection so we never have less than 3k in checking. 

Here is what I need help figuring out - our property values have increased quite a bit from last year and our home is worth about $620k. We owe $540k on it (we used FHA to purchase). Should we sell the house and pay off our student loans before buying a home, and just rent for a few years and buy once we have paid down the loans in about 10 years? I'm wondering if we made a mistake buying a home while having student loan debt. Does it make sense to count on the equity of a home going up to try and use it to pay off student loans in a chunk? 

Our plan is to wait for 5-7 years, hopefully have the equity in our home go up by 100k or so, and pay off all his federal loans in a chunk, wait another 10-12 years and repeat with mine. Essentially we would add to our mortgage (hopefully at a lower rate than the average of 6% interest rate that our loans are at) and borrow against the house to pay off the loans little by little.  

I doubt we will get to a point where our loans would be forgiven because we don't work in public sector. The reason for this type of payment is we lose income based repayment if our income debt ratio exceeds a certain amount so we have to be careful losing that IBR status. 

Should we stop contributing to 401k and pay down student loans (this isn't really that much money, certainly not enough to pay off loans as a whole but may put a little dent in it). 

We have a safety net / savings of about $20k, but that's it. My 401k has $12k and his has $14k. We graduated law school 4 years ago, no jobs before then. We have about 25k in credit card debt (0% and 2% interest rate that we are making monthly payments on for dental work, furniture and a couple of house projects we borrowed for). We are both 30 if that helps. We won't have childcare expense until after about a year, but daycare will be another 1.5k/month.

personalfinance,Capital gains harvesting in down years,"I just wanted to share a strategy that my wife and I have used to take advantage of in down years when our taxable income has been lower than usual (one year with a large medical bill and two years wife was on maternity leave).

My wife received shares of AAPL as a kid and they are currently worth about $120k.  The cost basis is essentially zero so we would have capital gains of $120k if not for our strategy. In these three down years, we have sold stock every year to maximize our tax free federal capital gains (our state, MN, taxes capital gains across all tax brackets).

We do this by simply buying and selling the same number of shares at roughly the same time (wash sale rules do not apply because we are selling for a gain). We’ve increased our cost basis to $16k and will add another $10k or so this year.  I won’t keep doing this forever because I don’t want a cost basis of $100k (remember this isn’t entirely free because of state taxes) in the event the stock drops and we need to sell. But having a cost basis of $20-$30k will allow us to use the shares as a savings account (assuming all shares sold are held long-term) to draw money out if we need to. If the price drops slightly, we can sell a mix of old and new shares to create a net capital gain of about zero. If the price goes up (one of those good problems) we will pay far less in capital gains taxes should we need to sell.

And now for a question... when we sell $10k worth of shares at the end of this year, I have been thinking we should each take $5k and rebuy the shares inside our Roth IRAs.  Any reasons anyone can think of to say this is a good/bad idea?  Of course we would not be realizing the increase in cost basis in the same way (i.e. the cost basis will go into an account where cost basis is meaningless except as it relates to contributions).  Assuming we want to have that $10k in investments for retirement, it seems to me that it may make sense to simply move it to our Roths this year to maximize those contributions.

Bitcoin,Where I think btc is headed,"I see it like this. Bitcoin either reaches critical mass or it doesn’t. Critical mass comes when there are enough people invested with enough wealth, that holders start to demand outlets to spend their currency en masse. Shops see the value rising beyond all expectation and gladly accept the transaction fees with respect to future growth (relative deflation). No one ever needs to sell their coins to market directly. Fiat is not necessary, except as a means to acquire crypto currencies (which are sureproofed against the innefficiencies and ignorance of government fiscal and monetary policy). 

This point of critical mass is where fiat becomes irrelevant. Everyone wants in, and the only way to get in is to provide goods and services to those that have it, or pay high prices on the exchange. 

We end up with bitcoin as the emergent true store of wealth, and then by perspective, massive hyperinflation of every other currency as they quickly become irrelevant. 

It becomes the believers vs non believers, the conservatives vs the visionaries, the ‘extincters’ vs the ‘evolvers’. And if the believers win, we’ll have our better future. If the negatives have their way, then we’ve proved ourselves ahead of our time, for now. Because make no mistake, in my view there is no long term value in government currency.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Managing credit card debt - looking for a sanity check before I apply for a loan.,"Let me start out by saying, I have been lurking this sub for the better part of the year. And I have gotten some great insight. Just looking to make sure I am not thinking about my situation wrong.

So, I am looking to manage our debt this morning.  And strongly considering getting a personal loan to tackle the credit cards.

I am married, and have a child due in about 6 weeks (!!!)

I am currently the only income and will probably remain so for at least a few years.

Credit cards are currently very close to being maxed out (within 1000$ each on 2 cards) and very little in emergency savings (1000$) which is also really bad, I know.

So at the moment, I come within a few hundred dollars of breaking even in an ideal situation. But lately, I find myself using a credit card when checking account goes a bit low, so my balance hasn't gone down for a while now.

I really would like to have some breathing room, and not another high interest rate credit card. We had already done one balance transfer that, had 0% interest for 17 months, but that period has now ended.

I am confident that we have excess spending under control, but not confident that we will easily manage when there is a baby to buy diapers for and one of our cars breaks down.
A detailed breakdown:


* Income: $60k  (about 3000$/mo after taxes and 401k contributions)
* Mortgage: $81k remaining (650$/mo)  3.125%apr  -  $120k estimated value
* 2 cars, but we own them both. 220$/yr registration fee coming up in 2 months
* Credit card 1:  $11000 (270$/mo)
* Credit card 2:  $4000  (110$/mo)
* Wife's credit line:  2000$ (100$/mo  fixed)
* Utilities/phone/insurance: $800/mo
* groceries/house supplies/medications/etc:    $600+/mo
* other misc expenses: varies
* future expenses including baby/hospital bills,  and USCIS/lawyer fees, as my wife is Canadian and has to renew her green card this coming year (8 months from now). 


In addition, I have started to receive medical bills that were not fully covered by insurance related to my wife's pregnancy. Its pretty good insurance (work paid HMO), but so far, 32 weeks in, have gotten about 600$ in bills. I will be calling their billing dept to ask them for help. I have heard you can generally negotiate medical debt. And I know that there will be an even bigger bill once our baby is born.

I do expect a good sized tax return (~4000$), will file as early as possible, That should cover the lawyer and filing fees next year, as well as hospital bills.




Just playing with numbers on PNC's website (I only went there because they are who I have a checking account with and one of the credit cards), they suggest I would have 8.5-9.5% apr on a 60-month $15k loan with payments around 310$/mo

There is also a $20k loan with the same apr and term for 410$/mo

I feel like I would:

Take $15000 loan
Put 3000$ aside as an emergency fund
Pay off her credit line  (100$ removed and one less bill to pay)  
Pay off the 4000$ card (higher interest rate)
Put the rest on the $11k card (leaving about 5000$ left on it)

If I take out a $20k loan, with the numbers above, I would roughly eliminate the debts and save about 60$/mo and have 3000$ savings to boot.


Does this seem reasonable? Is there elsewhere I should be looking for a loan? Is there another option (besides remortgage - I don't want to do that) I haven't thought about?  Does one of the loan scenarios I laid out sound better than the other?",finance
personalfinance,23 y/o living alone making $41k/year - should I move back home for a while to pay back $27k in debt and start saving? Is moving back with your parents worth it?,"Hey /r/personalfinance!


**I have a big dilemma in front of me - I am 23 and currently taking home 41k/year ($3416/month) after tax (pre-tax is about $58k), and I am wondering if I should move back home to save money and pay back my debts.**
------
------

I started living on my own after high school, as I was tired of living with crappy roommates and so as soon as I got what I thought was an ok-paying job (with no dependents/or significant expenses) I went ahead and rented an apartment by myself.

As this was the first time I lived entirely on my own (I had only lived with roommates etc or at home up to that point) I had to start entirely from scratch, and had the (in hindsight, bad) idea of purchasing all the the furniture and various household items that I wanted straight away when moving in as I thought it’d be worth it to have everything I thought I needed from day 1 and just pay it off in 1 year.

4K 75” TV, home teathre, shelves, books, lamps, plants, furniture, kitchen supplies, beds, sofas, fridge, freezer, washer, dryer, tables, bookcases, and all sorts of things later I ended up using all that I had saved ($3-4K), and with $14k in debt all in all (loan at 12.95% EAR)

On top of that, because of things I shouldn't have purchased, misc. emergency expenses and unforeseen circumstances, I also ended up with $13k of credit card debt (6k at 0% EAR for 6 months and 7k 11% EAR)

I also have my student loan at 5 years/$8k left, though with an interest rate of only 1,75%, so paying this back beyond minimum payments hasn’t really been a priority.

-----

**My fixed monthly expenses are:**


- $1400, rent+electricity/water
- $280, transportation (fuel, insurance, toll roads, maintenance) 
- $300 groceries 
- $150 phone, internet, tv/music streaming etc

(I should add there is little room for cuts here, all of this is already at the bare minimum for the local COL)

This means that in living expenses only, I am at $2130/month. Realistically, it’s more than that as I always have at least $50-200 in various costs popping up once in a while.

This leaves me with $1200 a month to pay off my debt. And that’s without any fun money, no traveling, never eating or going out, or buying any gadgets.

At this rate, I’ll have paid off my $27k debt in 27 months, provided nothing major breaks down, and I still never go out/travel/buy anything new. Which seems sad and unrealistic.

—

In short, even though I really enjoy where I live and my material possessions, I feel trapped by debt, and as I sit down on my $1k leather sofa watching the 75” 4K TV I just had to have (spoiler alert: I didn’t really need it and should have gotten a cheaper one), I wonder in unrest each night if I should just cut my losses, sell everything I own, and move back home.

If I sold all of my furniture, gadgets and misc. stuff, I estimate that I’d end up with 7-10k (this is realistic from experience), in addition I’d also get my $4k lease security back and could also return some other items that I purchased for full price thanks to extended return policies for $5k.

—

I have thought about this for some time, and came up with the following:
---


**PROS of moving back home:**

*   Only cost of living would be transportation, $300/month, giving me $3k+ a month to pay back debt/save

*  By selling/returning everything and terminating my lease I would end up with $16-19k in cash with which I could pay off a large portion of my debt.
*  With this and the money I wouldn’t spend on rent etc, I’d be able to pay back my debt in just a few months, and I could then save/invest aggressively, building up a nice nest egg in 12-36 months.
*  Helping out my aging parents/spending more time with them, time is going by quickly and they are not getting any younger

**CONS of moving back home:**

- Losing my independence to a great degree
- Living in an objectively worse, much smaller place, with a longer commute and in an area I don’t enjoy as much
- Losing all the comfort and enjoyment that I get from my lifestyle/furniture/items/gadgets.
- Higher stress, being limited in my preferred lifestyle choices/activities, due to lack of compatibility with living at home
- It'll be a great time/energy consuming hassle to move out from here and sell everything, and likewise when I later want to get back on my own
-  Stigma/social aspect of going back home (it’s often frowned upon)

I should also add that my job is not very fulfilling and I would like to save up enough to be able to cover 3-4 years worth of living expenses in the near future (at a much lower COL than my current one) freeing up time from my day job so that I can go off on my own starting my own business and/or freelancing. 

This sort of “starting capital” would easily be achievable if I lived at home for 2-3 years.
However if I keep doing as I do now, it'll be at least 5-8 years before I have any sort of capital put aside..

—

Ideally I’d much rather stay where I am, but I’m finding the financial and future implications (as well as remaining stuck with increasing debt) very concerning.

**What do you guys think? Should I just suck it up, cut my losses, move back home and pay back my debt/start saving towards my goal? Would you, if you were in my position?**

**I realise that I alone can answer this question, but I would highly appreciate any inputs/thoughts, or experiences if any of you have been through something similar before.**

**Thanks!**

personalfinance,How should I manage my new $125k/year salary (24 y/o)?,"**Situational Background:**

Hi I recently got a new job and I will be starting the second week of December. I am currently making $70k but I just signed an offer for $125k with a new company. (A year after college, I decided to make a career change. I moved back home and started learning computer science. After a year of practicing and doing projects, I was able to get my first job in the field, the job I currently hold at which I make $70k. After working there for a little over a year, continuing to practice at home, iI started interviewing again in the fall and was able to land an offer from the company I will be starting at in less than 2 weeks.)

**Personal background:**

Im 24 y/o, live in Seattle, and pay half of the rent on a $2400/month apartment. I have ~$50k in loans (all to my school and the government) and am paying them back at a constant rate of ~$450/month. The highest interest rate of all my loans is 6.8%, fixed. The rest of my loans range from 4.3% to 5% interest rate, all fixed. I only have one bank account, joint checking and savings, with $8k in it. I don't have any 401(k), investments, or stock. After taxes, I currently take home about $3400/month, and save ~$1200/month of it. I would say I live pretty comfortable and **don’t** see myself wanting to spend more money eating out or enjoying night life, so I really want to start saving/investing.


**So what exactly should I do with the extra money I'm making now?**

Should I pay off my loans at a quicker rate, begin saving for a house, start saving for retirement, start investing, etc? Most likely, the answer is a combination of a few or all of these options, but further detail on how much I should contribute to each would help.

Also, I don’t require a personal answer to this question.  So if you know of another thread where OP’s situation was similar to mine, I wouldn’t mine just a link to that post.  Thank you.


**Bonus Question:**

How much should I contribute to my new/first 401(k) based on my company’s matching?

In the benefits package, the terms concerning the 401(k) matching are as follows:
&gt; [Company Name] will match 50% up to the first 12% for the first six months of the calendar year and 13% for the second six months of the calendar year; capped at $2,500 per year. Full vesting occurs after 1 year of service with [Company Name].

Based on that, what is your advice on how much to contribute? At first I thought, that if I put in 12% of my $120k ($14.4k), they would put in 6% ($7,700k), but I then saw that their annual cap is $2,500/year. So does it make more sense to put in less, maybe 7% or 8% and use the remainder of the extra money from my paycheck (but obviously post-tax) to save for a house/retirement/loans?


**Bonus Bonus Question**

Should I get a credit card? I don't really think I need one but my friends say I should get one to start building credit. I have been paying off my loans now for about 2 years to 2 institutions (my school and the government). Isn't that helping me build credit?  Is not having any credit beside my student loan based credit bad?

financialindependence,The tax torpedo. I didn't find anything in search but this could be huge for a lot of you.,"Some of this depends on your income and the source.  But potentially it could look like this.

https://i2.wp.com/gocurrycracker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MargainlTaxWithSSHigh.png?ssl=1

Basically it's 1/2 your SS income plus your pensions and pretax income and I think pretax interest like from muni bonds.  https://www.ssa.gov/planners/taxes.html

**It is NOT indexed to inflation so it's basically a bomb for later retirees.**  Especially anyone with pension or pretax 401k dollars.

The long and the short of it is you reach a point were basically taking 1 dollar out of your pretax retirement account leads to it being about $0.55 post tax.

This http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvhmyUgLq64&amp;t=8m20s
does a pretty good job explaining it.

I get that total tax rate is still low.  However this is potentially going to hurt me a lot. Which means my pretax 401k dollars are going to be hit a nearly 50% taxation on the way out due to the face my SS will be taxed.  And remember it isn't indexed to inflation.

www.calcxml.com/calculators/how-much-of-my-social-security-benefit-may-be-taxed

https://smartasset.com/retirement/florida-retirement-taxes

That second link is pretty helpful.  Use these numbers and I'm punching in predicted numbers.  75k social security when we retire (who knows in 30 plus years but whatever). 

Total tax rate on 75k SS is 0%.

75k SS and 10k pretax 401k.  Tax is still 0%

75k SS and 20k pretax 401k. $1981 in tax.

75k SS and 30k pretax 401k.  $4756 in tax.

75k SS and 40k pretax 401k.  $9027 in tax

75K SS and 50k pretax 401k.  $13652 in tax.  So you took out 10k more and only got to keep $5375.

I'm likely switching over to the Roth 401k at this point as my current federal tax rate is 15%.  Plus the Roth is going to give me greater flexibility come retirement.  Especially if I want to buy some land or go one big vacation later in life.

I know the overall tax rate is still very low.  However I'm indexing my predicted SS benefits for inflation.  So in 30 years even with low inflation my SS benefits are set to be about 1800 in today's dollars.

If you are RE you it might make a lot of sense to start rolling pretax 401k dollars into the Roth before taking SS.",finance
Bitcoin,Fundamental Questions &amp; Discussion - Please Help Me Understand Bitcoin,"Hey everyone,

So I've been thinking about Bitcoin for the past few days quite a bit. The price keeps rising at an incredible rate and people seem so enthusiastic about it. 

Before buying into it, though, here are some fundamental questions I've been thinking about (but don't have an answer to). I appreciate anyone taking the time to answer, and I'm sure it will be helpful to many others as well!

What do I need Bitcoin for?

What can’t I do already that I can do with Bitcoin? I’ve never made a payment with Bitcoin, and never felt the need to. What have I been missing? How will my experience of buying from Amazon, or at a local grocery store, or paying my bills, or sending money to someone, be different with Bitcoin in terms of convenience, speed and costs? Is that something that traditional banks or current payment processors are going to be unable to replicate?

I can send the money somewhat anonymously (although not completely, right?), I get that, but what practical use is that unless I’m doing something illegal? Since Bitcoin is not totally anonymous, and since governments around the world (including the US) are getting increasingly interested in the identities behind customer accounts at Bitcoin exchanges, is anonymity a strength at all (and if it is, will it be that to a lesser degree in the future)?

Is the value of blockchain technology (which, to my understanding, only releases its value once you build something on top of it, am I right?) being confused with the value of Bitcoin? Why is Bitcoin the big thing instead of the other similar options (I assume one reason is because it has gotten over the hump and people are already using it all over the world, which would be difficult position for a new coin to get into?), and why do we need a ”cryptocurrency?”

How much does the world economy help Bitcoin right now and what will the effects of a downturn be? We have incredibly low interest rates, for instance, and households being in record debts in many countries. When rates increase, people face higher interest costs and start running out of savings, won’t they go to their bitcoins to get some more euros, pounds, and dollars? 

How can Bitcoin handle a sudden rush of conversions from Bitcoin to fiat currency? You can’t edit the amount of bitcoins all of a sudden to deal with a sudden increase in volume (a big part of the reason for its volatility, I assume?). Will the system be able to handle that without absolutely crashing? Could people lose their faith in the idea of getting rich simply by purchasing some bitcoins in such a situation? And then what?

The people I know who’ve invested into Bitcoin do so because they expect the value in dollars/euros to rise. They don’t invest because of the technology, or because want to use bitcoins in the future; they invest because they want to make more dollars and euros. Now you might argue that it doesn’t matter if they invest for the right or the wrong reason, as long as there is a real reason for the value of Bitcoin, and I agree. But I still wouldn’t take people buying bitcoins for no good reason as a sign of confidence in the long-term success of Bitcoin.

Also something I’ve thought about regarding the people who’ve bought bitcoins: are they ever going to be able to sell, considering the price is always supposed to go higher and they fear missing out of future profits? For the majority of these people, do bitcoins ever translate into real money?  Or will, at some point, people start thinking differently about Bitcoin, and perhaps start to treat it more as a usable currency rather than an investment? I assume this requires for the volatility of Bitcoin decrease. But will that be possible when there's only a limited amount of them available?

If anyone takes the time to answer these questions, THANK YOU!",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,"BCH fork was an instance of taxable, ordinary income","You're not going to like this folks. There is a strong case that that the BCH which ""became yours"" on 8/1/17 is taxable income at the instant of the fork, regardless if you subsequently sold it or not. See here: https://bitcoin.tax/blog/how-to-tax-bitcoin-cash-bch/

That is, ordinary income like mining. Not a capital gain. As a perverse side effect of this, it means everyone has to report implicitly how much BTC they had to the government. Good chance the Feds will go apeshit wanting to investigate everyone's hodlings so that this can be assessed.

It looks like BCH started trading at $277 so that's the figure you would have to multiply all your coins by.

If you traded your BCH for BTC or another crypto, there is a possibility that this *subsequent* trade might qualify for like-kind exchange, but you still have to report the income at the time of the fork. I have offered that argument [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7h87mc/im_likely_one_of_the_coinbase_14000_that_the_irs/dqp1jf1/?context=3).

personalfinance,"Music Producer, Debtor, Vagabond","The guys over on [my TIFU thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7h2i8r/tifu_by_sleeping_in_and_losing_my_sleeping_spot/) suggested I post here.  I don't know how much detail to give, so I'm just going to be somewhat of an open book.  


Disclaimer, I'm a vagabond at the moment.  Feel free to read how I got to where I am, or you can look directly at the current situation part.  


**History/Habits**  


The story starts about 2 years ago.  My credit score was in the mid 700's, I was pulling between $1,500 and $2,500 a month between my three jobs.  One of these jobs was a gig producing music, which would get my name out there as a producer.


I bought a car (with a good interest rate, thankfully), and a computer on two credit cards.  At the time, I was still well within my means, and would have the cards paid off in about four months. 
I would have waited longer on the computer, but I had a music production job lined up.  It required me to take action immediately, as I didn't want to lose out on other offers that this completed project might help me get.  


I then moved into an apartment.  Again, still living well within my means.  That being said, this may have been my first major mistake - I signed an apartment lease with two other people who weren't in the same financial boat I was in, and things fell apart in every direction.  


Long story short, paying for rent myself and playing catch up, I maxed my credit card paying for groceries and missed my payments, so my interest rates skyrocketed and my nice credit score dropped.
I managed to move out with a financial blow, and my girlfriend and I got a place together.  I paid for my debts and half of the overall cost of living, she had the other half of that.  Slowly but surely, I was paying off those debts.  


She suggested I quit one of my jobs so I could focus more on producing music, as the other job I had paid enough to cover my half of things and my bills.  I'm an idiot, so I did that, and we coasted.  


Then I totalled my car, which essentially unlocked all of the problems in our relationship.  So in a two week period, I lost my car, apartment, cat, girlfriend, and my work laptop and headphones broke.  I moved out with some family friends for a bit.  I was lucky, my dad had a spare vehicle he was trying to get rid of, so he shipped it to me.  


I decided to sleep in my car.  I don't want to discuss too much of the philosophy, but I wanted to learn how to handle myself instead of having someone bail me out.  At this point, my credit card debt existed for a year, three times as long as I had initially believed it to be.  That album I produced never got released, by the by.  Sure, I got paid, but using it as a demonstration of my ability was not as likely an option.  

I decided to move back to Nashville, where I have music connections and a decent support group.  For the second time, I moved in with someone I should not have, a friend who was having money struggles who would use the help.  This person I knew for about 7 years was not the same friend I had in college; he ended up trying to cheekily sell me his car for $500, a car that he failed to mention (until it slipped) that was more than likely about to break down at any moment.  In other words, I moved in with him in a less-desirable situation, gave him the last of what I had for rent, and then he was willing to screw me over for $500.  

So I moved out.  I didn't tell him I figured out what was going on in his head, that I didn't trust him; it didn't really matter at that point.  A good friend of mine let me stay with him rent-free for two months until his lease ended, as I was now really behind on bills.  

I got a job (current) at a hotel.  Based on the pay, I should have had just enough to buy a cheap vehicle to sleep in as well as catch up on things.  The job was offered to me on the spot, but the actual job itself didn't start for two weeks, which was the last problem I needed.  

While this may be a very open, honest, post, at the time my situation was very hush-hush.  

I decided if I wanted to be real about my situation, I needed to let it happen - I took on the role and title of ""vagabond"", which I have had for just over three months now.  I released an EP that didn't turn out how I wanted it, but will be re-released in a few months, so much for that!  Meanwhile, I've been filming everything since mid-way through the sleeping-in-my-car period.  

I don't want any sympathy or handouts, to be clear, but I am sharing my story in case anyone notices any habits that I may be missing that I need to hear.  My situation is only going to be better if I start with myself.  

**Current debt**  

I have the following debts;  

$63,000 - Student Loans (5.5% interest)  
$2,300 - Credit Card 1 (28% APR, $2,000 limit)  
$5,000 - Credit Card 2 (24% APR [I think], $5,000 limit)  
$4,000 - Back Taxes  
Fico Score - 637  

**Current monthly payments**  

$80 - Student Loans  
$80 - CC 1  
$150 - CC2  
$200 - Taxes  
$100 - Phone Bill (I owe on a phone, can't leave contract yet)
$82 - Storage Unit  
$55 - Monthly Bus Pass
$20 - Gym (so I can still shower)  
$16 - Google Play (I prefer to keep this)  
As far as food, I eat a lot of fast food and canned food.  I try to keep it cheap, but it's hard as I can't really meal plan on the streets.  

**Make Money Money**  

I have a job that makes $11 an hour before taxes at full time, so I'm pulling in roughly $1,000ish a month.  
I have an opportunity for a second job, but I don't interview until the 18th.  It's a music teaching job, so probably decent pay, but I'd have to slowly build my hours/studio over time.  
There's also a possibility that I can work at a fast food restaurant for $10 as well, kind of by random happenstance, I haven't really looked for any other bottom-rung job.  If I can get the time and connections, I'd love to get back into music production as the pay potential is great.  In theory, one good contract in the right place could pay it all off, and give me a chance to start over and make better spending-below-my-means choices.  Besides the point, not why I'm here, but need to keep some time open for that.  

Life's a little harder right now, as most normal things take more time, especially travel, music practice, getting food, etc.  Anyway, what are your suggestions, guys?",finance
Bitcoin,I think a new Exec. Order similar to 6102 will be issued at some point,"I'm sure a lot of people know the history of the gold confiscation act in 1933.
I see a lot of people saying that this will never happen with bitcoin namely in a democracy (China), we're not on gold standard and they have no way of taking your wallet (true, but it'd be worthless).

However you need to really review the historic order and take note of the entire reason for it as well as other Orders and Acts at the time.  

https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/gold_reserve_act
http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=14611
&gt; Section 1. For the purposes of this regulation, the term ""hoarding"" means the withdrawal and withholding of gold coin, gold bullion or gold certificates **from the recognized and customary channels of trade**. The term ""person"" means any individual, partnership, association or corporation.

&gt; Section 5. Member banks shall deliver all gold coin, gold bullion and gold certificates owned or received by them (other than as exempted under the provisions of Section 2) to the Federal Reserve Banks of their respective districts and receive credit or payment therefor.

This Order was issued because gold was a direct threat to the power of the Federal Reserve and overall banking system.  
And no, we're not on the gold standard, but when you look at the reasoning for the order how can bitcoin NOT be viewed as the same threat as gold?  

I think that a new confiscation is not only a very real threat, but becoming more likely as the price of bitcoin balloons and as newer cryptocurrencies emerge.  

The start of this was when the IRS won the case against Coinbase and now Senate Bill 1241.  Make no mistake, these aren't about making sure people are paying capital gains taxes, but it to prevent money laundering and most of all keep currency centralized a la US FRS.",cryptocurrency
financialindependence,Does the 4% Safe Withdrawl Rate take taxes into account? Seems like it doesn't,"I've been researching FI/RE for the last couple months. This subreddit has been super great!

&amp;nbsp;

I've been calculating the amount of capital I need to retire.  
I understand the 4% / 25X rule.   
What I don't understand is that (as best I can see) it doesn't take taxes into account. If I'm missing something please let me know.

&amp;nbsp;

**Assumptions:**  
*Annual Spend Goal:* $80K  
*Federal Capital Gains Rate:* 15%  
*California Tax rate:* ~10% (I'm not totally sure if this is correct assuming I have no other income)  

&amp;nbsp;

Using just the 4% rule I'd need to save up $2,000,000  
$2,000,000 * 0.04 = $80,000  
This is very clear. 

&amp;nbsp;

But in this case, I would think I'm going to be taxed on the $80,000 I just turned from invested stocks into cash.  
Assuming a 25% tax, I have only $60,000 left over.

&amp;nbsp;

Really to have $80,000 for the year, I'd need to have $2,666,666 in investments.  
$2,666,666 capital * 0.04 swr  = $106,666 annual procceds  
$106,666 * 0.25 tax rate = $26,666 tax payment  
$106,666 - $26,666 = $80,000 after taxes.

&amp;nbsp;

Am I missing something? I feel like when I read about the 4% rule I don't see anything about taxes. Is it just so obvious that you need to account for taxes that it's not mentioned?

Personal finance has been very helpful to me reaching some of my goals this past year but now I feel as though I am standing at a fork in the road. My main goal is to secure my financial future with my wife I am trying to make the best decision on how to do this right now. Below I will list my current financial situation and plan going forward. Any feedback is welcomed and appreciated.

Age-28

Income- 48,000k gross for me and 26,000k gross for my wife. After taxes/insurances take home for me is $2566 a month and $1794 for my wife.

Townhome- $1150 a month (this includes mortgage, HOA, and utilities)

Student Debt- 45k federal loans at 4.6 interest rate for me. None for wife. My payments start in January. Currently I am going to pay $480 on the 10 year repayment plan. This sucks and is a definitely a thorn.

Car payments: None

Credit Card Debt: $150

Savings: $8000

Checking $650

401k and Investments: Neither my wife and I are contributing. This is something I plan on starting after we reach a $10k emergency fund for our savings.

**TLDR:**
**I don't know if I should throw extra payments at my student loans, invest , add to 401k, or build more of an emergency fund.**",finance

Bitcoin,Journalists keep getting Bitcoin analysis wrong,"In the rush to find adequate comparisons to describe the bitcoin phenomenon to the public, journalists are falling into logic fallacies and publishing out right errors. This includes comparing Bitcoin to equities like blue chip stocks, discussing future risks based on a small set of observations that will not hold relevant in the long run, and misinterpreting how any investment class assets obtain value in a marketplace.  Describing the risks of cryptocurrency investments is perfectly acceptable, but much of the mainstream analysis I read, simply doesn’t make sense. Let’s outline the most egregious of these misinterpretations. 

Bitcoin has no value because it produces no cash flow like stocks or bonds.
 
This is a popular one with old-school Wall Street, but it’s also one of the most flimsy arguments. This seems to ignore that many classically valued assets, including gold and fiat currency produce no cash flow in of itself. Let’s be clear, cryptocurrency is not an equity like stocks and bonds, it is simply a medium of exchange. The more wealth that individuals want to store in crypto-currency, the more the agreed value of the asset. Just like other world currencies, value has nothing to do with the tangible composition of the paper it is printed on. Usually the same people that will compare Bitcoin to blue chip stocks, will adamantly state that cryptocurrency is not backed by a government, like fiat currency, and therefore holds no similar nature. While I will not deny that the contractual backing of world currencies by nation states does play a substantial role in making fiat currency a viable medium of exchange, governments also subvert that bestowed value by regularly inflating the currency with new money supply. Government backing of fiat creates a legal fiction, asserting value where there would be none otherwise. But what really manifests the value of fiat currency is a long history of use and trade, a continuity which psychologically anchors the price of the currency with commonly purchased items. What ultimately separates fiat from crypto is simply ample time in use and adoption.  

Bitcoin is not real, and therefore holds no value

It’s interesting that the digital nature of bitcoin creates so much anxiety. Most of us barely use cash anymore, and only see our saving as digits on a bank’s website. We like to believe that somewhere there are big stacks of bills sitting somewhere, available if we need it. That’s not an accurate representation of money today. Money has always been about information, a tabulation of some exchanged value that can be verified by third parties. Perhaps we have always been uncomfortable with this idea, but it has been fundamental to modern economics. So rather than little pieces of green paper, or information that is validated by governments and its institutions, cryptocurrency is entirely tracked on the blockchain. Despite this differentiation, cryptocurrency fulfills the basic needs of a currency. 

Price volatility discredits the validity cryptocurrency and high prices mean we are overvalued. 

The argument is posed that the rapid price fluctuations of cryptocurrency makes it impossible to use as a form of money, and therefore provides no service and possesses no intrinsic value. First lets clear up why there is volatility. Right now there is unprecedented adoption of crypto assets. The market is doing what markets do, creating a price based on supply and demand. Since there is a limited supply of prime-crypto assets, markets can not possibly provide stable pricing while billions of dollars enter into crypto positions. Is rapidly expanding adoption really something that discredits the valuation? Tell that to any social network. Most of those that are long on crypto believe that the future use scenarios will be vastly greater than what is being accomplished today. Yes, it’s speculation, but it’s also highly probable. This also draws on the assumption that if the market for crypto is volatile now, it always will be. There is no reason not to believe that eventually these markets will gain equilibrium, and money entering crypto will level out with supply. I really don’t expect this to happen anytime soon. We are simply no where near mass adoption on a global scale. While $11,000 sounds like a big number for a single Bitcoin, the market cap of Bitcoin is simply too small to absorb the amount of fiat cash that is out there and looking for a home. We live in era of cheap money, low interest rates, and abundant capital with no where to go. We are just stepping into institutional support, with futures derivative trading coming online, and this has the potential to dwarf the activity of individuals. Will there be crashes and corrections, certainly, but cryptocurrency isn’t going away.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Should I pay off my car in full or pay it off monthly? ~$19k loan with 6.12% interest rate.,"I recently bought a new car and my loan on it is just under $19,000 in principal, with a 6-year term and 6.12% interest.

personalfinance,Consolidating Student Loans + Car Loan,"Alright, so I have a financial plan setup for the coming months, and I wanted to discuss it here to see if anyone can poke some holes in it or perhaps could advise me on some better alternatives or methods of going about it.

I will be graduating from college in the next two weeks and currently work as a student worker. I will be unable to work past the first week of January, *but* should be getting hired on as a full time faculty member afterwards. I haven't been given a pay estimation yet, but I assume at lowest it will be 30k a year, and at the highest 50k a year. I will graduate with 7.5k in Federal loans, and about 15k in private loans through Sallie Mae, a 3.5k at 7% interest, and a 11.5k at 12% interest (! ouch) for a total of 22.5k owed. My plan was to just consolidate these loans into one place to make it easier on me to pay them, and hopefully get a lower interest rate overall. *However*, I also want to move from my current rental home into a nicer one ASAP. The cost per month in rent wouldn't be much of an increase, as I'm paying $285 a month right now, mostly for location (2 blocks from the College), whereas I'm going to upgrade to something bigger and nicer on the other end of town. 

Currently, I have no method of moving myself other than renting a Uhaul truck. I currently drive a car that is under my dads name valued at around 6k. My plan is that when I consolidate my student loans, I want to tack on an extra 10ish grand and buy myself a used 2006-2010 Ford F150. I've done some research and found that 10k is a pretty average price point for these with 75k-100k miles in my area. I could then use this to move myself, as well as fulfill my need (okay, probably want) for a truck over a car. Currently, I have no plans to sell my car to help pay for the truck, but I am still a bit on the fence about it. I also have not run the idea by my dad, so I'm not sure how he would feel about it. Personally, I wouldn't mind getting rid of the car, it leaks coolant and burns off oil, which actually gets quite costly to upkeep. 

So TL;DR
Want to consolidate 22.5k in student loans, tack on an extra 10k, and buy a truck to help move myself in the coming months.",finance
personalfinance,Should I cash out my bitcoin and pay off a student loan or keep the coin to see if it increases?,"Hi! I put a little more than a hundred dollars into bitcoin in 2016 and I didn't end up spending it so it's just been sitting there. I recently heard about the increase in value so I went and checked and it's worth more than $2500 right now. 

I have 30k in student loans, but because my salary is so low I have $0 monthly payments on the ibr plan. I intend to still pay them off each month and focus on the higher interest rate ones. I have 15 total direct federal loans with interest rates from 3.4, 4.5, and 6.8%. The amounts range from $900 to around $2800 each. The smaller ones are the ones with the higher interest rates. 

Should I leave the bitcoin in there to gain more value (I know nothing about investing or bubbles though), withdraw and take out a student loan or two, or withdraw and make that my emergency fund (no savings yet). 

I'd be interested in leaving it in there and seeing what it can become, but I understand it's very volatile. If anyone has any advice on what would be the smartest decision, I'd appreciate it!",finance
investing,Buying vs Renting,"I live in the northern California in a small town Elk Grove about 15-20 minutes/12 miles from Sacramento, and want to move into Sacramento to be closer to work, friends, activities, basically everything I do.

I'm 28 going on 29 in March and when I graduated college in San Francisco with my bachelors I moved home to pay off student loans and save up a bit before moving out on my own again. Have a decent job making 50k a year, will get a guaranteed raise in May and then another in June/July to bump me to about 60k a year, and possibly a promotion to put me at 60k with the possibility for more raises. I have paid off my student loans, don't have a car payment or anything to speak of. 

Related/Unrelated - In February I bought a house with a friend and we rent it to his dad's business who pays the mortgage. They got a grant from the federal government to run a care home, that's the dad's business, so they were able to put like $120,000 in upgrades to the home paid for by the government for free, don't have to pay back. I cosigned and put down 30% of the down payment, and whenever I want to refinance and sell the home we can and I would get 30% of the profit from the sale of the home. I say that because I technically have debt in that home, but I don't pay a dime and I know if I were to get a loan they wouldn't count it against me since it's rented out and I don't pay anything on it.

Okay so my predicament. I saved up several thousand and was trying to move out in November, couldn't find anything so changed to December, and if I want something fairly decent I'm looking at paying $1000-1200 a month in rent alone. Which for my after tax income of $2700 a month is a good chunk just to rent. Still after almost 3 years living at home I want/need to move out. Commute is long, and I'm not a huge fan of living at home, though it has been great and let me pay off all my student debt.

This morning my older sister, 29 going on 30, also lives at home and after asking between her loans and car payment has just under $800 monthly debt, but will be combining the student loans to get it to just under $600 a month in like February or March. She makes about 60k currently and would get a raise sometime next year to about 63-65k I think. This morning she asked if I found a place yet and I said no nothing decent that I can afford, then said we should buy something. Pulled out a few brochures or whatever, and whether I like them or not the question is, it makes more sense financially to buy something with her than to move out on my own and rent right?

Seems like an obvious, yes answer. If we split the mortgage I'd be paying like maybe $1200 max if not much less per month, and I would own the place. It would be WAY nicer than anything renting for $1200 would afford me. So I'm hoping you all can tell me to quit being stupid, yes you won't live on your own but this makes way too much sense to pass up. As far as down payment she has around $15,000 right now, and I have $10,000. If we get something for like $400,000 might be able to get grants or help from parents, and by February we might be able to put together $40,000 for a down payment.

Tl;dr - It makes more sense financially to buy a place with my sister where I'd be paying at most $1200 in mortgage for a fairly nice place as opposed to renting a decent place for possibly $1200 a month, right?",finance

personalfinance,Advice on student loan repayment,"Evening everyone.

I have a bit of a nightmare student loan situation.

Approx 16k federal, 100k private. Yes private. And I know. 😔

Luckily, my IBR for federal is fantastic and affordable.

As well know private is much less forgiving. However, a stroke of luck and me constantly being in communication about my account and loan has earned me some flexibility with LendKey. My payment is now coming due, and the payment plan is putting me at 1300 a month (minimum)

Wife and I have adjusted our budgets, bought a house that actually reduces our housing expense by $400/mo, and drive two POS cars that I personally repair.

We forego vacations for ourselves and two children, don’t splurge on anything except for Christmas and birthdays of our children, and generally live pretty damn close to paycheck to paycheck.

We are very slowly building a savings, more like a trickle.

What are my options to make the repayment actually doable? Obviously increasing income, but let’s assume our income is not going to change.

For at least the next 4 years or so, my wife will continue not to work as it made more sense financially for her to stay home than work literally to pay for daycare.

I make 65k/yr, can expect a 2-5% increase per year, 5% into 401k. I do side gigs and stuff totally maybe 5k/year extra. 

Do I attempt the impossible and try for a bankruptcy? Do I refi the private loans for a longer term somehow?

Starting to panic as I’m going to assume Lendkey is not going to be so understanding much longer.

btc.help says they'll take $4 but if I try to pay with BTC the min payment the processor will take is 0.0014 which is almost $16.

personalfinance,Navient applied payoff amount to just one loan.,"I recently refinanced my student loan debt. There were 8 different loans with various interest rates. My new servicer of the loan sent Navient the full amount of all off the loans. Navient only applied the amount to the first loan and therefore I have a huge overpayment.

I feel that they are stalling. They will probably send me a check for the overpayment amount, wait for me to put it in my account and then make the correctly allocated payments, all while the remaining loans are building interest. I'm going to call them on my lunch break but my question is, am I responsible for the interest accrued on the other loans from the date that Navient received their money and applied it to just the first loan?

I know you can request specific distribution instructions when you make a payment and I tried to do this on Navient's website after the new servicer sent the money to Navient. In my mind, if the payment amount is enough to cover the entirety of all of the loans, it shouldn't have to be written out that it should be applied to all of them and not just the first one. Perhaps I'm the ignorant one...

What is the hate about?

Anyway, I do all my banking through them. I first set up my account with the help of my dad 2 years ago when I was 16. I have since separated the account from him, started a separate savings account, and a credit card.

Account details are as follows-

Bank of America Core Checking- No fees because I am a student under the age of 24. $1856.54 in this account. 

Bank of America Rewards Savings- No fees because I maintain a balance of over $500 daily and its linked to my checking. $6,999.59 in this account. 0.03% interest rate.

Bank of America Cash Rewards Visa- No monthly or annual fees, 1% cash back on everything, 2% on groceries, 3% on gas. $1.83 balance on this card. I usually just buy a soda or snack the within the first couple of days of the cycle and pay it off at the end of the month to build credit.

Any reason to switch to another bank? Honestly as long as they're keeping my money safe and not charging me any money it doesn't really bother me, but some of you guys seem very against them. 

How important is it to have a relationship with a specific bank? I feel like one day when I want to buy a house or car, my loyalty and history with the bank might do me some good. Is that even relatively true or am I dumb? At the end of the day I'm a huge saver and not much of a spender at all. Whatever account I end up having I will be responsible with, but I just want to explore some options.

personalfinance,Thinking of slowing retirement for one year in order to pay off the house. Good or bad idea?,"I am debt free except my house.  No kids, not married, late 30s and my income is around $80kish.  I currently owe $37k on my house and I've been putting nearly half my income into retirement for the past couple of years.  It occurred to me that if I slowed this down for just a year I could make a gigantic dent in my house. 

My regular house payments amount to about $6kish a year and about half of that is interest.  If I continue next year doing the same thing I've done this year I'll wind up owing $34-35kish on the house.  These are rough, spitball numbers of course.  If I dial back my investing to 5% I would still get a match in my company 401k (although not the full match I'm getting now) and if I cut back my lifestyle and some of the big ticket purchases/projects I like I can knock at least $20-23kish off the house.  Add the $3k principle that I would normally pay and I could go into 2019 owing $10kish or so on my house.  I'd then ramp my retirement savings up to what they are now as I could knock out $10k or so in a year even at my current savings rate.

The more I think about this the more it sounds like a good idea to me though I'm sure someone here will try to talk me out of it and that's what I want to hear.  I've googled around and the only good reason I've found to not do this is that I'm missing out on a 401k match.  I would generally agree except in my case I'm not pressing pause so I'm not missing out on a match entirely just some of it and I'm only doing it for a year after which I can spend the rest of my life tossing a house payment into retirement and have several decades to catch up to just that year.  If it was longer than a year this plan makes less sense.  Are there any other reasons I should consider?  I've already rejected the idea of keeping a house payment around in order to invest.  If I walk in front of a bus tomorrow and can't work I'd rather have a paid for house than a beefed up retirement account.",finance

My home is worth somewhere around $300K and I owe $190K on it still. My stock account has about $85K in it, so pulling $30K out would be a big hit. The stock account is not a retirement account, so there isn't any sort of penalty for pulling money out. 

My original plan was to pull the money out of my stock account, but then I realized the stock account is currently making more then the interest rate on a home equity line of credit loan.

I already contribute 15% of my income to a Roth 401k at work. Should I go ahead and pay off the loans more quickly than I need to? (Interest rate is around 4% average). It doesn't really make sense to save more than I need to at 1% interest or a bit higher in bonds, and I have my doubts that putting that extra money into stocks will net me 4% annually in the next 1-3 years (just a personal opinion). Safer stocks with high dividends could be an option but I'm already putting a lot in to the market through my 401k. Realistically I could pay off the loans within 1-3 years or could continue making the minimum payment for 10 years. I think the difference is around $1000-$2000 in interest.",finance

Monthly Income:  $11,072  
Monthly cost of living: $5,123  
No consumer debt

We are moving from House A to House B in January.  

As stated, House A has a value of ~$125k.  We owe $75k on it at an interest rate of 5.375%.  We are 8 years into a 30 year mortgage and can refinance for 20 years at 3.7%, lowering the payment by $140/month. 

Since we are using a VA Loan to purchase House B, we don't need to put anything down.  It is turnkey and a substantial upgrade from House A.  

We are both middle 30s and have only matched our employers 403b plans for retirement savings.

My question is:  Should we sell House A and pocket the equity or should be retain House A, refinance at a lower interest rate (3.7%), and rent it out?  
  
If we don't refinance, the monthly rental income would be:  
  
PITI: $720  
Repairs: $75*  
Vacancy: $100  
Capital Expenditures: $100*  
Property Management: $100

*Absolutely everything in the house is brand new, from the floors to the fixtures.  I don't anticipate anything other than cosmetic repairs for awhile.

Total Monthly Expenses: $1,095  
Expected Rental Income: $1,250 (area comps)  
Monthly cash return: **$155/month**  
Annual cash return: **$1,860**

If we refinance, the monthly rental income would be:  

PITI: $580  
Repairs: $75*  
Vacancy: $100  
Capital Expenditures: $100*  
Property Management: $100  
  

Total Monthly Expenses: $955  
Expected Rental Income: $1,250 (area comps)  
Monthly cash return: **$295/month**  
Annual cash return: **$3,540**  

Clearly, with our new income we will be able to throw extra money at House A in order to pay it off comfortably in the next two years.  After that, it would be an extra $500-$750 per month income (plus the equity).

Bitcoin,"Sometimes ""Moon-Missions"" Fail... A brief warning...","I wanted to write a quick post/mini rant to give some analysis of this subreddit...and perhaps a warning of sorts to some uninformed Redditors about BTC purchases, especially right now at 11k... 

*Btw, my background is as someone who owns/operates a marketing firm, so I see trends come in and out all the time and my day to day job is to capitalize on those trends, know when to quit, then jump on the next one FAST. Crazy as it may sound, I deal in U.S. dollars, and havent had any problems so far...

Anyway,

This BTC subreddit seems to be divided into a few different demographics...

- Your cocky guys who bought in super early, who are acting like they are Jesus reborn since they likely cashed out or are potentially trust fund/insurance babies to begin with...

- Your dreamers who probably bought too high with not enough invested, who will lose all of their hopes/dreams when BTC crashes (before the big money goes all-in, duh!)...

- Your armchair 2-3 week redditors who we will call ""speculators"" since their (perhaps unfounded) opinions likely sway more people &amp; coins than THEIR actual coins &amp; investments sway the market...

- Your ""I want to be spoon-fed EVERYTHING!"" sheep, who are basically waiting to be told to buy or sell (of course these people will hang around as they always will for any situation such as this)...

These demographics and the generalized ""mania"" surrounding Bitcoin are equally important to consider before making an investment that will likely tank hard before the banks come in huge. 

A warning from me to you: Sometimes ""moon-missions"" fail, and billions of dollars go ""ka-put"" - into the nothingness of space before another few billion dollars create the movement to success...Think Myspace to Facebook for example...

While BTC still does appear to be in its infancy and while yes, some are surely riding a euphoric wave of fast cash, I would caution most people from allowing the difference between concrete U.S. dollars and BTC to become blurred/mentally consolidated to the point where you are throwing down loans, releasing assets, liquidating other funds just to sink into BTC...

Its important to remember that the integrity of the people holding coin matters in regard to getting anywhere near ""the moon""...There are still hurdles to be overcome with BTC, regardless of how many early millionaires have been made.

My advice to those who may be on the fence about buying is this: 

1. Accept that you missed the early train... It's never coming back to the station.

2. Buy slow and steady, or budget your way in over time. Dont bet the farm because Wall Street will be coming in hard on the next dip to sweep out your stack of chips and lay down their own.

3. If you are buying high, HOLD through crashes. If the crash is devastating enough to where you feel financially compromised, you've invested too much.

4. The most important point... Until proven otherwise, you should have a solid income of actual USD WHILE you invest into BTC. Chances are that if you havent mastered making ACTUAL MONEY, you wont be able to master BTC just because you have the money to buy a coin at 11k.

Dont underestimate the power of REAL MONEY while BTC obtains its full footing.",cryptocurrency
investing,"Money is the ultimate, completely diversified, no fee ""ETF,"" if...","In this hypothetical scenario, an economy has one type of money that is accepted exclusively as the medium of exchange. This is not to say barter can't happen, but there is one intermediary money used for indirect trade. The supply of this money is infinitely divisible, so it doesn't matter how much of the money exists, but lets say for the sake of simplicity 1 Trillion of the standard units exist. The standard unit was chosen naturally by the market to make every day use of the money require simple math. For example, a cup of coffee costs 3 standard units, not 3,000,000,000 or .0000000003.

As the economy grows, people invent new products, come up with new scientific discoveries, iterate and improve the efficiency of current manufacturing processes, and build more capital goods that increase production levels relative to man hours and material resources, more goods and services are now available to be consumed. Because the money supply never changes, never goes up or down, there are still 1T standard units of money, and a lot more goods and services available, the laws of supply and demand would tell you, all else equal, this puts downward pressure on prices. You can now buy more goods and services for the same number of monetary units than you could before.

Because this society has a money that is universally accepted as the medium of exchange, your money has essentially been an investment in every business in existence. Money serves as the ultimate ""ETF."" It is completely diversified, there are no fees to hold it, buy it or sell it. It is invested not only in publicly traded companies but in every small business as well. Holding money is as diversified an investment as you can possibly have.

Edit: So here's another question to help get to the bottom of what's really going on with inflation and deflation: If the FED told everyone that tomorrow all dollars, coins, and bank balances would be multiplied by 10, would anyone's purchasing power change? I would say generally speaking no, everyone's purchasing power would be exactly the same as it was, except for the fringe cases where people don't realize what's happened, or businesses don't change their pricing accordingly quickly enough or people mistakenly think they have more purchasing power and then spend more. Is that a starting point people can agree on? If so, what is it about ""printing"" more money that makes it useful?",finance

I am going to school on a scholarship, and I pay for my books and gas (I commute to campus from the other side of town, typically around $100-$150 a month. I always hit up Thriftbooks and Amazon for my books, so I usually wind up paying around $200-$300. However, I only have three classes next semester in addition to part time student teaching, so hopefully books will be cheaper.). Because I’m on track to graduate without exceeding four years of school, my last semester’s tuition will be free. (Just a nice little thing my university does!)

I’m looking into potentially moving out soon and getting my own place. I love my parents dearly, but they’ve been hovering a lot lately. I want to try living on my own and gaining some independence. I’d like to seek some advice for how to go about this.

I currently have a part-time weekend job at a small retail shop. Business has been slow, so my hours got cut. I work 9 hours every weekend at minimum wage. So, around $300 monthly. I know that this won’t cut it for rent, but I’m looking into taking a second job. I used to work at a fast food joint for a couple years, then left. However, I told them I’m considering coming back, and they were thrilled. They are a very busy location and constantly understaffed, so I can get all the remaining hours I need from them. (This will also be at minimum wage, which is $8.75/hour in my state.) It will take some serious arranging with my class schedule, but it’s definitely doable. I also have about $5000 in my savings account, which I’ve been placing portions of my checks in for about three years now. If I work full time over winter break, I can add at least another thousand to that.

So, I’ve been looking at apartments. I’ve found a lot of studios and one-bedrooms with rent between $400-$600 a month. If I were to take a roomate, I could get a two-bedroom and pay around $400 a month as well.

I’m still on the fence about all this, but I’d like to educate myself. Let’s say I take back my second job and start making around $700 a month next semester.

Bitcoin,Interest rates are low = not spend on toys but spend on Bitcoin,"Interest rates are an all time low which actually worries me a lot. Lower interest rates means the government stimulates you to lend money and spend money to shift aggregate demand and pull the economy out of recession. They make more loans therefore use more of those fake cheques from the FED to be used for fractional lending. This means the FED prints more toilet paper inflating the supply, I think someone posted a graph of $ supply increasing  on the chart.

Not to mention that the FED is privately owned &lt; :(

My advice is to invest in these intangible currencies eventhough they might seem high. They are proven to be a better safety net.

*Preferably no minimum balance, and a decent interest rate.

*I'm thinking of possibly direct-depositing a part of my paycheck to this account so I don't have the chance to not do it, but it would be cool to also have the freedom to deposit cash/checks if needed.

personalfinance,Questions about my VA home loan and reducing interest.,"I’m looking at my statement and on $1,706 monthly payment I’m making $918.72 in interest every month and only $453.19 in principle payment.

Are these offers legitimate? What are the risks involved as opposed to the benefits? Is there a good company to look into the IRRRL program and reduce my interest?",finance
Bitcoin,Bitcoin value + FBI seizures?,"Disclaimer - I'm not super well-versed in the topic of cryptocurrency or economics, so forgive me if I'm misunderstanding something. 
I'm trying to understand why bitcoin's value is so outrageous right now. I also just happened to notice a few other bitcoin-related happenings that seem to have coincided at similar points in time. 

Right before the value surge of btc, Alphabay was seized by the FBI in June. In late July I believe (?), BTC-e was seized as well. Apparently, $4m in btc were seized from Alphabay and Hansa. ""45%"" of btc value was confiscated from BTC-e. I couldn't find the exact amount here that was seized.
I am pretty sure that the seizure of Silk Road in 2013 was the only previous FBI confiscation of a dark-web market before Alphabay and Hansa. Alphabay was the next largest dark market created in 2014 following Silk Road. Alphabay and Hansa were both seized by FBI; Alphabay went ""down"" first, and then when users switched to Hansa, the feds copped them all too. 
The FBI's liquidation of btc following the Silk Road incident pulls up very few news results when I look it up. I guess the FBI had initially found 27,000 btc ($18m USD at the time), but updated that they had seized 144,000 of Ulbricht's btc out of the 600,000 that he had stored in encrypted wallets or whatever. Haven't seen any updates since then lol. The US Marshal service sold that 27,000 btc for around $17m, and another 144,000 recovered from Ulbricht's personal stash that were auctioned off over time.
 Silk Road was shut down in October of 2013, and shortly after in November, the value of btc spiked tenfold - from around $100 to $1200 (according to Wikipedia and a quick google search of the news in 2013). 
The seizure of those dark markets and BTC-e hardly gathered any news attention at all. 

There are theories out there that btc could surge up to $25k before leveling off again. I've heard that it's an economic bubble that has formed arbitrarily, that it's going to burst, etc. I've also read that blocks of miners have released bitcoin cash and the whole segwit2x ordeal (which is all way over my head, just that this had supposedly led to a surge in value). 
I do think it seems odd that the two most popular, trafficked dark markets were seized mere months before insane btc value surges. 
I don't think that the DOJ is trying to raise money for itself--it would keep btc indefinitely if that were so, and wait for surges to auction them off. I just find it strange that these major monetary seizures are occurring before major booms in btc worth--not just in 2017, but in 2013 as well.

The fact that this has happened twice now seems too odd to be a coincidence, but hey, maybe I'm just a crazy conspiracy theorist. But I can't think of any rational link between the two events, or economic explanation...I guess maybe if a large amount of circulating btc was being stored within each markets' servers, and that btc was then confiscated, that would lead to an increase in demand? And then the boom just keeps building? This is the only thing that makes sense to me, at least. 

What do you guys think??

I was wondering what other options I should consider besides a money market account to make sure that money is not doing nothing for potentially many months. I figured a money market account is simply a savings account with slightly more restrictions (and in our case, it seems to just be a savings account with higher interest rate) so there isn't any real risk in putting the money in one. However, I'm really curious about more aggressive and/or better options (taking into account potentially greater risks, of course).

Any other tips in general is much appreciated. My parents told me to do some research and have mentioned money market accounts but I would like to know other options as well.

CryptoCurrency,My crypto story,"I want to share my story over how I became a Master crypto trader I first heard about Bitcoin a couple years ago from a twitter account called Trutherbot. This twitter account played a big role in waking me to the truths of the federal reserve and the worldwide central banking scam. Nevertheless everytime he would post something about bitcoin I was to lazy to actually watch a 10 minute video on what it was. 

Fast forward to summer 2017 Im working and going to school at the same time hating both at the same time. While I learned some valuable lessons and hd great teachers in college I saw Most universities as outdated institutions more focused on making money and having a succesful football team that actually keeping up to date with the age of information where most careers will have to be relearned by the time you get that paper. To top it all off I would have to go into debt to pay a 4 year university tuition.  My job on the other hand was HUGE on ""SELL THIS SELL THAT SELL EVERYTHING"" It always made me feel like a total cuck seeing poor ladies with their fast food uniform on count out cash to try and pay their bills and it be my job to try to sell them on something I knew they couldn't afford. Point being I felt like a total shill working there and I wanted out. By habit I fall sleep watching a documentary about anything I find on youtube.  I watched a youtuber who  mentioned Bitcoin which was what eventually made me say "" What the hell is this bitcoin thing"" and decided to do some research. It was love at first sight. I saw Bitcoin as a sword forged from liberty itself to cut off the tentacles of historical bank oppression and create a financial revolution #DecentralizeEverything. I was so ecstatic; I felt like I had discovered a digital California gold rush besides the technological and financial revolution I was witnessing. I became huge on Bitcoin, almost all my twitter and facebook posts were about cryptocurrency and I kept telling everyone how this was the future. In those summer months I would get out what I could of my paycheck and put it into bitcoin. As the boom continued I continued to HODL and make more money. Then it hit me. ""people who dedicate their life to trading stocks or forex it isnt luck its a strategy, and any strategy can be learned and applied. 

As I hodled I called my family back in Mexico and told them all about it and my mom sent me 1k to invest it for her. The more I grew in knowledge the more comfortable I felt trading. Over time due to my posts on social media more and more people kept messaging me asking me about bitcoin and how they could invest. This made me decide to start a hedge fund and run it month by month. This was it. My exit from being a tax slave to the dollar fictional system. I quit my job, dropped out of school sold my car and moved back to Mexico with my fam so I could focus full time to trading with maximum efficiency. Fast forward to November 2017. I have 12.5 k invested and my sister turns 15, Her Dad sends her 6k as a birthday present and my mom gives me 4k to invest it for her. Total 16.5 k for the month. One night, I see BCH is pumping like hell. Sticking to trader discipline I tell myself theres no way IM buying on such a high, It goes from 300 to 400 to 500 to 600 to 1lk bam bam bam. This at the same time BTC is going down. I scamble to social media and see everyone talking about ""The Cashening"". I told myself I wouldent switch unless it went over 2.5k. Within 15 minutes I saw my fund drop 50% in price and i dumped. Now sitting with 50% of what I had I knew I had to make a powerplay to end the month positive. I scoured altcoins for that answer and found XLM. I even posted an analyses on my tradingview. telling everyone to buy at 491 and predicted a 57-120% increase . 4 hours before The pump I set a stop loss on XLM and go to sleep just in case. I wake up to find myself stop lossed with no XLM and it being around 1k sats. again , devastation. I wasent about to end the month negative and dissapoint all my Friends and family. I learned how to margin trade. I made an account on Bitmex and transfered my remaining funds in there. 

Fast forward to today. I see BTC forming a pennant after breaking resistance and decide to all in 25x leverage. Gone, everything is gone. I apologize for the rushed ending but im still in shock. Im sorry for the clickbait title but I want this story to serve as an example to anyone who wants to become a ""trader""  in crypto. My advice is never go all in and just hodl; dont trade. or you could end up like me. A fool who let greed blind him. I dont want anyone else to experience the stress and anguish I felt and still feel. This all happened not more than 2 hours ago. Please be careful.",cryptocurrency

I will be taking out a student loan to cover car payments, tuition, rent, and basic costs of living this semester as I will be seriously cutting down on hours at work to focus on my studies. The student loan (over a 7 month period) I am currently estimating to be about $13,000. My mother will be my cosigner, and her and I have great credit history and scores.

personalfinance,Thinking of potentially renting out a house one day. Question: Does renting out a house count as a small business?,"As the title says I was reading on home ownership and being able to rent out, deduct taxes, etc. and I couldn't help to think while reading ""does renting out a home count as running a small business?"" 

I mean, technically you are sort of running a for profit (hopefully) sort of business right? You offer a product (real estate) in return for money (rent). You run a lists of expenses and may even employ others to help you run ""your business"" through management or otherwise. That being the case could you then deduct the costs of repairs as business expenses like you could for a small business costs? 

Just like many businesses rely on loans from investors, like banks for instance, in order to make money off the small loans in hopes of beating any interest or costs of the loans themselves so would a homeowner want to do by charging more than the mortgage and perhaps making a profit much more than the interest rate and any repairs. In a sense you are kind of running a small business sort of at least right? I am no businessman, but it seems as though there are many similarities. 

So, is this applicable? Would this be seen as tax fraud? Is there some merit at all to any of this? I know people who legit live off of the income from rental properties and just pay handymen a set rate and certain servicemen and women as employees. They legit make what seems to be a small business out of real estate. Just as apartment complexes or many or other real estate agencies, businesses, etc. seem to do, but they just do it at a larger scale.",finance

Anyone else being pressured to help friends and family catch-up on the cryptosphere?","I'm sure you've seen it, I have too, bitcoin-discussion is on every lip today; seems like every family was talking about it during Thanksgiving.

Naturally I've been advocating friends and family to buy for years (mostly without success), but with the recent price gains I now have newfound credit in these circles, whereas these same people weren't sure what to make of bitcoin in the past.

A few months ago a friend of mine, who actually does own some bitcoin on my recommendation, asked me to meet with some friends of his interested in bitcoin, a couple in their 40's, and explain bitcoin to them, which I did.

I don't know if they bought any coin at that time, and this was pre-BCH, but word of this meeting spread.

Lately they began asking me to do a larger presentation on bitcoin this time for a few families in their friend circle, and I've now agreed to do it and gave them some cheesy flier I whipped up to send out.

So this Saturday I'm doing a Bitcoin Bootcamp for a private groups of maybe 5-7 couples (don't know exact number that will show), hosted at my friend's house with people he's inviting. Completely free of course, just there to talk about bitcoin, answer questions, and I will of course tell them why I think Bitcoincash is a great buy right now.

Just in mentioning this event in passing, several more people have been expressing interest in going and now want me to do another soon after...

So guys, this is starting to become a thing for me and maybe this will snowball into talking in front of dozens or hundreds of people at a local homegrown conference center or something (I live in Los Angeles).

People out there are hungry for information and most people are not able to do the kind of research that we are, they need it spoon-fed to them. I formerly worked for Citigroup and held a 6 &amp; 63 securities license, so I am not uneducated in these matters and have some training in risk management and financial matters for families.

Today, I ran into a random guy at a car dealership, ones of the salesmen was telling me that his brother is a cryptocurrency day-trader(!) and has begun trading thousands of cryptocurrencies back and forth between several altcoins, and he was interested to learn more about it and start investing, he said could he put in $100 a week or so. I turned him onto Coinbase automatic buying and the Ledger Nano S, which I will recommend to all of them, of course.

Soon after I left there, a friend called me and told me about her Thanksgiving experience. Her cousin is a bigwig Wall Street trader who, four years ago, advised my friend not to buy bitcoin when they were $200 and I was telling her to buy, who now admits during Thanksgiving that he in fact knows nothing about cryptocurrency and wishes he did and wishes he'd bought some after all. This carried great weight with my friend. She gave him my number and wanted me to explain to him how cryptocurrency worked. So, I'll apparently be consulting with a Wall St. trader soon about bitcoin.

Another friend called me a few days ago, she has a friend whose boyfriend got her some bitcoin but they broke-up and now she would like my help recovering those funds from her laptop.

Anyone else experiencing these levels of awakening interest among casual acquaintances?

I've been in the bitcoin space since mid-2012 and I enjoy public speaking so this is something I'm looking forward to, not afraid of, but it feels like we have crossed a particular psychological barrier among the general public, where the average person is no longer automatically dismissing cryptocurrency as something too radical to put any faith in and thus not worth their time to look into further.

Today people are asking how to get in, recognizing that they should've bought when they first heard about it. We still have a lot of people afraid of the 'bubble popping' because they do not understand the utility behind bitcoin. 

My strategy will be to try to explain to people both the history of money going into antiquity, the need for sound money, the need for the separation of money and the state, and how the qualities of cryptocurrency both make it a fantastic money and give it real utility that people can depend on and profit from, and that this is underpinning its valuation.

And then I will finish with an explanation of how that mission to improve the world was walked away from by Core when they took over control of bitcoin and how that vision is being carried forward today by Bitcoincash, and I will end up recommending them to hold BCH long-term, past 2020 when the next Halvening takes place.

This is a paradigm shift, a revolution, a new way to do money, and we who understand these concepts have a unique opportunity to *make people's lives better* by helping them understand and integrate bitcoin into their lives.

But if you do this kind of thing, watch out for pitfalls. Don't make promises on price gains, caution people not to spend more than they're willing to lose, make sure they understand the security challenges and how to own bitcoin responsibly.

I'm working on a series of metaphors to help people analogize the security model behind bitcoin. One of my favorites so far is analogizing bitcoin to email, in that you have a public address that people can send mail to, your email address. But to send email FROM that email-address, you need your secret password which acts as the private key to allow you to send email from that email address. And you must keep this secret or else anyone can send email from your email address.

I'll let you guys know how it turns out.",cryptocurrency

stocks,Is this a sign of a partial deflation of a bubble?,"It is a given that the market has been pumped up by an era of easy money with low interest rates and exceptional monetary accommodation by the Fed and Treasury.  Based on valuation, it looks like the entire market has been blown up like a bunch of balloons.  The tech balloon is now deflating like a whoopie cushion under a dump truck.  That money won't stay on the sidelines.  It will move into another segment that is already inflated but perhaps not as distended as tech.  Please post your thoughts on whether this scenario is probable and if so, what sector(s) will benefit the most.  Rational posts with logic and numbers are preferred over ""I believe"".

My thought is that more money will flow into ""safe harbor"" investments that have solid earnings and long term growth potential.  Few companies fit this profile.

I am currently sitting on 1 month's e-fund after a recent windfall let me pay off my credit debt. I anticipate being able to increase my e-fund to 6 months' expenses within 8 months or so.

I have about $73k in student loans to pay off. Details:

* Private 1 - $6650 @ 7.05%
* Private 2 - $6300 @ 7.05%
* Federal 1 - $9000 @ 6.55%

* Federal 4 - $5700 @ 5.75%
* Federal 5 - $3050 @ 4.25%
* The rest is private and federal loans with interest rates below 4%

btc,"If I was brand new to Bitcoin, and used it for the first time, I would abandon it immediately because of how inconvenient and expensive it currently is to use.","I've owned both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash for a little while, and swapping back and forth when I foresee a bump in value for either one.  As BitStamp is opening up trading for BCH tomorrow, I am hoping for a jump in the price of BCH.  Consequently, I swapped all of my bitcoin for bitcoin cash a couple hours ago.....however, the confirmation times are so long that it hasn't even cleared yet.

On the flip side, there have been a couple times when I was doing the reverse (swapping my BCH for BTC) and the transaction is confirmed IMMEDIATELY for less than a cent....EVERY time.  It is in doing these transactions that I have been convinced that Bitcoin Cash is by far the superior coin at the moment.

I'm hopeful for Bitcoin to be able to fix it's issues, but I'm not confident about any impactful progress being made in the foreseeable future.

I also spent some Bitcoin to buy a keyboard, and the transaction took hours to confirm and then cost me an extra $6 in fees.  As the title says, if I was totally new to the space (most newcomers to crypto-currencies see Bitcoin as the flagship), I would immediately give up after my first time using Bitcoin.

Paying with debit/credit cards are way faster and cheaper at the moment.  If Bitcoin doesn't solve these critical problems quickly, I suspect people will eventually catch on and it will lose its luster.  If Bitcoin fades away, I hope Bitcoin Cash can carry the mantle and people will regain hope in competing currencies to help break down the Federal Reserve System and the stranglehold central banks hold over the world (especially the poor and needy).

personalfinance,Federal Income Tax and paycheck question,"Background:

-	I live in Texas, USA
-	My boss says I'm hourly but my job pays me for 40 hours weather I work 40 or less so pretty much salary. I know exactly what I get paid every week.
-	Recently received a $1.25 raise which will come out to be an extra $140/month.
-	paid weekly

With my first paycheck stub reflecting my raise, my boss left a note saying that I could adjust my ""FIT"" by either adding or subtracting ~~up to $60~~. Currently, he takes out $76.45/week for ""FIT"". I assume ""FIT"" stands for federal income tax. I was thinking of asking him to adjust it so that I get an extra $30-$40/week on my paycheck. An extra $120-$160/mo on top of my $140/mo raise would really help out.

So I guess my questions are; would I be screwing myself over if I adjusted this number? What is Federal income tax taken out for? Is this the money that gets taken out and then I get back at the end of the year as a tax return?

EDIT: I looked at the note again, my boss has bad handwriting. All he said was that ""FIT"" can go up or down. I thought his ""Go"" was the number ""60""",finance

I have two Credit Card debts that I need to pay off, one is a credit card with my Credit Union that is about 3k with an interest rate of 17.9% (wedding and new apartment purchases that I am now not super proud of but...they happened). The other is about 4k on a 18-month no interest card, terms about to expire in a month or so with a 27%. 

I recently got married and moved out, and just started a new job that is bringing in about $1,000 more a month than before. I expect I will be able to put about at least $800-1,000 into paying these debts off...I'd like to get it all paid off in about a year.

Now, the seemingly obvious thing to do would be to apply for a personal loan. I was accepted through my bank for a 7k personal loan, 36 months at 11.5% APR. Now, I know that is much lower than my other interest rates, and I know that I can pay this off in about a year.

We recently published our research on a potential Leishmania vaccine in ACS Central Science http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00311. For a generalist introduction to leishmaniasis, you can read the coverage from Newsweek http://www.newsweek.com/horrific-flesh-eating-parasite-called-next-plague-could-spread-us-spurring-663868

This is Alexandre: I am Associate Professor in the Institute for Biological Sciences, Parasitology Department, at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil. I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Pharmacy (July 1997) and a Ph.D. in Microbiology and Immunology (August 2007). During my doctoral dissertation, I worked with infectious diseases and vaccine development against microbial pathogens.  From 2007 to 2012, I did my postdoctoral research in the Biological Sciences Department at The University of Texas at El Paso. My work there involved proteomics for the discovery of novel molecular targets for vaccine development and therapeutic treatment against parasites such as Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania spp. I am currently on sabbatical as a visiting Senior Scientist in the Finn laboratory at Georgia Tech.

And this is M.G. Finn: I am Professor and Chair of the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Georgia Tech in Atlanta.

I am also the Editor-in-Chief of ACS Combinatorial Science (http://pubs.acs.org/journal/acsccc). In my lab, our research starts with the development of reliable chemical reactions – click reactions, which we then use in chemical biology and materials science. We have for many years combined chemical and biological techniques to make virus-like protein nanoparticles that have desired properties, usually for biological applications.
The students and postdocs in Alex’s lab and mine in Minas Gerais and Atlanta are working together to make new vaccines against parasitic diseases using these virus-like particles, focusing on carbohydrates and peptides that are unique to the surfaces of the target parasites.

personalfinance,Want to refinance student loans - parent can't cosign,"I am not the most financially literate person ever. So far I have basically dealt with my student loans by ignoring them because they make me too anxious. I have come to terms with the fact that this is not the best strategy and am seeking help with making them less terrifying. I have no idea what information is actually important, so I'm just going to try to cover everything.

I just found the interest rates on my 8 loans (totaling $40,000) buried in Great Lakes' obtuse website. (The balance on my account is listed as $45,072, even though ""Total Estimated Unpaid Interest to Be Capitalized"" is $4,142.96.) The amount for each loan is between $2,000 and $7,033, and they are between 3.860-6.800% APR.

I was unemployed for my first year out of college for health/personal reasons. Because of this, I was on an IDR paying $0 per month and accrued about $1,000 in interest during that time. (I previously spoke with a Great Lakes representative who claimed my accounts were not collecting interest during the first year.) I have been employed full-time since June at a salary of $30,900. My job does not offer a 401k and I have no other assets aside from a few thousand dollars in my checking and savings accounts. I live with my parents, so my expenses are minimal (car payment/insurance).

I have tried to apply for refinancing from several lenders (SoFi/Earnest/CommonBond), but they all denied me, saying that I needed a cosigner. My credit score is 747 right now according to my FICO credit scorecard. CommonBond was kind enough to give me a rejection letter explaining the reasons I was declined, and my credit score was 701 according to their soft credit check. I cannot get either of my parents to cosign; they are both in enough debt that I have a better credit score (even at 701) than either of them, and I'm sure it would do more harm than good. I do not know anyone else I would feel comfortable asking. Am I completely screwed as far as refinancing goes? In general? Should I just try to pay these off through Great Lakes?",finance
personalfinance,19 years old. Very lost. Need help living and finding a new job.,"Hey everyone, I apologize in advance for the wall of text this post is going to be. I'm simply trying to be as detailed as possible in order to get the best advice form individuals here. I'd like to outline my current budget/income and a story about my situation.

If you don't are about my story, my budget/income information will be in the second part of this post. 

I'm currently a 19 year old college student living in Ohio. Since I was 12 years old, I've been doing HVAC (Heating, ventilation, and Air Conditioning) in my Dad's company. As most of you know, this is a lucrative field and the skills are constantly in demand. When I started off working with my Dad, I knew nothing about working in the HVAC industry or doing basic work with hand tools. However, after doing this for 6 years, I've grown very knowledgeable in the field. I'm able to install systems, do service calls, work on electrical components, weld copper pipes, diagnose and charge Freon systems in AC, manage inventory, deal with distributors, etc. etc.

I am currently paid $12 an hour **UNDER THE TABLE**. I do not make money ""on the books"" like the other employees. 

Unfortunately, over the years, I have become increasingly dissatisfied with working in my Dad's company. I am now the *lowest* paid employee in the company while receiving the *most* work/stress. The other employees in the company make $16-$17 an hour for doing half the work.

As of right now:
*I am the only employee who knows how to do service calls and diagnose broken systems. The other employees don't only do installs.

*I am the only employee who can look at our inventory and know what systems/parts/materials to order. The other employees do not do this.

*I am the only employee who can handle paperwork from jobs, handle money, and do payroll. Basically, I do office work when my Dad isn't around. 

*I constantly put in overtime because I'm the only one qualified for service calls. So when the other employees get to go home after an install at 4 PM-6PM I have to go out on service calls until 8PM-10PM

I am tired of the constant stress and the constant need to dedicate my life to the family company for $12 an hour while other employees make more than me for less stress/responsibilities - especially when they have less skills in the industry and aren't able to perform service calls/deal with distributors. Not to mention there are also large expenses for working in my Dad's company.

Therefore, I would like to move to a different company. The problem is that all of my years of experience in the HVAC industry mean **nothing** to potential employers because I can't prove it. I don't have any pay stubs to prove I've been working in an HVAC company for six years. And no HVAC company wants to hire some 19 year old they know nothing about who just claims he knows the business. 

The other problem for me is that I'm a college student. I schedule all of my classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays so I can have the rest of the week to work. Currently, I go to class from 9AM-8PM on Tuesday/Thursday and then work Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and sometimes Sunday. Most job listing I've seen online require working every single weekday from 9 AM to 5 PM. I'm finishing my second year for my Bachelors and can't quit college now. 

What are my options here? What can I do with my experience to secure a well paying job? I don't care what the work is, I just **want a good paying**. I'm willing to work and put in the hours. I'm not afraid of getting my hands dirty. 

I've been using Indeed to look for jobs in my area, but it seems hopeless. Every posting that isn't a minimum wage fast food/cashier position wants direct experience in that field. 

There were listing for a FedEx/UPS delivery driver for $14/hour: 2 years of delivery driver experience required

Warehouse worker for $13 an hour: 1 year of warehouse experience required

There are a lot of listing for administrative assistants, but they all want years of prior experience as well. 

________________________________________________

As of right now, these are my current living expenses every month

Rent: $725 

Gas: ~$60

Electric: ~$60

Internet: $50

Groceries: ~120

Phone Bill: $100 (currently locked in contract, had large data plan due to constantly having to use the phone in the
 field to look up distributors and addresses. Will be trying to cut this when contract expires in one year)

As of right now, I hold $2400 of debt on one credit card and $650 on a second card. The second card has zero interest until September 2018. I am not using the cards to buy anything anymore and am only working on paying them off. I am very aware that I am stupid for going into debt like this. I will not be doing it again. 

This does not include gas for my car and other various expenses. 
I would also like to make it clear I do not spend on many luxuries. I do not eat out. I do not own a TV. I do not buy much clothing. I do not go out for the weekend and drink, I stay home.

I currently bring home about $450 a week and am living paycheck to paycheck. 

What are my options for securing a better job? And what are my options for not loving paycheck to paycheck anymore?

personalfinance,Refinance $200K home??,"Hey everyone,

My wife and I are considering refinancing our home for a shorter term to save money in the long term.

Estimated home value: $200,000  (according to Zillow so give or take)

Original loan:

Purchase amount: $156,500  (20% down)
Current loan amount: $116,000
30-year fixed 4.5% rate
payment/month: $638
purchased in 2013

I'm thinking we refinance to a 15 year as I've seen rates in my area anywhere from 3.2 to 3.7 % without buying points.  We both have good credit scores so I'm confident we'd get good rates.  We're not concerned with higher monthly payments because we've been able to increase our salaries by double since we originally bought the house.

So my question is:  ""Is it worth going through the process to refinance in my situation?""

Part of me just says to try just pay higher on the 30-year.  However, I like the idea of the lower interest and being forced to pay higher.  And I feel like these interest rate levels may not last forever.

The debt we have currently is one car loan and student loans.   The car loan has about $17K left on it at a poor interest rate that we're paying all our extra income to pay off early.  I'm thinking about using a refinance cash-out option to pay off the car using some of the equity.  Good or bad idea?

personalfinance,Need advice on the best way to utilize credit card with 0% interest rate,"I currently have 2 credit cards. One is a Discover card with roughly 7.5k on it, and a variable APR. The second is a Citi card with a 3.4k limit and currently about $1600 on it, $1500 of which was transferred over from my discover card.

The Citi card has 0% APR. My current gameplan to pay down my debt was to transfer over as much as possible to the Citi card so my balance on Discover doesn't grow as fast, and keep making above-minimum payments on the discover card along with any extra money that comes my way. I'd also be paying towards the Citi card a bit over minimum (maybe $70 a month with a $35 minimum), to pay that one down at the 20 months of 0% APR that I have left. 

Is this my best game plan here? Should I pay down the debt on my discover card to 3.5k and then ask for a credit line increase on my Citi card (which is a hard pull, I believe?) and transfer everything over there if the APR promo hasn't run out yet? Should I 'max out' my Citi card as it stands in favor of having a lower balance on my Discover card?

CryptoCurrency,A Traceability Analysis of Monero’s Blockchain Research to deanonymize Monero,"&gt;ABSTRACT
Monero is a cryptocurrency that has rapidly gained popularity since
its launch in April 2014. The source of its growth can be mainly
attributed to its unique privacy properties that go well beyond the
pseudonymity property of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.
In this work, we conduct a forensic analysis of the Monero
blockchain. Our main goal is to investigate Monero’s untraceability
guarantee, which essentially means that given a transaction input,
the real output being redeemed in it should be anonymous among
a set of other outputs. To this end, we develop three heuristics that
lead to simple-to-implement attack routines.

&gt;We evaluate our attacks on the Monero blockchain and show
**that in 87% of cases**, the real output **being redeemed can be easily
identifed with certainty**. Moreover, we have compelling evidence
that **two of our attacks also extend to Monero RingCTs — the second
generation Monero that even hides the transaction value.**
Furthermore, we observe that for over **98% of the inputs that
we have been able to trace, the real output being redeemed in it
is the one that has been on the blockchain for the shortest period
of time**. **This result shows that the mitigation measures currently
employed in Monero fall short of preventing temporal analysis**. Motivated
by our findings, we also propose a new mitigation strategy
against temporal analysis. Our mitigation strategy leverages the
real spending habit of Monero users.

Bitcoin,How Bitcoin Futures Will Work and Why The Financial Establishment Is Interested,"**[Bitcoin Futures and the Need for Control](https://tomluongo.me/2017/12/04/bitcoin-futures-and-the-need-for-control/)**

December 4, 2017 - by Tom Luongo

I’ve been asked by a few subscribers to further discuss the potential effect of the major exchanges starting up futures trading in Bitcoin.  Last month the CME Group and the CBOE – Chicago Board of Exchange — announced they would begin trading futures contracts in Bitcoin due to popular demand.

The SEC fast-tracked approval, because, what the big banks want the big banks get.  This is called ‘regulatory capture’ for short.   Trading is due to begin on December 18th.

Now there are a lot of issues here but the main thing is that these are cash-settled contracts.  This means that, for all intents and purposes, these are dollar-based bets on where the price of Bitcoin is going in the future.

And dollars, unlike Bitcoin, are in nearly infinite supply.  I’ve heard arguments that the recent price rise in Bitcoin is partly because the CME and CBOE are building inventory.  That’s pure disinformation.  What inventory are they building when they are never going to settle the trades in Bitcoin?

**Futures Imperfect**

Futures markets are a function of coordinating supply of an asset with time.  If you anticipate the future need for a few million barrels of oil and want to lock in your future liability to obtain said oil, you buy some oil futures which will deliver you that oil on by that date.

By contrast, a cash-settled contract is, in effect, no different than a CFD offered by a forex broker. A CFD is a *contract for difference* which are simply bets on the movement in price of something.  They are divorced from the underlying asset and do not affect its supply or demand like an asset-settled futures contract is.

CFD’s are really no different than betting on a football game or who will win the election.  It is a pure derivative of the underlying asset and has no relation whatsoever to the trading behavior of the asset itself.

Except, of course, that traders who are looking for any edge they can get will use that data to influence their decisions.  And so, as a secondary or tertiary effect, the structure of CFD markets have an effect on the market of the underlying asset.

In short, the tail wags the dog.

The question on everyone’s mind is, how much of an effect this will be.

The analogue for stocks is the VIX — the volatility index.  The VIX is its own market which itself is a prime indicator of where the market is headed.  The VIX is manipulated all day every day in the equity markets to support whatever narrative the political class, Wall St. and the central banks want us to believe.

The VIX used to be a small market.  But, in today’s yield-starved, central-bank-coordinated world, where price discovery is suppressed in the name of market ‘stability,’ the VIX now IS the equity market.

And this is the mechanism by which a cash-settled futures market can be used to gain control over the price of Bitcoin.  It will bring absolutely zero liquidity to the Bitcoin environment natively.

It will simply make high-frequency scam-trading and spoofing in Bitcoin an official part of the market through the creation of a near-infinite supply of dollars.  And the issuers of that supply will use those price moves to push or pull the Bitcoin market itself to fit the needs of the banks and exchanges whose business is most threatened by Bitcoin’s existence.

**The Blockchain Threat**

When you look around the blockchain space you can very easily see that there are a number of projects attempting to marginalize the existing financial trading infrastructure.

They are building blockchain analogues which require no third party to settle and clear trades or provide liquidity pools.  From cross-chain atomic swaps to distributed exchanges with direct fiat conversion,  the cryptocurrency community is becoming focused on replacing the current system with one less subject to manipulation through central bank largess.

The central banks themselves know they are under attack at an existential level.  And it is why the major ones will never truly embrace digital assets in any substantive way.

In [my first article for Crypto-News.net](https://www.crypto-news.net/bitcoins-wild-ride-and-the-end-of-confidence/), I cover why the Federal Reserve would never create a crypto-dollar.

&gt; Bitcoin is a digital analogue to gold with respect to the Federal Reserve. So, the Fed, which props up confidence in the dollar by marginalizing gold, will never create a Bitcoin-derivative. Doing that would state categorically it doesn’t have faith in its own currency. Why create a crypto-dollar when the real dollar (itself just as much a digital asset as Bitcoin) works just fine.

We have historical precedence for this with gold.  And I remember the crowing in the gold community when the SPDR Gold ETF (NYSE:GLD) was formed.  All the same liquidity and ‘bringing the big boys in’ arguments were made and yet, buried deep in the prospectus was the poison pill about how the ETF dealt with settlement and what assets it actually held — futures contracts, not gold.

And is it any surprise that with the rise of GLD the leverage on the gold futures platforms around the world has risen to astronomical levels?

So, don’t think for a minute that the CME or the CBOE are implementing Bitcoin futures for our benefit or simply because they want a cut of the action.  No, they are doing so because they see the existential threat to their business and are moving to defend it by becoming part of the action.
The Way Forward

But, there is a silver lining to this.  Bitcoin is not an asset where the existing power structure can coordinate pricing worldwide 24/7.  And Bitcoin trades, much to the consternation of everyone in power, 24/7.

Gold is easily manipulated (up and down) because like all other assets trading on official exchanges, gold closes on Friday afternoon and doesn’t start up again until Sunday afternoon.  That’s two days of policy coordination talks, headlines, bad-bank settlements and the rest to ensure that it, like any other systemically-important asset, does not spasm in price and cost anyone important too much money.

Blockchains operate all day, everyday.  And there truly is no reason why they should ever stop trading. So, the future exchanges, if they are planning on trying to control the Bitcoin price through their derivatives, better be subtle about it.

Because what they bring to the table first and foremost is their imprimatur of professionalism.  These are supposed to be the most trusted, most sophisticated market making platforms in the world.

And their entry into this space is supposed to professionalize the way Bitcoin is traded and price discovery achieved.  And without 24/7 exchange coverage they better behave themselves or the market will lose confidence in the product very quickly as arbitrage effects will destroy their credibility.

Because, remember, once the blockchain-equivalent platforms are up and stable there will be a whole new level of trust added to the financial system.  There is absolutely zero reason why a blockchain based, coin-settled futures market can’t compete with the CME Group or the CBOE.

At which point we enter into a whole different regime of price discovery.

When the change was made, that meant a 3.5% rate on new EE's vs ~2.6% on '97-'05 ones. However, the new methodology fell through the floor over the next few years and has pretty consistently been much worse. The last few years it's been at a ludicrous 0.1% vs a current ~1.68% (it varies a few tenths bond-to-bond, which I don't know the explanation for) on '97-'05 ones.

investing,Why dividend stocks are a bad idea right now,"With the possibility of interest rates rising looming and since the market is looking a bit toppy and nervous, I'd like to address some popular advice about dividend stock investing.  Many respected and credible sources like value line recommend robust companies with a high dividend to ensure principle if a recession hits.  There are two reasons why I think high dividend stocks might not work out moving forward, especially if a recession hits.

First, most companies I view as paying high dividends are highly leveraged and therefore will be adversely affected by both the tax bill, which reduces the tax credit on interest rate payments, and the rise in interest rates, which will increase the price of floating interest rates. This will jeopardize the companies ability to pay out their dividends. I'm thinking about AT&amp;T, who is in a lot of debt and wants to take on even more debt to buy TWX. Most people won't care about watching HBO on their phone if a recession hits. 

And second, if interest rates rise, then the yield on risk free government bonds will increase, and 30 year bonds are already almost at a 3% yield. If the yield goes to 5%, why take the risk on a highly leveraged company if you can have the money ensured by the US government? High dividend stocks also historically have much less price action too making a bond likely more attractive.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Is Crypto a black swan event that will reverse Baby Boomers' ill gotten gains?,"Had this thought as I came out of REM sleep this morning...

Baby Boomers have made out like bandits at the expense of subsequent generations:

* Low interest rates boost stock prices and home prices - great because they already have those assets
* Hell, now you lose money if kept in a savings account...younger people basically forced to put money in the stock market to outpace inflation...I don't like the concept of having no other choice...and it benefits the boomers more who already have large portfolios.
* High immigration rates encouraged to boost home prices and pay pensions - at expense of greater competition and lower wages for younger workers
* Pensions/retirements/social security/medicare pay out way more than they contributed - paid for by next generation of workers
* List goes on

So, it all seemed wrapped up.  I certainly didn't see a way out.  But along came Crypto.

Younger people are buying because they like the technology - and i think subconsciously have a feeling that the existing banking/investing/taxation system is rigged and just want an alternative.  Kind of a middle finger to the old way.

Now that this movement has led to 100's of % of gains, everyone is noticing.  I can already hear a giant sucking sound in the traditional stock market (with all the boomer loot).

Could the entire tables get flipped as Boomers that can't operate a smart phone are left with decimated stock portfolios as 22 year old crypto millionaires take their place?

Can't say I'd feel bad.  Of course, just an idea.  Could also have unintended consequences.  Certainly interesting times.

CryptoMarkets,"Newcomer to crytopcurrency trading. Questions regarding ""pumping and dumping"" money into currencies.","Hi I’m new to the concept of cryptocurrency trading and find it very interesting. I’m in the process of doing as much research as I can. I had a couple of questions when it comes to trading cryptocurrencies.
What interests me is investing some money in lesser known up and coming cryptocurrencies Which of course comes with a lot of risks. For example; FedoraCoin. It's worth 0,0001 US Dollars at the moment and the value has been going up 1000% in the last 24 hours. 
Now I was wondering if it would actually work if you would ""pump and dump"" your money in a coin like this. What is the catch?

Let’s say the FedoraCoin you invested 1000 dollars in, increases in value with 500% in an hour. It seems to me that a lot of people would wanna sell their FedoraCoin for dollars or Bitcoins. 

The main issue I see here is when you sell it on a site like Bittrex, that it takes very long because a lot of people are selling their FedoraCoin. Wouldn’t there be so many sells that the website can’t process them all and while you’re waiting for it to finally work the coin has decreased a lot, or even worse: crashed? Is this a possibility and a risk people take that is part of the whole cryptocurrenceis trade? Or is this an unlikely scenario?

Another bad scenario: what if you sell your coin on Bittrex and the value of the coin is decreasing WHILE the sale is being processed. Is this a possibility or is the amount final once you made the sale?

Final question: Is there a limit in the amount of coins you can buy? Let’s say you want to buy 10 million fedora coins because the price per coin is very low. Is that even possible? Or would Bittrex or another site limit you?

BlockChain,How Blockchain Is Changing the Banking Industry,"In 2015, 9 large banks created the R3 consortium to study and experiment with blockchain. Two years hence, the number of participants exceeds 100 people, and hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of man hours are already invested in future considerations.

Along with it, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), founded in February 2017, is growing. Among its members are the Spanish bank BBVA, Sberbank of Russia, Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse, and the IT giants such as Microsoft and Intel.

Banks are actively testing the distributed ledger technology — they enjoy it. Blockchain is perfect for the financial sector. The results of the experiments are promising, therefore the investments in development of blockchain solutions grow every year.

Instant Transactions

The main blockchain benefit to banks is the transaction acceleration. Today the international wire transfers take from 2 to 7 business days, while R3 or EEA members have completed pilot payments within a couple of hours.

On November, the second largest bank in Spain, BBVA, carried out an international trade transaction between the companies from Mexico and Spain. Today, the preparation and verification of documents takes up to two weeks, the pilot reduced this time to 2 hours. Both parties of the transaction followed the process and received data on its status in real time.

Another example: Commerzbank, KfW Banking and MEAG conducted transactions for a total of 100,000 euros in a few hours. Blokchain has significantly simplified and expedited these transactions, reducing the costs to the parties and increasing their reliability.

Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, said that the main weakness of the banking sector is its sluggishness. If financial institutions don’t introduce instant payments, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will beat them.

In the coming years, more and more members of the banking sector will introduce blockchain solutions to attract new customers and retain the old. Visa and MasterCard have already applied for patents for the use of technology to compete with cryptocurrencies.

The Lowest Fees

Banks charge huge service fees because of the high transaction costs. If transactions are accelerated, simplified and automated by means of blockchain technology, and the manual work is reduced, then fees will be minimal. Some transactions may become entirely fee-free.

Banks Will Become Guarantors For Small Deals Using Smart Contracts

Now banks act as intermediaries only for corporate deals, as this process failed so far to be automated. With existing technologies, dealing with transactions of $ 100 or $ 1,000 is unprofitable — labor costs and transaction costs are too high.

Smart contracts can automate this process. Freelancers and small companies will be able to enter into contracts with each other, and a bank’s blockchain platform will monitor the fulfillment of obligations and transfer money under the specified terms. This will help to protect both parties, and open up a new niche for banks.

P2P Lending

Up to 80% of people from developing countries cannot use banking services for various reasons. They do not have accounts, cards, and they can receive a loan only from microfinance institutions at very high interest rates.

Blockchain is changing this right now. Several startups have raised considerable investment, so in the near future they will be able to provide their new customers with the key bank functionality.

All you’ll need to transfer money or to get a loan is a smartphone with the mobile application installed on it. Blockchain will maintain the data on the lender and the borrower, and smart contracts will monitor the fulfillment of obligations.

P2P lending will provide people who own small funds with an opportunity to make a profit. You have a few thousand euros or some bitcoins to make direct loans. Find people who want to borrow money through the web interface or mobile client applications. Choose the convenient terms and send out a part or the whole sum entirely.

The first step is to check the borrower. The transaction history, public personal information and other important data are stored in a decentralized manner, so you can personally calculate all risks when lending and be sure that these data have not been changed for someone’s own benefit.

The second step is to confirm the terms of the loan and transfer the funds. After that, the process involves a smart contract. It monitors the fulfillment of the obligations by both parties, protecting them from troubles.

People, who took out a loan to start or develop a business, know well what inconvenient and labor-intensive the process is. Some get approved, others try to get the desired amount for a year, but they are rejected for absurd reasons.

Decentralization enhances a chance to get the required sum for business development. An organization submits an application not to another organization, but addresses hundreds of legal entities and individuals. It is subject to a principle — “many a little makes a mickle”, when many small amounts accumulate to make a large amount by common efforts in a few days, or even hours.

Cryptocurrency Support

Traditional banks do not work with cryptocurrencies, the pioneers to introduce this functionality can “hitch a jackpot”. And if the existing financial institutions will need a lot of time due to the particular attention of the state and need to obtain appropriate licenses, new banks can manage to do this easier.

Remote Services

Theoretically, blockchain will free us from the branch banking. All the necessary data is reliably protected and stored in a decentralized manner, so there is no need to visit the office.

Today, without blockchain, banks reject a large number of offline units, but in 3–5 years their number will decrease much more. All operations will be carried out online through a web interface or a mobile application.

Cryptobanks

They are initially tooled for blockchain and cryptocurrency. Thus they provide their users with many new or improved traditional services. It doesn’t make difference from which country the transaction is made to, or where the recipient of the loan is located — it is easy to receive the service.

When properly harnessed, cryptobanks can attract new clients from developing countries, who cannot use the services of traditional financial institutions for some reasons.

One of the brightest representatives is Datarius Cryptobank. It is a decentralized partially closed system, which allows users to access all the necessary banking services on equal footing all over the world.

Each Datarius customer will be able to set the required tariff through the designer to minimize the costs and facilitate the interaction with other organizations.

The project takes all the advantages of blockchain, adds the cryptocurrency support and work with startups.

personalfinance,"Splitting a House, but Not the Down Payment","Hi /r/personalfinance,

My unmarried partner and I are buying a house, and we're trying to figure out the best way to handle the money between us.  We spoke to a real estate lawyer about putting an agreement in writing yesterday, but now we're really skeptical about his advice. So we're hoping you can give us some insight.

Background: I have a lot of savings, but she does not.  We are buying a house for $600K (not the real number, but I'm simplifying the math) with a 20% down payment.  She cannot contribute to the down payment, but we can split the closing and recurring costs.  We are both on the mortgage and the deed. We also both have very stable income. 

Goal: We'd like to split the house 50/50.

Question: How do we set it up so that I pay the entire down payment but we still contribute fairly to the house over the long run?

We've narrowed it down to two options (after considering a bunch of options).

Option A:
I pay the entire down payment.  She takes a loan from me for half of it ($60K) with a normal promissory note at a fair interest rate (maybe 6% or so) for 10 years.  So she would pay me $666 dollars a month on the loan. We just split the house costs/liabilities 50/50 by putting the same amount each month into a joint bank account and paying the costs from the joint account.

Two problems with option A (that option B will hopefully avoid): (1) I will have to pay income tax on the interest from the loan.  (2) Neither of us will contribute enough to the joint account to claim the entire mortgage interest deduction, so we won't collectively be minimizing our tax burden.

So that's why we thought of option B: I pay the entire down payment.  Each month for 10 years, she puts into the joint account twice the amount that she would have paid me had I loaned her the money ($1332).  We then contribute equally to the joint account to cover the rest of the costs of the house.  After 10 years, we just cover the costs equally.

If we did option B, she would be directly putting more money into the joint account than the annual mortgage interest.  So she could take the entire mortgage interest deduction on her taxes.  And mathematically, it works out to her paying the same amount as she would have on option A.  (To see this, just imagine her first giving me $666, then us contributing equally to the account -- it's the same as her just paying my first $666 each month.) I also wouldn't have to pay income taxes on the extra amount she contributes to the house (since it isn't income to me -- it's a contribution to our joint account that's used for housing costs -- I gain equity via her payments, but it's unrealized until the sale of the house).

The main problems we see with option B involve how to spell out exit conditions on the agreement (like what happens if we sell the house, one of us dies, etc).  As far as I can tell though, there is no inherent problem with spelling those out -- it's just more complicated mathematically.

Our lawyer insisted that we should go with option A, but only because B was ""too complicated.""  (She and I both have PhDs in math-related fields, so we're not too worried about that, frankly.)  Am I right in thinking that option B is actually much better for us financially?

Thanks for any thoughts you have!  This is in Pennsylvania, in case that matters.  Also, I know you're not my lawyer (which might be the problem in the first place ...).",finance
personalfinance,Is debt consolidation a terrible idea?,"Hello /r/personalfinance! I've looked at some of the links on the side bar and my head is just spinning. I've recently gone through a divorce and come through the other side with a pretty big monthly payment for child and spousal support. I have barely any spending money each month, I'm constantly shuffling bills a payday down the road to free up money for now. I'm wondering if there's any point/if it's a good idea to consolidate my debt to try and bring my monthly payments down. Current debts, with the monthly payment in parenthesis:

~7000 to CareCredit for some dental work (200)

500 to chase, credit card (25)

500 to pioneer federal credit union for a small loan (50)

~2500 to a local medical debt collection agency (25)

1738 to Fingerhut (100)

This may not seem like much now that I'm sitting here accounting for it, but between a cel phone bill, gas to get to and from work, having money to spend on my daughter during my visitation hours, etc. I'm finding myself scrambling, all the time. I don't know if this is enough in the way of debts or monthly payments to be worth any kind of consolidation, but I'm at a bit of a loss as to even where to start. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: I should add, part of my thinking is getting a loan for more than I really need to pay off my debts. Since my financial situation got wrecked in the divorce, I'm stuck living with my parents. I'd love to be able to buy some new furniture and things to have there when my daughter is staying with me, but again, not sure how all this works.",finance

Bitcoin,"Andreas Antonopoulos posted this response to ""a prominent member of the bitcoin community"" on patreon.","Andreas M. Antonopoulos posted
In defense of optimism
Yesterday, I woke to a flurry of activity on Twitter. A prominent member of the bitcoin community had decided to a message to me that many perceived as critical. The tweet pointed out that had I managed my money better I would be wealthy and wouldn't need the support of patrons.
It was in response to a message I posted on Twitter a week earlier, to once again dispel the impression that I am a bitcoin millionaire. It is hard for many to accept that someone who has been involved since 2012 has not amassed a great fortune in bitcoin. The truth, however, is that due to circumstances and some poor choices I made, I was not able to benefit as much from the rise of bitcoin as some others have.

At the end of 2012, when I heard about bitcoin, I had been working as a freelance consultant for about a year after burning out of my previous work as a partner in a research firm. I had a modest retirement fund, a small amount of credit card debt and enough income to make ends meet. I was really in limbo, looking for the next opportunity. Bitcoin arrived into my awareness and slapped me in the face. You've all heard my story of tumbling down the rabbit hall, absolutely consumed by awe.

What is not quite obvious is that my obsession also drove me to abandon my consulting work and put all my attention into bitcoin. I worked as hard as I have ever worked, focusing full time on this technology. During this time, I was unable to find any way of making a living through bitcoin. I traveled to speak at conferences (which didn't even cover expenses), I consulted with startups (which couldn't pay me), I wrote articles etc. To support my ""habit"", I dipped into my savings. I cut back on my expenses as much as I could and started ravaging my savings. By mid-2013 I was forced to start liquidating my retirement funds. In my early 40's, I was undoing a lifetime of savings, in a way most people would consider irresponsible. While doing so, I incurred penalty taxes for early withdrawal. Then, I went into credit card debt. By the end of 2013 I was ""worse than broke"": going into debt at an alarming rate.

Finally, in 2014 I started making a bit of income. I was so deep in debt that I continued to live paycheck to paycheck, struggling to chip away at my debt. It was going to be a long two years before I finally became debt free at the end of 2016.

I won't complain about the lost opportunity. I am extremely fortunate to be able to live debt free, doing my dream job in a field I absolutely love.

Yesterday, while reading the tweet that criticized me for my poor choices, I felt sick to my stomach. It forced me to confront and relive every choice I made and all the missed opportunities. You see, the critical tweet contained a big grain of truth. I could've become wealthy. If only I hadn't sold. If only I hadn't given away hundreds of bitcoin to complete strangers. If only I had reduced my expenses more. If only I had made smarter choices. If only...

Working in bitcoin is an endless struggle against cynicism, negativity, regret. Throughout the last 5 years I have always tried to maintain an optimistic and positive outlook, to focus on the long term, to think about the potential to lift billions out of poverty. But every now and then, I get dragged back into the negative. Yesterday was one of those days. I felt crushed.

And then, something amazing happened. Over the next several hours, tens, dozens, then hundreds of people responded. I sat reading the responses with tears in my eyes. An outpouring of positivity washed over me. People I have never met jumped to my defense, reminding me that they started their journey after watching my videos, or reading my books. Some people attacked the original criticism and its author (which I strongly discourage). But the vast majority focused on optimism.

Not only did people remind me of the importance of my work, they also encouraged each other to support me. In the last year, I have gradually received more and more of my income from Patreon. Patreon allows me to regain my financial security without switching my focus to commercial conferences, banking and investment events and chasing the next paycheck. Because of Patreon, I managed to stop selling and finally HODL. Because of Patreon I can dedicate my entire focus to the people who I have always felt like I am working for: the community of crypto-currency dreamers, visionaries and creators. I now finally get to work for you.

Yesterday, you fed my soul. You reminded me why it is so important to remain optimistic, focused and determined to overcome the cynicism. It's been a long and hard road. Sometimes I get lost. But, every time I do, you step up and help me find my way, find my focus again. You show me that I do not walk alone on this path. You are all there with me. I am part of a wonderful community and you have my back.

Today, I am even more focused on my goals: educate the next 10 million users. Train the next 10,000 developers. Do it all in every medium possible. Do it in more languages. Do it with more energy, with more passion. Do it with unrelenting optimism. In the end, my engine runs on hope, it runs on optimism. And today, it's turbocharged.

Bitcoin,"I botched an ACH transfer to buy Bitcoin. I now see why the world needs ""Bitcoin.""","Disclaimer: I am currently hodling.

November 21: I decided that I want to buy more Bitcoin.

I executed a sale of stock from my brokerage.

In a momentary lapse, I requested a DEPOSIT rather than a WITHDRAWAL of the monies.


It took my bank T+2 days to reject with deposit. I get dinged $30 penalty.

November 24:

My brokerage puts a 7 business day hold on ACH transactions for any deposit, even rejected ones. This is a standard practice though the days are variable.

December 6:

I am told that my funds will be available for withdrawal, tomorrow. What about a wire? Well, that's more complicated.

Apparently, because the Fed clears wires, it could be a significant about of time before I get my money out by wire. They are calling me back to explain this.

My brokerage company doesn't do wires to 3rd parties (i.e. exchanges). I have to pay $25 to wire to my bank and $15 to wire from my bank to my exchange.

This is all to say that I still do not have my money where I want it and so far it has cost me:

- 2 weeks of time
- $30 in ACH deposit reversal fees
- ~$3000/btc in price exposure (it could have dropped, just saying).

When my money is finally released I have the pleasure of waiting more time or paying more money to transfer it to its final location.

One might easily dismiss this as: ""next time, don't be an idiot."" The reality is that, if nothing else, cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies have a future in replacing this antiquated clearing house nonsense.

Bitcoin,Austria starts implementing blockchain in ‘old economy’,"Austria strengthens its leading role in blockchain technology ahead of EU-Presidency - state-driven sandboxes promote real business applications 

“We are bringing together the expertise of the entire community, so that needs of our entrepreneurs can be incorporated into the agenda of the incoming administration. In Europe, Austria already has a leading role in the field of blockchain, having implemented an ambitious roadmap. Now we need to ensure that the next steps are taken and create sandboxes to promote real business applications. Otherwise the competiveness of our business sector is impeded,” says Harald Mahrer, Federal Minister of Research, Science and Economy. Therefore, the Federal Ministry initiated a Blockchain summit in Vienna, bringing together more than 500 expert, representing the wide range of blockchain know-how in science, economy and civil society. The main target of the summit is to implement the blockchain technology in concrete use cases and make it applicable for various sectors, including tourism, trade, energy, public administration, finance and law. 

The main problems for the practical use of blockchain are not merely technical. The existing regulatory framework in most European countries is not flexible enough for the needs of blockchain applications. For the necessary research,  Austria just launched a Research Institute for Cryptoeconomy in Vienna. Furthermore, a number of legal and regulatory obstacles need to be overcome. For instance, private clients are currently not allowed to sell self-produced electricity via blockchain due to regulatory barriers. As a first step Austria plans therefore to allow for regulatory sandboxes in order to test and implement blockchain applications under market circumstances. 

Also, the ongoing governmental negotiations in Austria takes the opportunities provided by the blockchain technology into account. Harald Mahrer, who was the leading promoter for this issue in the outgoing administration, is actively involved in the innovation agenda of the ongoing negotiations. “Blockchain is more than cryptocurrencies. It offers enormous possibilities for new business ideas. Now it is essential to explore these possibilities without taboos in regulatory sandboxes”, he says. 

The summit in Vienna is the kick-off for various activities set by the Austrian government and the Federal Minister. Specifically during the upcoming Austrian presidency of the European Union in the second half of 2018, digitization and new technologies will be a central topic. Also, the ministry has started a new eight million Euro research fund with a strong focus on smart and digital services initiatives as well as blockchain technology. The main goal is to develop blockchain based service innovations.",cryptocurrency
BlockChain,4 Bills for Blockchain in NY,"As reported by CoinDesk.com a lawmaker from New York, Clyde Vanel, has proposed four draft laws to the state government to study where they possibly can use blockchain technology. 
According to the publication, the draft laws establish legal language for blockchain technology in accordance with the state law, and also offer to use it, to check voter tallies on local and federal elections.
So, the first bill suggests adding terminology for “Blockchain technology” and “Smart Contracts” to New York’s technology law and to define what are legal signatures stored on a Blockchain.
The second bill envisages the study of blockchain technology to protect voter tallies and election results, as well as increase the cybersecurity of digital voting platforms. 
The third bill includes a study of Blockchain platform potential to store information quickly and efficiently.
The fourth bill is aimed at creating a task force to determine the impact of the cryptocurrency on New York financial markets.
METRUMCOIN’s opinion:
These 4 bills, if passed, would make a huge leap in legalizing Blockchain technology in New-York. Moreover, if it will be able to work in NY and help local authorities establish a successful Blockchain system to organize elections, it has also a potential to be used throughout America.
If the technology gains success in NY, then it can be a sweet spot for the rest of states in implementing Blockchain. In addition, if they legally accept Blockchain, then there won’t be a door in America Blockchain can’t walk through.

investing,"Help with valuation and critique my analysis, please","I am trying to do a valuation on a private life insurance stock and could use some input from the community.  How would you value this stock and is my logic solid or flawed.  I'm kind of new at this, but basically I want to know what a reasonable target would be if this stock were to make a public offering.

**Key Metrics**

- annual ROE of 21% over the last 4.5 years (fairly consistently)
- total growth over a 4.5 period of 114%
- book value of $21.39 (up from $10 4.5 years ago)
- EPS for the last four quarters combined was $3.65

**Valuations:**

P/E Ratio: Looking at peers, P/E ratios range from 5 to 66 across a range of 15 companies sampled.  Mean is 20, median is 16, standard deviation of 16.  The average PE ratio, over the last 5 years, has hovered around 15 for peer-group insurance companies.  If I use a PE ratio range of 15-20, I get valuation of $55-$73.

P/B ratio:
My understanding of P/B ratio as it applied to financial services industry is that a P/B of 1 is cheap and 2 is likely overpriced.  Using that as a valuation method I get a valuation of $21-$43.

PEG Ratio:
My understanding of PEG ratio, is that a company, when fairly priced, will have a P/E ratio equal to its growth rate.  With a CAGR of 21% and a history of similar results since inception, this would give a valuation of around $77.

ROE: The ROE is significantly greater than peers, suggesting a well run company worth paying a premium

**Other Factors**
Life insurance companies are helped by rising interest rates, which is the current trend.  Although higher reserves and corresponding capital requirements are hitting the industry along with increased regulation, this particular company is well positioned and ready for regulatory change and capital adequacy rules.  This makes me lean toward a higher valuation.

**My thought process:**

So looking at this company and the various valuation methods, I get a range of $22-$77 with the price/book method standing out as being low. Looking at the average P/E ratio of peers, of which this company outperforms, I get a value of $58.  I am going to use this as my absolute lower limit and discard the price/book method as being inappropriate for this relatively new company that significantly outperforms its peer group.  Given the other valuation methods suggesting an upper limit of $73-$77, I am going to peg my upper limit at $73.  That gives me a working range of $58-$73 for the stock.  

Now I need to decide which end of that range is most appropriate.  Given the strong performance relative to peers, I am going to skew this value to the high side of my range.  The mid point of $58-73 is $65.50, making the high side of the range $65.5-$73.  That is a fairly narrow range, the midpoint of which is $69.  

**Conclusion**

If I had to place a value on this stock, I would say $69 is appropriate.",finance

personalfinance,Almost 24 year old deciding what to do for the future.,"Hi Everyone,

First post on here and I hardly frequent this sub to be honest. Just pops up every once and a while. I need some help answering some questions and understanding how all of this stuff works. I'm about to turn 24.

To describe my financial situation currently I make around 40k a year or so. It's at a place I don't like very much that I have been using to help pay for rent, my car, school etc. I don't have really anything in savings (I know, I need to start doing this) and don't have any other source of income or financial help. It's almost impossible for me to get financial aid because of the money my parents make.

I have been terrified of loans my entire life. When I lost my old car and had to buy a new one I was terrified. I ended up getting a car I really liked but the interest rate was around 15%. I eventually fixed that but now I am back to another loan situation. I really don't like my job anymore and haven't been able to do school full time since I work 7-3 and live about an hour away from school. I'm considering getting student loans to pay for the rest of my schooling and finally be a student full time but don't understand how they work, what they cover, and all that stuff. Will I have to sell my car? Does it cover my phone?  I honestly don't understand.

I'm about to finish my generals and have about two years left of school so hopefully that cut off some money from the loans I would get. I have the option to live at home but I'm not sure if that the best options for what loans provide. My parents aren't super laid back either so there would be quite a few rules I haven't had to do for a long time.

Should I try to tough it out and continue doing part time school and work full time? Should I live up there and get school done ASAP? Should I get the loans and live with my parents until I'm done?

I apologize if I broke rules and for the weird structure of this post. I'm just generally flustered about this whole situation and don't know what to do or the best course of action. 

I appreciate the help..",finance
personalfinance,Feeling buried in credit card/loan debt and trying to recover. What are my options? Is debt consolidation a good idea?,"Hello all-
Looking for some advice here, as I'm really not sure how to proceed. I've already read and used some of the tips on [the debt page](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/debt) ; but at this point I feel buried given my situation in the past few months.

I've always kind of lived paycheck to paycheck. I pay all my bills on time, but generally always the minimum payment. I've been serious about trying to build my credit and pay down my credit cards and other debt for about a year now and in doing so- I've budgeted and curbed my spending. With my highest rate interest card, I have been trying to pay more than the minimum with the extra I have. Watching my credit reports monthly and keeping a tab on things, I'd actually noticed a very positive jump in my credit scores.

However, the last week of August I lost my job and did not regain employment until the middle of November; now I bring home about half of what I did. My current job is part time at the moment, and I am unsure if I will have to seek other employment or if they will boost me to full time. The goal within a year is to actually move where I have better job prospects and people who are willing to help me so that I can continue focusing on paying down my debt; but I can not do so as of right now with the situation being what it is.

I am having great difficulty paying all of my bills in a timely manner, and have fallen behind. While a few places had put me in 'hardship programs'- those are all starting to end.

With the high interest rates, the behind payments- and the fact that my credit score actually plummeted 200 points into the 500's; I've been looking into debt consolidation to try and get myself back on track. With a car loan, student loans, a medical bill and three credit cards this is proving to be very difficult. Just the medical bill and credit cards alone are about 10k in debt; two of my credit cards have rates just over 20% and they are not willing to negotiate down as of this time. 

It was suggested to me to look into debt consolidation loan in order to help with not only the interest rates, but to give me fewer payments to keep track of. If debt consolidation is my best option, are there any trusted places I should be looking at?

Any insight would be incredibly appreciate, thank you.",finance
personalfinance,If I were to work for a new company?,"I'm seeing salaries of 67k to 92k for entry level position in my field.  That is the range for this particular job.  Currently I only have 1 year of experience in the field, but i'm at an elevated role but underpaid at my company, technically my workload is that of an assistant manager.  But this company I've been looking at does a lot of nice work, but I'm sure I'd be placed in a role where I don't have as much involvement as I do currently.

Currently I bring home about 30k a year after taxes.  But looking at the 67k salary, which I assume I'd likely get, I'd assume I'd only bring home about 40-45k after taxes. I'm an idiot when it comes to state/federal taxes etc. So that might not be accurate.

Would this be any reason to jump over to a new job?  I feel that as my company begins to progress I will probably get paid more, but I'm not sure of that at this point.  I do enjoy being able to do a lot of the design, permitting, liaison, meetings etc. that I do, but I need to make a real salary bringing home 60k, not 30k or 45k.

Bitcoin,What keeps coins for being lost forever?,"I'm an investor in BTC and a few other CCs.  Right now I have to admit the whole process is a bit complicated and convoluted with some exchanges offering these coins while only one exchange allowing you to buy those coins (IOTA).  Transfers require multiple logins, crazy authorizations and SMS texts being sent, and then there are the QR codes and long deposit/withdrawal links you have to copy and paste. I honestly can't imagine doing this on a cell phone and it's painful enough on a computer with multiple tabs open. 

Needless to say, I'm pretty computer literate but even for me this is all so complicated and at times scary.  I've moved most of my coins offline onto a Ledger but in the event I needed to mass sell my portfolio it seems even a hard wallet will require a lot of time and energy to move funds in the event of a sell off (not to mention it's taking 24 hours or longer to move this currency which was supposed to be ""instant""). 

WITH ALL THAT BEING SAID, I've noticed that in my novice use of Bitcoin, I'm finding that my money is scattered around in multiple places and some exchanges won't let me transfer out partial coins less than say .001 (Binance, I'm looking at you).  

If the idea of Bitcoin is that there will never be more than 20 some million coins, what happens when millions of people start to disregard these fractions of coins or fail to do anything with them in a handful of exchanges?  When I calculate my partial BTC in my Binance account, it equals $4 and at the moment I'm basically dismissing that amount of money and perhaps I will never use that exchange again.  Couldn't this be a huge problem as more and more people do this and eventually deplete the number of available coins?

Maybe this happens a lot with normal Fiat money too with accounts unclaimed but with Fiat money the value and backing by the Federal Reserve is constantly changing and money is constantly being printed (for better or worse). 

Just trying to understand what happens to all this partial money that can easily be overlooked.  I also hear a lot about micro transactions for fractions of a penny but at the moment I'm finding I can't transfer out less than the equivalent of $4 which is way beyond the value of a micro transaction.  

So what gives?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,First Student Loan Payment Due and Want to Pay Over the Minimum. Focus On Principal of One High-Interest or Multiple? More Info Inside,"So as the title says, grace period is over and it's time to start paying. I'm feeling a little stressed but know I'm not in a bad position. I have just about $28,000 in loans broken up as follows:



Stafford Sub. $5,500 @ 3.76%

Stafford Unsub $2,077 @3.76%

Stafford Sub $5,500 @4.29%

Stafford Unsub $2,169 @ 4.29%

Stafford Sub $4,500 @ 4.66%

Stafford Unsub $2,276 @ 4.66%

Stafford Sub $3,568 @3.86%

Stafford Unsub $2,312 @3.86%

I know that I should focus on the higher interest rates (4.66%) in this case after making the minimum payments ($286.82). I plan to make the first payment with an amount of $4,500. After the minimum that leaves me with $4,213.18 to distribute. My question is, do I pay the rest of that on the $4,500 loan at 4.66% or break it up? And if so, how? 

My current expenses are $250 for rent and $80 for phone bill. All other expenses (utilities, food, travel, etc) are negligible, and I currently make around $1,700 a month working part time while looking for a job.",finance

investing,"Law Firm Announces Filing of Securities Class Action Lawsuit PayPal Holdings, Inc.","In reference to the TIO data breach:

&gt;Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announces the filing of a class action lawsuit on behalf of purchasers of the securities of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) from February 14, 2017 through December 1, 2017, inclusive (the “Class Period”). The lawsuit seeks to recover damages for PayPal investors under the federal securities laws.

&gt;According to the lawsuit, defendants during the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the data security program of TIO Networks Corp., which PayPal had acquired by July 2017, was inadequate to safeguard the personally identifiable information of its users; (2) the foregoing vulnerabilities threatened continued operation of TIO’s platform; (3) PayPal revenue derived from its TIO services were therefore unsustainable; (4) as a result, PayPal had overstated the benefits of the TIO acquisition; and (5) consequently, PayPal’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

btc,Roger Ver shames Andreas Antonopolous,"Roger Ver's tweet on Andreas' bad decisions:

https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/938137951518773248

&gt;Andreas is one of the most eloquent speakers on the topic of Bitcoin, but if he had invested even $300 in bitcoin back in 2012, he’d be a millionaire today.

Andreas' reply:

https://twitter.com/aantonop/status/938147200978374662

&gt;I did invest, Roger. Then I sold in 2013 to pay my rent. I didn't have disposable income to work for two years without pay and invest at the same time. I should've gone into more debt, but that would have been irresponsible towards my family who I supported

Extended Andreas reply:

&gt;Andreas M. Antonopoulos posted In defense of optimism Yesterday, I woke to a flurry of activity on Twitter. A prominent member of the bitcoin community had decided to a message to me that many perceived as critical. The tweet pointed out that had I managed my money better I would be wealthy and wouldn't need the support of patrons. It was in response to a message I posted on Twitter a week earlier, to once again dispel the impression that I am a bitcoin millionaire. It is hard for many to accept that someone who has been involved since 2012 has not amassed a great fortune in bitcoin. The truth, however, is that due to circumstances and some poor choices I made, I was not able to benefit as much from the rise of bitcoin as some others have.
At the end of 2012, when I heard about bitcoin, I had been working as a freelance consultant for about a year after burning out of my previous work as a partner in a research firm. I had a modest retirement fund, a small amount of credit card debt and enough income to make ends meet. I was really in limbo, looking for the next opportunity. Bitcoin arrived into my awareness and slapped me in the face. You've all heard my story of tumbling down the rabbit hall, absolutely consumed by awe.
What is not quite obvious is that my obsession also drove me to abandon my consulting work and put all my attention into bitcoin. I worked as hard as I have ever worked, focusing full time on this technology. During this time, I was unable to find any way of making a living through bitcoin. I traveled to speak at conferences (which didn't even cover expenses), I consulted with startups (which couldn't pay me), I wrote articles etc. To support my ""habit"", I dipped into my savings. I cut back on my expenses as much as I could and started ravaging my savings. By mid-2013 I was forced to start liquidating my retirement funds. In my early 40's, I was undoing a lifetime of savings, in a way most people would consider irresponsible. While doing so, I incurred penalty taxes for early withdrawal. Then, I went into credit card debt. By the end of 2013 I was ""worse than broke"": going into debt at an alarming rate.
Finally, in 2014 I started making a bit of income. I was so deep in debt that I continued to live paycheck to paycheck, struggling to chip away at my debt. It was going to be a long two years before I finally became debt free at the end of 2016.
I won't complain about the lost opportunity. I am extremely fortunate to be able to live debt free, doing my dream job in a field I absolutely love.
Yesterday, while reading the tweet that criticized me for my poor choices, I felt sick to my stomach. It forced me to confront and relive every choice I made and all the missed opportunities. You see, the critical tweet contained a big grain of truth. I could've become wealthy. If only I hadn't sold. If only I hadn't given away hundreds of bitcoin to complete strangers. If only I had reduced my expenses more. If only I had made smarter choices. If only...
Working in bitcoin is an endless struggle against cynicism, negativity, regret. Throughout the last 5 years I have always tried to maintain an optimistic and positive outlook, to focus on the long term, to think about the potential to lift billions out of poverty. But every now and then, I get dragged back into the negative. Yesterday was one of those days. I felt crushed.
And then, something amazing happened. Over the next several hours, tens, dozens, then hundreds of people responded. I sat reading the responses with tears in my eyes. An outpouring of positivity washed over me. People I have never met jumped to my defense, reminding me that they started their journey after watching my videos, or reading my books. Some people attacked the original criticism and its author (which I strongly discourage). But the vast majority focused on optimism.
Not only did people remind me of the importance of my work, they also encouraged each other to support me. In the last year, I have gradually received more and more of my income from Patreon. Patreon allows me to regain my financial security without switching my focus to commercial conferences, banking and investment events and chasing the next paycheck. Because of Patreon, I managed to stop selling and finally HODL. Because of Patreon I can dedicate my entire focus to the people who I have always felt like I am working for: the community of crypto-currency dreamers, visionaries and creators. I now finally get to work for you.
Yesterday, you fed my soul. You reminded me why it is so important to remain optimistic, focused and determined to overcome the cynicism. It's been a long and hard road. Sometimes I get lost. But, every time I do, you step up and help me find my way, find my focus again. You show me that I do not walk alone on this path. You are all there with me. I am part of a wonderful community and you have my back.
Today, I am even more focused on my goals: educate the next 10 million users. Train the next 10,000 developers. Do it all in every medium possible. Do it in more languages. Do it with more energy, with more passion. Do it with unrelenting optimism. In the end, my engine runs on hope, it runs on optimism. And today, it's turbocharged.

Now, I'm a Bitcoin backer, but I share the same sentiment as Andreas in that Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash can co-exist, and be two completely different cryptocurrencies, with two completely different technologies, dev teams, communities, etc, without feeling the need to ""destroy"" the other.

However, Roger Ver is a real shit stain for attacking Andreas like this. Really really really shitty move. Andreas helped me, as well as millions of other people, in understanding Bitcoin, what it means in changing the world, and how it all works. Andreas is probably the reason I got into cryptocurrency.

Why do you go about shaming someone like that? Is Roger really just all about the money? Really? The self-made millionaire before Bitcoin even existed is shaming people for not have the foresight to make decisions which could make them millionaires?

I've lost all respect for Ver. I hope you might have too.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"I am homeless, jobless, have a disability and my student loans are asking for 360 dollars a month. What can I do?",I had to take a medical leave from school after being diagnosed with C-PTSD. I had to quit my job because I was being triggered daily and my symptoms were getting worse. This has left me homeless and jobless. I have been looking for a job within my field but I have not heard back from any of them. I just got an email from my student loans and they said I am going to have to start paying for them the day after Christmas. I can barely keep myself fed let alone afford to give all of the crumbs I make a day to the loan servicer. Does anyone one have any advice to get them off my back until I get back on my feet?,finance
personalfinance,Save cash for house or pay down student loan debt? Help me plan the next couple of years,"I'm having some difficulty deciding what is the best use of the cash I currently have, and how to most effectively plan financially for some of the goals I have. Basically, I'm wondering if I should keep the cash I have on hand now and continue saving for a down payment for a house, or use some of the cash to pay down student loan debt.

Here is my info:

I'm in my mid 20's, male, making around $56,000/year. After taxes, retirement, and health insurance I take home about $3000/month (paid biweekly). We just had our first child a few months ago, and my wife left her job to be a stay at home mom for the time being.

- Between my wife and I, we have $60,000 of student loan debt
- Monthly payments of all combined student loan debt is ~$900
- Only other debt is car loan, $5000 at $150/month
- We have $25,000 cash in an emergency fund, plus $6000 saved toward a down payment on a house.

I'm deciding if I should put the $6000 cash we have saved toward a down payment on a house toward the student loan debt? This could knock out one of our private loans, freeing up $160/month. I'm also wondering if I should continue to put any extra savings toward the loan debt too, or continue building up our down payment fund? We would like to buy a home in 2-3 years, probably in the $150,000 range, so we want to have $30,000 saved by then.

I don't want to touch the $25,000 emergency fund. The peace of mind this provides with a new child and only one income is necessary for us. We could live for 8-9 months without income with this.

Thanks for any advice, and please let me know if I should provide any more detail info.

Bitcoin,As the price grows people keep asking me what it is. This is what I am sending them:,"Why it keep buying it:
As an American who uses dollars my dollars represent a bill coming my way. Through inflation we are slaves to wars, trade wars, corporations growing but were working longers hours, food is too expensive and rent will never come back down. All of the above add to a defecate that has been growing for the last 100 years. This affects the middle class (70% of the population) and our ability to purchase things (purchasing power). This is due to the fact that when our dollar loses purchasing power in the world market our things get more expensive. As well when we print money and expand our market supply of dollars they lose value. If we lose purchasing power than we cant buy things and corporations cant grow anymore. This typically causes a correction or the economy shrinks to levels people can afford.

personalfinance,Almost out of debt. Eliminating expenses??,"I make roughly 24k a year. A have one Quicksilver Capital One card $150 left to pay. I have to pay back my brother $150 on his ford credit card. That card taught me about compounding interest. As the interest rate was 30% after 6 months and I owed $300 of interest. Ouch. 

I don’t have a car loan, my credit is roughly 680 and I have been working on it. I want to be debt free. I want to minimize my expenses. 
Here’s my next step.

I have an iPhone 7 from sprint with contract and I owe roughly 2000 to them until the contact is up. I got the phone a few months ago. I owe 520 left on the phone and I’m aware of Sprints early termination fee. However that fee would a price I’m willing to pay to cut my expenses and not have a $105 bill eating at me every month. I would pay this with my taxes. (As others would spend to get a new phone)I have a $98 progressive insurance bill. Rent is currently $344 a month with 3 people paying. 515 with 2. I make about 1.4k a month. 

Would this be a good strategy? My sprint bill eats up 2k a year plus. I’m okay with buying a gps and paying for minutes. We live in a world where we are told to spend spend spend. Its toxic and I do not need to participate in their business practices. No one needs to pay someone else for data. At least I don’t.

personalfinance,How can I contribute more towards retirement? Should I decrease my student loan contributions? How am I doing? What more could I be doing?,"I’m 31, about to turn 32. In the last year and a half I have completely turned my finances around. I had worked prior to that on grants and freelancing so saving wasn’t always possible and only had $5500 in retirement savings. I now have a steadyish job that pays $78,250. Today I have $36,128.94 combined in a company 401K and Roth IRA. I’ll max out the Roth for my first time ever and just come a couple thousand short of maxing out my 401k. I allocate at least 26% of every paycheck to my company 401k, but sometimes increase temporarily, like right now I’m at 31%. I have $6207 in student loan debt, but no consumer debt. I’m rapidly paying off my student loan at about $700 a month, which I know financial advisors discourage, but I’m already contributing so much towards retirement and with a 5.90 interest rate I’m wanting to knock it out quickly. I started the year with no emergency fund and have saved $10,448 with a high yield savings account! I try to maintain a balance of $2000 in my checking account after bills. 

I live in Florida so pay no state income tax. I don’t own a car or property. I am paying a little more than I should on rent but it means I can bike to work so the difference works out and I get exercise! I am pretty frugal, although I do like to spend money on travel. 

While I’ve made great strides, I keep thinking about what I could do more. I don’t have a year’s salary in retirement yet and in three years I’m supposed to have two years’ salary in retirement. To achieve that I’d have to contribute $52166.66 each year for the next three years which is way over the combined legal limit for Roth and 401k. Feeling like I can’t get there. Whenever I talk to retirement reps at Fidelity and Empower they kind of sugar coat things. Which makes me wonder if they talk to women that way, or just don’t want to alarm people. I know I’m young, but I take this seriously, and I’m seriously behind. Can you help? Where should I be focusing? How can I contribute more to retirement? What am I doing wrong here?",finance

* $4500 in student loans with 6.05% average interest rate
* 6-month emergency fund built up
* Contributing employer-match amount (8%) to 401k
* Maxing both Roth IRA and HSA contributions

I just recently bought a house that ate into my emergency fund a bit. Now that I have it built back up to 6 months of expenses (which is plenty, I feel, as I have a very stable and in-demand job) I am torn between the following options:

1. Pay off my student loans in full from the emergency fund and use the payments I was making to build it back up
2. Redirect my monthly emergency fund budget towards paying off the student loans, or
3. Continue making the same payment towards student loans and invest the emergency fund budget

I don't have any major upcoming purchases that I need to save for so any income not going towards the emergency fund or student loans would go towards retirement.

My gut feeling is to go with option 1 of paying off the student loans in full and rebuild the emergency fund back to 6 months with the student loan payments. Is there anything I am missing here that might make the other options more attractive?",finance

personalfinance,Should I take this raise?,"Hello! Long time lurker and I have learned a lot from this board.

I'm coming to you for your opinions. A little background - I am a nurse. I have been since May 2016. I work in Chicago in a Nursing home. I started at this staff nurse position almost exactly 11 months ago starting at $24/hour. I was promised a 6 month performance review and raise in hourly rate after 6 months. I did receive that raise (after 7 months and me asking about it) and was given $1.50 more per hour for a total of $25.5 an hour.

My issue is this. We are severely understaffed and I am regularly working 8-24 hours of OT a week just to keep my residents safe. Which is still nearly impossible due to poor management and overworked and under educated staff. My nursing assistants are brand new fresh out of school and I end up doing a large portion of their job on top of my own which defeats the purpose of having a nursing assistant. This however is not entirely their fault as the management fails to educate them (I feel obliged to say that because they are good people with good intentions).

To cut to the chase. I decided to ask for a significant raise to take advantage of the fact that we are severely understaffed and they could not afford to lose another 48-60 hours of staff nursing hours a week. I asked for $28.83 and they countered with $27. I am more than willing to walk and have several interviews lined up for next week anyway. I have read never to take the first offer. So my question is should I counter with something dead in the middle of our rates and hand them my resignation if they decline? I believe it would be much more expensive for them to have to hire out an agency to fill my vacancy (as well as several other nurses that are leaving).

personalfinance,Trying to figure out how to repay these student loans and plan for a future when it looks so grim finance-wise,"Hi all,

I'm hoping to get advice on what to do with my current student loan situation. 

I am 25 years old and I currently have two student loans that I am paying on: 

1) Sallie Mae loan - $27,990 owed at 8% fixed rate 
Current monthly payment: $345 

2) Federal loan through Great Lakes - $11,000 owed at 4.6%
Current monthly payment: $140 

Total I pay $485 per month. 

On average, I make about $1000 per month at work. Even though I have been at my current job for the last 8 years, I have no room for growth and my boss has repeatedly says she has no money to pay us more. I have applied to many jobs in my hopeful field and I have yet to receive anything. 

I was just kicked off of my parent's dental insurance plan and I know my health insurance is next (in 6 months).

I was not wise with my credit cards in college but paid those off before I had to pay on my student loans. But with rent, utilities, and general living expenses I can not afford to pay $485 per month. I tried to contact Sallie Mae to lower that payment and they told me that there's no option for me.

I've never had great habits with money...but they've slowly been improving, but due to a year-long rut I have experienced personal and career life setbacks which coupled with procrastination have caused me to rely on credit cards and stick my head in the sand and ignore other debts altogether.

-I've reached an all-time low point and my life needs to change NOW. I feel like I have all these bad things (debt, career, mental health) ambushing me from all sides, and that I can't really begin to move forward until I have a solid plan hatched out to get out of debt.There's nothing quite like creditor calls to ruin your day.

-I currently have credit card debt, an auto loan, and the usual monthly utilities which I often fail to pay in full or on time. 

-My credit score was once good (even with CC debt, as I paid minimums or more on time), but is now terrible. It's going to take time to rebuild.

**I need your advice:**

-I need to make a very good budget, I don't live in luxury, but I do currently live beyond my means. What would you suggest as far as a spreadsheet, app, or tracking approach?

-What is the best approach for paying off all my debts? Should I try to pay them all directly through the institutions and negotiate lower interest rates if possible? Or should I get a loan or line of credit, pay them all off at once, and then make schedule payments against that line of credit?

-Any other wisdom?

I recently bought about .1 of BTC when it hit 9900, just to test the waters. I’m 23, self employed (no 401k) and recently lost a very big chunk of my savings because i forgot to pay my quarterly income tax and paid off a $5k student loan just a week before. 

It was an unexpected loss that I didn’t account for. Completely forgot I had to make payments quarterly (just recently self employed) and completely my fault. 

I have about 11k left of student loans with interest rates at about 3-4%. 

Here’s where the ethical dilemma comes in. Last year I spoke with my grandparents (recently retired lawyers) to loan me $5k to invest in a house. At the time, my goal was to buy a multi family home with a few roommates and have the tenants cover the mortgage etc etc. They were cool with $5-10k at 3% over 3 years. 

Fast forward to last week and I have no desire to own a home anymore, so I told them I didn’t need the loan. I made a joke about how “I should probably have put it towards student loans anyway”. 

Yesterday I get a call saying they talked about it and decided to give me $5k as a gift to pay off some student loans. I’ve never received a gift like this (I won’t receive it for another 2 weeks). 

So what do I do? My savings are low. My school loans are 11k. My grandparents gave me the money to pay off loans, not invest. Do I save $1000, put $1000 into btc and pay $3000 of loans? Am I scumbag for not putting 100% into my loans? Help me out here.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,I may have fucked up big time,"I am a first time investor and panicking. I opened an account with Vanguard and wanted to invest in their Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (VFIAX).

personalfinance,Fastest way to pay off loans,"My husband and would like to get out of debt ASAP.  We are currently  paying extra on the 3 loans we have.

House: owe $85,000, interest rate 3.9%, payment $1,315 plus $250 extra
Home improvement loan: owe $6,000 interest rate 3%, payment $160 plus $100 extra
Car loan: owe $17,000 interest rate 4%, payment $450 plus $75 extra

Would it be faster to put the extra toward one loan and begin to ladder the loans or will it not make any difference?  The interest rates are all similar.  I was thinking to work on paying off the home improvement loan because that is the smallest, then the car loan and finally the house. The home improvement loan could be paid off in less than a year.  What do you think?

personalfinance,Can a bank re-report old delinquencies to the credit bureaus?,"I made a bad decision as a student years ago and opted for a student loan of $5,000 USD through Wells Fargo. After graduating in Dec 2013, I, like many other students, found that it was not as easy to find a job as the university made it seem when I signed up. Without a steady income, my federal loans were able to be put on income based repayment, but my Wells Fargo one was not, and the bills quickly began racking up. 
Fast forward to summer 2016 when I FINALLY found professional work and needed to move, I had to clean up my credit to get an apartment. I wrote to WF, and they kindly removed the negative reports. My credit score went from 480 to 720s over night. 
The job I took in earnest, pays very low for my profession, about $26,000. My wife started working full time at the same time I did, had since lost her job. We came to a point this summer where there just wasn’t enough money coming in and I missed one payment. I caught up the following month. Recently, when my score updated, I saw that my credit score of 740 was suddenly now in the 400’s again. Wells Fargo re-added all of those past negative scores in addition to a new one. 
What can I do about this? My wife is working again and we want to start looking into purchasing a house, but this is going to kill our ability to find reasonable credit. 

TL:DR - Wells Fargo took away bad reports then added them all back plus another. Can I fix this?

My wife and I work for the same employer so we both get free health insurance and since Tricare is cheaper for the whole family we both have double insurance coverage.  My employer offers two plans, a low deductible plan with no HSA and a high deductible plan with an annual HSA contribution of about $500 dollars.  Our benefits specialist claims that ~~by law~~ *per HR policy* I am ineligible for the HSA contribution since I have Tricare, but I have never put it down on paper that I have Tricare because, quite frankly, it's none of their business as far as I am concerned.  Does anyone know if there's any truth to this?

     * Other (after refinance of several 6.5% loans): ~13.6k at 4.64%, min. mo. payment $280.
     * Minimum combined payment $655 per month.

* I contribute 5% to Roth TSP (to max out gov. matching) - C Fund 60%, S Fund 20%, I Fund 20%. Current value ~13k.
* Rent is $850 per month.

My current goal/strategy is to eliminate my student loans as quickly as possible, so I'm paying extra per month towards my loans in order to pay them off within 2 years.

I'd like to begin building my savings more for a down payment on a house, but I'm unsure if I should wait until my loan is paid off. Additionally, I do realize that contributing to my TSP might make more sense as I can expect a higher return than what I would save by paying down my loan. The problem is that I would like to be able to see this money in the near future (wthin 5 years) should I decide to purchase a house.

 I have heard others have recently gotten better rates, and when I search around for refinancing estimates I see ~3.6-3.8%. My credit score is ~760 and hers ~770.

personalfinance,Check the fine print on promotional zero per cent interest rates for in store credit card purchases. Many apply retroactive interest if not paid in full by the end of the promotion.,"Just over two years ago I got estimates for replacing basement windows on my newly purchased home. I went with Home Depot (who really just subs out the work). They offered a two year zero percent interest promotional offer if I put the balance on their Home Depot Card which I accepted. 

When I received my first billing statement I noticed they charged me interest on the purchase so I called their customer service number and they corrected the issue. I'm assuming this ""reset the clock"" on the promotion. 

I've been paying the $3700 off $50 to $100 a month over the past two years. 

I naively believed that any remaining balance after the promotion ran out would be subject to the 17%+ interest rate. Wrong. 

Fast forward to this month and I get my statement.  I have about a $900 balance remaining and interest charges listed as $800. Since everything wasn't paid off by the promotional deadline Citi (who operates Home Depot consumer cards) retroactively bill all interest on the entire amount. 

I called in and spoke to a rep initially thinking it was a calculation error on their part but no. ""That's how it works"" is what I was told. I asked if I could pay the balance and remove the interest they agreed to do so. I mentioned this scenario to a co-worker who had the same thing happen to him when purchasing a mattress and he wasn't so lucky - he offered to pay the balance and was told the interest had to be paid as well. 

I'm not happy about having to pay out $900 unexpectedly especially around Christmas but better that than $1800+. I have no one to blame but myself for not checking the fine print more carefully.

gaming,The Complete Guide to Beating DC Legends “Flight of the Penguin’s” last battle with an underpowered team.,"This is a guide for anyone having difficulty with the Penguin event’s last node, but specifically F2P players. Penguin may seem impossible but it can be done, and it can be done without an overpowered team.  I just beat the final battle with a team &lt; 14000 points. I won’t lie, this is entirely dependent on Reverse Flash.  If you don’t have him, don’t bother reading further. I know some people have had great success with a bleed-based squad (Robin, Dr. Poison) or simply overpowered/debuffed him with a WW POT/Dr. Fate squad, but those didn’t’ work for me. My WW sucks, I don’t have Dr. Poision or Step and I don’t spend money so I don’t have Lv 70 gear 10 characters. So this is what worked for me, and based on what I’ve read, my version is pretty competitive since it only took about 10-15 minutes, compared to 30-60min I’ve read about other accounts.

Setup: My squad was Capt Cold (leader), Aquaman, RF and Zatanna. No toon was above 4000 points or Lv 56. My RF wasn’t even legendary and this is based on him! Aqua was L3 (not that it matters) and Z and CC were only L1. To attempt this run, try to get your RF gear level as high as it can (mine was 8) and focus on pumping up his basic attack as it will be of paramount importance (more on this later). I believe mine was Lv 6. 

Roles: Aqua and RF do the heavy lifting in Wave 1 and the first half of Wave 2. Capt Cold’s entire purpose is to slow people down (his damage is minimal, but his impact on pacing can’t be overstated). Zatanna is there to heal, debuff when applicable and otherwise chip away with her attack. 

 Strategy: Focus on one enemy at a time and don’t move on until they’re dead. The enemies on this node should not be underestimated and can quickly kill a unit, leaving you helpless and wasting 35 energy. Nothing is more frustrating than having an enemy with only a sliver of health land a critical hit on one of your characters because you didn’t take the time to finish him first. I know you’re tempted to save your big attacks (Aqua’s 2nd and 3rd skill, for example) on a fresh enemy but it’s not worth it. There will be DOZENS of rounds before this battle is over so your skills will refresh quickly enough, believe me. It will be easier to focus and strategize with one less enemy. 

Wave 1: I focused on the green affinity enemies first so Aqua could have a bigger impact earlier as his role fades away at the end and RF can hit hard and often regardless. Use Cold to slow down the enemies not being targeted and save his sweep attack when the enemies get their mends up as that can effectively neuter their healing. If a toon (usually Cold or Z herself) is below 50%, use Zatanna’s heal, don’t gamble and try to ‘max the heal potential’ because a critical from the enemy can take out your cast and the heals will come quickly enough. Don’t head based on RF because his speed ups will accumulate rather quickly so his paradox is usable quite often. Wait until RF is below 50% to maximize the heal and then use the extra strength ups to pound the enemy. 

Wave 2: First rule! NEVER attack penguin with anyone other than RF unless you have to (i.e .he’s the only one left). His shield is strong and his affinity resistance neutralizes your blues and both build up very quickly. Cold should use skill 2 on penguin when possible because it doesn’t trigger his passive and keeping him slow is helpful. One you eliminate the underlings you can begin the second half of Wave 2. 

I had 3 char left (Aqua, RF and Z) and if I’m being honest, the other two were actually a hindrance. I would recommend not healing at this point and letting them get killed. Don’t worry about RF because unless your RF is a pushover, unlikely or you’d never even make it to Penguin, than you can’t really lose 1 on 1 at this point because Penguin’s attacks are weak and your speed will build so quickly you should always have a Paradox on standby when your health drops below 50. If possible, try to use the Paradox when the cooldown on skill 2 is at 1 so your very next attack gives you 2 speed ups right away. 

If for whatever reason you don’t’ know this, the secret to the battle is in one sentence. Reverse Flash’s basic attack ignores shield. With that gift alone, you can win this battle.
 
Timing is very important in this phase as this battle will already test your endurance and patience and you want to maximize when you can actually do damage. Penguin easily reached his full shield with me and stayed that way so he was basically invincible to any attack other than RF basic. His umbrella triggers often and his awareness is annoying. Since only RF’s basic does any actual damage, don’t be afraid to use the otherwise more powerful skill 2 and 3 to get rid of the awareness and use his basic to actually do damage. I averaged a measly 1000 HP per non-critical strike, so you can imagine this battle takes awhile. But slowly and surely, his health began to drop because even though his shield is awesome and his HP god-like, HE CAN”T HEAL so just chip away with the basic attack and EVENTUALLY he will die. Congrats! You just beat, IMHO, the toughest hero challenge stage yet!",technology
CryptoCurrency,"Bitcoin's popularity seems like it will also be its inevitable downfall...if increased market cap seems to bring unlimited volatility, how can it ever become a viable currency or hedge asset?","Bitcoin seems like it doesn't have any function anymore except a speculation vehicle.

Most admit Bitcoin isn't necessarily the most promising Blockchain Technology compared to newer technologies/alt coins.

The main arguments I hear in favor of Bitcoin's long term potential are either its viability as an alternative to fiat currency, or a digital hedge asset...as an alternative to Gold.

Gold isn't a great currency, because it isn't really a great medium to exchange goods,...its hard to go to a store and exchange a block of gold for a new watch. But it is a great way to store value It has hundreds of years of history as a reliable means to hedge wealth outside of government-controlled fiat money. And in general, its pretty stable. The price swings up and down inverse to the general economy. But you're never getting 2000% turns in a year. 

Now that the Bitcoin market cap has increased dramatically, we're seeing swings +/- $2000 on some days.  With something that susceptible to volatility, it seems pretty useless as both a currency and as a digital asset. 

Even if Bitcoin becomes widely accepted for transactions...how many people want to buy a watch with Bitcoin in the morning, when by that evening you could have bought a watch and a half with the same amount you paid?

And how many people are really willing to transfer $1,000,000 of fiat money into Bitcoin in the morning, when it could only be worth $700,000 by the afternoon? 

And if everybody's strategy is HODL, and keep buying more and more.... with a relatively fixed supply and increasing demand....when does the volatility end?

While you have some millionare/billionares/investment companies hopping on board...and a lot of FOMO buying by the general population....I don't see how the majority of institutional investors or mainstream high net-worth individuals would be willing to take that kind of risk with the bulk of their net worth.  Its still too new and unpredictable.

While some tout the main benefit of Crypto as a currency which doesn't rely on the whims of governments or banks, the reason the USD doesn't crash during periods of increased spending or periods of economic instability is because the government has means to control inflation. They can change interest rates, reserve rates with banks, or enact measures to take money out of the spending supply.

Bitcoin has no means to control inflation, other than changing the potential supply. But with the current limited supply, and demand through the roof....nobody has been able to answer is where is the point of stability?  

And with no stability, what purpose does it really serve other than a Pump &amp; Dump get rich quick scheme?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,(US) When should I play the balance transfer game?,"Like most young adults I was stupid with my credit at a young age and have lots of balances on lots of cards. Credit Karma indicates that the reason my score is so low is because I have too much balance to available on too many cards (three cards are at 97%~) I'm not struggling with monthly payments but I am frustrated by a) the number of bills and b) the interest rate on some of my cards. 

Credit Karma is suggesting I apply for a card (with good chances I'll get approved according to them) and do a balance transfer. 

My concern is that my husband and I just took out a mortgage and I have three hard pulls on my credit report because of it... and my credit isn't so great rn. (600 - 675. I was at 675 when we got our mortgage and CK says I'm at 600 at TransUnion and 612 at Equifax now?). Never been sent to collections and other than being dumb and young my credit score has no other negatives... my debt to income is pretty tight. 

I'm trying to decide if the hit to my credit from applying for a new card and potentially being denied is worth attempting the balance transfer game. Balance transfer does make sense - 0% interest, frees up some balance to available, but would the impact of adding another hard pull (and potentially a decline) out weigh the potential good?

I was stuck outside my home city for Hurricane Harvey since the airports were shut down, and therefore was a little tighter on cash than usual  I called Capital One to see what my options were and they said although our county was declared a federal disaster area, the only thing they could offer was to not charge any late fees until December but my payments would still be due.  In the meantime, cash gets even tighter due to the fact that I am self employed and  my husband is at a low paying hourly job that has been decreasing hours (currently looking for a new one).  Thankfully we were approved for food stamps for a month, but sadly nothing else.  

I paid August late and November's payment is pending.  4 tiers of customer service said that there is absolutely nothing they can do about the jump in APR so just be on time for a year.  I am currently $500 over limit simply because they continue to charge interest on top of my current balance. 

Help!  We just sold a car yesterday to take care of an unexpected HOA assessment and will be putting our condo up for sale next month in order to move in with family.  What are my other options?  I feel like I am stuck due to the fact that this was stated in the fine print.  Am I being a baby by feeling this is completely unfair and predatory?

personalfinance,Pay off student loans or continuing saving for large expected expense in the near future?,"I have about $22k in savings currently and my student loan balance is around $19k meaning I could pay it all off and still have a little cushion left over. I currently pay around $300 a month towards them and the payment isn't really impacting my life or financial situation. 

The problem is that in the somewhat near future, I need to have a minor surgery done (nothing life threatening; mostly cosmetic so insurance won't cover much) that will cost around $38k. I can get approved for a personal loan from Sofi with an interest rate up to a whopping 14% with monthly payments of around $750-800; quite a bit more than my current student loan payments. 

I have zero debt other than my student loans (no car payment, no credit card debt, no mortgage) and make decent money in a low cost of living city. My credit is fine and I don't expect having any issue getting approved for that personal loan. 

How do you think I should use my savings? Pay off my student loans once and for all or throw all of it at the surgery? Split the money between the two?",finance

WHY DO YOU WANT TO DO IT?

Because you are good shibes and want to help the doge network prosper. This you can do by running the full client **and** opening up [to the outside world](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/6chkqq/please_if_you_can_run_a_full_nodes_by_enabling/) by running as a full node. Downloading the entire blockchain via torrent network is much faster then would be with the doge full core client only. Especially useful if you want to recover old wallets.


HOW TO USE IT: 

1. use the torrent file with any bittorrent software of your choice ([like this for example](http://www.utorrent.com))

2. Plz. don't forget to add [more trackers](https://pastebin.com/uSBPMinF) to the torrent file, it will help finding peers

3. download the bootstrap file 
4. please consider seeding the torrent for as long as feasible (just let it run)
5. download and install the full Core client from http://dogecoin.com for your operating system 
6. Launch the Dogecoin Core client once and let it run for a short while to download the first few blocks. This creates the needed directory 
7. Close the client 
8. Place the downloaded bootstrap file into the ""dogecoin"" data directory (the one with files named wallet.dat, peers.dat, fees_estimates.dat and such ). If you did not change the default path during installation, on Windows: open Windows Explorer and enter *%appdata%* as a path, you'll find it there. Mac users [look here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/7iat0y/for_all_new_shibes_who_wish_to_run_the_full/drrsv8f/). On Linux, it shall be ""~/.dogecoin/bootstrap.dat"".
9. Launch the client. If the bottstrap is at the correct place, the core must show at the bottom of its window that it started importing blocks from disk. 
10. once the operation finishes (it will take some time) the core will rename the file to ""bootstrap.dat.old"". Close the client and you can now delete the file. 
11. start saving up doge for the trip to the moooooooon!

personalfinance,25 with a good paying job and no idea what to do with the money,"I'm 25, just broke up with a long term girlfriend whose expensive alcohol habit I'm no longer expected to fund, and at the same time switched to a higher paying job so now I'm making 89k. I live in a relatively expensive area for the Midwest.

Monthly income after taxes: $5500 (Will I have a tax burden?) 

Monthly expenses (EDIT: Forgot a couple of these):

* Rent: $1445 (This could certainly be brought down, but the current lease goes until August)
* Electric + Gas + Internet: $150
* Food/Entertainment: $400
* Car Insurance + Cell Phone Plan: $100
* Gas/Household Upkeep: $100

I currently have about $6000 to my name. I have $2800 on a 0% APR credit card promotion which is due in about a month. I have $7750 in student loan debt currently in repayment at a low interest rate (some at 3.1% and some at 3.6%, fixed).

I have nothing saved for retirement. My new employer automatically contributes 6% per month to a 401k, and will additionally match up to an extra 4% from me, resulting in a contribution of 14% when I pay 4%. I assume that any suggested long-term goals will begin with maxing this out.

I have an old (2000) Toyota Camry with 220,000 miles on it. It hasn't been well taken care of, and it currently has a wheel bearing starting to give out. I've been hoping I can trade it in and buy something nicer and more reliable instead of continuing to fix it up. I'm skeptical that the car can make it through the winter, certainly not without fixing the wheel bearing and whatever else might be wrong with it. My commute is only 1.8 miles each way, but I would like to be able to freely put miles on a vehicle without worry.

I grew up fairly poor so I have no experience in dealing with investments, portfolios, or anything of the sort. What would a more experienced person do in my position, both short-term and long-term?

Bitcoin,Bitcoin is not an island - it is part of a larger financial system,"Hey guys.  I want to raise awareness of an issue I haven't seen discussed very much.

A lot of us view Bitcoin as an escape from a financial system that we have fundamental issues with.  The inflationary nature of fiat currencies, especially with zero interest rates, rewards borrowing and punishes saving. 

A lot of us see cryptocurrencies as a safe haven from this - many assume that a crisis in the wider financial system would be good for the price of bitcoin, similar to how gold has historically done well in a crisis.  *But bitcoin did not even exist at the time of the 2008 crisis*.  We don't have a reference point for what would happen.

One thing that did happen in the 2008 crisis is that people moved money out of high-risk high-return asset classes to pay down debt or invest in lower-risk asset classes.

Bitcoin is often compared to tulips by people who know very little about either. What is not widely known is that the tulip bubble didn't end because the fad ended - it ended because of an economic shock to the wider economy - Germany unexpectedly losing the 30 years war in 1636.

My core point is this: have a plan. How are you going to pay your rent or mortgage if another 2008-level shock hits the economy and you lose your job?  You should have an answer that doesn't involve dipping into your bitcoins.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,How to go to college when your broke,"Thought I would just write this down in hopes that it could help at least one person. All of my friends that went to college are in huge amounts of debt ($30,000- $120,000) and some are even having problems finding jobs. The cost of a higher education is ridiculous and it seems like things are just getting worse.



I was raised by a single mother who at her highest level was making $33,000 a year and still remember her saying “If you want to go to school I just can’t help you.” So I had to figure out how to do it by myself without going into crippling debt and luckily not only did I go to school without spending much of my own money, I finished without any debt. Just so you know I graduated in the winter of 2015 so hopefully this info isn’t too old. Sorry for the long post.



Figure out if you need to go to college or not: I feel like there is so much talk coming from people saying everyone needs to go to college and it’s just not true. College isn’t for everyone. I personally feel like I did need it just because I felt like I needed the structure. If the idea of school doesn’t seem right to you just take a year off, it’s not really going to hurt you in the long run. Get a job, start a business or maybe even go to a trade school and see if that life is for you. The last thing you need is to finish college and find out that you didn’t need a degree and also be in debt.



FAFSA, FAFSA, FAFSA: I cannot tell you how important this is. Sign up-up for the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). It’s the doorway to free money. If you’re coming from a family like I did you won’t believe how much they will pay. When I was in community college I was getting so many grants (free money you don’t have to pay back) I was pretty much getting paid to go to college. That money paid for my gas, food and whenever my car broke down.



Study and take the ACT and SAT: I really wish I cared more about SAT/ACT earlier in high school, unfortunately I didn’t and when I did care I didn’t do well on it. If you have the chance study and take the tests even if you think you won’t do that well, you might surprise yourself. If you do well enough on these tests you might be able to get scholarships (we’ll talk more about these later). Also schools want to make sure you’re not going to be a waste of time. I know these test can seem like a lot of money especially if you’re from a family with no money, but you can hustle enough to figure it out. Talk to your counselor about registering for the SAT or SAT Subject Tests and whether you qualify for a fee waiver.



Live at home: Some people can’t live at home, but if you can, do it. It will save so much money.



Go to college in-state: Please try to do this. The difference between in-state and out of state is usually double… enough said.



Go to a community college first then finish up at a university: I really don’t understand how community college got a bad reputation; it’s not bad at all. If you go to one in your area the cost is crazy cheap and a lot of the professors teaching also teach at the big universities. Just make sure the classes your taking can transfer over easily to a bigger university when the time comes. Your guidance counselor is your best friend!



Test out of classes: Talk to your guidance counselor and see what classes you can test out of. Not only with this save money, but you will that much closer to graduating. Just go to the local book store and buy a used copy of the test prep and study.



Try not to take loans: If you have to, it happens, but that should be a last ditch resort.



Get an easy job on campus: I actually really enjoyed this. I worked in the computer lab at night at my university helping people with simple computer stuff like how to use the printer. These types of jobs are pure gold! I had plenty of time to work on my homework and when I was done I would just watch Netflix.

 

Again sorry for the long post, just thought this could help.

TLDR: Figure out if you need to go to college or not, fill out the FAFSA, take the ACT and SAT, Go to a community college, live at home, go to college in-state, test out of classes and get an easy job.

personalfinance,"25 years old, looking to buy house","Hi everyone, 
I'm heading into uncharted territory here and I'm strongly considering buying a house in the next 4-6 months. The problem is, I'm not sure if my current financial situation will allow me to get a mortgage, or if it's a good idea in general. I started a new job and got a significant pay increase, paid vacation, overtime, 401k match, bonus structure, etc and I've been there for three months. Here's the specifics of my finances:

I make 53,000 dollars per year not counting overtime. I typically work 45-50 hours per week, some weeks up to 70 @ time and a half 

I pay for: 
Car insurance $75

Car payment: $265 

Health insurance: $250/ month - going to drop as I'm going to an HSA provided by my employer @ $45 my cost per month

Food: $150 / month

Entertainment: $150-200 per month

STUDENT LOANS: 
I have roughly $56,000 in student loans and am currently on an income-driven repayment plan so my payments are very low. I hate it, but I wasn't making nearly as much at my last job and had to do something so that I could save a little money just to exist with a car payment and have food. I would like to get back on a 10 year repayment plan and aggressively pay it down, so my payments would probably be closer to $600 / month on that type of plan.

Loan specifics: 
Loan 1 = $9,162 @7.75% interest

Loan 2 = $14,055 @7.99% interest

Loan 3 = $32,151 @ an avg interest rate of 4.4775%


Savings: I have around $8,800 after christmas shopping

Credit score: 715

I contribute 8% of my pay to a 401k currently 

My company pays for my phone, I am currently living rent-free and don't pay any utilities, and pretty much only pay for food and entertainment-related expenses 


My girlfriend and I would be moving into this home together, but it would be in my name and we would split the finances right down the middle, but I'm not going to include her financials as the burden will be on me if  things go south. She is a nurse and we are planning on getting married, so I'm not all that worried that I'll be left high and dry with a break-up, but I'm sure I should still consider that. 


Should I focus on paying down my student loans with the money I save, and rent an apartment? or can I realistically do this....lots of stuff I'm unsure of haha but the houses we're looking at are priced in the $115,000-135,000 range for reference.

My core monthly expenses are my mortgage and utilities ($1.3k), car insurance ($230), cell phone ($50), groceries ($200), student loans ($350)

The only accomplishment I can claim is bringing my student loan debt down from $34k in 2013 to ~$25k currently. But I hate myself for essentially filling that difference in with CC debt. 

I've got 2 credit cards and they're killing me and my credit. One is at approximately $7.5k (16%) and the other is at $8k (20%). I throw roughly $800 at the larger interest rate one per month and $500 at the other. 

Right now the balance on the $8k should really be $5k, since I've resently put $3k on it for work (waiting on the reimbursement).

If you just did the math, you probably see that I don't have much wiggle room between monthly income versus expenditure. You're right, I don't. I end up shuffling things around to break even. 

Guys, I know I'm an idiot. I've got a good job and a good salary. I don't want to be at the mercy of credit card stress. Please, any guidance you guys have would help me tremendously.

CryptoCurrency,Factom will surpass a billion dollar market cap in 2018 or I'll eat my d***,"Why?  

Factom launches the third and final phase of the protocol in 2018.  M3 (milestone 3) is when the protocol becomes fully decentralized by launching 64 federated servers.  Inflation is introduced as 73,000 new Factoids will be created per month to pay these Federated Servers.  These servers will need to be data centers as blockchain networks are flood fill systems where everyone needs to have all the information and the user base for Factom consists of large enterprises.  Here is a thread that confirms Factom is working with DHS, the Gates foundation, and several other Fortune 500 companies:

https://www.reddit.com/r/factom/comments/74iyb7/factom_confirmed_to_be_working_with_several/

Here is a link to a plugin developed by kx for kdb+ which is the database used by 19 of the top 20 tier one banks:
https://kx.com/blog/kdb-factom-securing-data-blockchain-qfactom/

Now if we know that there are going to be some major players using the protocol, that tells us that we're going to need some pretty large data centers to handle all the data.  As you can imagine, data centers don't come cheap and they will need some real incentive to consider becoming a federated server for Factom.  What's the biggest incentive?  Money.  As it stands, each federated server will be paid ~1156 factoids per month.  At the current price, this equates to ~$20,000 a month.  I've done some research into attaining one of these data centers and the cheapest I've found came out to be around that price and those were the absolute smallest.  Could this be the floor for Factoids?  There's no doubt that when the protocol starts running at full speed the data centers will need to be much bigger and much more expensive.  

One of the biggest complaints against Factom is that they don't post any news.   A few recent quotes from Paul:

&gt;&gt;""I'm going to be doing more interviews and presentations in 2018! Going to have a good bit to talk about! Stay Tuned!""

&gt;&gt;""My goal for 2018 is to push a number of projects out onto the world stage. To finish and deliver solutions to a number of ICO based projects.""

&gt;&gt;""As much as I appreciate why you think it's just a tactic, I have to respect the process and work with our people. We have brought on new resources, and working through new opportunities, completing our budget for the new year, and adjusting to some significant shifts in organization and focus.
We will be putting more information about our progress and achivements. And there are significant things we can talk about in the coming weeks.""

&gt;&gt;""We have focused on clients that are slow moving and tight lipped.
We are changing some of our efforts. You'll hear more about new stuff we are doing in the blockchain space in combination with some of these longer term efforts as they begin to come on line.""

&gt;&gt;""Our approach is changing, but change takes time and planning. You will get more news sooner.""

The timing of this change of approach shouldn't be a surprise.  Factom knows that with m3 incoming they MUST increase the price of the token to give incentive for people to become federated servers.  Just my two cents.",cryptocurrency

I have a college degree (2014) in a non-specialized area and have just under two years of professional, post-college experience (including recruiting) and one year of office experience from a student aide position in college. I have numerous years of customer/public service experience as well.

I have just under $1100 in debt from student loans that I'm finishing this month from savings -- no other debts. I've been unemployed since June and am anxious to get back to work. BTW, I live in a major US city on the West Coast for context.

The company is offering me an hourly rate of $17/hr for the first 6 months with a dollar raise to $18/hr after with a 0-3% raise each year depending on how well the company does. No 401k, 10 days of PTO (includes non-federal holiday vacation and sick days and no rollover to the following year), and medical insurance, but I do not yet have the specifics (don't need them as I have insurance through my spouse, but still).

Is all of this a big red flag to you guys? I want to negotiate for $20/hr and 14 days of PTO. Is that unreasonable? I was making $19.50/hr at my previous job.

Thank you and apologies again if this is a totally wrong subreddit to post in!

Rent where I would like to live in the US is at least 1000/month for a 1 br in a not scary area, and I have a dog so it's difficult to find a place to rent.

I would still have a chunk of money in savings, which I really want to have for peace of mind. I'm wondering if I should buy the condo now while I have a good salary, and I can rent it out until I move back. Then when I get there I'll have a cheaper place to live. I'm worried that once I move and am making less money it will be harder to get approved for a mortgage, even though I could afford the monthly payment on a new lower salary, and it will be cheaper than renting. 

I'm hesitant to pay off a chunk of my loans with my savings because the interest rate is OK (4.125%), and when I have a lower income I can get on the income contingent repayment and lower the monthly payment. I'm not sure whether to bank on this, but the loans are set up for the public service forgiveness, and I have 6 years in to that. Theoretically if I get 4 more years of public service, the balance is supposed to be forgiven, but that is completely unstable since it depends on the US government's whims.

I don't have any other debts, no balance on my credit card. My car is 10+ years old but has low miles and is a Toyota so I'm banking on it lasting for a long time! So hopefully no car payment in the future, or I'll have savings to buy something with cash.

So should I try to buy a condo while still living overseas? I'm going back for a visit soon and could look at a few places.",finance
Bitcoin,Is this all that crypto is about?,"With all the craziness surrounding Bitcoin's extraordinary climb in price, I'm a bit disappointed and sad about so many people here talking about jumping in and getting rich. To me it seems like we have replicated in ourselves the same mentality of those greedy banks we hate and want to abolish. Everyone wants  more, more, *more*! Me, me *me*! ""Let the price climb so that I can buy myself a Lambo, a house, whatever!"" I was hoping crypto would bring about a bigger change, not just in spreading wealth, but also in instilling a more selfless life? Call me naive all you want, but the feeling I get from reading most Bitcoin-related posts is that we still want to get rich no matter what - the System is the same, except it will be now fed directly by us individuals instead of by bigger entities. 

Am I the only one interpreting things this way? I would love to hear your opinions on this.",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,Technical question/help about transactions and confirmations,"Hi everyone, would appreciate some clarifications/explanations/tips about what's going on with my transactions (tl;dr to follow):

So after being unable to receive authorization emails to blockchain.info's wallet for a while (a pretty scary several hours) I was fed up and wanted to move my bitcoins ASAP to a desktop wallet where they will be safe until my nano s arrives.
So anyway, I wanted to first do a test transaction to my desktop wallet (since i tried to generate a segwit address and wasn't sure I did it right), and I sent a tiny amount with a tiny fee (about 88 sat/b). After seeing my wallet recognized the transaction as ""pending"" (but obviously not received since it would take a while for this low-fee TX to process), I decided to do another test transaction, this time with much higher fees.
The thing is, the blockchain wallet only had one sending address, so effectively I made two transactions from address A to address B, first one with very low fees and second one with much higher fees (394 sat/b).
The second one is still not confirmed (some 12 hours after I made it), and then I remembered that the first transaction basically had an ouput to itself (to account for the change).
So now I'm afraid that the second high-fee transaction uses the output of the unconfirmed transaction as its input, in which case I'm kinda stuck as I pretty much can't send ANYTHING from my wallet, it has only one address and the majority of the funds are still waiting to be confirmed as outputs of the first low-fee transaction.

But then I thought, should this even matter? How can the second transaction even use the first one's output if it's not in the blockchain yet? Wouldn't it then use the output of the latest confirmed transaction to my wallet's address?

So in short, I'm a bit confused about the whole process and even more, I'm afraid its pretty easy to generate a situation where you're effectively locking yourself from using some address' bitcoins if you made a mistake and sent some too low-fee transaction from it first (at least until it clears or drops out of the mempool but I don't know how long that can take).
If anyone can explain this in more detail, or at least tell me I'm still able to use my funds (got my nano s already so I want to get out of blockchain fast), would be greatly appreciated (I can link to the transactions in some explorer but I'm not sure if it's something I should avoid).

**TL;DR:**
Consider the following situation:
1. Alice buys 4 bitcoins that are sent to address A
(so Alice has unspent output of 4 BTC in address A)
2. Alice sends 1 BTC with very low fees from address A to address B. The change is returned to address A (so A is also in the output of this transaction) The transaction is now stuck in the mempool.
3. Alice gets impatient and sends 2 BTC from A to B with very high fees.

What would happen? Does the second A-&gt;B transaction gets confirmed fast, using the original unspent output from the initial bitcoin purchase?
Or is the second transaction using the unconfirmed output of the first low-fee transaction?
If so, why? How can it use the first transaction output if it's not on the blockchain yet?
Wouldn't that create a situation where you can't transfer your funds AT ALL until the first transaction is confirmed, which might take a very long while?

Of course he told me “bitcoins a bubble don’t buy it”, which I think I countered pretty well. But the point he brought up that worried me was with derivatives. 
The way he explained it to me was that basically when you buy derivatives, options specifically in this case, you don’t buy the actual product you just buy an option to own that product. 
I was told this is essentially how big companies take over smaller ones, but the options, dump the product to drive price down and then buy the majority of the product/small company stock while the price is super low.

 I paid her $13,000 loan off with my christmas bonus a week agon. Her interest rate is 8.75% so if my math is correct roughly $1137 of that is interest. Her other loan is around $13,000 at 8.25%. We have been keeping up with the minimum payments so we should have another $1000 to deduct from that if I'm not mistaken.

I do not have any plans to study in USA but I am curious about the math because I feel an immigrant will probably not save much. Please go through the list below and correct me where I am wrong. I have calculated it for one year basis and not monthly.

Total salary: $100,000/year

Taxes: $33,000/yr (Federal + State + FICA)

Rent: $24,000/yr (I believe it's anywhere between $1500-$3500 for a 1BHK in major cities + good location?)

Student Loan Payment: $12,000/yr (6% on $50k for 5 year term)

Groceries: $4500/yr (at $350/month x 12)

Health Insurance: $3600/yr (I see the common health plans are between $250-$350 premium per month for a single individual)

Dental insurance: $500/yr

Home utilities: $3500/yr (Electricity: $100/month + Water and sewage: $100/month + Internet: $50-$70/month +Garbage,Laundry and other minor utilities: $25/month)

Travel expenses to &amp; fro from work: $1200/yr (With a $100 bus pass a month)

Foreign travel plane tickets: $ 1200 (Usually immigrants go back to visit their homeland once a year or two)

Weekend fun: $1500/yr (bars + booze + uber or other travel once a week or so)

Other minor expenses: $500/yr


I havent included the following: House deposit money paid to landlord, any visa charges, paid services like netflix, prime, spotify, any entertainment stuff, emergency fund, money sent to 401k fund, a car, any major splurge, any deductible health problem charges, gym, hobbies, clothes, electronic gadget purchases or dating/relationship expenses or the losses occured while you were pursuing your Masters degree like the plane ticket expenses or the salary you may have earned for those 2 years in your home country.

And despite that the expenses seem to go out to $85k per year. Leaving about $15,000 in yearly saving or just a little over $1,250 in saving per month. I feel, a net saving of $15,000/yr on the prized ""$100k job salary"" seems very poor. But from what I've read a lot of students here would kill for a $1,250 saving per month because they save even less. Because this is a good case scenario with nothing going wrong. The savings are at par at what one would net in a third world tech job with a few years of experience. 

I would appreciate if some of you guys could take a look at my above math and correct me as to where I've missed or overshot the $$. I wouldn't mind some tidbits from your personal finances and how they relate to the above as well.

Thank you.

I'm an engineer in college with $8k in student loans and a USAA bank account.

Bitcoin,Congratulations! You weathered your first price correction. Alert: This IS the dip...,"[Edit: Part 2 with further clarification found here...](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ikhon/futures_vs_the_future_who_exactly_is_betting_for/?sort=new)

Cryptoctopus here for your weekend-prep: 

So here we are, already Friday night (for Asia!).  The end of a very crazy week.  You already know the past two-day history of insane gains, so I will only speak to the past 8 hours for those of you who have been sleeping (shame, shame...)

So, having a $2,000+ decline in one ""day"" is not unusual, especially for the start of the weekend.

As someone who has lived in Korea, I can tell you first hand that the off-duty times for the working class (read: everyone) are of vital importance. Work hard / play hard, and all that jazz.  

If you have read anything recently in the news, you know about the pressure that exists for the Korean need of an immediate securing of local fiat into a storage of long-term wealth.  Bitcoin obviously fulfills that need, and has caused a feeding-frenzy for cypto for the last 72 hours. With the start of the weekend, that frenzy has has slightly lifted up, but expect it to pick back up in full on Monday. 

 Consider this weekend your last big chance to pick up some big gains during this ""bottom dip"".

Also remember that as Westerners, we will hit Monday morning a whole half-day later than Asia, so they will get the jump start on us Monday.  The working morning for them will be approximately 4:00-5:00 PM EST on Sunday Night.  

Keep in mind, I know that there are a lot of other factors at play here.  Institutional, public awareness, first initial bitcoin-binges, etc.   However, those things are still at their infancy when it comes to price manipulation.  It is important that you alert yourself to the power of the global market, and that its timezone will even more continue to affect Bitcoin's short term market swings very greatly.  

This is a very good thing for bitcoin in the end, as the international participation is going to strongly hedge against not only Wall Street and US based institutional investors, but also against all of the ""public"" that are recent buy-ins.

There is a lot of recent talk about the ""new money"" coming into Bitcoin because of all the media.  However, the last thing that you need to concern yourself is the ""friends and family"" demographic. The amount of money that they are putting in is being astronomically dwarfed by all other sources that, for now, is a guaranteed non-concern. 

Specifically, the average person's disposable investing/gambling income that is dipping into Bitcoin can in no way compare to the million/billion funds being poured in through quantitative investments on the institutional level. 


Prepare for a strong return of previous gains from the stalled weekend.  Also, do not fear the upcoming Monday futures release, as the rest of the world has been betting on Bitcoins future success for quite some time.  There will be volatility, but speaking as a previous institutional wage-slave, it is in their best interest to keep riding the bull. 

If you are long, stay long.  If you were waiting for ""the dip"", or a time for a first entry; this is it. See you at the top!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Does a balance transfer from a personal loan to a credit card make sense? Also, what debt to best apply the cash to.","I was recently approved for a credit card with $25,000.00 limit and a 6.99% APR (variable) through Navy Federal.  

I recently took out a personal loan through Goldman Sachs for 20,000.00 at 10.99% fixed rate over four years to pay off two vehicles and take them off the road (this freed up 500$ a month in insurance).  I've since sold one (7,000) and am trying to sell the other (hopefully around 7k)

.  My previous credit card through Discover was at 23% APR with a 4,000.00 balance on it.  Needless to say I will be transferring this balance to the new card. 

-I don't fully understand how the variables vs fixed rates work and when the variable rates actually change.  At first glance it seems to make sense to pay off the personal loan (10.99%) with the new card (6.99%) but I've been warned against that because of the difference in how the interest works on credit cards (the person warning didn't understand enough to be certain but just to advice caution).  Any insight on this would be greatly appreciated.   

Also, so I took a hit in taking out 20,000 at 10.99 to pay off two vehicles I that I'll have sold the cars for a lot less.  7k already in hand for one and the other is on the market for the same.  However, my insurance was crazy high because of long story issues with driving so I'm saving 500$ per month not paying insurance.  Also, the car payments together totaled to 550$ month.  The minimum payment for the personal loan is 515.00/mo so I feel like I've made out in the short term at least in that I've freed up roughly 500 a month to work with...

My other question aside from he balance transfer is to which debt is the cash from the vehicles best applied to.  If 7k goes straight into the fixed rate personal loan will that drop the minimum payment or is it best to pay down the variable credit card event though the new one has such a low APR?

I get things wrong and I make mistakes. Knowing this, please don't take this post as the gospel truth. I am not an authority. In such a case that we are indeed severely misunderstanding things, I would also hope that Bitfinex/Tether could explain what all this is about, so we can all chillax.

**EDIT 4:** Apparently this is making some waves. I realize there are people who will see this that are new to cryptocurrency. A fairly general understanding/background on Bitfinex, Tether, and the history of cryptocurrency exchange scandals would be useful. (i.e. Mt. Gox - which fraudulently made off with millions of dollars worth of BTC after artificially inflating its price at the expense of thousands of users) As this post is already extremely lengthy, I'll try and sum up the basics before getting started (skip to below this section if you are already familiar):

&amp;nbsp;

First off, I'm not the first person to look into this. And it's hardly new info. For example, Bitfinex'ed ([medium](https://medium.com/@bitfinexed), [twitter](https://twitter.com/bitfinexed)) has been onto this situation for quite some time now, and it's worth checking out if you want to keep learning.

&amp;nbsp;

1. I've previously [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7e2drk/do_tethers_legal_terms_seriously_outline_the/) on the interrelatedness of Bitfinex and Tether. Worth a read if you don't know how they're connected.  

2. Bitfinex is a cryptocurrency exchange with a dark past involving multiple run-ins with trading laws and regulations, problems with banks and multiple hacks resulting in the loss of millions of dollars worth of BTC.  

3. Tether (USDT) is a fairly new development. Its first address came into existence in 2014. What it claims to be is a cryptocurrency backed 1:1 with the USD. So for every Tether, there is supposedly $1 backing it. Thus the name, ""Tether."" Problem is, there is no evidence of this. The requirements to buy Tether involve extensive verification hoops, that make it pretty much defeat the purpose of cryptocurrency.

4. The primary difference between Tether and virtually *every other cryptocurrency in existence* is that it does ***not have to be mined into existence.*** It can simply be ""typed"" into existence through a keyboard. Go ahead, type a number on your keyboard. $100,000,000? No problem. Done. 

5. Because of this, and after seeing hundreds of millions of Tether being typed into existence to the tune of over 800 million, most of which is being used on exchanges, it has come to the attention of the cryptocurrency community as a whole, that Tether may not be such a great thing for Bitcoin - or any other cryptocurrency. We've found that it is being ""created"" freely, without any proof of its required $USD reserves.

&amp;nbsp;

Tether has the equivalent power of the Federal Reserve. That alone, is ***absolutely insane.*** You can see why these factors combine to create a somewhat stormy horizon for cryptocurrency as a whole.  

**All I aim to do in this post is to outline who owns the majority of Tether (USDT), where it's located, how much of BTC's daily trading volume it makes up, and how I came to those conclusions.** Anything beyond that, like implications or predictions about price, manipulation, BTC being propped up by Tether, etc. or any kind of conspiracy, I steer clear from. The information below is, to the best of my knowledge, purely factual information, not theoretical.

This is going to sound crazy. But the wallets don’t lie, and I’ll break it all down below *(as if summoning hundreds of millions of dollars worth of fake money out of thin air to spend on real crypto-currency wasn't crazy-sounding enough)*. I know this is long, but it's worth reading if you have the time. TL;DR at the bottom. 

&amp;nbsp;

First, I need to outline which addresses are which. All the following addresses were at one time, or are currently on Tether's ""[Rich List](https://wallet.tether.to/richlist)."" And as we'll get to below, belong to Bitfinex:  

**Tether Printer:** [3MbYQMMmSkC3AgWkj9FMo5LsPTW1zBTwXL](http://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=3MbYQMMmSkC3AgWkj9FMo5LsPTW1zBTwXL)

&amp;nbsp;

As some of you know, I’ve been investigating the web of transactions and addresses from OmnExplorer for the last several days/weeks. It has become more interesting the deeper I dig: Tether, ***through Bitfinex*** (their own partner, arguably owned by the same company) is sending hundreds of millions of USDT to Bittrex and Poloniex accounts. This would be normal if it weren’t for the fact that all these accounts appear to be under control of Tether &amp; Bitfinex directly.

&amp;nbsp;

**From Tether to Bitfinex to Bittrex**
-

I discovered this when I realized Bitfinex doesn’t have any USDT trading [volume](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/#markets), nor is USDT offered for any trading pairs on Bitfinex, despite Bitfinex being the only Associate of Tether listed in its legal terms. “So what, Pepto?” Well this is *weird* for several reasons:

&amp;nbsp;

1. **Bitfinex is listed as the only partner of Tether** in Tether’s legal terms. You’d think the ***only exchange*** partnered with Tether, and indemnified in its legal terms, would be offering USDT in its trading pairs, no? Why isn’t USDT offered on Bitfinex? After all, they are heavy users of it.  

2. **Bitfinex-A has been the [recipient](http://omniexplorer.info/lookuptx.aspx?txid=0bf949bf09c6e02555a6b07e527cc2810b8c7a68cace83d5378bd46c3f064123) of hundreds of millions of USDT,** directly from the Tether Printer and Treasury.  

3. **Bitfinex-A has spent the majority** ***(hundreds of millions in ~half-million to million increments)*** **of its USDT** by [sending](http://omniexplorer.info/lookuptx.aspx?txid=6e143b4b8770bddf1c8118ba0b42ef5b600bea925bc826b8f3cda7ca2d6c87a3) it to an ***unknown address*** which ***exclusively*** [sends](http://omniexplorer.info/lookuptx.aspx?txid=bcb0f12cbadc5d6deefd1675f8f42e035851406eec6fc54f4ab2328f96fa9b1f) USDT to **Bittrex.**  

4. **Bitfinex-A and Bittrex are currently top 3 on Tether's ""Rich List.""** They currently hold ~386million USDT across both addresses.  

&amp;nbsp;

Think about these points. The *only one* who can be in control of this ***unknown address*** is Bitfinex. Here's why: **1)** Bitfinex does not offer or trade USDT. Tell me what random soul out there is *privately* selling hundreds of millions of USDT worth of goods or services directly to Bitfinex, only to send their USDT revenue to Bittrex? Who in their right mind would sell anything in exchange for Tether? **2)** It’s not Bittrex, because they would have received it from the Treasury if they had directly bought it from Tether for use in their trading pairs, the only place besides an exchange where you can get it. *But besides offering it as a trading pair, what exchange would ever directly trade hard cash for a digital token whose terms of service explicitly outline its worthlessness?*

&amp;nbsp;

It is because of these points that we can safely deduce that this unknown address is owned by Bitfinex. So we’re going to label this unknown address “Bitfinex-B” for future reference. Next. If Bitfinex-B is sending USDT ***exclusively*** to the Bittrex address on Tether’s “Rich List” immediately after receiving USDT from Bitfinex-A, who is the owner of the Bittrex address?

&amp;nbsp;

Do we need to ask why Bittrex would ever exchange cash, goods or services with Bitfinex for USDT again? It's pretty clear at this point that the ""Rich List"" Bittrex address belongs to Bitfinex as well. Alright, so in case we're lost, so far, the flow of USDT looks like this:  

Tether Printer &gt;&gt; Tether Treasury &gt;&gt; Bitfinex-A &gt;&gt; Bitfinex-B &gt;&gt; Bittrex  

&amp;nbsp;

**From Poloniex to Bitfinex to Bittrex**
-

But wait, there’s more. Bitfinex-B also occasionally [*receives*](http://omniexplorer.info/lookuptx.aspx?txid=c26d37e37d20886be59aab6988e28fe7396154be4fe35da9a275d3a9beeacea0) several hundred thousand USDT from one of the “Rich List” Poloniex addresses (Poloniex-A). Poloniex-A also [sends](http://omniexplorer.info/lookuptx.aspx?txid=53cd8758586d625bc40b1e2001b80bb5f8304b95cbf6d550b5a7bf1208389174) tens of millions of USDT to the [second](http://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=1Co1dhYDeF76DQyEyj4B5JdXF9J7TtfWWE) Poloniex “Rich List” address, (Poloniex-B) and visa/versa.  

Poloniex-A &gt;&gt; Bitfinex-B + Poloniex-B  
Poloniex-B &gt;&gt; Poloniex-A

&amp;nbsp;

Now, if Bitfinex-B is receiving occasional USDT from Poloniex-A (as we outlined above), then who is sending USDT from the Poloniex-A? Let’s look at a few major hints:  

&amp;nbsp;

1. Poloniex-A [has sent](http://omniexplorer.info/lookuptx.aspx?txid=acd6ff77da25c9a292fd93464f7425ae45c95d03c1a81144aea8cd0dbd1a8255) a tiny amount of USDT **directly to the Tether Printer** once before.  
2. What reason would Poloniex-A have to send USDT to Bitfinex-B unless it were a withdrawal from a Poloniex account? Remember, Bitfinex doesn’t buy USDT, they distribute and spend it as Tether Associates.  
3. Whenever Poloniex-A sends USDT to Bitfinex-B, the same amount is then sent from Bitfinex-B to the Bittrex ""Rich List"" address. Yes, the same Bittrex account we determined belongs to Bitfinex.  

&amp;nbsp;

Here's the updated flow:  
Poloniex-A &gt;&gt; Bitfinex-B &gt;&gt; Bittrex  
Poloniex-A &gt;&gt; Poloniex-B  
Poloniex-B &gt;&gt; Poloniex-A  


They're all intertwined. 

&amp;nbsp;

**From Poloniex to Bitfinex to Bittrex to Second Poloniex**
-

Considering these things, Bitfinex is the likely owner of not only Bitfinex-B and Bittrex, but also Poloniex-A. If it’s true that Bitfinex owns Poloniex-A and the Bittrex address, then Bitfinex may own ***both*** Poloniex addresses on the “Rich List” (Poloniex-A + Poloniex-B) Why? Consider these points:  

&amp;nbsp;

1. Poloniex-A sent a total of ~180 million USDT to Poloniex-B up to November 28th 2017. It's just sitting there, with the occasional return spend back to Poloniex-A (the one Bitfinex owns).  
2. Poloniex-B had also received an insignificant amount of USDT (~100 test transaction) ***[directly from](http://omniexplorer.info/lookuptx.aspx?txid=3f826d6df1ced2e6b41d9fe50e57ef7e62476a10beecaf92b09f63993a10f0d5) the Bitfinex-owned Bittrex address***.  
3. Poloniex-A has sent hundreds of thousands of USDT to Bitfinex-B.  

&amp;nbsp;

Here's the once-more updated flow:  
Poloniex-A &gt;&gt; Bitfinex-B &gt;&gt; Bittrex &gt;&gt; Poloniex-B &gt;&gt; Poloniex-A   
Poloniex-A &gt;&gt; Poloniex-B  

&amp;nbsp;

So we have Poloniex-B, an address receiving 10's of millions of USDT from: Poloniex-A &amp; Bittrex - both owned by Bitfinex. And only ever sending USDT back to Poloniex-A (owned by Bitfinex). Who do you think owns Poloniex-B?

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, the history only goes back 20 pages on OmnExplorer. So I can't confirm which address that initial ~180million USDT came from after it left the Treasury, before arriving in Poloniex-A.

&amp;nbsp;

**Tether &amp; Bitfinex Afraid of Their Own Coin?**
-

So, here's what's insane to me: **1. Bitfinex holds USDT on their exchange, yet doesn’t offer USDT in any of their trading pairs.** That's insane to me because Bitfinex is the only Associate of Tether in Tether's legal terms. If they do offer USDT, they're calling it USD which is sketchy as hell. **2. Instead, they pass their massive USDT balance on to exchanges that *do* offer USDT in their trading pairs.** Namely, Bittrex and Poloniex. Clearly, *someone* is trading USDT on these exchanges, as [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/#markets) displays. 

&amp;nbsp;

**In summing up the USDT flow:**

Printer &gt;&gt; Treasury &gt;&gt; Bitfinex-A &gt;&gt; Bitfinex-B &gt;&gt; Bittrex &gt;&gt; Poloniex-B &gt;&gt; Poloniex-A  
Poloniex-A &gt;&gt; USDT Printer + Bitfinex-B + Poloniex-B  

&amp;nbsp;

This rabbit hole is a lot deeper than the big toe I've stuck into it with this post, which only covers 4 addresses on Tether's ""Rich List."" Would you be willing to bet that most, if not all, addresses on the Rich List belong to Tether &amp; Bitfinex? I won't say that's the case *(how could I?)*, but I will say that it wouldn't surprise me.

&amp;nbsp;

Currently, the Tether ""Rich List"" accounts for ~644,000,000 (~76%) of the ~844,000,000 total USDT in circulation. There is 100,000,000 USDT that the Rich List doesn't display, probably the rest of the Tether being used in ""regular-person"" trading accounts in Huobi, OKEx, etc. Even if Tether &amp; Bitfinex do not own all the addresses on the Rich List, if we only consider the ones we've already covered that they do likely own, that's still ~623,000,000 USDT (~74%) of the total ~844,000,000.  

&amp;nbsp;

Tether &amp; Bitfinex currently control at least 70% of USDT's circulation, and it's ***all on cryptocurrency exchanges.*** Taking this one step further, looking at the daily volume of USDT ($1.7 billion at the time of this writing), and adding up the total 24hr BTC/USDT volume across the major exchanges (Bittrex, Poloniex, Huobi, OKEx, Binance, HitBTC), which totals $1.12 billion at the time of this writing, we can see that the majority (~66%) of daily USDT trading volume is going into BTC.  

&amp;nbsp;

***Think about who owns most of that USDT, as we already outlined above.***

&amp;nbsp;

At BTC's current 24 hour trading volume of over $18billion, USDT makes up about 6% of BTC's trading volume.

&amp;nbsp;

What about Bitfinex? They are, after all, ***the number one highest volume trader of BTC/USD.*** My only hope is that they aren't trading BTC/USDT under ""BTC/USD"" (I realize it is difficult to both deposit and withdraw at Bitfinex with USD). If they are, there is a ton of data that CoinMarketCap.com would currently not be able to display properly. We'd see USDT's daily trading volume increase by over $2.3billion. Combined with the current daily USDT volume of $1.7billion, we'd see its volume reach to over $4billion, the majority of which is on Bitfinex.

&amp;nbsp;

Consequently, we would also see the daily BTC/USDT volume increase to over $3billion, which would make up about 17% of BTC's daily trading volume.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't quite have the confidence yet to directly say what this means. Only that the facts I've laid out above do concern me. Thanks for reading, please feel free to contribute, debate, prove me wrong, etc. As most things I investigate, I'll be happy and relieved to be wrong about any and all of the above. :)  

&amp;nbsp;

**EDIT 6:** We have some *potential* rebuttals for this situation. See the comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ih0hd/guess_who_controls_over_half_a_billion_tethers/dqz4knq/). There are still questions I have, and I'm not yet convinced but I appreciate this response. Feel free to contribute to the discussion.

----

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR** - Tether *(Tether Limited / Tether Holdings Limited)*, in partnership with Bitfinex *(BFXNA Inc. / iFinex Inc.)* is the sole user and trader of USDT across at least 3 major crypto exchanges (Bitfinex, Bittrex, Poloniex), controlling over 73% of USDT in circulation--623,000,000 of the total 844,000,000. While ~66% of USDT daily trade volume is on the BTC/USDT pair, USDT also happens to make up between 6% &amp; 17% or more of daily BTC trading volume.  

To boil it down: USDT was created by Tether, for Tether.

----

&amp;nbsp;

I welcome debate, and any further information that may prove me wrong. Yes, I want to be wrong on this. I hope I am wrong on this because it is insane to me that the company ~~printing~~ typing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of fake money out of thin air is the same company that controls the majority of that fake money, where it *primarily exists on cryptocurrency exchanges.*  

&amp;nbsp;

**This kind of power was previously only wielded by the Federal Reserve!** Print money &gt;&gt; send to exchange &gt;&gt; buy assets &gt;&gt; rinse, repeat. Anyone familiar with the 2007-2009 financial crisis is well-aware of the bail-outs. Trillions were printed out of thin air to prop up the US economy. Am I saying BTC is being propped up by Tether? ***I haven't gotten that far yet.*** Is 6% to 17%+ of daily BTC trading volume enough to move its price? ***I don't know.*** And I emphasize this: 

This post wasn't about BTC being--or not being--propped up by Tether. ***It's purely about fake money being used to buy legitimate valuable cryptocurrencies, which can be turned into USD or used to purchase real goods and services.***

&amp;nbsp;

**EDIT 1: Bonus for anyone wanting to continue researching.** This address ([16tg2RJuEPtZooy18Wxn2me2RhUdC94N7r](http://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=16tg2RJuEPtZooy18Wxn2me2RhUdC94N7r)) is under the label, ""Quarantined"" on the Tether ""Rich List."" It currently holds ~30million Tether, ***all received*** from this address ([31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv](http://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv)) towards the end of November. I'm interested because this ""31okFF"" address is one of the only other addresses receiving Tether from the Treasury. 

&amp;nbsp;

**EDIT 2:** ***Incidentally, the Treasury hasn't sent Tether since November 19th. Is there a new Treasury?*** All we have to do to figure that out is go to the Printing address. Sure enough, it has been sending **hundreds of millions of Tether** to this new address ([1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz](http://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz)) since November 26th. This is the *only other address the printer has sent USDT to besides the original Treasury.*  **The patterns yet remain the same. After hitting the Treasury, USDT flows straight to Bitfinex-A.**  

&amp;nbsp;

**EDIT 3:** From u/imaginary_username *(thank you for your efforts)* 

&gt;A few things to add:  

&gt;1. Tether ""Treasury"" moved after the ""hack"" to [1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz](http://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz).  

&gt;2. [1MZAayfFJ9Kki2csoYjFVRKHFFSkdoMLtX](http://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=1MZAayfFJ9Kki2csoYjFVRKHFFSkdoMLtX) is the ""recycling"" address that flows Poloniex USDT back to Bitfinex. 
 1MZAayfFJ9Kki2csoYjFVRKHFFSkdoMLtX doesn't just recycle Polo USDT, it also recycles Bittrex.  

&gt;2. [15KXxPi4zAY5pLD8yvzZALXyCYhcqmuKuv](http://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=15KXxPi4zAY5pLD8yvzZALXyCYhcqmuKuv) is another address that flows exclusively from finex to Bittrex.  

&gt;3. [1DdrGZDomf5tSWbxPYwZyDP6Zx5vFapPCx](http://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=1DdrGZDomf5tSWbxPYwZyDP6Zx5vFapPCx) is ""Bitfinex flush"" that exclusively bounces a shitload of USDT back and forth between itself and Bitfinex-A.  

&gt;4. [1J1dCYzS5EerUuJCJ6iJYVPytCMVLXrgM9](http://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=1J1dCYzS5EerUuJCJ6iJYVPytCMVLXrgM9&amp;page=3) is an interesting one. It's been very active in shuttling Tethers from finex/Bittrex to Polo almost exclusively during the last few Tether prints and just recently did another one, but it's building up its stash again. Watch its movement and it can be rewarding.  

-------

&amp;nbsp;

**EDIT 5:** Due to the increasing attention of this post, I feel the need to re-state that there's always the possibility that we're all severely misunderstanding what's going on here. ***Which is actually my hope, as I've already stated.*** I want to emphasize that I am just some guy. I get things wrong and I make mistakes. Knowing this, please don't take this post as the gospel truth. I am not an authority. In such a case that we are indeed severely misunderstanding things, I would also hope that Bitfinex/Tether could explain what all this is about, so we can all chillax.  

That said, the information in this post is presented to the best of my knowledge with the best of my ability, and it is only an opinion, which may be an erroneous one. I am not offering advice, nor do I intend for this post to be construed as advice. I make no accusations against Tether/Bitfinex regarding crimes. Anything that appears to be suggestive of crimes is not intended as an accusation, defamation or slander. All suggestions (whether criminal or benign) in this post are purely hypothetical and may not be relied upon to make sound financial or legal decisions. (Bitfinex, if you're reading this, instead of suing me or issuing a cease and desist, please clear the air for us all, so we can rest easy).

personalfinance,Financing a Used Vehicle,"I've been looking into getting a newer used vehicle, as I'm not sure I see my current one doing too well through another winter. I have a good idea of my budget and how much vehicle I can *actually* afford.

My question is about my financing options and what would be best for my credit score. I have a solid score right now (high 700s), and one of the drawbacks my report usually notes is a lack of diversified credit. Up until now, my credit has mostly been credit cards (all of which are paid off now, with the exception of one that I use and pay off in full each month, Thanks r/PF!) and one personal loan (used for consolidating credit cards, and has since been paid off in full).

I can make a sizable downpayment on a vehicle, but will need to make payments for a bit. In terms of diversifying my credit, would it be better to take out another personal loan on my own? Or should I finance through the dealership? I'm not sure if these are even considered different on a credit report. Obviously, I would check interest rates for all of my options and take them into account when making a final decision.

Any input at all is appreciated. Thanks!

Federal loans for students cannot exceed $20,500 per year, so I’ll have to apply for supplemental loans. I have heard about graduate plus loans and believe their interest rate is 7%.

personalfinance,Looking for an intermediate goal,"I'm down in the purple section of the prime directive flowchart, which is a good place to be. But as I size up my overall financial situation, I can't help but notice that the goals I'm working toward are all fifteen-plus years away. So I'm looking for a personal finance goal that I can aim for in the next few years to keep me on track.

My info:

* My wife and I are both 34 and have jobs that pay well. We've got two little kids.
* Cash: 8 month emergency fund
* College Savings (combined): $95k in 529s
* HSA: $10k
* Retirement (combined): A little under 2 years' combined pay
* Liquid investments (i.e. stuff we could sell this week if we wanted): A little under 2 years' combined pay, mostly in index funds
* Illiquid investments (e.g. ownership interest in a private company): Hard to value, probably worth about 1 year's combined pay.
* Mortgage: About 3 years' combined pay, at 3%. Probably 60% of the value of the house. Adjusts to 1 year LIBOR+2.25 in 2023 (max adjustment 2%/year, up to an 8% cap).

We spend/invest/donate pretty deliberately. We've got a couple of giant expenses that we decided were worthwhile (housing and child care), and there's definitely some fat we could trim if we wanted to, but we've decided to keep the fat in our budget because we feel like we can afford it, it makes our life a little bit better, and it doesn't seem like it would move the needle on reaching our goals.

Financial goals:

* Pay off the mortgage: We're 2 years into a 30-year mortgage, and we're just making regular monthly payments. Our interest rate adjusts in 2023, but until then, we've got a low enough rate locked in that it doesn't really seem like it's worth paying early.
* Pay for college: First kid won't hit college for another 15 years. After that we'd like to be able to pay for 4 years of undergrad for each kid.
* Save for retirement: We're maxing out our retirement accounts (short of doing a mega backdoor roth, anyway), and we like our jobs enough that we're not trying to retire at some absurdly early age. So this is probably a couple of decades away.

Anyone have suggestions for a good intermediate-term financial goal, maybe something 3-5 years out? Or even nearer term than that?

I had some cash I wanted to deposit so I deposited them to my wife's account (at a different bank) and had her write me the check for the said amount. Then the problems began:

1) I tried to deposit the check with Ally Android app.
2) The app malfunctioned and deposited it twice.
3) I immediately called the customer support and asked to ignore/cancel the second transaction - they assured me they will.
4) Both transactions still go through and put my wife's account in overdraft.
5) I call Ally again and ask to reverse the second transaction. They say ""no problemo, money will be back in 2-3 days"".
6) Ally withdraws $1,200 from my Ally account.
7) A week passes; $1,200 never reaches my wife's account.
8) I call Ally every 2 days. Customer support assures me they are on their way.
9) After 10 days of arguing they tell me that the ONLY way for my wife to get the money back is to open a ""paid case through FedLine"" via her bank. And no, they can't give me money back.
10) My wife's bank says they will do it, but it can take at least a week and up to 90 days.

I don't know when I will get my money back. Meanwhile, Ally bank keeps my $1,200 for no reason whatsoever. I have liquidity so it is not a problem right now, but the idea that I wouldn't be able to pay my rent because of their mistake sends shivers down my spine.

She said she was selling the family home in about 9 months, so that's my deadline for needing to save up to move out. 

Rent for apartments in New Jersey are about $1500 a month for one room. I'm really worried I won't be able to make it. My mother put the debt on her credit cards so she only owes the bank money. However, she put the payments on cards with incredibly high interest rates, so she has been pressuring constantly to keep giving her more money as she guilt trips me into believing that I'm just lazy and that's why I can't save. 

Someone please help, I'm fearing for my life.",finance

personalfinance,"Possibly purchasing a house from my aunt, but worried if it's worth it or if it's a good deal.","I am a 26-year-old male. I have a girlfriend who I've been dating for the last 2 years and will probably marry. I am currently renting from my aunt along with 2 roommates for $550 a month per person. My aunt has decided to sell her house and has made me an offer. The house is appraised at 215K and she will sell it to me for 192k. It is a 3 bedroom, 3 baths, 2,100 sq foot ranch style house. It was built in 2002. It is located in a great area and only about 10 minutes from my work. I originally never planned on buying a house anytime soon, but if it's a good deal? I only have around 4k saved up, but my dad said he will help me with the deposit if I need it. Also, I was told I can get a gift of equity to help with the deposit/closing costs? I'm not 100% sure how that works.
My Finances:
Monthly take home pay after taxes: $3,200 approx.
I have 46k in student loans at 6.4% interest rate. 
No Monthly car payment
No other debt
I spend around $1,675.99 a month on bills(Rent, loan, car ins, etc). $1,105 in savings and Roth IRA. Around $445 a month on extras like going out, fun, gym, etc. Any extra money I throw into my savings account. 
My roommates plan on staying with me for a while which is good. My three main concerns. 1) I don't need a house this big. Even now, we don't use our finished basement, besides my bedroom and bathroom down there. But there is a lot of empty space that 3 20-year-old guys don't need. 2) The house has an HOA fee of $120 a month and they paint the house every 4 years, mow the lawn and scoop the driveway. Personally, I can mow my own damn lawn. I feel like I'm just throwing away $120 a month. 3) The house definitely needs new carpet and needs to be internally painted. Personally, I don't really care about it, but if I do want to sell it, that is more money I will have to put into the house.

I'm sorry for ranting through this, but I'm just really nervous and I don't know what the right answer is. Any advice would be awesome and I don't know if you want any more information?

personalfinance,USA - How much more do I need to do in order to buy a house?,"So i'm looking to buy a house within the next 3-5 years and am wondering what i need to have in place prior to pulling that trigger - 

I currently have:

$35000 in a CD account that I don't have access to for at least 2 years (I treat this as an emergency fund also)

$10000 in a IRA invested in a mutual fund

$2000 in a taxable brokerage account mostly split between a couple of ETFs

I also pay into my employers pension scheme (It's an old fashioned gov pension scheme) and have 5 or 6 thousand in that currently.

As for debts, I have $15000 left on a new car that I am paying off monthly and will be refinancing soon to get a sub 5% interest rate, and I have about $2000 on my credit card which should be paid off within a month.

What financials do I need in place to buy a home of say 300k? My credit score is sitting at around 720 right now.

personalfinance,$2500 in credit debt -- finally have income and looking to alleviate,"Hey /r/personalfinance, 

So my title says the gist of it. I understand that budgeting and spending responsibly will be the best way to get everything paid off, but what I was wondering about, in the meantime, was the possible benefit of so-called balance transfer credit cards. I had looked into them before, but was told that this really wouldn't help my situation, because I didn't have income. When I was in school I racked up some debt, and now I am working again, at nearly full-time, and my expenses at the moment are not too much. However, for my current credit cards (which are at their limits), I'm currently paying almost entirely interest and the occasional late payment fee. So I wondered if a balance transfer card would be a good option for me. Seems there are cards which offer no interest for 12-18 months.

Perhaps there is a better way to make payments and insure that I'm still making an impact on my debt, but for now it seems that having two cards which are maxed out and for which I'm paying a decently high interest rate is probably not the best solution.

Any advice would really be appreciated, thank you.",finance

My current income is about $120 dollars per week vs about 500$ during the summer since I dont have school. I plan on attending a 4 year school after high school which will probably be very costly 

What should I do with my money? Do I keep it in this same account that makes no interest or do I switch to an online bank with high interest rate? Do I start an IRA? I am expecting to use most of this money on my college costs which means I probably cant do another long term CD.

Instead of $74.00 they paid 740.00 and now say that I have to pay it back, the letter basically made it sound like I stole it...More info Inside.","I was working at a restaurant a few months ago, until I found a better job. I remained on call should they ever be short staffed. After several months, I received a call asking if I could work, and I was free so I agreed. Two nights after I worked there, I received a few calls through out the day and figured they were wanting me to come back. After getting off my new job I checked my messages and the manager of the restaurant said that there was a letter from corporate and that I needed to come in. 

The letter basically stated that I was given $740.00 in stead of $74.00 on check in tips. Now they require me to work and pay it off or just pay it....Which I cannot afford to do. 

How can this happen? It was their mistake, and they worded things to make it sound like I stole the money. How am I supposed to know how much I get in tips all the time? It wasn't off my hourly wage where the mistake was. Now I have to double up on top of my other job to work until its paid off.

Looking for any help or knowledge on the matter. Can it be fought? What can I do besides just work for nothing and they take all the money until its paid off...

Thank you in advanced.

I'm sorry if I was unclear in my frantic state. I'm completely understanding of the mistake and am willing to pay it back. The issue I have was that I EITHER pay it all right away (which I cannot) or work for them and they take my pay check and im basically working for nothing...Someone suggested I ask for a payment plan...That will be my next step",finance
Bitcoin,A punk rock/bitcoin faerie tale.,"This is my story. 

When I originally bought into bitcoin I was a snot nosed punk rocker with long hair and a bass guitar that I carried everywhere. I got dozens of the fuckers by mining on my sweet ass gaming laptop which could play half-life 1 at like 23 fps, then when a GPU became necessary and my sweet ass gaming laptop chipset wouldn’t cut it, I bought in at a hundred dollars for a few cents a pop. Hit a bunch of faucets, got a few freebies—whatever. Something about it always appealed to my anarchist side, I felt hardcore, bringing down the system and fucking shit up. 

Low life’s high tech, right? I was living the dream my 80’s punk and cyberpunk forefathers laid down, neon and chrome. The Man could not handle my kickass basslines or my cryptocurrency. 

Unfortunately, I never really got it because I don’t get technology that well. Don’t get me wrong, I can read and learn and unlearn with the best of them, I’ve read every cyberpunk book in existence, and I was down with the plan—but I didn’t really get the supporting frame work, the chord progressions supporting the melody. Block chain?—sure, if that’s what it takes, just point me at the bastards and I’ll hit ‘em hard. 

But I was never a true cyber-warrior and I barely researched anything about the coin. I didn’t understand scarcity and I didn’t understand patience and I didn’t understand investment because I didn’t care—that’s not what it meant to me. 

All I knew is that the banks would one day be running scared and I wanted in on making them squeal--wanted to light the mobs torches and pass out sharpened pitch forks with a ‘go forth and break my brother/sister’. 

When others were hodling I was giving that shit away. When the paper wallet thing came out, I would print out a stack at kinko’s five coins per and just give them to random people— “here you go, boss, become part of the revolution. Smash the banks.” and I’d walk away, head high, strut long. Leaving them staring after me like I was the craziest fucker. They weren’t wrong. I've never been the brightest tool in the shed...wait. 

It felt so good, maybe if I’d been born a few hundred years earlier I would have been a fire and brimstone preacher, I always loved getting up in front of people and stirring them up. 

I remember trying to buy anything I could with bitcoin, insisting to all my friends that it was the fucking shit and they needed to get in on this. They laughed at me. They were right to, even if it wasn’t because (as they thought) that bitcoin was and always would be worthless. More so because I’d do stupid things like pay people to take bitcoins from me, I remember one dude with infected sores all up and down his arms who I convinced to open a wallet so I could give him a bitcoin before I’d bum him a cigarette. 

I paid him to have a smoke. 

It was because I—like many people—just don’t have that great of a risk/reward/longevity brain, I guess. But I wanted crypto to win so badly. I loved the idea of fiat currency crashing down around the ears of the bastards who use it to keep small and angry men like me in our work boots until the day we die. I frittered hundreds of coins because the revolution obsessed me, because I was playing in bands on the strip and never making ends meet and I was mad about it. Because I thought coins were cool and wanted to use them as much as I could. I never suspected the coins would be worth anything in my life time, I always figured, yeah, ten years on I’ll be good and dead of an overdose or a burst pancreas and this shit will be tits. 

Turns out, the biggest trick I ever pulled was on myself, surviving a lifestyle I had no intention of getting out of. 

Looking back on all the junkies, working girls, speed freaks, and random musicians that I hung out with and gave bitcoin too, I wonder if any of them hodled? I wonder if somewhere, a hodler is crying with happiness and thanking that one idiot punk rocker with all the bad three minute songs about beer and kicking ass. 

Damn, I sure hope so. 

So there I was, living it up, this is around 2013, and shit came crashing down. Just for me. Nobody else. Some things went wrong with people close to me and in my family. Nobody else could help and my bands weren’t going anywhere, so, in desperation, I pulled what could be described as serious shenanigans to get what I needed—and fled when the creditors came knocking. 

It didn’t help in the end. Nothing would have. Let me tell you people—health is the only wealth at the end of the day, never forget it. 

After that I kinda lost it. Lost myself. Stopped caring about anything but fiction novels and alcohol. I was homeless for a while but I won’t talk about that because there are plenty of people (some I’ve personally met) who’ve had it way tougher. My computer got stolen and along with it my few remaining coins. 

I fell out of touch with my scene and most of my ideals. A friend helped me pick up a bit, let me shower at his place and stuff. From there I couch surfed for a few years and then another buddy of mine turned me on to a brilliant motel scam and I got into cloning/stealing key cards and hiding out in second story smoking rooms at motel sixes across the Midwest, spanging for change and smoking way too many cigarettes and dreaming of all the bands that went wrong and all the times I should have just tried harder instead of giving up on a junkie drummer or an asshole lead singer.

I’d escaped California; became a drifter. A nomad with a few tricks up his sleeve and all his dreams on life support. I’m still nomadic to this day, I travel, stay on the move and one step ahead of the authorities (as if they cared). 

And here I am. Still worthless, still a long haired (ever so slowly balding) punk rocker (failed) with nothing to show for it. Except I don’t regret it. Not one damn second. Not for chasing my dreams and not for evangelizing bitcoin. All I can do is pray that somewhere, somehow, I had a small part in this revolution. That my words reached someone with the actual mental facilities to really get stuck in and fuck shit up, the Case Johnsons and Thomas Lulls, the Molly Millions and India Carelesses of our time; our future. 

So that’s it, keep on brothers and sisters. I’m cheering you from the sidelines. I don’t own a single Satoshi and I don’t care. It’s not a bubble and it never was; all of you deserve your rewards for being part of the revolution. 

I’m gonna have a beer and play my shitty bass which has only one string because some asshole stole my other three (literally off my bass!) and I’m gonna write a song called ‘Midnight Crypto’ which will never be recorded like the other hundred or so I’ve written—but that’s also ok—because I’ve got a computer to write on and bass to slam on and one day soon, maybe within my lifetime, I’m gonna watch those banks fucking crumble. Fall on their knees and beg for forgiveness as they try to explain away the ocean of blood from the lives they’ve ruined. 

TL;DR: I was a punk. I am a punk. I’ve yelled a lot about stuff in my time. Also, I’m reading Emma by Jane Austin and it’s fuckin’ tits, who knew? (Actually, I guess it’s a classic so lots of people).",cryptocurrency

I make about $1800 a month after taxes and am staying with a close friend who is determined to help me and letting me stay rent free while I rebuild my credit (she's the best).

I have $17,000 in student loans which are all government loans and will be ~$175 a month when I need to start repaying them (end of March). 

I use Mint.com to manage my money and when checking my credit the only open accounts etc... are my student loans. The only thing labelled ""poor"" was my credit-age.  

My plan to rebuild my credit was to get a secured credit card ($300) and use it for primarily gas and groceries- paying it down/off often, possibly get a car through DriveTime (using my current 2005 Ford Expedition which runs as well as some cash as a down payment. I understand the interest rate is bad but I thought it would help with my credit), and paying my student loans. 

What I don't know is *if* I can afford to do all three of those right now and in what order I should do them. Should I start paying my loans off as quickly as possible or get the credit card first? Will a car payment help my credit enough to justify the purchase?

personalfinance,Medical student about to graduate. I would really appreciate some advice about my debt!,"Hi PF! 

Let me first thank all of you guys. I never knew anything about credit, debt, or investing and I have learned a lot from this subreddit. 

I am a 4th year medical student about to graduate medical school in about 6 months. I will be in debt 100K total and my payments will start 11/2018. 

I took out private loans at a lower interest rate (4.99%) but they were for a 5 year term. I was not eligible for student loans at that time because of I was an international student. Last semester I was eligible for federal loans, and I took those at a 10 year term. My monthly payments starting 11/2018 will be ~1400/month. 

The loan amounts are as follows: 
$13,721 - $267.30/month (5 year term; 4.99%)
$10,296 - $200.92/month (5 year term; 4.99%)
$11,069 - $216.31/month (5 year term; 4.99%)
$6,695 - $131.18/month (5 year term; 4.99%)
$19,426 - $143.62/month (10 year term; 4.99%)
$18,031 - $155.58/month (10 year term; 4.99%)
~$22,000 - $248/month (10 year term; 6.99%)

As a resident, I will be getting paid an average of $53,000/year pre-tax. I will need to pay a little for health insurance, 401K match, and some other things. My car is paid off and my parents will help me pay for my car insurance. My rent will also be b/w ~$850-1000 +/- electricity/water/internet. I won't be getting cable (just paying for netflix). Lunch will mostly be provided at the hospital so I will save on food. 

So my questions are: 
1) I have one more semester left. Would be smart to take a 10 year term federal loan at 6.99% and pay off some of the 5 year loans to reduce the monthly amount? 
2) Or would be possible to afford $1400/month on my income? and if so, what can I do so I am not strapped for cash every month and also build my savings? 

Thank you in advance! You guys are the best.",finance
personalfinance,Is switching to PAYE worth it after 5 years of IBR? (x-post r/studentloans),"Do the benefits of 5 less years and only 10% discretionary income payment on PAYE outweigh 5 years' worth of interest capitalizing on IBR?

personalfinance,How to save (and vigorously pay off student loans),"Hello everyone! I need a bit of advise.
I have had a job as a School Administrator for the last six months (which pays $16/hr). I graduated with a BA in Psychology a year ago and have been trying to pay off my student loans ASAP, but i'm finding it hard to balance having any kind of savings and making loan payments. 


Here is a breakdown of what I'm dealing with:


* I bring home around $1900 a month (working 8-5 M-F)


        - Monthly Expenses (Ex: utilities/rent/gas/electric): $350/mo

        - Loans: $39,200 total

        - $13251.57 in federal loans (unsubsidized - 7 loans total make up this amount - some loans have 6.8% interest, some loans have 4.6%. 

        -$ 16948.46 in federal loans (subsidized - 5 loans total make up this amount - 3.8-4.2% interest 
     
I looked into refinancing my unsub. loans w/ higher interest rates, but I don't have anyone I could co-sign with, so I haven't been able to get approved (even though I have a great credit score). 


Because I really wanted to have my loans paid off in 3 or so years,  I have been paying $1235 a month towards my loans, which leaves me with $665 to work with. After paying bills, I'm left with around $300 a month (which doesn't get me far). 


There are not many high paying job opportunities where I am from and I took this job because it is great experience for the field I want to get into, but I don't know how to pay off my student loans and have a savings at all.


I could really use advice on what I should be prioritizing.",finance
Bitcoin,FUTURES vs THE Future. Who exactly is betting FOR Bitcoin?,"[In a previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7igdnx/congratulations_you_weathered_your_first_price/), I mentioned ""the world"" in general betting FOR bitcoin.

I apologize, as  /u/thinkharderokay brought up a very valid point about terminology.


 When it comes to Bitcoin's future, ""the world"" was much to vague for what I was intending to express.

With the release of Futures, there will indeed be investors betting against the UPCOMING and SHORT term exact valuation of Bitcoin.  However, forget for a moment that will there be others taking that bet against them for whatever X price swing they exchange contracts on.

Many of the very same investors who will be taking up shorts against Bitcoin are working for companies whose trading desk is built around a long/bullish strategy for Bitcoin overall!

""The rest of the world"" is the embodiment of technology, businesses, and individuals who are in place working towards the actual future of Bitcoin.

 This is not the uninformed media, or the general public that are just starting to ask serious questions about bitcoin.

As with all new and misunderstood technology, many times the older or out of touch will drag their feet in both self-education as well as adoption.  If we look at the creation of the internet, ""the world"" was so ready for it even if ""the public at large"" did not even know it yet.

Specifically, the portion of the population that matters in this case are those who have been pouring a significant expenditure of  time, knowledge, and energy to ensure that Bitcoin's future does lead to success.  

What success means exactly for Bitcoin itself has not been defined yet.  This is a good thing because nobody really knows the exact implications of how this is changing the world. 
 However, just because the exact nature of implementation of cyptocurrency is unknowable now, does not mean that there is a looming danger for Bitcoin itself.

 It is mandatory to step back and see the billions that are being poured into Bitcoin.  Keep in mind to not look at just the money inside the blockchain itself, but on the infrastructure on cryptocurrency as a whole.  

The institutions, experts, entrepreneurs, managers, programmers, and everyone that supports them is just the tip of the iceberg of the human weight that is being exerted upon Bitcoin.  All of the above people dwarf the actual investors in importance for Bitcoins success in the long term, no matter how much money they have in the game.

All of these people are the ones who don't have time to discuss TODAY's market price, or take an interview on CNN to explain what they are doing to someone who clearly doesn't understand the pre-written questions that they are asking.

If we want the full picture of the engine of Bitcoin, we have to step back from just price, and current usability.  We have to understand that we are sitting at the inception of a NEW kind of financial market.

This is a hard thing to explain to people because we don't know what the final environment will be like.  Imagine trying to explain even the existing stock market to a mideval king.  

In the blink of one decade, cyptocurrency management is going to be second nature to every teenager.  It's history and usage will be taught in school classes, but it wont even be necessary because they will all be receiving their allowance through their phones, and buying snacks from vending machines with QR code scanners.  

Yes, there is a LOT of work that is going to take place in order to scale real life usage.  However, that work is going to create jobs, companies, new types of skills and abilities, and entire markets around what can be done with cypto. 

 Right now we are seeing some already in place business adopting to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, even with volatile prices and transaction delays/fees.  Now take into perspective the companies who are going to be built up AROUND crypto itself, and working hand in hand with those that are already toiling away at scaleability and usability issues.

This is the very pinnacle of the tip of an iceberg that is forever changing history.",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,Can someone explain grand vision of Bitcoin future in economic terms.,"Hey there,

Been keeping track of BTC for a while and have always had these nagging questions about its feasibility as the ""future"" of currency. I like all the not tracked, no third party involvement, etc (i.e. all the advantages of having an online currency that should most of the time be safe).

However, in economic terms I have always had a hard time getting my head around how it would feasibly work as the prime currency of a country (to keep it simple).

I guess the closest analogy there exists of such a system is the gold standard right way back when. However, and please correct me if I'm wrong, the issues with the gold standard, principally that when theres no more new gold, theres no more growth, doesn't apply to bitcoin. From posts on this sub and others, it seems that the vision is that when bitcoins stop being made, whenever more money supply is needed, the demand for bitcoin will increase and thus price will as well, thus allowing for a smaller fraction of a bitcoin to be worth more (please tell me if i am understanding this very incorrectly). For example, .01 bitcoins at bitcoin price of 50 dollars isnt much but .01 bitcoins at current bitcoin price is nice. 

Thus, in an all bitcoin economy, this sort of argument would imply the price of bitcoin will continue to rise forever, as long as there is growth (i.e more demand for me bitcoins). 

So that doesn't really make much sense to me. Growth in this crypto only world doesn't make much sense to me. . The thought experiment that I have been slowly developing but I can't seem to figure out (probably because of lack of bitcoin knowledge and effort) goes as follows:

Say we have gotten to cap of 21,000,000 bitcoins in the crypto-currency only economy (lets contain it to one country). Lets say that 1 bitcoin = 1,000,000 dollars - I know tha it doesn't make sense to compare it to dollars in a crypto only economy - so lets say instead that .001 bitcoins gets you a very very nice high quality TV. 
So thats the bitcoin relative price context. Now lets say that our crypto economy is doing well, people are working yea yea and are getting hired and productivity is up and so wages are up (woohoo!), so companies have to pay more bitcoins to their workers. -Here is my first confusion in a bitcoin economy-. In our fiat currency economy, when this happens, companies usually borrow money from banks (who were given it by printing money from FED) and they can fund these larger wages and hire-ings and technnology advancement (we could obvisouly discuss the merits of having inflation baked into growth into our current system, but its not really the subject).  Question: how is this planned to function in a bitcoin only future??? Is the price of bitcoin suppose to increase here, so that a smaller percentage of the bitcoin, (i.e. 10% of ancient bitcoin price, i.e. .0001) can buy the same tv as before thus in essence having 10x the money supply (in my hypothetical scenario here). If this is the vision, then what are the mechanisms for the increase in bitcoin price? How is the relative price of bitcoin compared to all goods actually increasing (demand by whom?). Second Question - if what i suppose in the first question is in fact the vision (please correct me if im wrong!), why would anyone ever spend? if i know when theres growth, the relative price of my money goes up, I will just never work and wait for growth to drive my bitcoin price up in effect making me richer by sitting there (I may have not understood something really fundamental here cause this really just doesn't work like that does it?). 

Essentially this scenario is the one that ive been trying to wrap my head around. I don't expect some full holistic answer to the whole scenario, just want to understand if this is how bitcoin believers envision an economic system based crypto currency behaves, and how they actually envision it. thanks for any input!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Got approved for a really low rate on my 10k car loan - do I take the longer term (lower monthly payments) or shorter term (higher monthly payments)?,"I am currently in college and getting my first car. I have an excellent paying job (800 bucks minimum a month at 12 hours a week min - I can work up to 22 before it starts reflecting in my school work) with no other expenses other than the biweekly grocery bill. My 10k loan was approved at a very low 2% interest rate due to my exceptional credit,and after some quick calculations I found that with a 5 year loan my payments would be 175/month and that with a 4 year loan I'd be at 217. At a 3 year I'd be at 285 which I could handle,  it would just be slightly less stress for me working if I wouldn't have to pay that consistently. Because the interest is really negligible to me personally - is it not better to invest the difference in the monthly payment? Or should I just pay it off as quickly as possible?I plan on paying it off early anyway but I just like to plan for contingencies

personalfinance,"The old employee vs. independent contractor debate (Long post because I've done my research, but I still have questions and need advice)","My fiancee has been working at the same job for over three years, which is a ""side hustle"" where she works 2-5 hours a week depending on the week.  This is not her main job, but she enjoys it, loves her clients, and it helps keep her sane.  Additionally, though some people might think it's not worth acting on if it's merely a side hustle, she has friends that work here full-time and are in the same exact situation she is.  Additionally, in a normal scenario my fiancee would be worried about retaliation, however she's considering leaving the business and I think she might as well correct all these issues on the way out; at the same time, I will admit that my dislike towards the business may be biasing me, which is part of the reason I'm asking for your opinions.

For her first year with the company, she was paid (and taxed) as an independent contractor.  Then the business owner sold the business, and the new owner paid her as an employee.  Recently the original owner purchased the company back, and now she is being paid as an independent contractor again.  Her job duties and her day-to-day activities have never changed.  Obviously one of the business owners was wrong.  Additionally, I think it may be important that she was considered an employee for two years.

I have checked [this IRS website (Understanding Employee vs. Contractor Designation)](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/understanding-employee-vs-contractor-designation), and I believe she's an employee.  I was hoping r/PF could held me decide if she is an employee, and if so what to do.

Without giving too many details, she teaches fitness classes at a gym in Louisiana.  The following are all true:

* She is told what her schedule will be for teaching classes, and does not pick her schedule/classes.  If another teacher is sick or calls out, she can choose to teach that class as a substitute.

* She is told what type of class she will teach (i.e., kickboxing).  She is only told to teach classes that she's certified to teach, of course, but the business owner controls what type of class she teaches without my fiancee getting input into the types of classes she prefers to teach.

* There is no official evaluation system; if people don't complain, the business owner just assumes things are good.  That being said, the business owner will occasionally take my fiancee's classes ""for fun"" however I have a hard time believing she's not being evaluated in those scenarios.

* My fiancee has received all of her training/certifications elsewhere, though the business does offer training and certifications and nearly all other teachers have received their certs from the business.

* All of the equipment used in the classes is equipment purchased and owned by the business, and my fiancee doesn't need to purchase or provide any equipment.

* She has no expenses, reimbursed or unreimbursed.  Well, she has to purchase her own gym clothing and shoes, which she tax deducts, but no expenses explicitly for the business.

* She has no opportunity for profit or loss.

* She also teaches the same class at a different gym in the same city, so in a way she's competing with this business.  The business owner has made it clear that she doesn't like this, but there are no explicit rules against it and most teachers teach at multiple gyms as a way of increasing their overall pay.

* She is paid per the class, not per the hour.  One class typically involves about 20 minutes of planning the class in advance, getting to the gym 10 minutes early to prepare the room, the 75 minute class time, and then about 10 minutes of hanging out afterward talking to students.

* There is no contract, and she receives no benefits (health insurance, etc.).

* This is considered a permanent relationship.  We live in a town with a university, so the business owner re-evaluates the schedule every semester and may tell my fiancee that for the next four months she'll teach a different class or on a different day.  Despite these changes, it is assumed that my fiancee will continue teaching at the gym without an end date.

* The classes taught by my fiancee and other teachers are a core part of the business.  Unlike some gyms that have floors of weights and cardio machines, this gym is exclusively three specially customized classrooms and a shop.  If my fiancee and other teachers like her were not performing their services, the business would have nothing to offer customers.

Thank you reading this far.  If the business owner is correct and my fiancee is an independent contractor,  I appreciate you telling me.  If I'm correct and she's an employee, please direct me what to do.  

I have found [IRS form SS-8 (Determination of Worker Status for Purposes of Federal Employment Taxes and Income Tax Withholding)](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fss8.pdf).  Should she fill this out?  We also have an IRS office in our city; is this the type of thing that she can just go in to the office and talk to them about?

Additionally, at a state level, I found this [Misclassified Employee Assessment from the Louisiana Workforce Commission](http://www.laworks.net/UnemploymentInsurance/MisclassWorker.asp), and based on the assessment (which clearly isn't binding) the website believes she is misclassified and encourages her to fill out a form on the [Louisiana Workforce Commission Fraud Reporting page](http://www.laworks.net/FraudMenu.asp).  Can she fill out the fraud form even if she doesn't know all the information and has to leave some of it blank?

Finally, two last questions:

1) Can I do any of these forms or processes for her, or does she have to do them herself?

2) If my beliefs are correct, should she do these forms and processes on her own, or is she better off trying to get more of the teachers to all do the forms together?

3) Does it matter whether she does the state or federal forms in a particular order, or at the same time?

And finally, if applicable: 4) What exactly is the business owner cheating?  Is she cheating my fiancee?  Is the cheating the federal/state government?  I think this is wrong, but I don't exactly understand what she's doing.

Thank you very much!",finance
personalfinance,Getting engaged. Fiancee has 102k in student debt. I'm a veteran in college. I need a plan.,"Well, it's how it sounds. This isn't a surprise, I've known about her debt since about ten days into dating. We've been very upfront about our financial situations. She's a high school teacher who's teaching internationally right now, I'm former military and in my second year of college at a top-tier private school. 

We're getting engaged this summer when she's home, and probably doing a domestic partnership so that we have some form of legal standing in case of emergencies (we've run into this issue twice now). Wedding will wait until after I graduate. We'll be meeting with a CPA during the summer before signing any legal documentation, because taxes are going to be a bitch. 

RE: GI Bill... 
I'm on a full ride here. I'm waiting for the last two years of school/if I go straight to an MBA program/when I go to grad school. My monthly stipend would be about $900 a month here, and $1,500 a month where I want to get my MBA. That difference + full ride = not touching it. 

I have about 20k in student debt from community college, and my sights set on consulting. My credit is not great, hers is absolutely brilliant. I have 4.5k in savings, she has 7k. I have $500 more in credit card debt than I have in savings, but just did a balance transfer to a 0% APR/1 year card with a lower overall interest rate, and am on track to pay that off within the year. We go over YNAB together with Google Hangouts, and there are no illusions about where we both are financially. 

I'd like to see her in a position to pay off her debt, she's currently paying half of her monthly salary to loans. She is torn between resigned to paying this forever, and wanting it gone. I know that when I graduate, I'll be on track to make more than her in a very short period of time. 

I'd like to see her pay these off. I also want to pay my debt off. My current thoughts on this:

* 1) Work on paying my debt off, once it's gone, start saving that same amount with intent to pay on her loans eventually. Worst case scenario for our marriage, I have a large savings account. 
* 1a) She's told me she doesn't want my money. She refuses to let me put myself financially out of sorts for her in any way. I would have to save the money, and then tell her about it. 
* 2) Ask to divide household expenses by income and debts, so that she can continue to make payments on more than interest. We've discussed this, but are not sure how to best do this while I'm in school (she comes back my senior year).
* 3) Miraculously have a windfall from a grandparent, which is more likely than the other option -- become rich on crypto (I have some crypto, I've held it for quite a while, but it'll take a miracle for it to become worth 120k after taxes haha).
* 4) We also need to save for retirement. I have about 4k in a 401k and 5k in a ROTH IRA. She has a pension from teaching domestically, but currently isn't contributing to it because she's overseas. 

I also have to decide if I'm going straight from undergrad to an MBA program, or if I'm going to try and work for a year or two. My GI Bill will pay for most of MBA program at any one of the top business schools, plus the living stipend. If I get an associate's position at a consulting firm, I'm looking at a starting salary around 65k. If I get an MBA first (getting in to the top three without a firm sending you is almost impossible), that starting salary is up to around 140k. This is not including benefits and possible bonuses, etc. 

I make $11.75 an hour and work 10 hours a week. I've saved enough money to go on my first vacation ever this Christmas, and it's completely paid for. I started school with literally $5 to my name, and now have around $4,500. I get a monthly disability payment that covers my bills, I've paid down a lot of debt with that $11.75 an hour. Essentially my life is in a holding pattern, though, until summer internships roll around. I used most of my income last summer to pay off a loan and paid down two credit cards, I've since paid them off. 

So my question is, how and where do I start to make a plan? How do we make a plan?",finance

personalfinance,Looking to refinance student loans - do it before Dec 12?,"Hello all! Now that I've began a career and (finally) settled after several months of job searching, my first step in personal finance will be to refinance several (~$30K for now) student loans. For lenders, I'm looking at companies such as SoFi/LendKey, etc.

A problem for me has been that due to the months of unemployment as a new grad, my credit card usage is out of control (near 100%). As a result, I've been living extremely spartan (possibly sleeping on the floor, etc.) my first few weeks with the new job to pay it down ASAP to raise my credit score. My rationale is that a few weeks of holding out may be worth hundreds saved with locking in a lower rate now. Once a payment to my CC processes this weekend my usage will be down to ~50%. After my paycheck clears on the 15th, it will be down to ~0%.

I'm looking to lock in a fixed rate, given the current market conditions and am aware that the Fed is likely increasing rates in December. However, I'm wondering if the ""likely"" rate hike has __already been reflected__ in the current fixed refinance rates, or if it has not, meaning that if I wait until Dec 14, my rate will likely jump 0.25%.

Given that credit scores take time to update, and that it's possible the rate hike is already reflected in current rates (not sure), is it worth the effort to snag a refinance before the 12th, or should I just relax, live (slightly) less spartan for these weeks, and wait until later this month?

If you had the opportunity to change an old friend's entire being in a positive way, would you? In life, some people have been ""dealt better hands"" than others so-to-speak; some of us off to better or rougher starts than our peers on our journey through life. Some of spend carelessly while others struggle day after day.    I think we all strive to be able to wake up every day, and actually feel the freedom to enjoy being alive for the day, in comparison to the way that I, like most people, stress every waking moment about finances.
      Partly , our decisions define the course of our existence. I'm not perfect. Nobody is.  We try to make the best choices at the time. Occasionally I do believe fate or a series of ""bad luck"" , and the lack of useful, proper outlets to deter these times of struggle, can cause one to be dug into an impossible hole.
      There comes time when everybody needs help. Otherwise why would things like loans exist? A lot of people have some sort of support system in their life or someone they can call on in times of need, I don't anymore.

      I'm 25 and I don't know anyone else who loved me or cared for me the way my mom did, of course.  My mother, along with my father whos still paying her medical bills, and the rest of the family (cousins and aunts and uncles) could never help me with my financial issues but, what she did and they do attempt to do is help emotionally because that's all they have the means to do. 
     No amount of money could bring my mother back or fill the gap that has been left in my heart, at this point I am just searching for something to give me a reason to go on. A purpose in life. Truly and mostly, a sense of security.   But as I write this today I am late and getting worse on multiple bills.
      I have considered filing for bankruptcy in an attempt to ""start fresh again"" but aside from the damage that will do to my credit for 7 years,  I am in need of federal loans and grants to fund my education, and a bankruptcy on my record would disqualify me.     
The newest thing to come about is my girlfriend is 12 weeks pregnant.
    I've traded bitcoin on localbitcoins in the past I had purchased 3 when they were around $650 a piece; I look back over the website now just in a dream state now seeing that they are hovering around 16k and it makes me sick.   I would be sitting on a pretty penny for my child to be if I hadn't sold my coins when they hit 1,000 so that I could help my dad with some bills and whatnot.

   I do owe 13k on a vehicle that I purchased with a 16%apr. One bitcoin could be cashed out over a course of a month or two easily and pay off my loan and change my life, literally give me a second chance at rebuilding a credit score and building a life for my girlfriend and child.

BlockChain,I need help wrapping my mind around blockchain and cryptocurrencies,"I work in tech and I've been following the progress of blockchain and bitcoin for the best part of the last three years. What started as excitement 3 years ago has evolved into honest concern about whether or not this technology can be as (1) viable and (2) beneficial as I originally thought. My concerns formed recently after listening to Andreas Antonopoulos (of all people) in the three episodes of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. I need somebody knowledgeable and patient enough to clarify some questions and concerns I have. Sorry for the long post. 

Before I list my questions/concerns, I have to say that I am a supporter of this technology (so far at least) and I couldn't be more grateful to experience something as disruptive as blockchain. I'm not trying to argue against the use of it. The answer to all my questions could easily be that I simply don't get the big-picture idea or something like that.


Bitcoin specific questions:

(1) Antonopoulos emphasized the importance of micro-transactions in all three episodes. With the last episode being in 2016, and transaction fees already too high for micropayments, how could he possibly argue that bitcoin is the correct medium? 

(2) How can bitcoin possibly be used for real-time payments, given the transaction delay?

(3) A parallelism between bitcoin and email is often drawn in these conversations. But in my mind, email transformed something that was extremely time-consuming and made it instant. How does bitcoin do that, given that payments are already fast and for the most part free (to me as a consumer -- international transactions excluded)?

Concerns:

(4) Antonopoulos gave an example of how micropayments can be used in a ""pay-per-view"" way or pay by the second etc, saying that a reporter (for example) could get a few satoshis every time somebody reads their article. This got me incredibly concerned. Are we moving towards an internet with no free content (regardless of the quality)? How would a 10 year old kid possibly be able to learn anything online if they have to pay for any content they want to see? And what would force the content creators to ask for such a low amount? My guess is they will ask for higher amounts than what Antonopoulos had in mind.

(5) Back to the parallelism with the early days of email, in order to simplify it, AOL, yahoo, google and so many more offered ""centralized"" email services. In bitcoin terms, that would literally be a bank. On the other hand, I can't see a future of bitcoin (or any other coin really) as a mainstream currency without such ""banks"".

(6) Is blockchain/bitcoin really freeing up the way money works? I'm beginning to think that it's simply taking us back to a time of barter or at least the beginning of minted coins being used between people. Those old methods evolved over time to what we have today, primarily for simplicity (and arguably control). Would it really take that long before we (bitcoin or any other altcoin) are at the exact same point we are today, except everything (banks, federal reserve, etc) is built over blockchain? In other words, is blockchain/bitcoin simply the beginning of a loop?

(7) The more I read about the ""differences"" between cryptocurrencies the more I realize they are all the same thing. For example, a couple of updates on bitcoin and it becomes ripple, or monero or any other coin. Can anyone clarify this for me?

I believe in January or February of 2014. So I don't think they can do a ton about that until 2019. But, at least 25k of that debt will be settled.

Credit card debt / interest rates
$9000 owing with a 24.99% interest rate.
$15000 LOC with 12.4%
$9500 credit card with 24.99%
$1400 credit card with 24.99%

It's the minimum monthly payments on these cards that are killing them. I believe the $9500 card got cut off a while ago if that changes anything. The only card that isn't at it's max is the $1400 card that has a $3000 limit.

Monthly expenses: ( all figures are approx after tax)
Internet: $84 / mo 
Home phone: $22 / mo
Rent: $1100 / mo 
Life insurance: $22 / mo 
Gym memberships: $44 / mo 
Car insurance: $128 / mo 
Bank fees: $28 / mo 
Gas: $200 / mo  (on average)
Yoga (mightve been cancelled) $90 / mo 
Misc expenses: $25 / mo
Groceries: $700 / mo  (average)

= $2443 / mo before any credit card payments

Minimum credit card payments

Consolidated loan $510 
Credit cards $414
Line of credit $128

= $1052 / mo 

Total income (average)
Step dad: $3000 / mo (works between 40 and 45 hours  a week as prison guard)
Mom: $700 / mo  (works between 15 - 20 hours a week part time)
Child tax credit: $200 / mo

= $3900 / mo

Now I have no doubt there's more expenses in there than what they had said
 I think it's misc stuff that can probably be cut but it's hard to get them to admit to any of that.
Biggest problem is my sister has cerebral palsy and someone has to be at home with her at all times. Whether that's my other sister, Mom or step dad. That also comes with more unexpected expenses for medication, trips to other cities for check ups and all that fun stuff.

I have no clue how they should start trying to tackle this. I know they're in an awful position. I'm paying for cell phone bills for them at the present time as I work at a cell phone company and get a 50% discount.
I do have a few smaller questions though.

1. Are they in any position to try and negotiate a better interest rate on any of their cards? I have some experience in doing this, so I can try and speak on their behalf if so.

2. Emergency funds. Is it worth it in their case? Or should the be fully committing to paying off the credit cards, And if an emergency pops up just put the expense on one of the cards ?

Overall I just need some advice on how to tackle this. Any help would be extremely appreciated. I'll answer any questions needed in the comments.",finance
Bitcoin,Pricing futures: maybe a little theory will calm you down.,"So I noticed that there is some panic around the upcoming BTC futures and no good reason for it. Why? Because theory.

Before we start: I didn't come up with this theory, it's as textbook as theories get. If you want to get into this, I can recommend ""Options, Futures, and other Derivatives"" by John C. Hull, which is a very easy read. Some people find it too colorful/long-winded, but I think it's great for non-mathematicians. Everything below is covered in the first five chapters. ^(The book has 36 chapters. Future contracts are actually quite basic.)

So let's get into it. ^(To keep the whole thing neat, I added a bunch of footnotes with details.)

*TL;DR: Skip to last section*

**What is a future contract?**

The purpose of a future contract is to shift risk. Since Andreas brought up this perfect example, let's run with it: A large-scale Bitcoin mining operation has monthly costs in USD. Salaries, electricity bills, rent, hardware maintenance, a leased Lambo... A staggering $300k per month. For simplicity, let's assume that they'll pay all of this at the same time and the next time they'll have to do this is in exactly one month. From experience, they know that they have an income of around 100 Bitcoin in the next month.

Where's the problem? 100 Bitcoin are worth $1.5M! Well, they are _right now_ and everybody that they have to pay doesn't give a damn about the price of Bitcoin, so this mining operation is absolutely screwed if the price of Bitcoin drops below $3k. The price of one Bitcoin is at $15k right now, so it seems pretty unlikely, but there is so much at stake that they are looking to reduce this risk.

One thing that they can do (starting Monday) is buy future contracts. The contracts allow them to fix the rate at which they can exchange their mined Bitcoin in one month. So they buy 20 contracts to sell 1 Bitcoin each for $15k each exactly one month from now. This will cover the expenses and they can keep the other 80 Bitcoin as profit.

Easy.^\[1\]

**You said BUY contracts**

Great, you're paying attention! Correct, these contracts have a price and this is where it gets interesting. In fact, I can tell you the exact price of one of these contracts:

$-14.27

Yes, the price of this contract is negative. So they have a _guaranteed buyer_ and they're even making money right off the bat? Absolutely. We'll find out where this price comes from and at the same time we'll learn how futures and the current price of Bitcoin are connected.

**Pricing a future contract**

The basic premise of this theory is that there are people who can borrow or lend arbitrary amounts of money for any length of time at one unified interest rate: the risk-free rate. This rate is called risk-free because the people who borrow this money have proven so reliable in the past or have such stable assets that you can be absolutely sure that they pay back the money that they owe. ^\[2\]

Ok, let's see what we can do if we can just borrow or lend money as we wish. Spoiler: it turns out that there is always a possibility to make free money if the price of the future is not exactly the one above. ^\[3\]

Assume that the price of the contract is nothing. Assume that I have one Bitcoin. For reference, we'll call this **Scenario A**. Here we go:

Action | Outcome
---|---
I sell my Bitcoin and get $15k. | I have $15k.
I ""sell"" the contract above to the Bitcoin miner. | I still have $15k and a promise to keep.
I lend the $15k at the risk-free rate for one month. | Nothing but promises now.
(one month later) | 
The loan is payed back with interest.| I have $15014.25k.^\[4\]
I buy the Bitcoin from the miner for $15k. | I have one Bitcoin and $14.25.

Look at that: I still have one Bitcoin, but $14.25 on top!

*Heh, okay, but I mean the miner is a dummy. This doesn't work the other way round.*

Oh, but it does. Assume that the price of the contract is -$28.50 (twice the original price). This time I'll start with absolutely nothing.

**Scenario B**:

Action | Outcome
---|---
I borrow the $15k at the risk-free rate for one month. | I have $15k and a promise to keep.
I buy one Bitcoin. | I have one Bitcoin and a promise to keep.
I ""buy"" the same contract as the miner. | I have $28.50, one Bitcoin and there are some promises.
(one month later) | 
I sell the Bitcoin for $15k. | I have $15028.50 and a promise left.
I pay back my loan. With interest that's $15014.25.^\[4\] | I have $14.25 left and no more promises.

^(In both scenarios I could actually set up the loans so that I would get my free money in the present, but that would make the numbers ugly)

**:thinking:**

That's right, I made money either way and both times it was exactly $14.25: the amount that the miner receives for the contract. I think at this point I don't have write down any formulas for you to believe me that if the price of the contract deviates in any direction by $X, someone can make $X for free.

You probably noticed that the $14.25 came from the risk-free interest rate that that is payed for $15k when borrowed for one month. That is precisely the point. It has absolutely nothing to do with the price of bitcoin. Both prices are interlocked. Bitcoin goes down, future goes down with it. Future goes up, Bitcoin goes up.

**So then how can the banks destroy Bitcoin by shorting it?**

Okay, let's first settle what ""short"" and ""long"" mean:

Long | Short
---|---
A long position is a situation where you _want_ an asset. So if currently hodl Bitcoin, you have a long position. If you need to exchange USD for BTC in the future, you would make a _long_ future contract. | A short position is the opposite: want to _get rid_ of an asset. The miner is _shorting_ Bitcoin.

Supply and demand allow you to change the price of an asset by buying or selling it. If you sell a large amount of Bitcoin at whatever the highest bidder will offer, the price will fall. If you buy a large amount of Bitcoin, the price will rise.

If you don't have a large amount of Bitcoin - ""only"" lots of money, there is only action that you can take: buy Bitcoin. This will change Monday. The price of Bitcoin and its future are interlocked, but individually driven by supply and demand. The interlocking is ensured by people exploiting the scenarios above, so-called *arbitrageurs*.

So the theory is that there are entities with lots of money who want to destroy Bitcoin. The proposed way of doing this is _selling_ lots of future contracts (shorting Bitcoin). According to the argument above, the price of Bitcoin should go down with it right? Does it tho...

One thing is certain: Any arbitrageur can exploit scenario B. All you that you need is the ability to borrow money. This means that the price of futures can never exceed a certain level above the current price of Bitcoin. Reversely, the price of Bitcoin can never lie under a certain level below the price of the futures. This means that the futures can _drive up_ the price of Bitcoin.

The reverse is not certain. An arbitrageur who wants to exploit scenario B needs to hold Bitcoin.^\[5\] An arbitrageur who exploits scenario B also _ends up with Bitcoin_. Since you can't sell your Bitcoin while you're bound by the loan and the future contract, you're basically forced to hodl while making a bit of cash on the side. So if you actually enable a low future price to drive down the current price of Bitcoin, you end up damaging the value of the asset you're hodling.

What this means is that we could actually see the price of the future contracts trade below it's theoretic price. So worst case: the miners / merchants don't get the predictability we're all hoping for - or at a very high price.

**So what will happen?**

You probably noticed that future contracts are pretty cheap. So maybe people will jump on the opportunity to get BTC at low prices in the future and drive up the current price? Well, no... You could also simply borrow money right now and buy some Bitcoin right away. That would have the exact same effect as buying long futures. But are you really _that_ sure that the price will go up? Are you willing to risk being in debt to your bank for years? Didn't think so...

So, unless big players start to freak over nothing, not much will actually happen.

So much for my two cents. Let's hear yours!

---

^\[1\] ^(This is only one form of future contract. Bitcoin futures will be settled in cash, meaning that the difference between the agreed-upon price and the actual price on that date will be settled in USD. No actual coins will be moved. You can also fork over the cash upfront. However, you'll see in a bit that this doesn't make a difference.)

^\[2\] ^(The risk-free rate depends on where you are and since it is so important there is a lot of fuzz around it. It is _much_ lower than interest rates paid regular people.)

^\[3\] ^(So for the sake of argument we'll assume that there are no trading fees, spreads, transaction costs, nothing. In reality there are, but all they do is introduce some wiggle-room in the math, which has no effect on your life.)

^\[4\] ^(I just looked up the 1-month US treasury rate and found a quote from August, which was 1.14%. I think it's compounded semi-annually, but I just applied it as it if were compounded continuously, so 15000*exp[0.0114/12]=15014.25).

^\[5\] ^(One could argue that it is also possible to _borrow_ Bitcoin. However, it will only be lent by a party who believes that it will keep its value, which leads to the same conclusion. Also you'd have to consider the interest on the Bitcoin loan, which would surely be higher than the risk-free rate. This interest rate would, however, set a bound for the difference between current and future price.)",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Financial aid department canceled ~$10,000 in FAFSA package that was previously applied to my balance. Now I owe the school, not the govt. and cannot enroll in classes nor get my diploma until I come up with 10g. Advice?","In April of 2017, I submitted my FAFSA for the 2017-2018 financial aid year. During this process, I noticed that I was not given access the IRS Retrieval Tool to easily transfer my records, and knew this was going to cause me problems. I manually entered tax info (correctly), and my FAFSA was processed. 3 days later, I was informed I would need to do a FAFSA verification to determine everything was correct in my FAFSA. I had done this once before, and sort of knew the process. I knew I had to get on this because a request for verification temporarily puts a hold on your account at my school ...goodbye enrolling for those information systems courses :( I couldn't sign up for classes until it was done. Also when you are selected for verification, all of your financial aid gets canceled until you get cleared.

The problem was that I needed verification for the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 years. I have no idea why. Well, I got two emails (one about 16/17 and one about 17/18) ...but I didn't exactly realize I needed to do the verification for both years...it seemed like I was sent a redundant email. Anyway, I had to obtain a tax transcript from the IRS, which is easy to do online if you have a credit card, mortgage, or car loan. I had none of these things at the time. Since I couldn't do this online, it took 2 weeks to get the transcript. When I figured out I needed the one for the other year, another 2 weeks went by. 

Occupied with finals, I submitted my verification information on May 15, the Monday after the last week of the spring semester. And here's where it gets bad. According to my fin aid adviser: ""Since we did not receive your Verification documentation by the end of the spring term, we will not be able to re-post your 16/17 loans. The last day to post those loans was Friday, and the loans can’t originate after the semester is over.""

The 2016/2017 package was about 15 grand (grant + loans) I think, and the financial aid dept was somehow able to cancel all my federal loans. One question I have is how were they able to do this, since I was the one who's name is on the loans?! 

The financial aid adviser said the best course of action was to get a private student loan, then hope that I get a lot of money from FAFSA for the next year to pay back the private lender...

On the plus side, I did receive all of my financial aid for fall 2017 and I got a refund, it wasn't automatically applied to the past-due balance.

I felt completely betrayed by the school, and the worst part is that I'm a senior with only 7 credit hours left. Actually, the worst part is that my job is at the university and is my source of rent/utilities/etc and requires me to be enrolled at this university. No, it's not work-study but that is their policy. It's ok I guess because I don't want to work with the place that's screwed me over, but I wanted to keep this job until I got out. I can take classes elsewhere and transfer them, but wont get my degree until I pay them 10 grand. And, I don't have a full time job lined up that will allow me to pay that back anytime soon. Currently, I can put on my resume that I have completed my major (which is true), and in the future I can say I completed my degree, just I wont have a diploma. 

Of course it's very late to be posting this, but I've been so spiteful of the university (mainly because there was no notice that the verification had to be before spring semester ended) that I could not get myself to deal with this issue anymore. I just feel like there's got to be a way to reinstate those loans or that someone should be fired for not letting students know about the deadline or that something they did was illegal. 

List of issues:

* I owe 10 grand to a university 
* I can't enroll in classes or receive an official transcript or my diploma
* Since I can't enroll, the 7000 for next spring can't be used (no classes means no fed fin aid)
* I must find a new job because I'm no longer enrolled

I assume bad things will happen if I don't pay them, but I don't know when these things might occur.  I'm currently working on getting a full-time job and I've signed up for classes at a nearby school, with the intention of paying off my debt eventually. Advice?",finance

personalfinance,Pay down credit cards or private student loan,"Hi everyone,

This is my first time here, so please let me know if this post is inappropriate. 

So here are the basics. I have about 28k in credit card debt (mostly made from emergency situations) and 28k in student loan. My parents have been generous enough to give me enough for my student loan, but have told me that I may pay off either. I'm 31 and I want to get out of debt asap so I can get some savings. I live an apartment and don't have any outstanding mortgage.

I'm not sure if I should be paying off my CC's or my loan, but quite a few of my credit cards are in collections due to my inability to pay them. I have three credit cards that I'm current on and seven total accounts. 

The two major ones that I have (and am current on) have around 8-9k each on them, and I pay the minimum every month. (Which of course gets me nowhere.) I'm charged around $130 a month and I pay in $200-$215 for each. My credit cards overall have 18-22% interest rates.

With the student loan on the other hand, I pay in $244.29 where $191.97 goes to interest and $52.32 to principal.

I make around $2500 a month, with $600 going to rent, $150 to transport, $110 to cell, around $150 for utilities, $250 to a small personal loan, $64 to company expenses, and I use about $200 on food. My partner helps take care of $200 of the credit bills each month.

A lot of the time I go over budget on food and transportation.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!

gaming,Destiny 2 backlash,"I'm a little taken aback by the response to the first DLC for Destiny 2. If anyone purchased the game thinking it'd be different than Destiny 1 as far as DLC goes then I don't think you did enough research. It doesn't take much to figure out that they had the same business model as before. We were shown 2 DLCs in the season pass just like before. There is somewhat of a pay wall, but not really because you can still use the gear from the DLC if you don't own the expansion. All I'm seeing so far is that you can't play the prestige versions of events. I can't say much about that because I'm not into prestige events anyway. But, like in Destiny 1, old content is buffed to match the newest high levels.

Maybe due to this whole EA incident, which I think was a terrible business model, we all feel the need to start a revolution (obviously not literally) against anyone who doesn't meet our needs in the gaming industry. I hope everyone's ready for the rise of Indie games because that's all we're going to get if we stop giving big budgeted businesses our money. Destiny 2's budget definitely shows, I just believe we are spoiled.

Budget Adjustment 1: OK Made some changes to the budget. Cancelled Amazon subscriptions and the Busch Gardens Passes... they let me out of them. Found out that I can cut my toll down to 2 dollars a day with an easy pass so it cuts my toll to 40$ a month. Cell phones are $90 in straight talk, not 120. I had that number wrong. My electric bill right now is 130 +120 Past due for 250 so I adjusted the numbers. I will be making more adjustments as we go along and I get a better picture.

Budget Adjustment 2: After looking over our food costs for the previous 2 months 600/month is far more accurate. I have also decreased our pet budget from 150 to 100.   


EDIT 2: I would like to thank everyone for their support so far as well as add a bit more backstory. It is unfortunate I am in the financial spot we are in. I myself have been very bad with my spending habits even prior to my injuries... it got much worse afterward. Depression and poverty can lead to poor financial decisions. Short-term gains for long-term suffering etc. These are my first steps really into thinking about our long-term financial plan. 

Second, moving again may be the right move financially, however, we do still have 18 months left on our lease (we signed a 2-year lease.) Not sure if getting out of it would be easy or what the financial penalties would be. I have considered speaking with our property manager about lowering the rent due to our predicament. Additionally, we have moved 9 times(due to military, injuries, different jobs) in the last 8 years, the only thing constant in our lives has been instability. Also, we live in Chesapeake (50 miles from my job) because of the schools for my daughter, who is in 3rd grade and has a learning disability. Her dance and gymnastics are really where she is drawing her confidence from. Additionally, we have absolutely 0 outside assistance. No family or friends in the area, and have never had any help financially from family at all. 

I am currently a full-time student and I work full time. My wife having a part-time job IS an option but with the way our schedule is right now I am not sure it would add much or we would be able to keep up with that for long before becoming burnt out. 

Unfortunately, my money philosophy stems from growing up in foster care and poverty, and I have brought that into adulthood, for some reason I am in constant survival mode...Is as if my bank account always gravitates around 0 no matter how much money I make. I am only now trying to figure out our long-term plan (due to necessity) and it is causing somewhat of a crisis in me. I probably would have been one of those folks who hit the lottery and was broke in 5 years. Changing 30 years of habits, my view of money, and organization will be the most difficult here. My biggest fear is ending up in poverty like the majority of our family.  My wife is on board with what needs to be done. 

How does anyone feel about consumer credit counseling? Also, I will get approx 9500 back on my income tax return in February. Additionally, we HAVE paid off over 15,000 in debt over the past 3 years. 12,000 in Military star cards and 3,000 in DFAS overpayment. 

Again any books to read, apps to use, or advice was given is well taken. Every journey begins with the first step. Thank you all. I dream of becoming debt free and owning assets.

MAJOR UPDATE: So... I found out today that there is a 7,500 delinquency debt threshold. Meaning if you carry over 7,500 in delinquent debt you are deemed unfit for federal employment and disqualified. This is major, up until this point I was trying to come up with a plan to pay down my debt over time, now I realize I have to, at a minimum, cut my debt in half essentially right now. To even be deemed qualified to maintain employment. Any suggestions?? I'm in full panic mode.",finance

2: My Fiancee has a similiar score, will getting married affect it at all?

3: Should I get multiple credit cards and buy little on each? or just 1 major one

4: I am looking to get a car in a few months, and I dont know what a good interest rate would be? Will a bigger down payment mean a lower interest rate? Or should I put down a grand or two? ( Sorry, my dad passed away recently and I dont have anyone to really help me with this)

investing,Saxo Bank 2018 Outrageous Predictions,"Saxo Bank 2018 Outrageous Predictions

2018 will be a true roller coaster ride compared to an outrageously placid 2017

Saxo Bank, the online multi-asset trading and investment specialist, has today released its 10 'Outrageous Predictions' for 2018. The predictions focus on a series of unlikely but underappreciated events which, if they were to occur, could send shockwaves across financial markets.

While these predictions do not constitute Saxo’s official market forecasts for 2018, they represent a warning of a potential misallocation of risk among investors who typically see just a one percent likelihood to these events materialising.

Commenting on this year’s Outrageous Predictions, Chief Economist at Saxo Bank, Steen Jakobsen said:

“We have published Outrageous Predictions for more than 10 years and think this year’s list is one of the best we ever had, encouraging everyone to think outside the consensus box. It is important to underline that the Outrageous Predictions should not be considered Saxo’s official market outlook, it is instead the events and market moves deemed outliers with huge potentials for upsetting consensus views.”

Head of FX Strategy, John J. Hardy, who lead the project this year, commented:

""A year ago, many thought 2017 would prove a volatile year, given the seemingly impossible rise of Trump and the shock of Brexit. Instead, we got a year of outrageously smooth sailing that inflated risky assets the world around with nary a storm. But in 2018 we see the pendulum swinging back in favour of pronounced volatility risks as the irony of long periods of quiet and complacency in asset markets is that they sow the seeds for future volatility as investors underestimate tail risks and overleverage their bets on a continuation of the cycle.”

“That being said, our predictions this year aren’t just about market crash concerns. We wax outrageous on everything from major central banks losing their policy mojo and a new political crisis in the EU, to China eroding the US dollar's reserve currency status and a new political spring welling up in southern Africa. We may or may not get any of these right but that isn't the point. Rather, our task here is to stimulate debate and thought on what outrageous direction things may head at major inflection points like those that 2018 will inevitably bring. “

The [Outrageous Predictions 2018 publication is available here](https://www.home.saxo/campaigns/outrageous-predictions-2018) and the full list of Saxo Bank’s Outrageous Predictions for 2018 reads:

1. The Fed loses independence as the US Treasury takes charge
Both the Republicans and Democrats vie for an increased share of the populist vote as we head into 2018 mid-term elections, with budget discipline entirely absent and GOP tax cuts bringing a massive revenue shortfall which will worsen as US heads into recession. The weak economy and the higher interest rates and inflation will leave the Fed with no answer on monetary policy. The Fed becomes a scapegoat for the economy’s weak performance, a bond market in turmoil and worsening inequality. The Treasury takes on emergency powers and forces the central bank to cap US government yields to 2.5% on long bonds to prevent a bond market meltdown, a policy which was last in place in the immediate aftermath of World War II.

2. Bank of Japan forced to abandon yield curve control
The Bank of Japan’s policy of yield curve control depends on soft global interest rates and low yields, and in 2018 this centre will simply not hold. As inflation rises, yields too will spike, and the result will be a fantastical plunge in the yen. Ultimately, the central bank will need to resort to QE-style measures, but not before USDJPY hits 150, after which it rapidly devalues to 100.

3. China rolls out the Petro-Renminbi
China is by far the largest oil importer, and many producer nations are already more than happy to transact in yuan terms. With the US’ global power and reach waning, and given the success of CNY-based commodity futures in general, the Shanghai International Energy Exchange’s decision to launch a yuan-based crude oil future is a runaway success. The introduction of the petro-yuan sees CNY appreciate more than 10% versus the dollar, taking the USDCNY rate below 6.0 for the first time ever. 

4. Volatility spikes after flash crash in stock markets
World markets are increasingly full of signs and wonders, and the collapse of volatility seen across asset classes in 2017 was no exception. The historic lows in the VIX and MOVE indices are matched by record highs in stocks and real estate, and the result is a powder keg that is set to blow sky-high as the S&amp;P 500 loses 25% of its value in a rapid, spectacular, one-off move reminiscent of 1987. A whole swathe of short volatility funds are completely wiped out and a formerly unknown long volatility trader realises a 1000% gain and instantly becomes a legend.

5. US voters go hard left in 2018 election
Changing demographics in the US which already has the under-35 millennials in place as a larger cohort than the post-war baby boomers will have a dramatic impact on politics in 2018. The general revulsion of younger voters for Trump’s persona, the widening inequality gap aggravated even further by the Republicans’ cynical tax reform, and a new breed of Democratic candidates who are unafraid to tap into Sanders-style populism from the left sees millennials turning out in droves at the polls in November. The Democrats pull the debate away from tax reform to spending stimulus for the masses. True populism means breaking out the chequebook for the 90%, and that means fiscal stimulus, deficits be damned. US 30-year Treasury yields rip beyond 5%.

6. Austro-Hungarian empire threatens EU takeover
The divide between old core EU members and the more sceptical and newer members of the bloc will widen to an impassable chasm in 2018 and for the first time since 1951, Europe’s political centre of gravity will shift from the Franco-German couple to CEE. The EU’s institutional blockage does not take long to worry financial markets. After spiking to new highs versus the G10 and many EM currencies by late in 2018, the euro rapidly weakens towards parity with USD.

7. Bitcoin is thrown to the wolves
Bitcoin peaks in 2018 above $60,000 and with a market capitalisation of over $1 trillion as the advent of the Bitcoin futures contract in December 2017 leads to a groundswell of involvement by investors and funds that are more comfortable trading futures than tying up funds on cryptocurrency exchanges. Before long, however, the Bitcoin phenomenon finds the rug torn out from under it as Russia and China move deftly to sideline and even prohibit non-sanctioned cryptocurrencies domestically. After its spectacular peak in 2018, Bitcoin crashes and limps into 2019 close to its fundamental “production cost” of $1,000.

8. Southern African Spring sees South Africa blossom
In 2018, after a surprising turn of events, a wave of democratic transition spreads across sub-Saharan Africa. The forced resignation of Zimbabwe’s long-term president Robert Mugabe at the end of 2017 triggers a wave of political change in other African countries. South Africa’s Jacob Zuma is forced out of power and Congo’s Joseph Kabila faces unprecedented demonstrations pushing him to flee the country. South Africa, however, is the main winner as the ZAR becomes the EM darling and returns 30% against the G3 currencies. It brings the world’s strongest rates of growth in South Africa and satellite frontier economies of the region.

9. Tencent topples Apple as market cap king
China, still the world’s most populous country and one with a rapidly rising standard of living, is opening up its capital markets and its reform programmes are driving a rise in investor sentiment. This is particularly evident in Chinese technology stocks with market leader Tencent’s shares rocketing 120% higher in 2017. In late 2017, Tencent moved into the global top five in market cap terms, nearing $500 billion and even eclipsing Facebook at one point. In 2018, though, Tencent leaves the other giants in the dust with its shares advancing another 100% despite the company’s already enormous size , stealing the world market cap crown from Apple at well above $1 trillion.

10. It’s their time – women crash the glass ceiling
Over the last generation, women have started achieving higher education levels than men, with US universities now graduating some 50% more women than men at the bachelor’s degree level. Women also now comprise nearly half of all business graduates. And yet in 2017, only 6.4% of the CEOs in the Fortune 500 list are women – though on average they earn more than their male peers. 
Change is coming – not because it is “fair”, but for the practical reason that women realising their desired potential is the last way left to grow the pie without growing the population in our low-productivity and aging developed economies. In 2018, the chauvinist old boys’ clubs are shaken to their core by shareholders and a woman occupies the top spot at more than 60 Fortune 500 companies by the end of the year.",finance
personalfinance,TFSA Transfers. Should I move my money or not?,"I'm from Canada,
I have 17 000 in a TFSA with CIBC. I turned 18 in 2012. 
It is nearing the year of the calendar year. I withdrew 10,000 from my TFSA in 2017 so far. 
I noticed that Tangerine has slightly better interest rates than CIBC. I am thinking about moving the 17,000 into a TFSA at Tangerine. 
Seeing that it is near the end of the year, would it make sense to withdraw the 17,000 from CIBC and move it over to Tangerine? My understanding is that withdraws from a TFSA in 2017 would not impact my ability to withdraw penalty in 2018. 
I’m talking about moving it from the CIBC TFSA into a CIBC chequing and then onto Tangerine, not a direct TFSA to TFSA transfer.

personalfinance,Future Planning,"Hello PF!

I'm hoping to get advice (planning, and if needed- tough love) on some major future life decisions. My wife and I are both young professionals (29) and are looking to eventually move into a new home of our own and start a family. I know all those things cost big time money, and while we're comfortable I want to make sure we're on the right track and have realistic goals. 

Personal information:
- 51k in student loans remaining, highest interest rate 3.7%. Monthly payments $1071 (refinanced into shortest term, lowest interest). Paying $3100 minimum monthly.

- My income: 76k with 10-20% bonus, realistic potential for raise to ~90k in March. I do a few PT jobs as well to throw extra $ directly at loans, average ~400/mo. 
- Her income: 55k with ~10% bonus. 
- 401ks up to company match (6% and 4%)
- 21k in low risk investments, hoping to use this towards future down payment. 
- Her car: 260/mo, 9k remaining.
- My car: 310/mo, lease up in April. Will likely buy it outright at 48 mo / ~300/mo terms
- Rent: 1450/mo not including utilities (250-300 for essentials, plus 95 for cable/internet)

Using unbury.us, if we hold off on any of the big time purchases and our income situation stays exactly the same, we will be out of debt by May 2019. Factoring in any raises, side hustle, or bonuses will probably put us closer to early 2019 or even into 2018.  Both our jobs are very stable right now and if needed we could shift more into an E-fund vs. paying down the remaining debt. 

We've been paying off debt as fast as possible, but I know if we actually were to start looking at a house we would need to build up a significant E-fund. From what I've read on the wiki and using online calculators, our rent payment far exceeds what we'd be able to find in a house even including taxes. Even a 250-300k house (which would be more than we'd need in our area) would be less expensive than our current rent.

My question for PF is this:
I know the financially prudent decision is to pay off 100% of our debts, build a big down payment and E-fund (~summer 2019), AND THEN proceed with the housing and family planning items. Given the above situation, does it make sense to move on any of those items earlier (specifically housing)? Are these realistic goals in the first place? I want to hold off on a kid for a couple years until we're farther along financially - the associated cost there is really intimidating to me! Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Keep renting a 2 bedroom apartment ; or buy a house (EU / BE),"I'm 36, single, Belgian, and have been saving for a down-payment for years with the intent of buying a house. House prices have risen considerably for all these years, so plans to buy were postponed until the down-payment and mortgage turned financially feasible. I think that moment has arrived, but would like your perspective on the matter.

I earn about €42k gross / €25k after taxes (or €2100 a month). I currently rent very cheap for 415€ a month (excluding utilities). I got lucky on that front because the rent was not indexed in the first 10 years. It got indexed about seven years ago, so that means I pay around 2% extra each year. That means my rent is very very cheap for living in/near a university city in Belgium. A similar 2 bedroom apartment usually goes for €700-€750 minimum. I'm also lucky on the commute aspect, since my work is a short 15 minute walk away. I don't own a car, never have, always use public transport. 

I have currently build savings worth €85k. The type of house I would like to own goes for €200k minimum (my minimum requirements are a yard &amp; central heating). There's nothing cheaper on the market and if there is, it means renovation costs will bring the total sum to €200k anyway. Tax wise &amp; mortgage/notary cost wise, I should add 10% to the house price to get the total figure. I should add that houses that go for these prices are no longer a 15 minute walk from my work. It either means buying a car since it would be 20 to 30km from work. Or possibly commuting by bicycle if it's closer to 7km. The variation in this buys me a larger yard / larger house. And while a longer commute is not something I look forward too, car ownerships does look attractive to me.

So all that means I could get a 20 year mortgage for €725 a month, with a €65k down-payment (1.75% interest rate; €147k loan). With my €2100 a month salary, that should be feasible since it's exactly 1/3rd of my income. Owning a house comes with higher costs, but also tax benefits. My current €80 a year fire/damage insurance would go up to about €300 a year. I would be obliged to take another €200 a year (debt-saldo) insurance for 13 years long. And I expect utilities to go up as well. The higher taxes are nullified by the tax benefits of house ownership. I'd possibly even earn back the higher insurance costs. 

So my question is: how stupid is it for me to buy instead of keep renting? I would pay more to live further away from work. I should - with some error margin for safety - expect €400 to €500 higher costs per month (€300 in mortgage / €100 to €200 in utilities and insurances). And possibly have to take into account higher transport costs as well. The financially smart decision is probably to keep renting; hope the housing market crashes and buy at that time. But I'm growing tired of living in an apartment, am annoyed by noisy neighbors and would love to have a yard/garden/maybe even a car.

On a penny-pinching/power-saving month I can save just over €1000 right now. Even with my strict budgeting &amp; power-saving skills, that will go down to €500 a month in case I buy a house. More realistically to a savings of €300 to €400 on average. I would still have €20k left in my emergency fund. Mostly to cover possible repairs and moving costs and worst-case scenario unemployment. But I could manage, right? And in 20 years, I would no longer have a mortgage/rent. 

I think I'm finally here. Financially ready to go for home ownership. But what are your thoughts? I'm still full of doubts. I know you can't help me answer my questions like ""will I cope with the longer commute"", ""how tired are you of your neighbors"", but I'm hoping for some outside perspective on my plans to buy and how financially feasible or stupid it is. 

My apologies for the broken English. Please ask if I can clarify something or if I should add a more detailed budget. I know I could post this in the EUpersonalfinance subreddit, but I'm sure I'll get more responses here due to the much larger activity and participation.",finance

btc,Any off-chain solutions like lightning network hubs and sidechains are bound to make Bitcoin centralized. This defeats the purpose of Bitcoin. Exchanges already scale via centralized databases. Off-chain solutions already exist.,"Bitcoin Core has no way to guarantee that the Lightning Network will be decentralized. Sidechain solutions also all rely on centralized, permissioned systems. 

I've observed that people pushing the LN or Sidechains are either new users that have been misled or old users that are misleading others because they plan to run a centralized hub/sidechain to steal fees from the network. 

For anyone who disagrees, please point me to a working sidechain implementation that is not a federated/permissioned system. Federated/permissioned might as well be a centralized database. The LN has no working and safe plan for routing that cannot be gamed in order to steal user funds; on-chain settlement will become too expensive to revert those stolen funds.

Bitcoin Core supporters cry ""decentralization"" about blocksize increases, but totally ignore that same criticism when it relates to the settlement system they are building. It doesn't work. It's not what people signed up for.

Just with the above knowledge, it becomes obvious that the blocksize debate is not even about the safety of blocksize increases, which Bitcoin Core developers used to support. That was a complete distraction. Instead, it's about control over Bitcoin's protocol in order to funnel transactions through bank-owned systems.

For new users: this is why Bitcoin Cash exists.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Few questions.,"Hey everyone I've got 2 questions, I'll try to explain as much as possible. Years ago I took a bad loan on a vehicle. High interest rate (23%) on a used vehicle. I've learned quite a bit since then, and havent defaulted on it. So I owe $5200 left which will be paid off January of 19'. 

Should I try to refinance the vehicle or just keep making the payments ($457/mo)? I currently don't have a problem making the payments, but the extra $450 a month would help saving for a home. Which leads the the second question. 

I'll make $48k this year and I'm looking for a home in the $40-60k range here in the Detroit area. I don't need nor want anything fancy. Just a yard for the dog. Should I wait another year or so until I have the 20% down or try to get down payment assistance? My state has a program they offer up to $7,500 and it's paid back upon selling or paying off your home.",finance
personalfinance,Just wrapping up medical school and looking for financial advice,"Hey guys, so I'm in the last year of medical school and getting ready to wrap everything up.  I took an Air Force scholarship that covered my tuition and school expenses ($60,000 per year for tuition, $25,000 per year for living expenses) but I still needed to take out additional school loans to cover living costs since I have a wife and 2 young kids.  

All in all, I have roughly $35,000 in federal student loans at 6.8% interest and payments have been deferred until I graduate.  Apart from that, we own my wife's car and I owe $14,000 on my car at 0% interest (loan from family member).  We also have a mortgage on a townhome that we are selling in the next couple days.  We're looking to make $46,000 from selling it.

I'm not sure where to go from here.  As far as priorities go, I want to pay off the $14,000 for my car since I don't like borrowing money from family.  $2,000 to $3,000 of the money will go towards work that needed to be done on the townhome prior to selling.  $5,000 or so will go towards misc. expenses.  I'm going to be left with $25,000 or so and wonder what I should do with it.

As far as my student loans go, I have 3 options.  1) Pay the minimum necessary and plan on paying them off over a long period of time.  I'm not sure what the payments would be per month, or how long it'd take to pay them off, but most of my classmates that didn't take a Military scholarship have $300,000 in student loans (at least) and plan on making the minimum payment over the course of their careers as doctors.  2) I can use a USAA Career Starter loan at 2.9% interest over 5 years to pay off the majority, if not all of my student loans.  I believe I'd be paying something like $550 per month for 5 years and then they'd be paid off at a lower interest rate.  3) Take the $25,000 or so leftover from selling our townhome and throw it at my student loans.  It'd pay off the lion's share and I'd be left with $10,000 or so that I could pay off with the USAA loan and have a significantly smaller payment over 5 years.

After graduating, I'll be heading to a 4 year medical residency with the Air Force where I'll be looking to make roughly $75,000 per year.  My wife has a part-time job as a nurse where she will make $25,000 or so, so we're looking to make around $100,000 per year for the next 4 years, afterwhich my pay will go up quite a bit.

We'd like to buy a house when I move for residency and were looking to spend between $200,000 - 250,000.  I don't know if it'd be better to save the $25,000 for a down payment, but I'm planning on getting the mortgage through a VA loan which doesn't require any money down to purchase a house.

So, use the money we get from selling our townhome to pay down my student loans, or use it as a down payment for a house?  Would it be worth investing somewhere instead?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.",finance

SURPRISE! I had no idea these existed, and she apparently doesn't know (or isn't telling me) much about them. The current balance is somewhere in the neighborhood of $4,000. There is not much information on the annual report that I have, but it does list my wife as the ""annuitant.""the plan is listed as ""90 FPA - flexible premium deferred annuity."" Apparently, she says her grandpa set the account up for her when she was born, and she gets these statements every year but does nothing with them. From the looks of it, this account has a guaranteed base interest rate of 4%. So, I have several questions:

For starters, what is this account? Is it like a regular bank account that we can have access to at any time?

Can we add money too this account? 4% is a great interest rate, especially if it's guaranteed. 

If we can add money too this account, is it considered a stable investment?

The interest accrued last year was a bit over $150. Do we need to be paying taxes on this every year, or is it only when the money is accessed? 

Also, any other general advice or information would be appreciated. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,debt management plan - take the plunge?,"Hi, everyone. 

I'm having a hard time.  In 2011, I went to graduate school full time and left the full time working word and really racked up some CC debt. I already has some but I used loans and CC to finance a move, etc. 

My credit cards are at about 27k. There are 5 major cards that have about 5k/piece.  Most of the interest rates are from 13%-20%. 

I decided to start fostering a child and didn't have interest in adopting him, but now I'm going to. His daycare expense is almost $800/month. I will start paying that in the new year. I'm also going to lose the per diem that I was receiving from the state -which was about $700/month. 

I make ~2000/mo. Currently about $1200 go to CCs, $100 for phone, $300 for car payment, $100 car insurance, $180 student loans. 

Housing and utilities are included in my compensation for my job. 

I'm considering a debt management plan. I don't know anyone that has done it and haven't talked to the yet. 

I'm hoping to get a new job. It will of course give the opportunity for a higher salary but comes with regards burden of finding a new living situation for me and my 2 y/o. I'm applying like crazy. 

I have about $10k is saving. I had really wanted to use that money for a down payment to purchase a home. 

If I do a debt management plan for my CCs - will it make it impossible for me to get a mortgage in the near future? 

What can I expect as a payment for a debt management plan?

personalfinance,Apparently I don't understand credit card interest!,"I'm 34 years old and generally very fiscally responsible, but I'm paying interest on my credit card this month for the first time ever (had $3,000 in unexpected vet bills last month!) and I'm now realizing I don't understand how it's calculated.  My last statement came out on Nov 9 and the due date was Nov 30, here's what has happened since then:

* Balance as of Nov 9	 $2,909.68 
* Balance at Nov 30	 $2,814.33

* Payment Nov 15 - $1,000

My interest rate is 5.97%.  I would have thought that I would be charged interest on the balance that hadn't been paid by the due date.  So the total balance on statement date was $2,909.68, I paid $2,000.00 so I pay interest on the $909.68.

Obviously that's not how it's calculated because the interest I was charged is $17.54.  I've done a bit of reading and I understand the interest can compound daily, but I still don't get it. Can someone explain this to me?",finance
Bitcoin,Older gentleman threatened to get violent with me for mentioning Bitcoin too much at a banquet,"The man wasn't a bad person, I just think I touched a nerve. Bitcoin's been in the headlines lately, and last week I made more in a single week off of bitcoin, than I have in my entire life. It's sort of the talk of the town now that more people have heard of it.

So I was at a banquet for people at a British Sportscar Club. Mostly older people, baby boomers, I was probably the only person there in my 30's. 

When people ask what I do, well I told them I've been getting into bitcoin lately and doing well off of it, particularly in these past 30 days. I got other things going on in life, like I'm trying to get a Class A CDL (namely to buy more bitcoin lol).

So we were talking about bitcoin, and how I see the price getting into the 6 figures maybe someday, and possibly even in the 7 figures way way off in the future.

Well I mentioned it to the gentleman on my right, and he was upset over it and said ""If you say one more thing about bitcoin, I'm going to knock you out of your chair.""

I don't think the man is a bad person, he later apologized. But the room is full of Baby boomers, and IMO, I think bitcoin could become the largest paradigm shift in the American economy, and maybe the world economy, since the FED was created in 1913. To me Bitcoin is a major shift in both how investing and currency will be done in the near future. 

And older investors aren't use to that. They're use to stable investments giving 10-20% yearly returns on average as their ""high risk investments"" and stable investments paying out a 5% dividend, and that's been the path to wealth all their life. A lot of our bitcoin threads would probably get us banned from r/personalfinance.

Bitcoin throws that crap out the window. People are running to bitcoin, I alone have turned almost a 300% profit on my first bitcoin and I only got in, in late September.

I think bitcoin is offensive to these older investors, they saved well, invested in solid companies, and gradually got wealthy over the course of their lifetimes, and then they see the bitcoin crowd turning out multiple 100% returns in a matter of months, so that's my theory, and my mom's theory for why the man really did not want to hear me talk about bitcoin anymore.

And to be fair to him, from hence forth we had a nice dinner conversation at the banquet, I just didn't touch on bitcoin anymore.",cryptocurrency

I'm a 25yo(m) Automotive Technician (mechanic) in MN making ~$30k a year.  I have an ASE certification, but no formal education after HS Diploma, all on-the-job training, but I now have 6 years experience.
I currently get $25/hr plus 2% of my gross monthly sales for service and parts.  BUT, I'm doing the work of a mechanic, service writer, parts runner, and shop maintenance, so I'm only billing 20-25 hours a week, and working 60+.  No real change to this situation at this job in the near future, been living paycheck to paycheck almost all of these 6 years.
I owe $6877.62 at 19% APR to Snap-On credit for my toolbox, $50 a week payment, the shop has been paying for me (no strings) every other week, all other tool accounts are paid up.  (Yes, I know it was a dumb decision and a stupid interest rate, but spilt milk and all that, plus I use it every day and I'll never need another one, it was also half off retail...)
I have a CapitalOne Platinum with a $500 limit at 25% APR, almost maxed, $25 min payment, which I have been making.  (Again, dumb decision, but first CC.)
Due to not previously having any credit, and these 2 decisions, my score is currently 595.
$675 a month for rent, all-inclusive except for coin laundry.
$130 a month for car/motorcycle insurance, looking to lower and add my truck back on, which has been sitting for a couple months, but I own all 3.
$80 a month for cell service, phone is paid for.
$20 a month for Netflix and GooglePlay.
The rest of my finances/spending habits are a complete shit show, I have used YNAB in the past, and I plan to again after I'm settled from the move, but I spend way too much on eating out, video games, and other unecessary crap.  My savings account is empty, my checking account is about $450 in the hole, and I owe the pawn shop $120 by the end of the month for one of my tools, if I want it back.  I have a little over $200 cash.

Here's where I'm going to be;
Got an offer from one of my current bosses to go with him and our sales guy to a dealership in CO.  Leave mid-January.  After I take the certification tests for this dealer (which I'm doing online right now), I'll be making $27/hr, with only a mechanics responsibilites.  The mechanics working there now are working 40-50 hours a week, billing 80+ hours a week, have been making $80k+ a year.  They offered a relocation package of $1500 at 30, 60, and 90 days ($4500 total).
Rent will be ~$1700 (~$850 my cost) a month, all inclusive, split between me and the sales guy for a 2 bed 2 bath less than 10 minutes from the dealership.  I have already paid for Dec and Jan rent here, and I will get my $500 security deposit back (already talked about with landlady).  My boss will cover the up front moving costs with the understanding I pay him when I get the relocation package installments.  That will include gas, rental of a trailer or truck, first months rent, and security deposit, which should total ~$2500.
I will get 3 more paychecks from my current job, totaling roughly $2500, and only need to pay insurance, phone, and food with them.  I obviously need to fix my negative account, and then close my bank accounts here, the phone will stay as is for now, if I have the spare funds before I go I'll get my tool back.  I need to set up with a different insurance company as well.  There isn't anything else off the top of my head, but I'm sure I left SOMETHING out, so any thoughts or advice are greatly appreciated, let me know if you need more info.  Thanks again.",finance

Ripple,Where the XRP Holders End Up 9 year from now...,"Everyone has been asking me how much to invest in XRP lately.

Here is my short answer...

I tell them to get together 10,000xrp bare minimum. WHY?

Because you will make $100 for every cent XRP goes up till the day you die.

Just take a calulator;

10,000xrp x 0.25 = $2500
10,000xrp x 0.26 = $2600


When ripple becomes $100 per xrp four years from now...

10,000xrp x $100 = $1,000,000 (1 million)

So in worse case scenario if you only see ripple hit $10 in the next 4 years, your $2500 investment today would bring you $100,000.

But if you think xrp will some day be worth $1000 in 9 years, that $2500 investment you made today would bring you 10,000,000 (10 mill)


My long answer: 


Now imagine a group of banksters sitting on 100,000,000xrp today.  

Do you see the incentive for them to push this baby through and work together? 

Do you see why something is keeping the price stable till its accepted and ready to fly?

When Ben Bernanke; two terms Chairman of the Federal Reserve for the central bank of the United States came out for Swell, do you think it's possible him in a room full of Bankers don't realise this. 

These fucks know the more XRP they use the more filthy rich they become. 

So IMO thats why the price is still low.  

Once everyone is on-board the spaceship with their cheap ass XRP,  mission to launch to the fucken moon will commence.

So shut the fuck up and sit tight!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Helping parent with student loan.,"After finishing paying off my student loans a couple of months ago I started a conversation with my mother about the status of the loans she took out to help my sister and I with college. She originally took a total of $40k and $11k for my sister and I respectively, but for years wasn't making large enough payments to cover interest and the loan inflated. For the last two years she’s increased her payments and has started chipping away at the loan but I’d really like to help her so she’s not making payments for the rest of her life.

Current loan status: Federal consolidated loan with $60k reaming, 4.75% interest and $415 monthly payments with 226 months remaining. At the current rate of payment it will take $94k ($34k in interest) to pay off the loan.

I’d love to help her with this situation as efficiently as possible by at least paying off the portion of the loan attributed to myself. My sister is well off but her husband and her both have very large loans from graduate school and a new house, and can’t help contribute.

First, is there anything that can be done about the interest that accrued when she wasn’t making large enough payments? She claimed the loan company set up the payments for her originally, so it was a shock to her when she found out they weren’t enough to even cover interest. I know ignorance isn’t a good excuse and we’re probably out of luck here.

Second, any reason I shouldn’t gift my mother $14k to pay off a portion of the loan? If she continues to pay at the current rate she will pay about $14.5k less in interest if I pay off this portion now. I’ve also looked into income contingent repayment, but it doesn’t appear this would reduce her payments because her husband and her make about $80k/year total.",finance

personalfinance,How am I doing? 180k student loan debt - 130k income per year. What more or less could I be doing? Can I afford a home?,"Hello everyone. I've posted here in the past about my current financial situation. However, several things have changed and would like some guidance or input on what more (or less) I could be doing.



**Debt:**
I won't beat around the bush, I have a lot of student debt. At the start January of this year all of my loans went into repayment and paying back the 220k student debt. I have been paying it off pretty religiously each month and had been doubling my payments every month between February to about October ($5,000 each month) until I started my 401k. Up until recently I owed $180,000 dollars in federal loan student debt that are spread across 5 accounts ranging from 5.x%-6.x% through Navient (monthly payment: $2,125/month). I had done the snowball method up until about October. I knew I would not qualify for the federal loan incentives and have consolidated and refinanced my loans to a private lender at 180,000 @ 2.9% fixed rate over 15 years with the contingency that I bank with First Republic National Bank. My new monthly required payments are now $1,243/month for 15 years, but I plan to pay $2,000/month if not more. I'm not looking for a magic bullet. As with everything, it takes time. 



**Income/Debts/Savings etc:**
I currently am working a job making $63.50 an hour and I work between a stable 36-40h week with very little room for advancement. Our contract has us increase our pay rate to $66.00/h over the next 3 years. The job here is stable. From what I hear, new grads in my field are getting paid 5-10 dollars less per hour in a non-union job (and because of a flooded job market) so finding a new employer is currently out of the question. Let's just leave what I do at that as I'm worried people on here will find out who I am IRL. I had skipped a 401k since starting my job in January of 2017 and didn't start funding my 401k until about June/July of this year. I haven't a single clue with how my 401k works. I just selected a retirement date of 60ish? My current contribution is 25% and looks to be maxed by the end of December. My returns so far appear to be around 4% (good? bad?). As for next year, I expect my 401k to be maxed around end of August 2018 at its current rate.

My take home:
    Pre-401k: ~1800/wk
    Take home working 36H: $1150/wk
    Take home working 40H: $1250/wk
    Current 401k: ~$15,500

Emergency fund/Assets:
    Chase Banking account: $5,000
    Ally Savings: $14,000
    First Republic National Bank: $16,000 - I need to keep a larger amount here loan contract though I can maybe shuffle around the distribution a little.
   * Direct deposit: I put about $450 per week into my ally savings account, about 70 dollars into my Chase account and remainder into my FRNB account.

Debt: 
    Credit Card: No outstanding debt by the end of each month. ~200-300 a month total (Gas + Cell phone + random purchases money)
    Rent: None - Currently live with family rent free (I tried to offer to pay rent to family, but they declined and wouldn't accept my money)
    Car Payment: None - Paid off car long ago and runs reliably.



**Lifestyle:**
I live pretty frugally. I've tried my best to stray from lifestyle creep and successfully have done so thus far in my opinion. But here is the kicker: I have a single parent who has been diagnosed with cancer (stage 4). It has been in remission for the last few months, but who knows how long it will be like that. I just pray for longer than not. This parent is everything to me and I believe in familial piety. I would gladly bankrupt myself and eat cheap store bought ramen day in and day out to keep a smile on her face if medical bills ever got to that. Ever since being a child, single parent's dream has been to finally be able to afford a place of our own. Parent had a heartfelt talk with me before cancer was in remission and said that before their passing, parent would die happy if they saw me with a home. I feel like I may be able to give her that dream, however it is a race against the cancer clock. I live in a HCOL area where small homes/condos/townhomes are around 500K+.

What realistic changes could I be making? Is it possible to afford a home with my situation? Is there anything else short of buying bitcoin that I could do? I plan to see if I can refinance my loan again once I reach an arbitrary 100k mark. What general thoughts does PF have?",finance

So I done goofed and sent BTC from my Nano s to my Coinomi account with too little fee. I read about child pays for parent - method to fix this. 

So how do I actually do this? Is it enough if I just send more btc to my coinomi account with additional fee and and both of my transactions will get cleared after miner picks up the one with bigger fee? 

Thanks for help!",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,How can I invest internationally? (MENA),"Hi,

Most of the resources I've found on here are very thorough when it is US-based. However, I don't live in the US but in another region of the world where I can't seem to find much information.

A bit of background about myself: I am 22 years old, I am a fresh graduate but I am lucky enough have found a job in my industry immediately after finishing uni. I am earning about USD 4200 (give or take a few based on the exchange rate) a month which isn't too bad. I do track my expenses and set aside money for bills and other obligations I pay at a set amount each month (about USD 1100). I plan on moving on doing a one-year course in the future that will help me gain my qualification in my industry but this may have to be done overseas. Either way, it is very expensive. I may not have to pay for it if I get sponsored but it's always good to have a backup plan.

While I do want to enjoy the money I earn (I've got two big int'l trips next year), I want to look at investing money even if it's just a bit so that I can benefit off that in the long-run. I want to look at opening another account where I can start building my investment portfolio. I don't want to open one from a local bank in the city I currently live in as the minimum rates are way too high for what I earn. This is also that is also another dilemma I have for opening a savings account here (the minimum amount for the interest rates to be triggered is honestly just too much). I'll still open a savings account anyway since my mentality is: I can't spend what I don't see. I will be opening a small USD savings account in another country wherein I just put 500 USD a month. This should hopefully build up over time and I doubt I'll miss the money since I won't see it. 

Anyway, where should I open an account? All major international banks are in my city but I want to know which is the most accessible and flexible. I was thinking about citibank since they do have an investment account option but I'm not too sure. Do you guys have any suggestions on how I should go about this and any tips? I have am also currently going through the book Investing 101 by Michele Cagan to gain a better understanding of the whole topic. 

Thank you so much! I have been following this subreddit for ages now and this is what really drove me to create a budget even back when I was in university. I hope you guys can help!!",finance

BlockChain,Foundations for the new banking,"The answer to the banking crisis is building banks from scratch. Being rebuilt from zero, prepared for new environments, prepared for new economic models, prepared for new P2P networks, prepared for zero cost societies, prepared for freemium models, prepared for new commerce – says Salvador Casquero Algarra, Founding Partner &amp; Co-CEO in 2getherbank, in Bithub.pl’s #SundayInterview.

**What are the cardinal sins of traditional banking?**

**Salvador Casquero Algarra:** *Among many others, banks biggest mistake was forgetting their primary function: promoting economic activity. They were born to facilitate economic flow (production-distribution-consumption) but they perverted this function when they were allowed to freely create money through:
– finantial intermediation,
– credit creation and
– fractional reserve.*

*They forgot to keep trust, confidence and client protection as their key obligations. But instead of that, they move their focus, they change their essence towards two other purposes:
– speculative purposes, which is a zero sum game (if I make money someone is loosing it),
– consumption purposes that it is not sustainable as it cannot last forever and it is unfair one as part of the world has more than they need whereas more than a half is missing the basic.*

*The banks built their profitable business model on one underlying: interest rates and at the same time Central Banks were driving them towards 0 or below zero breaking bank models. As many other times crisis came but this time something was different.*

*Banking alternatives, called fintechs, starting to emerge as flexible, faster, cheaper, fair options that completely unbundled bank offering. Money issuing was democratized and not „stupid” money, but smart one and not non-backed money, but intrinsic value one: blockchain*

*Banks cannot compete in this new environment because they have not prepared their culture, their organizations mind for completely new economic models beyond the exhausted capitalism and they have not prepared their infrastructures, their legacy, for a kind of chaotic innovation as it comes from everywhere, from everyone, for everyone: people empowerment.*

*And to make things worse, banks are completely disconnected from society, from their final clients. Crisis led people to lose confidence on banks, they have their reputation on the floor.*

Bitcoin,Serious Question: Why Bitcoin?,"There are a lot of arguments on this sub about how and why blockchain will revolutionize currency and transactions. Frequently, however, a specific type (Bitcoin) is used as the argument instead of the underlying technology/premise. I'll apologize in advance if I use the wrong terminology, but please correct me if I have something outright incorrect.

To my understanding, Bitcoin has a few drawbacks that a replacement could easily resolve:

1 - The processing of a new block is opensourced with a difficulty that is reset at regular intervals. This is to standardize the time of a new block, but has the current effect of pushing processing costs up and the long term effect of making costs driven by those processors and the market to collect fees.

This could be resolved by having only a specified set of processors in control. Call it the Federal Reserve equivalent or call it Google Coins if you prefer. As long as that list was relatively fixed and cooperative, the processing costs would remain low and transaction fees would remain manageable for real commerce. In an attempt to avoid a conspiracy counter argument, the processors could be any one and any number (with a minimum) as long as they were fixed and cooperative.

2 - Bitcoin has a fixed maximum number of transactional units that it is approaching (# of satoshis). Why not have that number always increasing at a reasonable rate. A real world example is how the US manages the dollar supply. A newly introduced Google Coin (or whatever) could do this.

3 - One argument in favor of bitcoin is the recognition of the brand name. I'd argue a federally regulated or major corporate backed coin would easily displace Bitcoin for normal day to day transactions. Who are point of sale or online retailers likely going to use, an anonymous unregulated currency or a currency with some backing and security they can point to?

Sure, you're going to lose the anonymity with a structured and well governed replacement. If you just wanted to buy illegal goods or launder money, you probably aren't going to use Amazon Bux or Visa Coins (or whatever). The VAST majority of transactions however demand a very inexpensive  means of exchange and not anonymity.

So, my question is - Why Bitcoin specifically? (Not ""Why a blockchain based currency?"")",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Banking sector inspired cryptocurrency,"For me cryptocurrency is disruption at its finest. This is what cryptocurrency is doing and I do not see (with my modest knowledge) any overlaps of the fiat and cryptocurrency worlds. But as we look at it, for one to succeed, the other has to fail. Moreover, if cryptos win, the central banks are rendered useless. I feel that a usecase for the blockchain technology can be made for the banking sector. It will require complete overhaul of our current systems but it can be managed. Moreover, it will also document everything in its ecosystem. This is a huge plus for countries with corruption and money laundering issues. 

In my opinion, l everaging blockchain can solve a lot of issues for the banking industry and a move towards it is very doable. My reason for this optimism is India's recent removal of notes from its system. As one-seventh of world's population worked towards arguablly the  biggest fiat disruption of my lifetime, blockchain based fiat is possible. 

Taking the discussion further, I am not asking for creation of a new token. I asking that the whole thing is built from the ground up with the ability to introduce applications that merge with the blockchain. A lot of things will need to be kept in mind. 

For instance, the money supply cannot be held constant or it cannot increase on a routine basis. The central banking authority will need measures for monetary policy measures. On a similar note, lets take a look at how banks work. They use the money over and over again. The current crypto world is not answering this. 

And things have to be rethought in light of the system. While transactions are straightforward on the blockchain, banking system does not work like that. I am no banker, but with the exception of simple intra-bank transactions, everything else requires numerous ledger entries to keep everything in check and balance. 

This is just an idea that I have been mulling over and shared here for your point of view. I am not a coder (former Business Analyst in the development sector) but I am believer in the crytpocurrency revolution, hence my research on how money flows and how the banking sector. 

I am not suggesting anything but want to discuss only. Thanks for your time and patience.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Budgeting to pay off debt, can we afford a car?","Right now our savings is at zero due to family emergency’s and we’d like to have it at $1,000 to start with. I know everyone says 3 months of expenses, however the chance of my husband outright losing his job is slim to none and I would like to pay down some debt first (let me know if this is stupid). It’s also why we don’t have rent, we live on a military base and it is automatically taken from his check, I’ve looked around and we couldn’t afford anything better than what we have now in town, in terms of rent. 

Our debts consist of 2K in student loans, 4K on a car loan and 10K in credit cards. 

I would like to purchase a used car sometime this year, if not next year, but to be honest my car works fine. It’s a 2007 and while it is losing paint and is ugly, it is safe and reliable. I was thinking a used SUV for around 10,000-11,000, but would love some input on if this is affordable. I want to pay my husbands car off first which is only at 4K now, but I know we should probably pay off a credit card with a higher interest rate first.

Another input is, I only work around 15-20 hours a week, but would like to work closer to 30-35 by picking up extra shifts if at all possible. I work with children, so the schedule is set, but after I’m cleared to be alone, I do have the chance to work more hours.

personalfinance,I need help figuring best way to compare mortgage options,"My home flooded in Hurricane Harvey.  I am fortunate in the sense that my father has 40 years experience remodeling homes and we were able to tackle the work ourselves.  

I also took the opportunity to *seriously* cut back on junk in our home and live much more streamlined (so much clutter and high-end electronics).  

I have an auto loan, 1.9% interest with $6000 left, it is $465 a month (never buy a car you cant afford to pay off in 3 years)  

Since we are cutting back our home items and did all the work ourselves, I could have a decent sized chunk of money going back in to the home.  I plan to use the money I received for items I wont be repurchasing to pay off the auto loan.  This will allow me to invest in my IRA again.  


I don't know what to do about the home note.   it is a 15 year note that started in July 2015; 180k principle with 3.25% APR.  

This is purely conjecture since I do still have work to do on the home, but let's say I can put 50k in to the home note.  I feel like this is the best move because the house has depreciated (understandably) since the flood.  

Would it be best to refinance to lower the house note and work to max out my IRA?  or would it be best to just put the money in to the note and pay it off sooner?  

I worry about refinancing and paying all that front-end interest.  Then again, I think the market would beat out the interest long term.  I also think interest rates have gone up half a point or more on house notes.  

How could I calculate this to make the best financial decision? Refinance? Stick it in the home loan? Forego IRA contributions and pay off the house more quickly?  

**High level bullet points**  
 * $6000 auto loan @ 1.9% APR with 14 months left on the note  
 * 15 year/3.25% home note with $180,000 left  
 * $0 contributing to my IRA  
 * 4% to my 401k with 8% company matching  
 * ~$50,000 to put in to the house note.",finance

[Digital Currency Group](http://dcg.co/who-we-are/) owns (in part) and directs [Blockstream](http://dcg.co/portfolio/) (go to ""B"" and look 13 down). Guess who runs Digital Currency Group:
 
1. Glenn Hutchins: Former Advisor to President Clinton. Hutchins sits on the board of **The Federal Reserve Bank of New York**, where he was reelected as a Class B director for a three-year term ending December 31, 2018.
 
2. Barry Silbert: CEO of Digital Currency Group, (**funded by Mastercard**) who is also an Ex investment Banker at Houlihan Lokey. This is the guy who thought SW2x was a good idea.
 
3. Lawrence H. Summers: ""Board Advisor""
""**Chief Economist at the World Bank from 1991 to 1993**. In 1993, Summers was appointed **Undersecretary for International Affairs of the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration**. In 1995, he was promoted to **Deputy Secretary of the Treasury** under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as **Secretary of the Treasury**. While working for the Clinton administration Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also **influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states [a massive FUD campaign that caused Russian citizens to sell their shares in public companies - these shares were purchased by Oligarch bankers with ties to Western Banks and most Russian people had their national resources stolen from them]**, and in the **deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act**.""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers
 
4. Blythe Masters: ""Former executive at JPMorgan Chase.[1] She is currently the CEO of Digital Asset Holdings,[2] a financial technology firm developing distributed ledger technology for wholesale financial services.[3] Masters is **widely credited as the creator of the credit default swap as a financial instrument**. She is also Chairman of the Governing Board of the Linux Foundation’s open source Hyperledger Project, member of the **International Advisory Board of Santander Group**, and **Advisory Board Member of the US Chamber of Digital Commerce**.""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blythe_Masters
 
DCG is also an investor in BitGo (See ""How it works""). See also: Money map
BitGo aims to become a ""service"" which prevents double spending. I thought Bitcoin had that built in. Well this service is only useful if transactions aren't being confirmed in the blockchain (rather, confirmed in, say, a side-chain, like Lightning--Blockstream's developing technology). Surprise, surprise. SegWit2x would literally take power out of the hands of the miners and gives it to central bankers and MasterCard. Interesting that after the decision to ""suspend"" (does not mean cancel) SegWit2x, Bitcoin gets held hostage by ridiculous transaction times.
 
edit: also worth watching this video from MasterCard before they invested in DCG. Notice this guy is just reading a damn script, too. Smh. Probably doesn't even know what he's saying.

I am 24 years old and 1.5 years out of college (not really using my psych degree) and find myself with $34,000 of student debt. I moved back in with my parents (50 minutes commute to work now) to save money. I make $31,000 a year at work (24,000  after taxes). 

My monthly expenses are:

Loans: 341 (minimum monthly payment)** details below 
Gas: 180
Phone: 61

I am saving a lot of money by living at home but as great as it is/as great as my parents are it obviously isn’t ideal to live with your parents at 24 and I would like to move soon as I have already been here four months. The commute adds an hour and 40 minutes onto my day especially with the coming winter/snow and bad roads. Luckily my parents are letting me use their vehicle (it’s required for my job) at no cost! However once I move out I will need to start paying the insurance (about 65 a month) Since the cost of living downtown is so high, I can’t really afford to move out without getting a roommate. My boyfriend offered to let me live with him for only $300 monthly plus half of utilities so roughly $350/month. He lives right downtown near where I work. 

** the interest rates on my student loans vary from 3% up to of 6.8%. I have looked into deferment and forebarence but do not qualify with my income and also refinancing doesn’t seem to be an option. I have been trying to pay my 6.8% loan off first (originally 2,000 and now I owe 1600) but not sure how much to throw at it since I’m trying to save up a nest egg living with my parents. I really want to avoid waitressing and bartending if possible. 

I would love advice on when to move, how to manage my debt, and how to live on 24k a year.",finance
Bitcoin,PSA : Don't ever sell ALL of your bitcoin!,"Look, my message is simple. Let's say your bitcoin are now worth enough to change your life. Enough to pay off credit card debt, buy that dream car, pay off your student loans, or even your house.

Congratulations to you. That is a great reward for investing early and holding through the drama.

But, please, don't ever sell all of your bitcoin.

A case in point. I have a friend who bought into bitcoin when they were worth 30 cents apiece. At one time he had thousands of bitcoin. Over the years he spent them at prices so low it takes your breath away. He likes to tell the story of how he paid 250 bitcoin for a pound of coffee.

However, the lesson to be learned here, is he never sold them all. And what he has remaining has, obviously, changed his life.

I, personally, have sold my bitcoin a whole bunch of times. I started investing in early 2013 and have been well ahead for pretty much the whole time. Over the years every single person who had an opinion urged me to sell my bitcoin. They would say ""that pigs get fed but hogs get slaughtered', or some aphorism like that. The message being, don't get greedy, take your profits and run.

And I did that. I sold my first 50 BTC in 2013 at $350 apiece because that was a nearly 4X return on investment.

I have sold a portion of my bitcoin multiple times, and as recently as earlier this year I sold 100 BTC at a $1,000 apiece to pay off my kids student loans.

Now, do I regret selling those bitcoin? Of course I do. How could I not. It was clearly a bad financial decision in retrospect.

However, I am glad I paid off my kids student loans. It really changed their lives for the positive.

My point here is that if selling off some of your bitcoin can radically change your life; I'm not going to recommend against it.

Just don't ever sell *all* of your bitcoin. Sell 1/3, or 1/2, but not all. They were too hard to come by and too hard to get back.

That's my advice at least. Had I never sold any of my bitcoin I would be in a much better financial position today, but I'm very thankful that I never sold all.",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,"Why I think ""Health Ranger"" Mike Adams is wrong (and David Icke as well)","Yesterday, Mike Adams, the ""Health Ranger"" whom I have nothing against, posted an article outlining what could happen. I CAN find at least one fatal flaw in his argument. Can you?

1) Roll out the NSA-created Bitcoin to get the public excited about a digital currency.

2) Quietly prepare a globalist-controlled cryptocurrency to take its place. (JP Morgan, anyone?)

3) Initiate a massive, global-scale false flag operation that crashes the global debt markets and sends fiat currencies down in flames. (Hoax alien invasion, hoax North Korean EMP attack, mass distributed power grid terrorism network, etc.)

4) Blame whatever convenient enemy is politically acceptable (North Korea, “the Russians,” Little Green Men or whatever it takes…).

5) Allow the fiat currency debt pyramid to collapse and smolder until the sheeple get desperate (i.e. Venezuela-style desperation with people eating out of dumpsters).

6) With great fanfare, announce a government-backed cryptocurrency replacement for all fiat currencies, and position world governments as the SAVIOR of humanity. Allow the desperate public to trade in their fiat currencies for official crypto currencies.

7) Outlaw cash and criminalize gold and silver ownership by private citizens. All in the name of “security,” of course.

8) Criminalize all non-official cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, crashing their value virtually overnight and funneling everyone into the one world government crypto, where the NSA controls the blockchain. This can easily be achieved by blaming the false flag event (see above) on some nation or group that is said to have been “funded by Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency used by terrorists.”

9) Require embedded RFID or biometric identifiers for all transactions in order to “authenticate” the one-world digital crypto currency activities. Mark of the Beast becomes reality. No one is allowed to eat, travel or earn a wage without being marked.

10) Once absolute control over the new one-world digital currency is achieved, weaponize the government-tracked blockchain to track all transactions, investments and commercial activities. Confiscate a portion of all crypto under the guise of “automated taxation.” In an emergency, the government can even announce negative interest rates where your holdings automatically decrease each day.

personalfinance,California Roth IRA - transfer to Bitcoin. Then transfer back. 13% fee.... is it worth it? Avoiding Cap gains state and Fed 33%,"Hey guys! 

I live in California. I'm 40 and plan to retire here in CA.  I wanted to put a substantial amount into a ""crypto IRA"" that charges 13% fee on the entire amount.
I currently have $100,000 in stocks in an Roth IRA that I want to Roll into a crypto Roth IRA (bitcoinira.com)

California has a 13% long term capital gains tax
US Fed has a 15-20% long term calital gains tax (I believe I'll be in the 20% bracket)
So that's a *33% TAXES I'm trying to avoid. (legally through a ROTH IRA)  

Example:  Roll $100,000 into a Roth IRA holding Bitcoin (and other crypto). Pay $13,000 in fees (the 13% bitcoin IRA fee)

in 2018 it turns into $200,000. and I take the initial $100,000 and put it back into more conservative stocks (ie S&amp;P and QQQ stocks etc)

Result:  Have $100k in stocks and $100k in bitcoin in 2019 and continue 

Does it make sense to roll my roth into this IRA for the time being.

Has anyone tried something like this?

EDIT: I guess I have to add a disclaimer or explanation: this is about 2% of my net worth.  I have a lot of stocks, cash, gold and investmetns in real estate held outside of my Roth IRA.
EDIT: If you don't know what a Roth IRA there's no reason to comment about this being tax evasion... A Roth IRA is legal and very common in investing...
EDIT: 
Disclaimer-  I am probably a fool and also understand I'm gambling 2% of my net worth. I don't advise to anyone to do what I'm doing.  I'm just bad with math and want to make sure I'm OK paying 13% fees to some IRA Trust. I wouldn't mind losing it.  I'd be more mad paying 33% on my capital gains then I would on losing the original amount in full thanks
I predict Bitcoin will double or triple this year. Again I am a fool ;)

:-) But seriously I do enjoy the discussion thanks guys...


EDIT:
Here's the site I was interested in rolling... I'm still not certain if it's the best choice or if I should go with a self-directed IRA instead.

 https://www.bitcoinira.com

EDIT UPDATE:  I'm not as satisfied with BitcoinIRA as I wished.  They put more into selling and marketing then charge you the big 13-15% fees and hike up other fees.  They should make the product more user friendly and have better customer service instead of just putting everything into their marketing

Bitcoin,GDAX and Coinbase is about to break again!,"GDAX has a Scheduled Maintenance: December 12th, 12:45 am - if you were a powerful organization (The Fed or IMF or whoever want the all mighty dollar to still be the best currency) then you would want to try and disrupt the main medium to exchange this currency.

What better time to attack the exchange then to do it during before or after a maintenance shut down.

This is just a theory and we have seen GDAX and coinbase attacked before (as in flooded with too much action), so why not do this during a maintenance period and try and disrupt Bitcoin even more with that action?

personalfinance,"32 and terrified to admit the hole I've dug for myself, but serious about turning it around. Looking for advice.","Hi,
Thanks in advance for any advice you may have.  I'm 32 years old and have no idea how to dig myself out of debt or save/invest appropriately to someday retire.

I put myself through college by work and a loan with an awful interest rate.  After college I decided to pursue my passions of working with people.  I traveled and taught English to adults and children in two different developing countries for two years (no savings, barely made enough to survive month to month).  I returned to the US and worked for several years as a teacher and a coach making hardly any money.  After some back luck (incidents outside my budget that I was forced to put on various credit cards) and realizing that I wouldn't be able to survive financially as a teacher, I started a job in sales.  3 years later I have been able to work my way into a fantastic job with a base salary I could have never dreamed of.  However, I am still getting no where on my debt and not saving any money.

Current monthly income (without commission): $3,900 after tax and monthly Roth IRA contribution
Debts (this is the part that gives me panic attacks):
College loan: ~$21,000
Car: $7,882
Bank Visa: ~$11,000
Amex: ~$6,000

Savings: ~$6,000 but I have no budgeted plan for how much I should contribute each month, nor is that sitting anywhere other than my bank savings account.  I have no idea how to invest or where to start.

The bright side is that I'm owed about $45,000 (some in AR past due, and some in AR current) in commissions, but I only get paid when our customers pay and our accounting/operations department is horrifically negligent and so I am not even counting on that money at this point.  I'm living far beyond my means and recently added up the amount I'm spending on eating out, alcohol, uber, etc. and it's making me sick.  That's an obvious place to start but I still feel like the end is nowhere in sight.

My monthly bills (including the bare minimum on my loan and CC debt) comes to ~$2000.  I know that this is manageable if I reduce my spending habits, stop eating out, etc.  But I'm curious if anyone sees a way for me to pay off my outstanding debts, put away some money each month, and get back in line to actually retire someday.  I feel like I'm so far in debt and have so little savings, that I'll never be able to get my bank account to a place where I can feel proud.  I just don't know where to start, or how to educate myself on investing and where to do it.

I apologize for the length, but wanted to give as accurate a picture as possible.  I appreciate anyone who's taken the time to read this far.",finance
personalfinance,*Recent grad looking for advice on future and school loan debt*,"I have seen quite a bit of recent grads asking about advice, but one thing I noticed was that as similar we may all be, not all of us are in the same job, situation, and debt. I'm sure my thread won't be answered, but for anyone that has the time to do so, I greatly appreciate it in advance.

I am a 25 year old recent graduate (Finished undergrad) and I am living with my father. I do not pay rent so I am able to save for a year or two. I currently working at a restaurant and my salary is $40,000 a year. 
I have about 40k in school loans, but no other debt. I have a car that's fully paid, and some credit cards but not much debt on those (total under 1k). So my main expenses are food, gas, and phone bill and some chill money. I end up using about $500 a month on average. Some months less, some months more, but around that range.

The loan I received was from Navient, and they have spoke with me about paying my loan starting this month. I told them I would call them back as I wanted to get more information before just agreeing with everything they said.

I also heard about IBR and refinancing programs, and wonder if thats a good route to go? And if so, how would I find more information to refinance? Should I just stick with Navient? Or switch to somewhere else?
I have also heard that you can deduct up to $2,500 of student loan interest paid in a given year. Does that work for me?

Any recommendations would be greatly appreciate, as I would like to pay this off as soon as possible, but also within my budget.

Thank you again and much appreciated.

Edit:

Total loan details:

Direct stafford subsidized thats about 19k. 
Direct stafford unsubsidized is around 22k. 
Total: 41k

I am on the nslds.ed.gov but I dont see the interest rates. Im assuming around 4% if I had to guess.

However, the outstanding principal is listed at an additional 5k more so total being 45k, but I see here that the unsubsidized has gained interest? Its slightly higher for each unsubsidized for every year I received it",finance
personalfinance,"Veteran, tech worker, nomadic - how should I do things?","Throwaway account in case things are too personal. I'm looking to gather some opinions on how to plan my financial future. Some background:

* Education: BS, BA, MS
* Debt: zero -- not on car, education, etc
* Career: military veteran, currently employed at $80k/year, $580/month in untaxed additional income (service related)
* Of note: bank (USAA) allows for special VA home loan (no down payment required, No private mortgage insurance (PMI), Mortgage loan can be refinanced)
* More background: I spend 75% of my year on the move internationally, for various work reasons (conferences, meetings) or else picking a place to be. I'm in the US about 25% of the year, otherwise. My US address is in Washington State (last place I lived and worked long-term, no state income tax is a plus), I forward mail to my relatives in Idaho. I have a temporary residency visa in Hungary, valid through 2020 (not a work visa, but remote work for external company is okay).

I tend to pay very little in rent money, as I'm typically staying with friends (US and Europe), family (US, some in Europe very occasionally), or on business trips (lodging and food all paid, usually just 1-2 weeks per month). 

My net expenditures for each month tend to be under $2000, often even $1000. 

I have full health, vision, and dental insurance through my employer, with an international supplement plan as well. I tend to pay cash for dental work in Europe, very low cost. I also have health insurance through the VA which counted as the minimum required under Obamacare, but may be irrelevant now--I try to get my basic checkups when I'm visiting the US by stopping into the VA.

My company gives equivalent to 1% of my income to a 401K, even if I put 0% from my paycheck in the 401k. Currently, I do exactly that.

I have a Roth IRA, worth maybe $10k right now. I haven't contributed this year, as I was a student in some years past and laid low on it. Max contribution is $5400 I believe, but I'm curious if this is changing with new tax laws federally. 

My total financial numbers:

* 45k in cash 
* 33.5k in mutual fund through my bank (global index)
* 4k in another mutual fund (aggressive growth)
* 4k in 401k
* 10k in Roth IRA
* 4k or so in Bitcoin (0.25 BTC)
* Assets: 1 car, permanent license plates (no renewal ever required), usually on storage insurance ($18/month), parked in Idaho

That's all I've got. So I'm open to any advice that comes up, but my questions:

1. Am I eligible for Foreign Earned Income Exclusion when filing taxes? I know I don't meet the time test, which requires 11/12 months that I'm outside the US, but I may meet the bona fide test which shows that I keep domicile abroad and don't domicile in the US (I am registered to girlfriend's address in Hungary, I don't pay rent, own a home, nor am on anybody's dependent list etc in the US -- aka I'm not domiciled)
2. I believe I should start immediately maxing out my Roth IRA each year. But if now is December, should I put $5400 into it immediately, then I max it each calendar year, or is it maxed during tax year? Is depositing a lump sum like that significantly worse than trying to deposit weekly or monthly sums?
3. Should I also contribute to the 401k, and up to what amount?
4. I am likely to continue living in the USA long term, but if I stayed in Europe (maybe married there), still would visit a lot. Either way, I'd like to own a small home/apartment/condo in the US, in the Rocky Mountain or Northwest region, where I can have internet and airport access, ski access... my little dream. It's not crazy expensive to do anyway, but I ask: is this complicated if I do it outside my tax home (Washington) or family's home where I can quickly take residence (Idaho)? What if I want Montana, Wyoming, Utah, or Oregon? How should I look at this as a benefit to own, and what other fees am I looking at aside from mortgage and property tax (resident vs non-resident tax too)? keeping in mind I can use this VA loan, my home state offers a similar option to have a no down payment first-time loan when buying a home, as a veteran
6. I have considered buying property abroad--anything to be aware of here? I can get an apartment on a ski resort in one of my favorite countries for about $20k...
7. How should I generally look at investing my money, keeping cash available (I hope in coming years to take a sabbatical, just for a year), and holding stock vs real estate?
8. Any other tips about real estate? I want to generally just purchase a home base for myself (somewhere like Salt Lake City due to great skiing and international airport access) -- open to owning to rent/airbnb but know that involves a lot more of my time
9. Charity/donation/write offs? Anything I should think about, do, don't do, in these categories?

personalfinance,(US) Planning for Maternity Leave and Beyond - WWYD?,"Hey there /r/personalfinance!  Just looking to get some opinions on how my family should handle our financial situation after our fifth member joins the pack in January.  Here's our details:

**Income:**

* biweekly combined net: $2,300
* biweekly ""child support"" from older boys' mom: $172

*Total:* $4,944 net monthly income

**Monthly Expenses:**

* mortgage: $1,100
* oil (winter usage): $350
* student loan payment: $300
* CC payment: $200
* groceries: $400-500
* electric: $250
* internet/phone: $200
* auto insurance: $150
* older kiddo daycare: $680
* infant daycare (as of March): $1,100

*Total:* $3700; $3,000 January-March; $4,800 April-May; $4,050 June-August (camp paid in full, no monthly spend on older kiddo daycare); $4,390 September-onward

**Debts:**

* my student loan ($300 monthly payment; avg 5.3% interest rate across 4 remaining loans): ~$3,000 balance as of today
* CC debt ($80 minimum payment, overpaying at $200 currently; 0% promo interest rate until November 2018): ~$7,800 balance as of today

To give the rest of our asset profile: we have liquid savings of around $6,000, which I realize is slightly less than adequate for our regular expenses.  Retirement is currently around $54K for him in a 401K and $38K for me split across a Roth and a 401K.  House is valued at $230,000 and our current mortgage balance is around $110,000; we do plan on getting a small HELOC in the next 2-3 years to take care of some major upgrades (windows, siding, and exterior doors need to be replaced).  We have an HSA account through my husband's work with about $4,500 in it currently for any medical stuff that comes up.

I'm due in January with kiddo 3 for our family, and I plan to take the full 12 weeks provided by my company (4 weeks at full pay and 8 weeks at 60% of gross).  I have this kind of hashed out above, but it's worth noting that the older kids will be out of daycare for that time, freeing up nearly $700 for three months.  When they go back in the spring we'll be shifting the elder of the two into the 3-day program rather than 5, which drops that monthly expense from $680 to $610; we drop to $340 in the fall since he'll be aging out of their after-school program entirely after the summer.  The little dude will be going into full-day care in the spring as well at a rate of $275/wk.  That's going to eat up most of our monthly delta, unfortunately, but it is what it is.  

I have not factored raises/holiday bonuses into any of the above figures.  

Right now, I've been socking away about $300 per paycheck towards savings goals and throwing the rest at our outstanding debts to try and get those a little lower before baby shows up and wreaks havoc on how I save.  What I'm trying to do now is come up with our plan for the next 3, 6, and 12 months as we hit each of these stages and our income/expense mix changes, and I'd like some advice as to how you wise folks think we should proceed as far as balancing savings with debt repayment.  Should we focus on paying a little more towards my student loans, or just keep going with what we currently do as my current payoff plan has them wiped out by October/November 2018 (at which point I'm already planning to apply that payment to the CC debt).  Or should we focus on saving whatever we can for the next year-ish until our income frees up a little more (from that loan repayment, shift in childcare, etc) and then start off 2019 really cranking on repaying the last of our CC debt?  

Optimistically, if we were to pay off the last of my student loans next year and then shuffle 100% of that payment over to the CC debt, I think we'd be able to knock that out before the end of 2019 with no change in the amount of our income that goes towards debt repayment.  

As for my maternity leave - should I just hide away any extra cash I can find to cover daycare costs over the next year or so or take advantage of the extra money to pay a little extra on our debts?

Sorry if this is a little wordy or overly-informed - I just want to get all the possibly useful info I can think of out into the post itself.

* Received job offer in NY, moved to NY on 8/2017, and have been living in a NY ""domicile"" (as defined by the State of NY website, linked [here](https://www.tax.ny.gov/pit/file/pit_definitions.htm) since moving here.
* Still a CA resident.
* Still have CA drivers license, but no car and I don't intend to drive or get a car in NY.
* The total (all) taxes I pay comes out to be ~36.6% of fed gross taxable income.


Recently noticed on my paychecks that I have been paying CA AND NY withholding tax:

* CA withholding in the amount of ~1.5% if fed taxable gross income
* NY withholding in the amount of ~5.8% if fed taxable gross income


I was surprised to see that I was still paying CA taxes, though I think it is because I told my employer my address was my old CA address and they set up my witholding starting day one (I never talked to an HR person on my first day about my taxes, nor did I do any paperwork related to taxes).

Couple of questions:

* Should I expect an ugly tax bill from the state of NY, assuming I DO NOT change my residency status from CA to NY for the rest of 2017?
* Should hold off on changing my residency status from CA to NY on Jan 1 so I can have a clean tax residency status for the year of 2018.

I'm 26 years old living in Sydney and I was never taught any financial skills through formal education or my parents. The latter is quite horrible at handling money as I've recently come to identify.

I've recently purchased a property which my parents and I live in for $885k with a $585k mortgage at interest rate of 3.89%. I have approx $15k of savings sitting in a mortgage offset account. I have no other debts outside of this mortgage but do want to pay it off asap. I have near 0% interest student loans apprx 15k owing which are taken out of my pretaxable income and only if I'm earning. There isn't currently any incentive to pay these off as no discounts are awarded.

I work in cybersecurity sector as a consultant and I currently earn 120k per year before tax with additional 9.5% ($11,400) going towards a superannuation retirement fund.

The question I have is what would you recommend I do with the money I can save from my income (approx 2k per month after mortgage repayments, student loans and expenses).

personalfinance,Any tips for an aspiring 19 year old who wants to be financially independent ASAP?,"First off, a little bit about myself: I️ am a freshman who is about to start nursing school next year and has recently got certified as a CNA (not great pay, but great for a resume). I️ have earned enough college credits in high-school (earned through AP tests and at my local community college) to graduate in my first semester as a junior in order to decrease the amount of money I️ borrow from the government. To save more even more money, I️ took all my nursing prerequisites at a community college. In addition, I️ live at home and pay rent by being my mom’s secretary and doing chores. 

Now that is out of the way; here is what I️ am doing right now to achieve my goal to become financially independent:

1) I️ put 10% of whatever I️ earn into Robinhood. I️ consider this my savings. 

2) As it stands, I️ buy stocks that pay dividends (especially those on the Dividends Champions list). This composes half of my portfolio. Other half of portfolio is composed of stocks that I️ believe have potential or are penny stocks ( come on BAA - daddy needs a new pair of shoes!!!).

3) Recently, I️ have taken a new interest in crypto currency trading and have started investing in it. (Using GDAX - if there is a better alternative - has lower buy/sell fees AND is safe/legitimate; please list). I️ am just experimenting, so not whole lot of money was placed here.

4) I️ estimate my tuition to be about ~20k (in order to get my BS in Nursing. 13.5k will probably paid by federal student loans. Rest will be paid by whatever money I️ get from scholarships and money from a CNA job that I️ hope to get soon.  I️ also intend to pay   the interest on my direct subsidized loans so I️ can save money. (Wish me luck please, these next two years are going to be one hell of a rollercoaster.)

Eventually, I️ hope to just live off my dividend earnings  and never touch the principle (so that when I️ pass away, my children (if I️ choose to have them) or grandchildren will have a better head start in life than I️ did. Realistically, this won’t happen till decades from now unless I️ win the lottery (lol). 

Now older (or younger) people of reddit, what can I️ do on top of what I️ am doing right to achieve financial independence ASAP?",finance

What does that mean?

personalfinance,Basically missed a month of income with no savings. The financial burden went onto my already-burdened credit cards and now I am struggling to pay my bills and the cards off. Any help?,"Basically what it says on the tin. I am a server who usually makes good money full-time at a restaurant. But some poor past financial decisions caught up with me, i.e. being young and stupid and scared and ignoring my student campus loans for five years until they went to collections. 

I had $5k in my checking account before moving into a new apartment with my coworker. We signed a 12-month lease that we are halfway through. Rent/utilities/Internet/food/gas all add up to about $850/mo. Rent is the biggest portion. I eat free meals at work and basically nothing else to avoid spending money. Gas is to get to work and home. 

Unfortunately, right after we signed the lease I was contacted by a collections agency on behalf of the student debt. There went the $5k in my bank account, plus $3k that I didn’t have and had to go on my credit cards. After my account got wiped, I have been working month to month to make enough to pay the basic necessities. Add to that my car insurance $107/mo., my federal student loans $125/mo., my car loan $122/mo. Those are all my bills and basic payments. About $1,200/mo. 

However, the month of September hit the restaurant hard. No one would give up shifts and they would only schedule me for 3 shifts a week instead of 9. I have been trying since the start of that month to get a second job to make up the difference, but no luck. I earned in the month of September what I would usually earn in about a week any other month. And since I have been basically living month to month, any savings I had went into rent and all other expenses and the remainder of rent went onto my credit cards. 

Since then it has been an active struggle to catch up with credit card payments while still paying rent and bills. It has snowballed out of control. 

I have been trying to budget, but because my income is so flexible each month (I make anywhere from $30 a shift to $180 a shift), it’s been tough. I already had some debt on my credit cards, but now it feels out of control. I don’t even know where to start paying. 

I have been trying to get a second job as well to keep up. I have an interview this week for a job that will start me at $13.50/hour full-time. So maybe $1,100 after taxes. Where do I focus first, with or without locking down this second job? I need a plan of action because what I have been doing isn’t working. 

Breakdown: 
$850 necessary monthly expenses
$122 car loan
$125 federal student loans
$107 insurance 

Card one: $2,200 balance
Card two: $2,600 balance
Card three: $3,000 balance

Car loan: $2,600 balance
Fed Student loans: $6,300 balance

I know I fucked up, and did it well. I should have paid off the campus debt as I earned the money, but hindsight is 20/20. If i get this second job, my income is gonna regulate to a more stable $1,100/month plus whatever night shifts I can pick up (maybe an extra $1k+ every month). 

How do I go about paying this down? I don’t want to take out a loan and breaking my lease isn’t an option as I don’t have the money to pay to break it (they require half the rent for every month I should have lived there per the lease), and subletting isn’t permitted. 

I don’t know what to do right now.",finance

personalfinance,"Thought I would ask the expert Sub ;) Need your insight on Foreclosure, 50K student and Chapter 7","In a very condensed explanation:


We own a home in another state. We have 2 children (4 children total, 9 and under) with Autism and had to leave the State because of the lack of services. We rented out our house and the tenants abandoned the property right as we were about to put it up for sale. The house is still in excellent condition and we have about 5K in equity. The house is now in foreclosure.


ID is a Deficiency Judgement state but I'm unsure if we would owe anything at this point. If we do then we are considering a Chapter 7 filing. Yes, I know it would be a doozy. The house wasn't in my name, it was in my Husband's so we would still have my credit to lean on.


The questions I have are: 1) Do you know if ID will come after us for a large sum? 2) I have seen things saying that **sometimes student loans can be forgiven if you can prove undo hardship** (like raising special needs children, financially speaking). We have a 50K federal Student Loan. The loan was 25K but has shot up to 50K with interest. 


Just looking for outside insight on this.


Thanks so much.


**EDIT** the house and the student loan are literally the only debt we have. My Husband has an excellent credit score but if ID comes after us for a large sum then it is our only option.",finance

personalfinance,"Totaled ""my"" paid-off car, worth $2.2k, need a new one; about to graduate with $12k in debt and go to professional school. I work only 8hrs/wk.","I am a senior at an undergraduate institution. Last week, I totaled my car, though it wasn't really mine. Yes, technically, I'm at fault for it, but I'm not sure that's pertinent here. My boyfriend's family had more or less given it to me once they had paid it off, letting me use it whenever, though of course it was still their car and if they needed it, they could use it. We had recently been in the talks about signing the title over to me in case I ever wanted to trade it in for a different car as it was fairly old and ""rickety"" or whatever. The insurance company indeed claimed it a total loss and is going to give us $2200, which I will use as a down-payment for a new-to-me used car. I'm fairly strongly opposed to buying a new car. 

My problem lies in that I am not completely financially independent. My grandmother helps support me, with money for doctors, groceries, etc. Basically, she pays for everything except my school and housing, which I have covered from scholarships, grants, and a small, federally subsidized loan. This means all the money I have to pay for school &amp; rent comes from those sources. My grandmother doesn't have much room to pay for anything else right now. I work only 8 hours a week, in a field pertinent to my career choice, so they acknowledged that there weren't many hours but I would be doing it for the experience. Besides which, my major is very time-consuming. I have thought about picking up shifts at additional locations, but I have trouble trying to find where to fit it in to my schedule. Therefore, I make ~$140ish biweekly. I use some of this money for gas, more doctor's appointments, and paying off my credit card. Yeah, that's another problem I have: some credit card debt from doctor's appointment, though not that much and I've been paying it off at about 430% more than the minimum payment each month.

Furthermore, car insurance for me would not be cheap. I've looked into it before. 

I plan to get married in 1 year give or take a month. Next year, upon our graduation after this last spring semester, we plan to move in together and he will look for a job, while I will just continue mine. His entry-level pay is expected to be (on average) ~40k if I'm not mistaken (though could be). However, I'll be attending professional school, which has a total estimated cost listed of $40k/yr. 

I plan to purchase a used car, less than 100k miles on it, less than $10k, and model year 2012 or newer. 

I would love any advice you could offer on figuring out how to pay for this car. I feel so very, very, very overwhelmed. My grandmother **was** only reimbursing my bf's family for the car insurance, $60/mo. So we'll be going from that to car insurance in my name (considerably more expensive) plus the actual car payment. I've figured that I could get away with paying a more moderately (versus cheap) priced vehicle, seeing as my future husband will be employed, but that scares me as 1. he is not employed yet, 2. anything could happen financially, 3. in the meanwhile, I'd have only my measly income plus whatever my grandmother can afford to help with.",finance
altcoin,"ETC: Technology First, Leader Next","Bitcoin Gold and Segwit2x have made the headlines these days. In terms of fork, there is more digital currencies than bitcoin that forked - Ethereum.

On 20 July 2016, Ethereum’s hard fork occurred at block 1,920,000 in order to resolve the DAO exploit. The blockchain then split into Ethereum Chain (ETH) and Ethereum Classic Chain (ETC). 

Unlike ETH, ETC is the continuation of the default settings: decentralization, irreversibility, freedom from third-party inspection and being unstoppable. Therefore, the development process of ETC is more prudent and security-conscious.

**A security-based policy**

It’s widely known that ETC has launched its production cut plan which set out that the supply will be reduced by 20% per 5 million blocks on December 12 and this will continue until the total supply is controlled somewhere between 210 million and 220 million. An anti-inflation currency model under this policy will thus come into being to solidly underlie values for investors and developers.

In nature, the most important premise of the plan is to maintain cybersecurity and be self-reliant. A suitable monetary policy will indirectly promote the development of the network and provide a secure platform required for the development of all smart contracts. Large, high-risk, or high-value applications can be hard to come by without a secure network which will in turn attract many apps to develop there.

**The Engineers: More technology than price**

On the day before the implementation of the reduction plan, the ETC community held a forum on the future development of ETC and many ETC developers joined the discussion.

When asked about ETC price, the developers said, ""We focus on technological development, our job, rather than price.” The has been pragmatically and steadily promoting the development of ETC. They’d rather slow down the development progress than do rash experiments. This would avoid users’ future loss caused by irreversible errors. By now, the team is working hard to make ETC more stable, more flexible and full-fledged. A dedicated and mature team is a good foundation for the rise of token price.

**ETC on apps**

ETC lags behind ETH in applications. However, it is also accelerating to narrow the gap. ETC is a universal blockchain smart contract platform that can run a variety of potential applications, such as IoT applications. ETC is currently working on several new projects, such as replacing the existing EVMs (Ethereum Virtual Machines) with SputnikVM for faster speed and more compatibility with IoT; Emerald Project provides a platform for Dapp developers; and more tools to integrate external services into ETC.

The potential use cases of ETC are very broad and theoretically include most of the applications that require trust and contract. There is special advantage in developing IoT applications on the ETC platform: stable and secure network, fixed cap, capacity expansion, privacy transaction, payment machine, etc. The combination of IoT and ETC will transfer more apps to the ETC network.

The development of ETC gives precedence to technology and concentrates on technological development and applications, which does good to digital currency. A technology-based token will only end up dying if it fails to keep a balance between marketing and technology. This is why ETC is technology-focused and will become a decentralized and tamper-proof public infrastructure that lead the industry.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Received 'Loan' offer with high interest rate and possible other charges, can someone help interpret this meaning?","Hi everyone,
Have browsed here before but just signed up because I have a question. I have 4 credit cards open and lost my job 2 months ago. I have still not been able to find work and all cards are maxed out. Since I have no work, I am worried about making the next due dates on my cards, rent, food etc... I tried extending credit, trying for a new card, but was denied.

But last week I received a letter in the mail with a live check in it. It is one of those things that if you cash the check, you agree to the terms automatically. I googled it and checked up on the source and it seems legit. However - the rates seem to be outrageous. 
Here is the info on the paperwork that came with the check. 

- Loan Amount: $2539.00

- Finance Charge: $1522.82

-Total of Payments $4061.82

- Number of Payments: 38

- Amount of each payment: $106.89

- Annual Percentage rate: 31.84%

- Interest Rate: 29.99%


So my interpretation is it will cost $1522.82 to borrow the 2539 so it makes it sound like I will have to pay back a total of $4061.82 over 38 months. (38 X $106.89).
However the paper does not say anything about this 'annual percentage rate' or the 'interest rate' which is written with the details. 

- Is it true I will have to pay more money then the actual $4061.82 meaning will that amount increase every year because of the interest rate?

- As in does this mean after the first year, or after 12 payments have been made, (12X106.89=1282.68), that I will have to subtract that from the total due (4061.82 - 1282.68 = $2779.14), I take the remaining balance of $2779.14 and multiple by 1.3184 which brings me to $3664.02 due after the first year is over? And I continue this until the amount gets to 0? 

So can someone please help tell me what they think these terms are/ am I correct in what I actually have to pay back? I know this is a stupid offer but I owe more than just my credit cards so if the offer is just paying back 4k to borrow 2.5k, I might consider it, but if I have to pay the interest on top of that, I will likely rip this check up now so I don't get tempted. Can someone please review what I've said and give me some feedback?
Thank you all.",finance

**The
Medium is the Message**

In the 1960s, a Canadian professor named
Marshall McLuhan became widely known for his thorough analysis of the evolution
of communication technologies.  His
central precept was that communication technologies have dramatic effects on
populations regardless of the content they carry at any particular moment.  The radio, for example, allowed private
microphones to broadcast to widely distributed speakers, which enabled the
amplification of private viewpoints on a public scale.  This had profound effects on society that
played out regardless of what particular messages were carried over particular
radio frequencies at particular times. 

McLuhan’s famous aphorism, “The Medium is
the Message,” is a distillation of this precept.  In point form: 1) each new communication
technology changes the environment into which it is introduced; and 2) the net
effect of a technology over time is both far more interesting and harder to
discern than the effect of any particular use of that technology or phase of
its development.  In other words, it is
harder to see the forest for the trees, but seeing the forest is everything.

So: what effect will Bitcoin have on the
world over the long run?  What is the _meaning_ of Bitcoin?

 

**The
Roman Model**

To understand where we might be going, we
have to first understand how we got to where we are.  In the West, our societies are founded on the
Classical traditions which were seeded in Ancient Greece and “scaled” so to
speak in Ancient Rome.  McLuhan had a lot
to say about this from a technological point of view:

The development of writing on lightweight
media such as papyrus and parchment enabled the externalization of
knowledge.  Thus, the oral traditions of
Ancient Greece were subsumed and replaced by written traditions which were far
less lossy and could be refined over time.
Writing on lightweight media also enabled the centralized control of
vast resources over large distances, which would have been impossible using
engraved stone or oral communication.
This was perfected by the Romans and thrown into overdrive by Johannes
Gutenberg's invention of the printing press around 1450.

In its abstract form, the Roman model takes
the form of _bureaucracy_ –
hierarchical organization -- and this model has underpinned the structuring of
society in the West for the past two thousand years.  Look up ""org chart"" on Google
Images if you can't picture one.  Our
societies are comprised of org charts within org charts within org charts --
try the following searches on Google Images: military org chart, bank org
chart, government org chart, university org chart.  Everything in our society is centralized,
bureaucratized, and nested within the context of the nation state which is run
by a central bureaucracy called the government, itself divided into departments
within departments, orgs within orgs.

This is not to say that humans didn't
organize hierarchically before ancient Rome -- of course they did, as do apes,
dogs, chickens, etc.  However, in a
social hierarchy such as a tribe, there is a scale limit (Dunbar's number, 150)
because each member must _know_ his
place and his role as well as the places and roles of all other members.  The hierarchy lives inside its members' minds
and looks more like a swarm than an org chart.
Bitcoin is, of course, this type of network, where each node has full
knowledge of the state of the network and participates in it voluntarily.

Bureaucracy, on the other hand, is based on
the writing down of roles _(job
descriptions)_ and makes people interchangeable.  There is no limit to scale as long as you map
everything out carefully _(management)_.  The lifeblood of bureaucracy is the
transmission of written forms of information _(paper-pushing)_ from the center to the periphery along defined,
linear routes.  Each node receives its
orders, performs its specialized role, delegates if the role requires it, and
then awaits new orders.  Privilege and
planning are concentrated near the center -- as is _risk_.

These structures are inherently fragile and
collapsible.  If you undermine a
high-value node as happened in the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the whole
edifice collapses.  The entire global
financial system barely withstood the collapse of a single American bank - it
is _that_ fragile.

Each nation's banking system is likewise a
matrix of bureaucracies operating as a single, hierarchical supply chain whose
product _(the national currency)_ flows
outward from a central node _(the central
bank)_ through successively less privileged nodes _(investment and commercial banks)_ down to the level of branches and
ATMs.  At each level of the banking
system, additional product is created
and loaned out _(credit/debt)_ using
the productfrom the level above as a
stake _(fractional reserve lending)_.  The banking systems are insulated from
competition by governments through the decree that taxes must be paid in
national currencies.  And to keep the
currencies moving, everyone is raised from birth to want more and then given
the appearance of more through the creation of more _by fiat_, meaning _by arbitrary
decree_, without any necessary connection to the creation of new
wealth.  This is _inflation_: the steady creation of new money to repay debt and keep
the show going.  It is a Ponzi scheme by
design, and it relies the continued ""buying-in"" of young people in
order to survive.

Each national currency has value and
utility only by decree and only within that nation's cell in the global
mosaic.  To move value from one nation to
the next requires snaking it through tenuous international pathways, paying
entrenched gatekeepers, and exchanging one national currency for another.  You have to _be somebody_ to access the banking system.  The more somebody you are, the more access
you get.  It is principally through
control of economic access that strong nations bully weaker ones, rich people
bully poorer ones.  There is tremendous
pent up tension in our world as a result.
This is where we are.

 

**The
Center Cannot Hold**

McLuhan predicted that the advent of the
electronic age and the emergence of global communication networks would lead to
the dissolution of these centralized, bureaucratic structures from the bottom
up.  He died before the spread of the
Internet but described the end result with crystal clarity in his writings.  His
vision of an interconnected world, which he called the ""Global
Village,"" is here _now_.  Every
person has the ability to broadcast information to others in their
networks over the Internet.  If a
transmission is perceived as having sufficient value, the receiving people pass
it on, and so on.  Above a certain
threshold of significance, transmissions are repeated by all people to all
other people: this is _virality_ and there is nothing that institutions
can do to harness or stop it.  The Arab
Spring for example brought down an array of national governments in a span of
months.

Like a rising tide, global communication
networks are bringing about an inevitable dissolution of the Roman model all
around us: the music industry was upended by Napster; newspapers are being
displaced by twitter and blogs; radio stations are being displaced by podcasts;
broadcasters are being displaced by Netflix and YouTube; brick-and-mortar
stores are being displaced by Amazon and eBay; AirBnb is gobbling up rental
supply; traditional transportation services are being displaced by Uber; and
now decentralized currencies are coming after centralized ones. Quoting W.B. Yates: _“Things fall
apart; the center cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.”_

It is important to realize that even though
the post-Dot-Com networks like Facebook and eBay were more effective than their
institutional predecessors, they are still quite fragile since they are _centralized_.  They can be hacked, compromised, back-doored,
subpoenaed, or otherwise shut down.  In
contrast, a truly decentralized network is perfectly flat and impossible to
shut down.  The music industry could kill
Napster by going after Sean Parker, but it cannot touch BitTorrent.  True decentralization, at scale, is one of
the principal reasons why Bitcoin is secure: whatever it becomes, it cannot be
stopped because there is no center to hold, and nothing to attack.

At this point, I think it makes sense to
explain how Bitcoin works, and why it has value.  If those questions can't be answered clearly,
there's no basis for thinking Bitcoin will disrupt traditional banking.  I do, however, think there are very good
answers to those questions which I'll try to present below.

 

**Bitcoin
and Blockchain**

Imagine you live in a pre-historic tribe of
ten people.  As a group, you need to find
a way to keep track of who did what work, and in what quantity.  In other words, you need an abstract “work
unit” that can be traded for work and held for use in future exchanges.  You could use shiny rocks or something else
similarly rare, but people would still be able to cheat the system: why do
actual work if you can simply go on a hunt in the forest and find new rocks?

One solution is to create a ledger or list
that keeps track of how many rocks each person has.  If the ledger is the authority on who has
what, people would not be able to inflate their balances by introducing new
rocks or other work units from outside the system.  The problem is, everyone has to trust the
keeper of the ledger.  If only one entity
maintains the ledger, they ultimately control how much money everyone has _(banks)_.

Decentralization is the solution to this
problem.  You can write down ten copies
of the ledger and distribute a copy to each person in the tribe.  At the end of the day, everyone could
cross-check the transactions that took place with everyone else and a consensus
could be formed about who has what without appealing to a central authority.

Eventually, the people might realize that
the rocks themselves are unnecessary, and that it is actually the ledger that
is important.  The rocks, like all
currencies, are meant to track work.  If
a ledger is already doing that, the rocks themselves become extraneous.  The actual units of currency are the work
units on the ledger.  And if everyone
agrees to use the same ledger, its work units have _value_.

The blockchain is that ledger and Bitcoin
is its work unit.

 

**Proof
of Work**

In the illustration above we can see that
the utility of a blockchain is that it enables distributed peers to _prove_ to each other that they have done
work, and to trade their work units freely without appealing to a trusted
intermediary.  The obvious next question
is: what _proof_ do we have that we can
trust the Bitcoin blockchain?

Bitcoin mining is based on a Proof of Work
consensus mechanism.  To put this as
simply as I can, each and every mining node on the network is competing against
the rest of the network to generate a small piece of data that proves it has
performed an enormous number of computer operations using a batch of new, _valid_ transactions as an input.  The amount of work that it takes to
successfully mine Bitcoin is dictated by how much computer power has
voluntarily joined the mining network - and this is adjusted dynamically as
miners enter and leave the network.  Each
operation requires a tiny bit of electricity since a computer must perform it,
so as the difficulty of the Proof of Work operation scales, so too does the
cost of generating it.

As of writing, the Bitcoin network is collectively
performing about 8,250,000,000,000,000,000 operations _per second_, and it takes an average of about ten minutes worth of
this grind for a single node on the network to successfully produce an
acceptable proof of work and add a block of transactions to the
blockchain.  The winning node is awarded
new Bitcoin by including a transaction in its block that credits its own wallet
-- now we understand _mining_.

So you want to be a Bitcoin miner?  Let's say you have a powerful gaming computer
that can perform about 100,000 Bitcoin computer operations per second (a
realistic amount by the way).  It would
have roughly a 1 in 82.5 quintillion chance of mining a block if you were to
enter it into the mining race today.  If
you had a stack of 1000 of these gaming computers your odds of mining a block
would improve to roughly 1 in 82.5 quadrillion.
A million of them?  1 in 82.5
billion.  Etc.  Miners use specialize hardware to perform the
computer operations, but the point still stands: it takes a staggering amount
of computer power and thus a staggering amount of electricity to ""get a
word in"" on the Bitcoin blockchain.

But let's say you get lucky and are able to
generate a proof of work.  That proof of
work will be tied inexorably to whatever batch of transactions you are trying
to add to the blockchain since those transactions were part of the _input_ of the computer operation.  Your transactions must be _valid_ or else the rest of the network
would reject your work.  You wouldn’t be
able to double-spend, create Bitcoin by fiat, or spend from balances that you
don’t have the keys for.  The network
would reject your block.

The larger and more distributed the mining
network is, the more cost-prohibitive it is to compromise it.  In other words: the more people you have
checking the ledger from different nations and backgrounds, the harder it is to
override the distributed, international consensus.  And _that_
is why the Bitcoin blockchain can be trusted.
It is audited by the largest computer network ever assembled and
requires that an attacker control at least 51% of the network on a sustained basis.

 

**The
Open Blockchain**

As more and more people use a blockchain,
its units (e.g. Bitcoin) become more valuable.
As the price of the base unit increases, it becomes more profitable to
mine them at the prevailing level of difficulty, so more miners join the
network.  As more miners join the
network, the level of difficulty increases and thus the robustness and security
of the network increases.  As the
robustness of the network increases, it becomes more secure against attackers,
so more users and investors are drawn to it.
And so the price of the base unit increases.  Which draws in more miners.  Etc. 

The adoption of a blockchain, like the
adoption of any currency, is a virtuous circle -- one that Bitcoin has been
nurturing successfully for nine years without any existential
catastrophes.  Bitcoin's heartbeat, the
mining of a new block every ten minutes, has not skipped a single beat in nine
years.  There has not been a successful
double-spend in nine years.  There has
not been a single accounting error in nine years.  No balance has been mysteriously wiped off
the blockchain in nine years.  This track
record has been established despite the fact that the blockchain is not
protected by a firewall, or an institution, or shielded in a vault.  It is not buried underground, or protected by
obfuscation.  It is out there in the wild
of cyberspace for all to see and attack, secured purely by Proof of Work and
sheer scale.

Bitcoin itself is valuable because it is
the only work unit that can be included in a block of this particular, _special_ blockchain: the open, global,
transnational, borderless, censorship-resistant, permissionless, leaderless,
most well-known, longest-running, and most-well-capitalized blockchain _(credit to /u/andreasma for this and many
other insights)_.  Because work units
on this blockchain are scarce _(per the
21-million cap)_, having the ability to sign for transfers of Bitcoin on the
blockchain is a form of _real_ control
over scarce resources.

This is the pivotal point: to the degree
that people around the world adopt and learn to trust the Bitcoin blockchain,
its work units will have value.  And it
is Bitcoin's openness in particular that makes it the prime candidate for filling
this role.  Any computer on the planet
can join the mining swarm at any time, just as anyone can join the network as a
user, at any time, from any location.  Even
the Bitcoin development community is open-source and open to new developers
provided they can _prove_ their merits. 

_This_ is what is meant by The Open Blockchain: the Bitcoin blockchain is
accessible everywhere and is open to anyone.
It is welcoming.  It enables
people from different cells in the global mosaic to transact point-to-point,
without snaking value through complicated interbank networks, without paying
entrenched gatekeepers and intermediaries, and without having to convert from
one currency to the next.  If a country
experiences a currency crisis, Bitcoin is a very real option because it enables people to transfer value
out of hot spots and convert it into other currencies.  The international monetary system is no match
for this technology.  Private blockchains
are no match either.

 

**Bitcoin’s
Monetary Policy**

Bitcoin is commonly referred to as
""digital gold"" since it is designed to function like a precious
metal.  The creation of new units follows
something like the extraction curve of a natural resource.  The issuance of new coins was steep at first
but will taper off over time through successive “halvings” of the reward that
miners receive for creating new blocks.
Eventually, the issuance of new coins will approach an asymptotic limit
of 21 million coins.

At each ""halving"", the rate of
inflation is effectively cut in half, though it decreases ever so slightly with
each new block.  The current rate of
inflation is about 4%.  At the next
halving in 2020, the inflation rate will be about 2%.  In 2024, 1%.
Etc.

The world has never before had access to a
truly deflationary asset.  Even
currencies considered deflationary such as the Japanese Yen are not truly
deflationary: the government _can_
print an infinite amount even though deflation in Japan has inertia.  Gold is not deflationary: new gold is mined
every year.  Bitcoin will eventually
become _truly deflationary_, meaning
the supply of available Bitcoins will contract year over year
consistently.  How is this possible, if there
is no provision to destroy coins in the protocol?

There is guaranteed to be a year sometime
in the future where more coins are lost due to people losing their keys than
new coins are created.  It _will_ happen.  As the miner reward decreases, years like
this will become more common.
In the distant future, decades will go by where every year is deflationary, and
eventually it will be practically impossible for the supply of Bitcoin to _not_ decrease in a given year.

Here is Bitcoin’s golden proposition:
because it the first _truly_
deflationary asset, it does not require interest payments or a
never-ending influx of greater fools in order to provide a “yield” over the
very long run.  In the distant future,
Bitcoin will have a low but predictable _intrinsic_ expected return approximating its rate of deflation, as long as it remains
secure.

When you combine Bitcoin's monetary policy
with its robustness through distributed Proof of Work on a planetary scale, you
end up with the basis for a global reserve asset more effective than anything
else humans have ever had a chance to work with, including gold.  Gold is modestly inflationary, it cannot be
transmitted over a network, and it must be centrally secured and accounted for.  Bitcoin has _already_ obsolesced gold as a reserve technology, let alone Ponzi
currencies like the dollar - most just don't know it yet.  As people come to really understand Bitcoin’s
monetary policy, they will flock to it as a safe haven, especially in troubled
economies.  If we have another 2008,
Bitcoin will be very much in play.

 

**Bitcoin
as Money**

People argue that Bitcoin's deflationary
policy, high fees, and volatility make it ineffective as a medium of
exchange.  If you can expect a Bitcoin to
be more valuable next year, why spend it this year?  If it costs $20 in fees to buy a $3 coffee,
who will use or accept it?  If its value
can double in a day, who will set prices in terms of Bitcoin exclusively?  The truth is, Bitcoin is not yet ready for
mass adoption as a day to day currency or unit of account.  Anyone who tells you otherwise is
getting ahead of the technology -- but this is temporary.

Just as the early Internet could only
handle the transfer of simple text-based content but eventually scaled to allow
everyone to stream 4k at the same time, so too Bitcoin will scale.  The Lightning Network shows promise in this
regard.  It will enable and incentivize
users to stake their Bitcoin on a second layer where payments are negotiated in
a trustless manner between parties, instantly, and merely settled periodically
on the blockchain.  But even with today’s
block congestion and high fees, Bitcoin is _already_
cheaper and more efficient for large transfers of value than the banking system,
especially internationally.  People
transfer hundreds of millions of dollars on the blockchain, securely, _today_.

Regarding volatility, we are still in the
very early phases of adoption.  Something
like 10-20 million people own Bitcoin worldwide.  Because the supply of Bitcoin cannot inflate
to accommodate increased adoption, prices will continue to escalate in
logarithmic fits and starts as adoption ramps up exponentially.  Look up ""adoption curve"" on
Google.  We are still in the very early
phases of the ramp-up, but eventually the curve will taper off and approach
something like stability.  We do not know
how this will play out or how long it will take, and there will be serious
volatility along the way; but if Bitcoin scales into a robust transnational
currency trading on thousands or tens of thousands of exchanges worldwide, it
will likely become more stable than most national currencies if not all.

Regarding deflation: over time, we will
likely see new innovative uses of Bitcoin as a reserve for credit
creation.  People are clearly willing to
operate in systems that use reserve-based lending, and they can work
wonderfully: look at what humans accomplished in the 20th century!  It is conceivable that Bitcoin could be used
as a reserve for distributed, trustless, bank-like networks that issue their
own tokens.  We may end up using a
modestly-inflationary cryptocurrency for day-to-day transactions and
investment.  There’s no way to know what
people will come up with, but they _will_
come up with things.  And that is why
Bitcoin must stay laser-focused on its role as the de facto reserve currency in
the crypto-economy.

 

**A
Vision Statement for Bitcoin**

Tying everything together: over the course
of thousands of years, we have built our societies around the use of
hierarchical principles of organization.
These structures centralize control and privilege, but also risk.  They are fragile.  Too big to fail.

The invention and proliferation of the
Internet paved the way for the dissolution of these structures, and over the
past twenty years we have seen countless examples of entrenched institutions
being wiped out by flatter, more effective networks.

Now we are seeing the early evolution of
global, distributed, _cryptographic_
value storage and transfer networks which will slowly displace traditional
banking systems by offering faster, cheaper, more reliable routes, with better
systemic risk profiles, infinitely better security, no access controls, and no
entrenched monopolistic privileges over money creation.

Bitcoin was the first mover in this space
and remains the incumbent.  It is a
global, secure, consensus-based currency that was bootstrapped from the ground
up by ordinary people volunteering to participate in its development, mining,
and use.  It has grown exponentially in
size since its inception, to the point where it is now upheld by the largest
dedicated computer network in the world.
Because it is secured principally by its unmatched scale, it is
therefore the most secure accounting system in the world, which in turn makes
the entries in its ledger the most trustworthy on the planet.  If you can sign for a Bitcoin in the
network’s eyes, you own it -- and nobody can stop you from owning it or signing
for it.

Bitcoin is here, _now_.  It is in the air all
around us, accessible over wifi and cellular networks around the globe -- anywhere
the Internet touches.  The next time you
walk down the street, look at the people around you.  As they move through the air, displacing it
with their bodies, recognize that they are literally wading through the Bitcoin
network -- they just don't know it yet.

 

**Suggestions
for New People**

1)
Focus first and foremost on the vision and take an interest in the
technology.  I have a friend who is
talking about putting $20k into Bitcoin, yet only a few nights ago he didn't
know that Bitcoin isn't a company, or that a block isn't a single
transaction.  I have another friend who
owns a whole Bitcoin but has never initiated a transaction.  A co-worker of mine just bought $100 worth of
Bitcoin but doesn't know that a wallet is key management software.

2)
Bitcoin is an experiment with no precedent.  Nobody knows if it will survive, what it will
evolve into, or how it will be used.
Even with its long-running track record, nobody can say with prophetic
certainty that it won't suffer a catastrophic failure of some kind, so put only
as much money into Bitcoin as you can afford to lose.  I would offer the following as a good rule of
thumb: if you have a negative net worth (meaning your debts exceed your assets)
be very cautious with Bitcoin, and at the very least do not increase your debt
to buy Bitcoin.  If you have a positive
net worth, do not go negative to buy Bitcoin.
Having said all this, do keep in mind that _any_ currency can suffer a catastrophic failure, including the US
Dollar.  Remember 2008.  Don’t fall for illusions of security.  We are all sailing in little boats on a big
sea.  _Diversify_.

3)  If
you believe in Bitcoin, try not to obsess over the value of Bitcoin in fiat
terms, as tempting as it is.  Try to
conceptualize its value on the basis of its potential utility in emerging
decentralized networks and look for ways to _use_
it in these new emerging ecosystems.
Look up OpenBazaar for example - it could be the new eBay without an
eBay acting as an intermediary.  I
strongly believe that owning Bitcoin is exciting because it sets you up to have
a stake in this emerging ecosystem.  If
your aim is to eventually get your value out of Bitcoin in the form of fiat,
you’ll be giving up that stake.  If you
don't care about having a stake and are here just for the gains, that's
perfectly fine too.

4)
Learn how to take possession of your private keys.  If you don't know what that means or how to
do it, _learn what it means and how to do
it._  Until you can say with
confidence _""I alone own my private
keys""_, you do not actually own Bitcoin and you do not have a
stake.  Someone else owns it for
you.  It took me two years of owning
Bitcoin before I actually clued in and took control of my own, and that is what
forced me to take on the Bitcoin learning curve.  The good news is, you can too.

personalfinance,"Navient ""mistakenly"" removed my Electronic Communications Benefit, also has been raising my interest rate every month.","Greetings PF,

I have a ""Smart Option"" loan through Sallie Mae/Navient. I checked my account details a few days ago, and noticed that I was ""disqualified"" from the Electronics Communications Benefit (ECB), which is a 0.25% interest rate reduction. I contacted them about it last week, and today they finally answered that it was a mistake and the ECB will be reinstated. 

The problem is that now I can't see at what point in time the ECB was removed, and how much interest I was charged because of it. I have all the statements from the past year, but the interest rate is variable, so I can't really tell where the deduction was removed. How can I get them to give me this information?

Furthermore, I noticed that as I've been paying down my principal (auto-paying every month, never late), my interest rate has gone up EVERY month (from 10.125 December 2016 to 10.75 this month). I don't know if this is a common thing, but it would appear they're doing this in order to keep milking money out of me (big surprise). Is there anything I can do about this, or is it a moot point due to the terms of the variable interest rate in the loan contract?

personalfinance,"Overwhelmed, desperate, determined to rid student loan debt- PLEASE HELP","I've been an r/personalfinance lurker for a while now and I'm floored to see how some of you navigate the student loan swamp (with some cash and integrity left in tow). I'm in a desperate place and willing to do nearly anything to help this situation.

Short backstory: First generation immigrant who completed a 4-year degree at a very expensive private university. Took out a flurry of private student loans with the naive assumption I would be able to pay back immediately following graduation. Finished my degree in the humanities (which I don't regret), but struggled severely with employment or underemployment. Completed an americorps program to offset federal student loan debt (under 30k) with cosigners unable to help in any capacity. I'm looking at ~150,000 in private loans- the main fuckers I'm trying to tackle.


Luckily, my employment situation steadily improved in recent months. I have been networking as much as I can- landing me opportunities otherwise unlisted or recently posted by credible organizations. I even have a second interview for somewhat of my dream job later this week.


In the meantime, my creditors are on my back. My credit score has completely tanked. I have no idea how to pay this back or if refinancing is possible given the terms of my private loans. I have no idea what to do first......I'm so colossally behind. Altogether I have 6 student loan distributors (including my university). I have already chastised myself for making poor financing decisions in the past- eagerly attempting to move forward with my life.

personalfinance,401(k): Traditional vs Roth?,"24, graduated last December and started work in February, new to the game and looking to learn more about retirement saving. The general advice I see here is to:

1) Max employer contribution to 401k

2) Pay off high-interest debt

3) Max Roth contribution (5.5k in 2017)

4) Max traditional contribution (18k in 2017)

My question is: Why is Roth prioritized (in general) over traditional for workers under the cutoff for Roth contributions? 

I understand the sentiment for Roth that you take advantage of a lower tax bracket now with the idea that in the future you'll be in a higher tax bracket. I'm not sure the numbers make sense to me though. 

Intuitively, I would expect that the larger pre-tax contribution now would have compounding gains that would out-weigh those of a smaller after-tax contribution now with no taxes later. At this moment, I pay ~30% combined federal/state/county income tax (assuming new senate bill values). Based on my career goals, I could reasonably expect to reach ~33% and could reach as high as ~40% (though not as likely as staying in ~33% is) at max expected income. If I'm effectively investing 30% more due to pre-tax contributions into traditional 401k, I'm not sure how even worst case (40%) tax on it later would make a Roth IRA worth it. Surely the compounding gains on a larger account would more than make up the 10% max difference in taxes paid, much less a 3% difference?

Am I thinking about that correctly? Please rip my thought process to shreds.",finance
gaming,AAA games are not only becoming pay-to-win. It is now an industry standard for them to be pay-to-finish,"This has been going on for some time now which is why I have gotten to this point of wanting to talk about it.  For me the straw that broke the camel's back was Destiny 1.  After gutting the game and effectively repackaging it is The Taken King it was clear to me that the games industry has been moving in the wrong direction.

&amp;nbsp;

This is not a rant against DLC mind you.  I love DLC that adds value to a game.  Diablo 3 reaper of souls added a whole new act.  Dark Souls 2 and 3 dlc added substantial amounts of of playtime to the experience.  But games like Destiny and Battlefront have incorporated pay-to-finish/win into the business model.  I was quite literally turned off of AAA titles for some time when Destiny 1 was released unfinished.  Now it appears that Bungie has failed to learn the lessons from the past, locking Destiny 2 players out of the end-game by arbitrarily raising the level cap in the DLC.  

&amp;nbsp;


This is a whole different level of opportunism in gaming and I think that we as gamers are seeing this happen to our beloved titles and are doing something about it.  I think that gaming industry needs to do some soul-searching and figure out what is the true cost of a video game.  What rubs a lot of people the wrong way here is that the true cost of the game is not disclosed when you buy the original disc for $60.    


&amp;nbsp;

Games nowadays cost $80 - $100 on AVERAGE with regards to season passes and DLC.  Games don't cost $60 anymore **when they have dlc planned** and we need these companies to start being more honest with the consumers.  I would much prefer that the full game release for $80 rather than 3/4 of the game releasing for $60.  Video games and the myriad costs associated with their production have not adjusted for inflation on the price-tag.  Rather we are forced to eat the cost later when dlc comes out or opt-in for the season pass. 

  
&amp;nbsp;

This is an ethical dilemma because it makes a portion of the install base feel like they were short-changed.  I know I felt that way with Destiny 1.  I never played The Taken King and I refuse to buy Destiny 2.  These companies haven't learned and I won't be the one to go back to the abuser after I have already been abused once.  

&amp;nbsp;

Edit:  I feel it necessary to also point out that games like Dark Souls (which full disclosure I enjoyed) did something I don't agree with. They had dlc planned that artificially raised the true price of the game.  I for one am fed up with this dishonest practice.

TL;DR

&amp;nbsp;

- AAA games have become not only pay-to-win but pay-to-finish

- AAA games with planned DLC need to include that DLC in the price-tag rather than artificially lowering the price then including a ""season pass""

&amp;nbsp;

- Gamers must vote with their wallets and voice their vote wherever possible to show these companies that we won't be taken advantage of anymore!  We have to speak up for the young gamers out there who don't know better.  We are the adults!

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: 

&amp;nbsp;

- AAA games don't cost $60 anymore

- On-disc dlc locked behind a paywall is bad practice and unethical",technology
personalfinance,Help with a Buy/ Rent Housing decision,"have posted before and the focus has shifted to my student loan amount. Lets not get on that topic, as it is not changing anytime soon, and will be paid off in 10 years(which is the norm).
So I have graduated dental school and so has my fiancé and woohoo, thats great! I currently live in upstate South Carolina, and she lives in the middle of the state, both with our parents and she's finishing up her residency Summer of '18. We are getting married in May of '18 and then are planning on moving to Charleston to settle down with jobs, a place to live, other life things, etc.
So here are my stats I guess. Around 400k of student loans, she has around 200k. Interest rates are around 6-8 percent (they are spread out by about 4 different loans and each one is around 6, 7, and 8% at the highest.) I dont have any other debt currently. I have a car that is paid off and should be fine for years with the occasional maintenance. Like I said we are both living with parents for the next 5 months until wedding time/move time. I have been working since July and have saved up about 10k in that time. I know there will be some expenses in the future such as possible down payment for house, wedding things, and honeymoon. My monthly loan payment is a little under 3k a month, but I've been making it an even 3k to pay a little extra bc I can, currently.
So we are looking at moving in 6 months. But we aren't sure if we should buy our rent. We want to stay in Charleston permanently for as long as I can foresee. Suntrust bank has spoken to us many times in the past about their ""Doctor Loan"" for mortgages that involves no down payment up to 500k for a house to maintain some capital while they know doctors are trying to set up shop and start a life/practice. Fiancé is concerned that having house is too much of a financial stress with a mortgage payment and all, as opposed to the rent payment. It seems that a rent payment is marginally different at best than a mortgage payment and to me, it seems like a big waste of money, since we would move in a year or two and throw away all that money. I know its a complicated question and answer, but I'm just seeking some clarity and advice. You guys always give good advice and know way more than me. Keep in mind all I Know is medicine and they dont teach any business or finance classes so Im in the dark besides what I've learned here. If it helps, I would say the average house price where we are looking is between 280-400k or at least thats where we've set our limits",finance

personalfinance,Investments as a 21 year old,"Hey PF

So lately, out of pure interest, I’ve been reading a lot about investing and decided I should delve into it

For a bit of a background, I am 21 years old and a senior in college and will be graduating in May of 2018

At the moment I work part time, 20 hours a week and bring home a little over 1k/Month. I am currently putting 6% of my paycheck in a 401(k), which is the max my company will match.

I have already accepted a job for after I graduate that will begin around July of 2018 with a salary of 62k/yr with about 4k in relocation every year (ill be moving every year for 2-3 years)

So currently, I have about 9k in a checking account and another 4.5k in a savings account. I am pretty proud of the money I have been able to save up, especially while paying for my own rent, food, gas, etc (really everything besides car/cell phone bills).

Finally, I do have some unsubsidized student loans that I want to pay back in the near future that currently amount to 9.5k (3*2.75k loans + 1.2k interest). These loans have an interest rate of 4.660% (is that high?)

The year is coming to an end I have been reading up about IRA’s (specifically Vanguard Roth) and was wondering if now is a good time to start depositing some money into an account like that (since it’s December and I would need to deposit before the years end) since it seems to be whats recommended for young people with low salaries.


What should I do? Focus on my loans? Is the interest on my loans considered high? Is the Vanguard Roth IRA a good investment for me, and if so, should I be depositing the maximum $5,500/yr? Are there better investments for me out there?

All help and advice is appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,"Almost Under Water, Need Some Advice","Good morning /r/PersonalFinance ! I need some advice. 
  
I recently submitted my IDR Re-certification for my Student Loans, and today I got the recalculated payment amount... it's increased from $70 to $277. My wife and I can pay this, but we'll be pushing it. 
    
I'm hoping I can get some advice on what to do here. Below is a breakdown of our monthly income and expenses. 
      


Wife's Income: ~$1000 WK 1 and 3   
My Income: ~$900 WK 2 and 4  
    
Car Payment: $450 ($225/2wks)  
Car Insurance: $150  
Credit Card Minimums: ~$500 (Can't access my wife's accounts from work, so I can't solidly verify this number... but I know this is close)   
Netflix: $10 
Gas: $80  
Food/Groceries/Etc: $200  
Student Loans: $220 (Wife + Current Amount for Me)
To Savings: $400  
""Vices"" (My name for superfluous leisure expenses): $250
    

Total Income Per Month: ~$3800


Total Expenses Per Month: ~$2260
  



These totals are why I need help! On paper, we should have - at minimum - $1500 left to pay extra towards our debts each month. However, it always seems like we're barely staying afloat. I've done up a spreadsheet once or twice to calculate what we *actually* spend each month, and I'm still lost. Even taking into account all of the small swipes at convenience stores, coffee shops, and restaurants, we supposedly should have had $1000 left in October... but we were broke. 

Our credit scores aren't good enough to consolidate the $10k in Credit Cards into a lower monthly payment/interest rate personal loan, and refinancing the 11% Car Loan has fallen flat on its face twice now. I'm lost, and when this higher Student Loan payment kicks in in January, I'm concerned about what will happen.

personalfinance,$25.5k 401k rollover to IRA or use against school loans with 6.5-7% interest rates,"Hi All, first time PF poster here and my current situation is this:

A financial adviser that partners with my previous employer reached out to me regarding rollover of my 401k mentioning either going into an IRA or having my current company handle the rollover into their plan. This is the first time I've had to deal with rollover of a 401k. 

I will be meeting with him to discuss things further next Friday, but what I wanted to ask PF beforehand was whether it might be advisable to cash out the roughly $25.5k balance and take whatever penalties and tax hits come with that and allocate that sum towards paying down the various 6.5-7% school loans I have outstanding (which in total exceed that $25k-penalties sum of the 401k I would take out, but would still be a large chunk out of the loans with only a few thousand remaining to pay off).  

I understand that this would qualify as putting my future at risk given it is my retirement savings, but it seems like getting the immediate return on paying off those loans at between 6.5- 7% interest rates could be more valuable than setting that 25k aside to compound over time with the average market return in an IRA. 

Not sure if this contributes to the feedback or not but I am currently 30 years old making $115k/year. 

Please let me know if there is any other info I should include that could impact the responses. Thanks in advance!

Edit 1: appreciate the quick responses! Feels like rolling it will be the best option. Not sure what my IRA options would be, but any suggestions in that area would be helpful(Roth?).

personalfinance,A previous employer f*ed up a profit sharing payout and want money back -- need help understanding taxes!,"I had a profit sharing account with a previous employer. For my four years of employment I was 60% vested. I could choose between a cash payout or transfer to an IRA.  


I decided to take the payout knowing I'd get hit with a very high tax rate. I filled out the paperwork, noting I was 60% vested, and sent it in. A few months later I received a check for substantially more than I expected.  


I waited another few months in case it was a mistake, and when I wasn't contacted I deposited the money and moved on. I paid additional taxes for the payout on my tax return that year.  


Now, another year later, they have contacted me saying that due to an internal error they paid out 100% vested instead of the 60% I was eligible for.  


Here is the financial issue I am facing:  


My 100% vested total was:  
$5,446.78


The check they sent me was less 20% tax that *they* sent to the IRS on my behalf:  
$4,381.57  


My 60% vested total was:  
$3,268.07  


The 20% less tax check they should have sent me would have been:  
$2,628.94  


The company is requesting $2,190.78 returned as a check, which is approximately the full pre-tax 100% vested total minus the full pre-tax 60% vested total.  


After I pay this amount they say they will send me a revised 1099-R that I can use to get the excess taxes back that were withheld.  
 

**My question is:** am I responsible for paying them that $2,190.78 figure which includes the portion of tax withholding that ***they*** sent to the IRS in error?

**OR** should I only be responsible for paying them the $1,752.63 post tax difference? ($4,381.57 - $2,628.94 = $1,752.63).
 

My feeling is that the revised 1099-R should show the amount of the payment and withholding that they should have sent me, and they should send in revised documents of their own for the overpayment. Then I would follow up with the IRS for only the *additional* taxes that I paid on my return.


Does anyone have any insight for me about this? I am already very frustrated about this and am really hoping I don't have to deal with the IRS more than I have to.",finance

Bitcoin,Want to know why so many young people are buying Bitcoin?,"Why has Bitcoin septupled in only half a year? Because if it works as promised, it's decentralized and free of the meddling of any government, especially our own government. Notice the financiers all hate it. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon called it a ""fraud,"" and all of the media repeated it. Bitcoin's value skyrocketed after that.

It's because the entire corporate media was unanimous about invading Iraq even though it was based on a lie. That can't be understated - the government knowing and willingly lied to everyone. It wasn't a ""strategical blunder."" Thousands of Americans died, millions of Iraqis dead, leaving it wide open to the worst extremist groups imaginable. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children are being born with defects because of the leftovers of our weapons. No prosecutions, no arrests, no one is punished, nothing changes. We're still at war with even more countries now, and we would be at war with more if not for the protests of citizens.

It's because we now know that Saudi Arabia was involved in 9/11, and because the US govt flew out Saudi royalty right after the attacks, and because that country is our ""ally"" even though they finance Islamic terrorism and have horrendous human rights records. While we're having our own Crucible going on about sexual harassment, Saudi Arabia which treats woman like second class citizens is just okie dokie with us.

http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/politics/house-9-11-sue-saudi-arabia/

It's because financial institutions and banks, who receive billions of taxpayer dollars from the Fed for free and then get to turn around and loan it out to people at interest before inflation has devalued one cent of it, while we are trillions in debt, who deliberately defrauded MILLIONS of hardworking people out of their pensions, got slapped with fines the equivalent of a traffic fine compared to how much money they make. No prosecutions, nothing happened, nothing changed, and now members of the government during that time are right back working for Wall Street as consultants. While savings accounts pay less than 1% annual return.

It's because corporations who enjoy record profits have all the power pay hardly anything in taxes and stash all their profits overseas, while the life of the average working American gets shittier and shittier.

It's because grads with student loans were preyed upon with high interest loans because the government let them, and because public university raised their tuition to extortionate higts because the government let them, and sold a bill of goods about how everyone needs a college education only to enter the worst job market in generations with debt so high just to get a B.A. you'd think they just finished medical school. and its one of the only if not the only types of debts that wont go away with declaring bankruptcy, interestingly enough.

It's because while the GOP is trying to push through a tax bill that's going to cheat even more Americans out of their wealth, including teachers deducting classroom supplies that they have to buy themselves because public budgets already dont pay for it, all the ""liberal"" media can talk about is some BS conspiracy theory about Russia that is shown again and again to be [completely baseless](https://theintercept.com/2017/12/09/the-u-s-media-yesterday-suffered-its-most-humiliating-debacle-in-ages-now-refuses-all-transparency-over-what-happened/), and polls have shown that only 6% of Americans consider it a top priority, yet thats all you see on the news every single day.

It's because our government of our so-called free country decided that they can decide what substances people can put in their bodies, and therefore created the largest gulag state known to man, where we imprison more people per capita than any other country in the world - more than China, more than Russia, more than North Korea - with 4.4% of the world's population we imprison 22% of the world's prisoners. Nearly one out of 100 Americans are behind bars at any given time.

It's because the only politician in our lifetimes that actually seems like he gives a crap about people and not just money was betrayed, cheated and railroaded by our own ""liberal"" media and our own ""liberal"" political party, and those who supported him were bullied and manipulated and lied to and insulted and discredited, and are still are, and no one seems to care.

It's because we're supposed to praise the gods for having been delivered crappy, byzantine and overpriced insurance, because even though we're the wealthiest country in the world, and even though the vast majority of voters want single-payer, both political parties have infinite numbers of reasons and excuses of why we can never have that.

Any advice on debt consolidation would be very much appreciated! 

[EDIT] Reposting this up here in case anyone else cares to dissect my monthly expenses. Please though keep in mind that budgeting is only part of it. My interest rates are also a huge part.

I make about $2,900/mo after taxes. Here are my approximate monthly expenses:

$1,100 rent,
$200 utilities,
$120 bus/subway,
$230 dog-walker/dog food,
$50 subscriptions/services (some for work),
$100 MasterCard interest,
$175 MasterCard min payment,
$230 AmEx interest,
$350 AmEx min payment,
$270 Chase monthly payment (only two payments left)

Total expenses:
$2,825 while paying off Chase card,
$2,555 after Chase is paid off mid-Feb

This leaves about $75/mo for food (a bit more come March) and obviously it isn't enough, so I use a credit card for that and any other extraneous expenses, which is why my balances have stayed the same for so long.

In case anyone wants to know, my credit score is 696. Good. Not terrible. I make 99% of my payments on time. Would I get a lower interest late on a personal loan (lower than 24%)? And if so, can anyone recommend a bank/service/credit union?",finance

Here are my expenses for M1:
Tuition $54k
Living Expenses/Supplies: $28k

My plan:
Use Roth, IRA and Savings Bonds to pay for tuition for M1 and M2. 
Use brokerage to pay for living expenses M1 and some of M2 (Keep 5-10k of cash as an emergency fund)
M3-M4: use GradPlus and Unsubsidized Stafford for tuition and living expenses. I’m not particularly fond of GradPlus due to the high origination fee and interest rate. If you all know of better options, let me know. 

I have looked into other ways to pay for medical school, but do not see myself doing HPSP, IHS, NHSC. I want to keep my options open for specialties and don’t want to be “locked” into any service obligation. If I find myself liking work at a 501c3 during residency and after, I may try to do the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program if it makes financial sense.

So here is my background: I am a 25 y/o about to graduate from nursing school. Like I said in the title, I have $30,000 in loans, $2,000 of which came from my grandparents. All of the loans are federal and so the highest interest rate I have is 4.5% (I have also been working throughout school and paying off the interest as I go so I have no current interest built up). I will be receiving a check for a little more than $7,000 this week thanks to some scholarships and grants and such.


I am 90% confident that I will have a job by February and making roughly $4,000/month after taxes (again, rough estimate but I think pretty close).


My parents have been gracious enough to let me live with them for the next year and a half or so (they didn’t put a time limit on it, that’s more my own personal time limit, gotta spread my wings at some point). Another thing that I am super indebted to my parents for is the fact that they have let me borrow one of their cars throughout school and will let me keep borrowing it until I have a job; however, I WILL be in the market for a car once I start working. My plan is to purchase a reliable used car, such as a Toyota Corolla, for around $5,000 (crossing my fingers I can find a sweet deal).


While working, I have been contributing 15% of my paycheck into a Roth IRA and have almost $1,700 invested in there in a few different ETF’s. 


Here are some of my short-term future goals: number one, I would LOVE to be debt free as soon as possible (1.5-2 years would be incredible). While working, I want to continue to contribute 15% to my Roth and also max out the 401(k) offered by my employer. I want to start to build up an emergency fund but am unsure how much to put into it given my current situation.


Here are some questions I have in regards to that $7,000 I’m about to get:

• Should I sock the majority of that money into my loans?

• Should I pay my grandparents first? They are not hurting for the money by any means but I like the idea of paying off family first.

• Should I put some of that money away for a down payment on a car? I have really good credit and my dad has told me that he would co-sign a loan for me; how much does a down payment affect the interest rate I would get on a loan if I have the good credit and a co-signer?

• Should I put the majority into my Roth? 7% return definitely beats a 4.5% rate on my loans, but does it beat the peace of mind? I also just had the thought that it might be nice to max out on my Roth before the fiscal year is over (I can still contribute about $3,800).

• Unrelated to the $7,000: how much should I plan on putting into an emergency fund? I know it depends on things like monthly living expenses but those will be very low for me (food, loan/car payments)

personalfinance,[Advice] Student loans and where to take them out / Refinancing?,"I know that I should take the lowest rate offered to me but when doing research on student loans I felt rather lost. I need recommendations on where (or where not to) take out student loans. From what I understand, every time we apply for a loan, it lowers my cosigner’s score, which she probably
does not appreciate. I’d really like to hear any good or bad experiences that people have had with X company, or companies that are known for lower rates. I have to use a company that gives deferral until graduation. 

Also, I do not at all understand how refinancing works. I am in my freshman year of college and my dad told me just to take out any loan that accepts us, regardless of the rate, and refinance it later. Is that smart? How long do I have to wait to refinance it and how exactly does it work? I know that refinancing gives you a lower rate somehow, but I don’t really get the way it works. 

I really want to go about this cautiously because I am the one that’s going to pay it off eventually, so I would really appreciate any advice.

When it came time to decide what to do with my life, I thought I’d get into the sciences because it pays better—and I really liked science. However, about 3/4 of the way through my Bachelor of Science, I realized that I’m way more passionate about art, and art is something I can excel at, instead of just being decent at (like science). 

I’ve applied to film school for special effects makeup and prosthetics, and I’ve been accepted!

The school I’ve been accepted into is great, but the tuition for the program is $31k, and the school is in a city that’s really expensive to live in. 

Is there anything I can be doing to improve my finances so I’m not crippled by loan payments when the time comes? I have about $10,000 in the bank at the moment, from leftover loans I’ve collected. Should I be investing any of this, and cashing in the investments for loan payments? Should I use it to pay off a large lump of loans to reduce interest? Should I use some to visit the States and sell my eggs? Should I hang on to it as a safety net in case it takes a while to find a job?

Bitcoin,Long time detractor but now I'm starting to believe. And it scares me.,"I always thought Bitcoin was a great idea. Like a huge step forward. But as I have some experience both in applied crypto and a little bit of finance, I thought it had a few critical problems, most importantly volatility and bandwidth. I thought there would be some other solution with that in mind.

After recent developments (futures) (volatility hedging) and upcoming technologies (like Lightning) it seems Bitcoin itself is going to be the thing. I'm also quite impressed by how the community is evolving the protocol. The obstacles are soon to be gone, if not by these by something else (options and other protocol improvements).

But this also worries me. Currently we are living in a huge bubble. Many governments have been over stimulating their economies with near zero interest rates and expanding their spending. Central banks have huge balance sheets after multiple QE programs. And both governments and banks are at the lowest on public support confidence. Bitcoin could be the pin prick that could trigger a huge collapse.

But who knows, sometimes something like this has to happen to have real change.

About two years ago, I was a passenger in a friends car when we got into a pretty bad accident due to black ice. I am embarrassed to admit that I am now scared to drive my tiny car. I live in a snowy climate and the large SUV's and trucks are scaring me in traffic. My general anxiety about driving has been getting worse over the last few months... I'm starting to swerve or brake when another car get's too close, and I know this isn't safe for me or any other drivers. My therapist has suggested I sell my car and buy something bigger. I have been looking at used Foresters (they sit high off the ground and preform well in snow) with less than 50k miles, which cost about $15-17kUSD.

My current vehicle: I am currently making payments of $195/m on an auto loan with an interest rate of 0.99%. The vehicle is a 2012, and I bought it in 2013 (I refinanced last year due to financial hardships). The loan is scheduled to be paid off in about 2-3 years.

We just closed on a re-fi to renovate about a month ago before I found out about this job offer. Currently I hate my job because of the lack of any real work to do. I have zero work or responsibility. Some people may say that is a dream job but I hate coming to work and staring at a computer screen and not doing anything tangible. Aside from that, there are no growth opportunities at my current job. 

A little backstory about myself, I served 10 years in the U.S. military and also have a retirement coming in (medical) from that. 

I am being offered a position in Massachusetts that is federal, so my military time will count towards that. The position is paying nearly $25,000 more as well. I am not sure if this is a no-brainer due to the cost of living (Gloucester MA, vs. Seattle, WA). I would like to buy a house within a few months of going there but am not sure if I should take the plunge or if I would even be eligible to buy a house. The last thing I want to do is move my family all the way across the country to live in a 1 BR/1 BR apartment because I have made a foolish decision. 

I have found cheap places to stay around Gloucester for the time being and have done the math on what it should cost for me alone to go out there for a few months while my wife and kids close business out here in Seattle. We have $11,000 in savings at the moment and plan to put every extra penny I earn into savings as well. My wife works a good job that pays about $50,000 that she will have to give up to move.

personalfinance,Question regarding paying taxes on gambling earnings I lost in the same night.,"A few months ago I was at a casino in Louisiana (I’m from Texas) and hit a $2,200 jackpot.

They took out the state taxes and returned with roughly $2,000 cash and a slip with tax information for when I filed.

Over the course of the next few hours, I had spent the $2,000 back into the casino.

Over the course of the year I won roughly $3,000 (only the $2,000 was large enough to require tax information from the casino) and lost probably $5,000. So a net lose of $2,000.

How does this work when filing? I’ve heard you can claim your wins/loses, but I’m not quite sure how that works. Am I just going to be out whatever the federal taxes would be in $2,200 since the state taxes were claimed by Louisiana? Or do I even have to file it since I never actually deposited the money into an account to show as “earned income” for the year?

Ripple,I've lost 6k worth of USD because of bitstamp,"Hi
I'm totally wrecked by bitstamp... I bought at 0.39, my order didn't work so I had to buy at 0.395. I wanted to sell at 0.449 so I placed a limit order and a few seconds later it reached 0.45 so I thought it was sold but then came the crash... I thought I could win even more when it bounces but I realized something was wrong when I saw my USD balance fall. I couldn't see my order, my ripple &amp; my dollars. I refreshed the page and my order finally opened... too late tho. I tried to sell with an instant order at 0.39 and stop my losses which didn't instantly work so my ripple were sold at 0.37
At that point I didn't lose a lot but later it started to bounce from 0.37. I used an instant order but with the lag, it worked only a few page refresh later and bought at 0.41... Then another crash...

To be honest losing 6k isn't that much, it's just that i'm really fed up with bitstamp. Day-trading makes me gain a lot on other platforms. I joined this one because eth, ltc and btc are cheap but in the end, the volume is so low that even when eth exploses, the price barely moves and so you can't really trade. The thing is that this site also goes down quite often and isn't reactive. I often see my orders appear after a 30s delay

ethereum,Decentralized Law?,"So, here’s your downright crazy read for the day:
I’m super new to the idea of Ethereum but after some cursory reading, I’m getting the sense of “something something decentralized apps”. With that kind of nebulous understanding, I just had a little intuitive jolt:
Would it be possible to use Ethereum as a decentralized means to implement law? I just...I got this glimpse of a world government without lawyers.

As a programmer, I’ve always had this idea in the back of my mind to make a legal language that could be parsed and interpreted by a program. Contracts would be written up in code and any disputes would somehow be settled instantly by the code, or maybe by comparing against the code. So, no judges, no lawyers. Only programmers.

I guess the setback to a decentralized world government is the lack of a monopoly on violence...but, maybe laws can be enforced another way.

Another idea I’d always had in the back of my mind was a decentralized government where the individual has the totality of power. In other words, instead of a federal government being the highest power (as in the US), and states second, then local governments, then the individual, etc, what if the precedence of law started at the individual? Complete individual sovereignty.

CSS (cascading style sheets) comes to mind as a rule system where individual entities subscribe to a rule set, but can also override any of the rules for individual purposes.

So, imagine a bunch of people living in an area. By our human nature, we look to cooperate in our community. Someone in the community would write up a contract or charter of sorts detailing general rules they say they’ll be following. Other people would maybe write up their own versions or agree to adopt one of the charters already written. When a person adopts or writes a charter, it becomes law for that person and/or their land. Because we generally look to cooperate, there’s a good probability that a charter with good fitness would be adopted by all members of the community who have the same views. If another group of people have different views in that same geographical region, they could follow their own charter and adopt provisions that allow for cooperation with adjacent and dissimilar charters. In addition to adopting a group charter, the individual could put their own provisions in their charter that details laws specific to their land.

From the standpoint of our current legal system, that would be a huge mess. But, if there was a decentralized system to interpret and process charters instantly and logically, dispute resolution could also be handled instantly. You could look up individual charters instantly. There would be no dispute of who was right and wrong.

Large scale operations, like building a road, would be written up in a charter and then agreed upon by all the individuals whose land the road would reside on. Maybe there can be rules written into the program to facilitate large scale operations, possibly imminent domain. Maybe if a parcel of land has 60% or more of adjacent land that follows a single charter, then that parcel’s charter has to have provisions for cooperation, or something. A program could be written to search through potentially effected charters and output potential conflicts.

I’m not saying I have all the details laid out...and I’m certainly not saying this is a great idea, but there seems to be something here.

Okay, that’s the end of my crazy talk. Is this something Ethereum is built for?

personalfinance,(SPAIN) Seeking for advice - buying property.,"Hi R/PersonalFinance !

I'm a long time lurker of this sub, been reading here for maybe around a decade now but didn't really get to posting until today. I've actually learnt a lot here (no actual real world financial education from my parents or school/university). So ... thanks!

I'm 38yo, male, single, born and lived all my life in Madrid (Spain). No kids and currently no plans to have any.

After finishing university (electrical engineering, control systems/software branch) and after 2 years of jumping around a few jobs, I ended up at a ""big multinational company"" (~100k employees, was almost 200k when I joined) where I have been employed for the last 13 years or so.

I currently make between 52k€ and 62k€ before tax (~39k€-45k€ after tax) + some left over cash from per diem travel allowances that I don't fully spend (I travel often and most of the time to ""cheap"" countries). I have been around these figures for the last decade (at the end of 2007, I gave notice to leave the company, they offered a big salary raise to get me to stay and I accepted --wrong decision, I know... but I was young and had a big mortgage to pay--).

Spain is currently a very big mess. Biggest mess its been in the last ~40 years I'd say. There are many different reasons for this, that I don't really want to get into, but IMHO at the root of all is the housing bubble burst that happened after the Lehman Brothers default in summer 2008 due to credit restriction.

At the peak of the bubble (2006-2007), prices for flats in ""not too centric but not too far away from the city center"" boroughs where middle class historically has lived were around 5000€ per square meter. A few years before that, during the spring of 2004 I bought a small 1 bedroom (50 sq meter under roof) penthouse (20 sq meter terrace) that was still to be built in a newly developed area for ~280k€. After 2 years the building was completed and I moved in during late 2006. 

At the end of 2014 I sold the place. It was OK to live there, but lack of space was starting to be an issue. I took a ~20% global loss in the operation (~55k€) but that wasn't really a big issue since I had almost finished paying for the mortgage (about 30k€ left) and had lived there for 8 years (renting would have been cost more). The price fall for property in Madrid was ~35% from the peak so I thought I was ""doing good"" and decided to sell and move on.

I moved into a bigger place (rented, 1k€/month) where I have been happily living for the past 3 years. I'm saving about 15k€-20k€ per year. No major expenses forseen in the short future. I already own a car (paid) that is 18 years old but still rock solid (Audi with TDI engine from 1999, I'm sure it would outlast me as long as I continue to maintain it properly).

In a few days, I have to sign a new rent agreement with my landlord (which I will do, already agreed with him on keeping the exact same terms). This has made me think about starting to get serious about buying a place to live in again.

In total, I have ~300k€ savings. Flats I'd buy and think would be OK to live in in the long run would cost me around 400k€ in total. Perhaps could bring that figure down to 350k€ but not easily without making some sacrifices that I'm doubtful about. I can't stop thinking that if I make them, then after a few years I'll want to sell and buy again to move up another (final?) step.

I still think prices in Madrid are way above what they should be. IMHO market prices for property I'm interested in should be at least around 30% less than what they currently are.

Salaries and job security have plummeted during the last 10 years. Unemployment rate is around 20%.

According to Spanish law, and despite the labor law change from 2012, there is still quite a ""generous"" severance package if you are fired for non-disciplinary reasons. Depending on the reason for getting fired you get 20 days salary (some conditions need to be fulfilled by the employer) or ~45/33 days salary (just plain lay-off for no good reason) for each year in the company before 2012/after 2012. This would be something like 38k€-75k€ (tax free) for me as of today.

If I lose my job then it would be very, very hard to get a similarly paying job. I'm confident I could find another job in Madrid but maybe making only 35-40k€/year before tax. My employer is globally in deep financial trouble, despite my division and office still makes profits every year. They have been making cost reductions for several years now, i.e. hiring people with little to no experience and paying low salaries, deeply under-staffing projects, abusing the use of external (cheaper) resources, offshoring work packages to cheaper offices (India, Bangkok). From a technical perspective I'm well considered (at least I think so) but I'm also aware that I am considered to be ""expensive"". Work load is simply off the charts and recently I have had a few issues with middle management (they all think I work 100% for them or their projects and -of course- nobody takes care of resource allocation from a global perspective). Nothing too bad but there have been some recent sparks.

The 400k€ flat I'd buy would nowadays go onto the rental market for perhaps 1.1-1.2k€/month. That is over 30 years rent to buy without even considering costs due to owning the flat (property tax, etc...)!

I feel dumping most of my savings into buying a flat is not the greatest of ideas. Currently I sleep very well with 300k€ savings in the bank. Could live for maybe 15 years from that + lay-off package + unemployment benefits in the worst case scenario (no new job found). 25+ years if I downshift to some degree. Help from family could perhaps exist if I end up in the worst case scenario but I'd rather not count on that for decision making (not really sure if it would actually happen and also have some strong doubts about financial health within my family).

In the case of buying and considering interest rates for typical mortgages are ~1% (variable rate) with no signs of them going up in the short-mid term I'd put ~100k€ upfront and take a variable rate 300k€ (80%) mortgage that would have 1k€/month payments for 30 years. Keep 200k€ in the bank to be used to absorb financial hickups or payoff the mortgage early and keep adding to it every month.

Any thoughts?

Would you start seriously looking into buying again or just stay renting for the next few years before re-considering?

If the decision is to buy, would you put down more money upfront? (less is not really possible without a non-negible raise of the interest rate).

personalfinance,"0% car loan, 0 down, 6k down payment, GAP insurance?","All,

I have found myself in a non-standard situation with a new car purchase. Myself and my spouse do a lot of camping and road trips on weekends and vacations, and drive several days with our 2 dogs to see family during the holidays. Also, we have a house and having a vehicle that can fit large items is convenient. This vehicle was purchased to replace an older vehicle that was used for the above functions, however it had become unreliable. My other current car is a daily driver, a paid off 10 year old Honda Civic in good condition and 160,000 miles on it that I expect it to run for another several years. I also have 3k saved up for car repairs on the Civic. 

I was expecting a 2.29 interest rate through my credit union, so I had 6k saved for a down payment and worst case budgeted $415 a month for a 5 year loan. However I took advantage of a 0% loan through the car manufacturer and decided to put 0 down on the 63 month interest free loan. Also, I was also able to negotiate a price with the dealer that was under what I expected to pay (invoice cost on the options I wanted and no labor charges for install). The loan and price was a good deal due to it being the end of the year and the manufacturer wanting to move cars to make room for next year’s major redesign of the model. 

I am now wondering if I should buy GAP insurance because the loan is more than what the vehicle is worth. I wasn’t expecting to buy GAP insurance as I was going to put enough down for that to not be needed. I do plan on keeping my downpayment in a savings account and realize I could self insure with that money. However, it will take about a year and a half for the monthly payments to break even with the auto insurance payout. I am mainly worried about the car getting the car totaled from some freak accident. Also, it is winter time and we drive around the mid Atlantic region of the east coast where there is enough winter weather to cause accidents but not enough for everyone else on the road to know how to drive in winter conditions. 

The dealership is offering GAP insurance for $700+, which is insane, so I am getting quotes from independent insurers. I am hoping to get a quote for not more than $350.

CryptoCurrency,"My Collection of information for when someone states where does Bitcoin, or Crypto-currencies derive their value","Let’s start with some basics first then we can move forward. Your question is where does Bitcoin derive its value from? Well that is a multifaceted answer. Its Utility creates the demand, plus it has a relatively high scarcity, but that is an over-simplified answer. A few other factors need to be addressed.  The first point is the security of the block-chain, and the second is the openness of the block-chain which is derived from the public ledger. It literally records every transaction for public records which are available to any, and everyone to review. This allows it to stand up to public scrutiny, and a thorough technical analysis.

We will start here for you. This is the basis of the whole concept.

A Block-chain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. By design, block-chains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. A block-chain is defined as an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two, or more parties efficiently and in a verifiable, and permanent way. For use as a distributed ledger, a block-chain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority.

Block-chains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a block-chain. This makes block-chains potentially suitable for the recording of events, medical records, and other records management activities, such as identity management, transaction processing, documenting provenance, or food traceability. The invention of the block-chain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has been the inspiration for other applications. Block-chain also has incorporated the Merkle Tree, and Fast Merkle Trees. A Hash tree or Merkle tree is a tree in which every leaf node is labelled with a data block and every non-leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes. Hash trees allow efficient and secure verification of the contents of large data structures. Hash trees are a generalization of hash lists and hash chains. Demonstrating that a leaf node is a part of a given binary hash tree requires computing a number of hashes proportional to the logarithm of the number of leaf nodes of the tree; this contrasts with hash lists, where the number is proportional to the number of leaf nodes itself. Hash trees can be used to verify any kind of data stored, handled and transferred in and between computers. Currently the main use of hash trees is to make sure that data blocks received from other peers in a peer-to-peer network are received undamaged and unaltered, and even to check that the other peers do not lie and send fake blocks. Suggestions have been made to use hash trees in trusted computing systems. Hash trees are also used in hash-based cryptography.

Hash trees are used in the IPFS, Btrfs and ZFS file systems (to counter data degradation), BitTorrent protocol, Dat protocol, Apache Wave protocol, the Bitcoin and Ethereum peer-to-peer networks,  the Certificate Transparency framework, and a number of NoSQL.

Whether you understand it, or not we will be moving more to this as a standard for all most all industries. Yes, the United States is looking at getting rid of Social Security numbers in favor of your identity being stored on the block-chain, in fact it is already in the works as they are in the research of feasibility stage.

What you need to is familiarize yourself with the following regarding block-chain protocols.


Proof of Work (POW)
A Proof of Work is a piece of data which is difficult (costly, time-consuming) to produce but easy for others to verify and which satisfies certain requirements. Producing a proof of work can be a random process with low probability so that a lot of trial and error is required on average before a valid proof of work is generated. Bitcoin uses the Hash-cash proof of work system.

One application of this idea is using Hash-cash as a method to prevent email spam, requiring a proof of work on the email's contents (including the to address), on every email. Legitimate emails will be able to do the work to generate the proof easily (not much work is required for a single email), but mass spam emailers will have difficulty generating the required proofs (which would require huge computational resources).

Hash-cash proofs of work are used in Bitcoin for block generation. In order for a block to be accepted by network participants, miners must complete a proof of work which covers all of the data in the block. The difficulty of this work is adjusted so as to limit the rate at which new blocks can be generated by the network to one every 10 minutes. Due to the very low probability of successful generation, this makes it unpredictable which worker computer in the network will be able to generate the next block.

For a block to be valid it must hash to a value less than the current target; this means that each block indicates that work has been done generating it. Each block contains the hash of the preceding block, thus each block has a chain of blocks that together contain a large amount of work. Changing a block (which can only be done by making a new block containing the same predecessor) requires regenerating all successors and redoing the work they contain. This protects the block chain from tampering.

The most widely used proof-of-work scheme is based on SHA-256 and was introduced as a part of Bitcoin. Some other hashing algorithms that are used for proof-of-work include Scrypt, Blake-256, CryptoNight, HEFTY1, Quark, SHA-3, scrypt-jane.


Proof of Stake (POS)
Proof-of-stake (POS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency block-chain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. In POS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen via various combinations of random selection and wealth or age (i.e. the stake).In general, a proof of stake algorithm looks as follows. The block-chain keeps track of a set of validators, and anyone who holds the block-chain's base cryptocurrency (in Ethereum's case, ether) can become a validator by sending a special type of transaction that locks up their ether into a deposit. The process of creating and agreeing to new blocks is then done through a consensus algorithm that all current validators can participate in.

There are many kinds of consensus algorithms, and many ways to assign rewards to validators who participate in the consensus algorithm, so there are many ""flavors"" of proof of stake. From an algorithmic perspective, there are two major types: chain-based proof of stake and BFT-style proof of stake.

In chain-based proof of stake, the algorithm pseudo-randomly selects a validator during each time slot (every period of 10 seconds might be a time slot), and assigns that validator the right to create a single block, and this block must point to some previous block (normally the block at the end of the previously longest chain), and so over time most blocks converge into a single constantly growing chain.

In BFT-style proof of stake, validators are randomly assigned the right to propose blocks, but agreeing on which block is canonical is done through a multi-round process where every validator sends a ""vote"" for some specific block during each round, and at the end of the process all (honest and online) validators permanently agree on whether or not any given block is part of the chain. Note that blocks may still be chained together; the key difference is that consensus on a block can come within one block, and does not depend on the length or size of the chain after it. This is what Ethereum is moving to later in 2018.

Advantages of POS over POW
No need to consume large quantities of electricity in order to secure a block-chain ( it's estimated that both Bitcoin and Ethereum burn over $1 million worth of electricity and hardware costs per day as part of their consensus mechanism).
Because of the lack of high electricity consumption, there is not as much need to issue as many new coins in order to motivate participants to keep participating in the network. It may theoretically even be possible to have negative net issuance, where a portion of transaction fees are ""burned"" and so the supply goes down over time.
Proof of stake opens the door to a wider array of techniques that use game-theoretic mechanism design in order to better discourage centralized cartels from forming and, if they do form, from acting in ways that are harmful to the network.
Reduced centralization risks, as economies of scale are much less of an issue. $10 million of coins will get you exactly 10 times higher returns than $1 million of coins, without any additional disproportionate gains because at the higher level you can afford better mass-production equipment.
Ability to use economic penalties to make various forms of 51% attacks vastly more expensive to carry out than proof of work.

Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS)
Delegated Proof-of-Stake, on the other hand, works slightly differently. It is a more efficient PoS algorithm altogether, and seemingly provides more decentralization when it comes to issuing stake rewards to more people. Moreover, DPOS provides reliably confirmed transactions on the networks that implement this technology. If it were to be added to bitcoin at some point, it could potentially speed up transaction times, even though it would add inflation to the ecosystem as well.

Under the hood, DPOS uses a reputation system and real-time voting to achieve consensus. To be more specific, a panel of trusted parties has to be established, with all of its members eligible to create blocks and prevent non-trusted parties from participating. Delegates, the parties responsible for creating blocks, are unable to change transaction details. However, they can prevent specific transactions from being included in the next network block. This seemingly requires a fair bit of trust, which makes the concept look far less appealing.

However, there is a caveat. Any transaction not included in the next block, or a block failing to create, will mean the next network block is twice the size. In a way, this prevents malicious intent to block certain transactions or blocks being created in the allotted time period. All it does is perhaps slightly delay said transaction or block, but it is seemingly impossible to prevent inclusion and creation in the long run.

Moreover, anyone who behaves in a nefarious way will have their behavior exposed to the public. Community members of the DPOS-capable currencies can vote to have said person removed as a delegate altogether. It appears as if cheating under DPOS rules is not only impossible, but it is not in anybody’s best interest to do so either. It is equally possible to have more or fewer delegates as part of the network, although that may not necessarily be beneficial either. It is always possible to change the number of delegates, though, which is an important factor to keep in mind.

It is also worth mentioning delegates in a DPOS ecosystem are paid for the creation of blocks and inclusion of transactions. However, the delegates can use these funds to pay for marketing or lobbying efforts, which benefit the exposure of the cryptocurrency network as a whole. Network stakeholders determine how much delegates are paid for their efforts.


Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT)
The dBFT (Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance) algorithm

Consensus is about trying to maintain one version of truth. Over time we have transactions that we want to record in this ledger (book of truth). Because block-chains run decentralized around the world, and they receive different transactions at different times, they can often disagree about what is truth.

The key is to get consensus one way or another, otherwise all sorts of bad things can happen (double spending).

dBFT Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance is a fancy and cool name for a solution to getting eventual consensus under certain conditions.

The condition is really simple: as long as less than 1/3 of bookkeeper nodes are BAD actors, you can get eventual consensus and everyone is happy.

That's the main thing to remember, and I'll explain why 1/3 and not 1/4 or any other fraction.

An Analogy - Painting the walls A King has decided to paint the walls of his castle. He's decided it is either going to be Green (G) or Black (B). He doesn't mind which of the two but he wants consistency throughout the kingdom. And he wants all of his sons and daughters to agree on the color.

So he calls his four painters to come over and sends a signed message to his sons and daughters: I am getting my painters to redecorate my walls. I am torn between Green and Black. To resolve this, I want you, my beloved sons and daughters, to agree on the color and tell my painters and they will paint my walls. As soon as a painter hears from you and you can prove that 2/3 of my family agree on a color, she will start painting that color. Good luck.

The painters are all contactable by any of the sons and daughters. However, due to fighting between the family, the sons and daughters don't all talk to each other directly. Instead they pass messages between them. They all connected, just not directly.

Some of the family is evil and they want to get at least one of the painters to paint the wrong color. The family discuss and decide on the following protocol: 1. The oldest member of the family is elected speaker. He or she will communicate the chosen color with their signature.

Everyone will communicate that color to everyone else (until everyone is informed.) along with their signatures. If you hear from 2/3 of people the same color, then you can call any or all of the painters and tell them. If not, wait for some time and then elect the next oldest member as the speaker and repeat.

These signatures are magic and cannot be forged, and also are without a doubt proof that the person did sign it. Proving consensus protection.

With this setup, we can now prove that as long as less than a 1/3 of the family are evil, it is impossible for any of the painters to get a different message to the others and thereby paint the walls inconsistently.

The proof goes like this. Imagine that the evil members of the family belong to a secret clan F and have managed to insert themselves in between the other family members such that the rest of the family is split into two groups, R1 and R2. R1 members can talk to each other and to F but they can't talk directly to R2. And the same for R2. So F is in control here as they can control what information flows from R1 to R2 and vice versa.

In order for them to exact chaos, they need to get 2/3 of the signatures (including theirs) to be Green and Black. Remember, they can sign Green and pass that message to one person and also sign Black and pass that message to another person.

The next bit is really easy. In order to get 2/3 of the signatures, we need the size of F and R1 (the number of people in those two groups) to be &gt;= 2/3 of the total. We also need that to be true for F and R2. That way R1 members think that it's green (for example) and the other group think it's black and they tell the painters and it all goes wrong.

However, because F is less than a 1/3 (remember, 2/3 people are honest), then it's impossible for BOTH F+R1 and F+R2 to be &gt;= 2/3 x N. By using the fact that F+R1+R2 = N (the total number in the family) and a bit of algebraic rearrangement, you can prove that to get two separate consensus you requires F &gt;= 1/3. Ta da - that's impossible as F &lt; 1/3.

dBFT doesn't guarantee consensus in the sense that it's possible the messaging network is broken and people just can't talk to each other. But it gives protection guarantees that if you do reach consensus you can't then reach some other different consensus later. As long as the bad actors are less than a 1/3 of the bookkeepers (the Family), then everything is all good. This is the important part of ensuring the integrity of the system going forward.


Now that we have stated that You will need to read about the following.

Consensus Nodes (Bookkeeper Nodes)
*See dBFT section

Master Nodes
*See Full Node, but used in a POS block-chain. These also pay out fees to you for running a Master Node.

Full Nodes
These are usually POW block-chains

Full nodes download every block and transaction and check them against Bitcoin's core consensus rules. Here are examples of consensus rules, though there are many more:

·  Blocks may only create a certain number of bitcoins. (Currently 12.5 BTC per block.)

·  Transactions must have correct signatures for the bitcoins being spent.

·  Transactions/blocks must be in the correct data format.

·  Within a single block-chain, a transaction output cannot be double-spent.

If a transaction or block violates the consensus rules, then it is absolutely rejected, even if every other node on the network thinks that it is valid. This is one of the most important characteristics of full nodes: they do what's right no matter what. For full nodes, miners actually have fairly limited power: they can only reorder or remove transactions, and only by expending a lot of computing power. A powerful miner is able to execute some serious attacks, but because full nodes rely on miners only for a few things, miners could not completely change or destroy Bitcoin.

Nodes that have different consensus rules are actually using two different networks/currencies. Changing any of the consensus rules requires a hard fork, which can be thought of as creating a new currency and having everyone move to it. Consensus rules are different from policy rules, which specify how a node or miner prioritizes or discourages certain things. Policy rules can be changed freely, and different nodes can have different policy rules. Because all full nodes must use exactly the same consensus rules in order to remain compatible with each other, even duplicating bugs and oddities in the original consensus rules, creating a full node from scratch is extremely difficult and dangerous. It is therefore recommended that everyone who wishes to run a full node use software based on the reference client, which is the only client guaranteed to behave correctly.

At minimum, a full node must download every transaction that has ever taken place, all new transactions, and all block headers. Additionally, full nodes must store information about every unspent transaction output until it is spent. By default full nodes are inefficient in that they download each new transaction at least twice, and they store the entire block chain (&gt;60 GB) forever, even though only the unspent transaction outputs (&lt;2 GB) are required.



Again to give you a slightly different over-simplified answer Bitcoin’s value is derived from the energy it cost to run the block-chain whether its coal-powered, hydro-powered, natural gas powered, or nuclear reactor-powered electricity.

Will Bitcoin be replaced by another block-chain as the reserve standard? Well it’s a possibility, but not likely any time soon. Most new Alt-coins are here to Compliment Bitcoin. Why do I say this? Well the goal is a Decentralized Smart Economy with the least amount of Centralized control possible. The Lightning Network integrates Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Vertcoin.


Bitcoin has 21,000,000 coins when they are finally fully released. This requires ASIC Miners a rather expensive, and specialized Computer. The block times are ten minutes. These for the older versions will still run about $20,000. It may have changed a little since I last looked, but the cutting edge ones will be much more.


Litecoin has 84,000,000 coins when they are finally fully released. This requires ASIC Miners a rather expensive, and specialized Computer. The block times are 2.5 minutes. It’s an improved clone of Bitcoin.


Vertcoin has 84,000,000 coins when they are finally fully released. The average Joe can mine this with a good graphics card. The block times are 2.5 minutes. It’s an modified clone of Litecoin.


Ethereum Is a Smart contract platform. It has many uses cases. Too many to list. This will be moved to a POS block-chain.


NEO Is a Smart contract platform. It has many uses cases. Too many to list. This has a lot of things in common with Ethereum, but at the same time it doesn’t. This uses the dBFT system, and has more common programming languages for Smart Contracts.


ARK this is a Smart Bridge ecosystem. It’s aim is to build bridges to other block-chains. Its aim is to be the hub of this new block-chain economy. Ark has bridged to Bitcoin, and also to Ethereum. They have plans for NEO, and Monero as well in the future. ARK has many other use cases I haven’t discussed, and don’t have time to right now.


These very originally made to compete with each other, but have found ways to coexist, but are also still be competitive with each other at the same time. I have kept this section short. I could spend many more pages writing about these Cryptocurrencies, and many more. These are the building blocks for the Smart Economy.



This is what Bitcoin, and all of the Alt-coins were brought about to fix.


·  People used to pay each other in gold and silver. Difficult to transport. Difficult to divide.


·  Paper money was invented. A claim to gold in a bank vault. Easier to transport and divide.


·  Banks gave out more paper money than they had gold in the vault. They ran “fractional reserves”. A real money maker. But every now and then, banks collapsed because of runs on the bank.


·  Central banking was invented. Central banks would be lenders of last resort. Runs on the bank were thus mitigated by banks guaranteeing each other’s deposits through a central bank. The risk of a bank run was not lowered. Its frequency was diminished and its impact was increased. After all, banks remained basically insolvent in this fractional reserve scheme.


·  Banks would still get in trouble. But now, if one bank got in sufficient trouble, they would all be in trouble at the same time. Governments would have to step in to save them.


·  All ties between the financial system and gold were severed in 1971 when Nixon decided that the USD would no longer be exchangeable for a fixed amount of gold. This exacerbated the problem, because there was now effectively no limit anymore on the amount of paper money that banks could create.


·  From this moment on, all money was created as credit. Money ceased to be supported by an asset. When you take out a loan, money is created and lent to you. Banks expect this freshly minted money to be returned to them with interest. Sure, banks need to keep adequate reserves. But these reserves basically consist of the same credit-based money. And reserves are much lower than the loans they make.


·  This led to an explosion in the money supply. The Federal Reserve stopped reporting M3 in 2006. But the ECB currently reports a yearly increase in the supply of the euro of about 5%.


·  This leads to a yearly increase in prices. The price increase is somewhat lower than the increase in the money supply. This is because of increased productivity. Society gets better at producing stuff cheaper all the time. So, in absence of money creation you would expect prices to drop every year. That they don’t is the effect of money creation.


·  What remains is an inflation rate in the 2% range.

·  Banks have discovered that they can siphon off all the productivity increase + 2% every year, without people complaining too much. They accomplish this currently by increasing the money supply by 5% per year, getting this money returned to them at an interest.


·  Apart from this insidious tax on society, banks take society hostage every couple of years. In case of a financial crisis, banks need bailouts or the system will collapse.


·  Apart from these problems, banks and governments are now striving to do away with cash. This would mean that no two free men would be able to exchange money without intermediation by a bank. If you believe that to transact with others is a fundamental right, this should scare you.


·  The absence of sound money was at the root of the problem. We were force-fed paper money because there were no good alternatives. Gold and silver remain difficult to use.


·  When it was tried to launch a private currency backed by precious metals (Liberty dollar), this initiative was shut down because it undermined the U.S. currency system. Apparently, a currency alternative could only thrive if “nobody” launched it and if they was no central point of failure.


·  What was needed was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This was what Satoshi Nakamoto described in 2008. It was a response to all the problems described above. That is why he labeled the genesis block with the text: “03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”. Bitcoin was meant to be an alternative to our current financial system.


To answer you on if this is a bubble. I personally do not see it that way at the moment. There will always be corrections in Crypto, or any field of Investing. Yes we have seen an unprecedented meteoric rise in cryptocurrencies there will be severe corrections in the future, but there will not be a ninety-nine percent crash like you are stating unless there is another Great Depression, or severe economic collapse.

CryptoCurrency,My opinion from 1.5 months of research into Cryptocurrencies with no investment experience. (Noob),"My thoughts, as an individual
with no financial investment knowledge, after a couple months of research and and a relatively small initial investment a week ago.  Prepare for unnecessary quotation marks!

It’s not about how well any cryptocurrency is “doing right now”.  If you’re new to investment  and looking to “flip” your investment(s) based on media hype or watching your crypto tickers like a hawk, you’re going stress yourself out, lose money, and regret it. 

This is a market that is suited, in my opinion, to individuals with a background in long term Financial Investment, Computer Science, or an Engineering background with an established support network.  I may be wrong, but if you are watching the market fluctuation and waiting to cash out or you’re just now taking interest in investment, then you will eventually end up losing whatever you invested based on the media hype.  Hype can be easily influenced by the majority of holders (HODLERS- I did enough learning from colleagues to get the story of this misspelling) who stand to gain from that financially “backed” exposure.  

The market is currently quite volatile and controlled (think Fed Reserve) by the people who already own the most of the most of the popular cryptocurrencies.  The 2% of BTC owners, aka old money, control “panic sales”, similar to when futures became available Sunday and BTC had a significant drop.  It will happen again on the 18th. These are the entities that can financially influence the media, sell, and artificially inflate whenever they want to.  That or vice versa.  The 2% are like a Federal Reserve with no regulation. (Correct me on this.)

The more you inherently know and the more you research day by day, the smarter you invest and maintain, transfer, or sell off your holdings.  It’s not about the “currencies”.  BTC is having its meteoric rise this year.  The problem with that is that the value of BTC is controlled by 2% of the holders.  Am I right or wrong here?  I genuinely want to know.

From what I’ve learned, the somewhat reliable place to invest is what made ALL of this possible and that is Blockchain tech and the “Tangle” (IOTA) for transaction verification.  One should read the scholarly whitepapers on ALL of these techs before investing in ANYTHING.  The “get rich in 3 years” before Average Joe media influenced inclusion appears to be over.  

At this point, you have to have an objective understanding of how the systems work. Again, this is what I’ve learned in 1.5 months of research prior to an expendable investment with NO stock market or any other sort of investment experience.  Just a person that takes the time to do things the right way.  I’d love to hear any opinions or any contrary insight based on what I’ve said.

personalfinance,"Your friendly reminder that credit score is not an indicator of overall financial health, nor should you pay interest just to bump your score","Hello friendos, and welcome back to another CoolKid PSA post. Credit score can be stressful and even confusing to some people, so I'd like to clarify a few facts about the responsible use of credit, paying interest just to bump up your score, and the concept of diminishing returns. Please note, this guide assumes you've at least *glanced through* the ""credit"" wiki. 

- Responsible use. Start here if you have no credit history or really bad credit. Get a secured credit card, preferably one which you would like to use as a regular credit card as well, and put all gas/groceries/misc living expenses on it. Pay off in full every month to reap the cash back/travel miles/points without paying interest. Repeat until you get upgraded to unsecured.

Myth time!: Many people believe carrying a small balance on your credit card every month benefits credit score. Untrue! If anything, it *decreases* your score by increasing usage %

Edit for clarity: *carrying a balance* means leaving a small balance on your credit card, past the due date, and paying the interest on it. I am *not* advocating for opening a card and then not ever using it. 

- Paying interest just to bump your score. I've seen several people, even users of this forum, advocating for taking out a small personal loan or car loan *for the sole purpose of increasing credit score*. This is entirely irresponsible. While it does work, *paying interest in order to bump your credit score doesn't pay off*. Why, you might ask? Because of the concept of...

- Diminishing returns! If your score is anywhere within the 750s/760s range, you already qualify for the best deals, lowest interest rates, etc. Please note, *even if you are lower than this*, I still wouldn't advocate for paying interest. 

Myth time 2: The Electric Bogaloo!: Many people believe that using the above tactics to increase credit score before a big purchase, such as a car loan or mortgage, will pay off in the end due to a decreased interest rate on that bigger loan. a) Car loans are getting lower and lower, with many credit unions boasting a 1% or even 0% interest rate with a semi-decent score. b) Mortgages can be refinanced. c) using normal credit repair tactics, without paying interest, usually has the exact same effect with a *marginally* longer pay off time.

Edit: Ok folks, yikes. I'm catching a lot of flak for my statements on housing and down payments, so I'm removing it. See my other [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6og0ax/countering_the_rent_is_just_throwing_away_money/) on ""Rent is not throwing away money"" for more on this if you're curious.

Bitcoin,Why are some miners charitable with low fee TXNs?,"**UPDATE**: All the low fee transactions are CPFP, I updated my walker to exclude them now.

Reference: [https://github.com/brianddk/btc-small-fee](https://github.com/brianddk/btc-small-fee)

&amp;nbsp;

There has recently been a number of very good analysis tools / sites related to fee calculation based on mempool fee distribution.  I began to get more interested in fee distribution on confirmed blocks instead.  I believe both pursuits are important.  One gives info on what the **competition** is while the other gives info on what the last **selection** process was.  What I've found is that all blocks seem to include... for lack of a better term... **charitable** transactions.  I'm trying to understand why.  If there is an abundance of fair fee transactions in the mempool, why would a miner include anything else.  The best WAG I can come up with, are the following:

&amp;nbsp;

1. **Off-book incentive** - Perhaps the miners have an off-book incentive to include some transactions that further their business.  Some payment to another pool or their utility company or whatever.  Perhaps the transaction is low-priority as far as the miners are concerned, so they include *some* fee in case some other miner finds it, but really they are just waiting to pick up those transactions themselves.
2. **Too busy to care** - Perhaps the compute cost to actually filter out the transactions is higher than the benefit of excluding them.  To me this is the most likely.  There are good ways to do a *sloppy sort* that would get a selection *mostly* sorted, but not entirely.  I'd imagine a bubble-sort continually running on the mempool, but blocks periodically getting cut before the sort is complete.
3. **Child-pays-for-parent** - Perhaps these low fee transactions are CPFP transactions, and there is a high-fee child somewhere in the block.  I'll need to modify my block-walker to try to flesh this-possibility out.
4. **A perfect fit** - Perhaps the size of the transaction is perfect to allow the block to be at maximum capacity.  For example, if there were 191 bytes space left in the block, it is obviously more profitable to include a low-fee 191 byte transaction, than to just leave that space blank.
5. **Something I don't know** - I accounted for SegWit, and admittedly did not account for CPFP.  Perhaps there is another part of the protocol that makes these TXNs profitable that I failed to consider

investing,Longer term market risks since everyone is asking,"This is from an economic roundtable hosted by Politico last month. Link at the end. Paging /u/Narcolepzzzzzzzzzzzz ...............

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Companies have taken on too much debt**, and if we’re not careful, that could trigger another financial crisis.
In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, when interest rates were kept very low, companies around the world found it easy to raise money by issuing bonds and other forms of corporate debt. Now, as interest rates creep up, there are warning signs that some companies are having trouble servicing their debt. If companies begin to default on their debt and debtholders (including large investors like banks) can’t easily sell off their holdings, that could trigger a 2008-style financial crisis. 

[Corporate debt chart from the St. Louis Fed 1945-2016](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NCBDBIA027N)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Stock markets are too optimistic**, and are not pricing in real political risks, so they are extra-vulnerable to political instability.
Bull markets at a moment of political instability can appear too good to be true. And indeed, the working group economists agreed that the markets are effectively ignoring real risks.

&gt; One participant quoted a credit agency officer who acknowledged being fatalistic about global risk: “Either the risk happens, or it doesn’t and there’s no point in pricing it until it’s so close to happening that you can see the whites of the eyes.”

&gt; The result, the participant said, is that a political crisis, such as a conflict with North Korea, could trigger a stock market crash and a larger global financial crisis.

&gt; “You have asset valuations that are just really out of line with fundamentals and with actual risks,’’ the participant said. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Economic inequality is a real problem.**

&gt; Middle-class malaise threatens the social fabric in both the U.S. and Europe, despite the fact that economies in both the U.S. and Europe are growing. Because of wage stagnation and dimming career prospects, more workers are bailing out of the workforce.

&gt; ""I think that’s the issue,"" said one participant. ""It’s inequality. Lots of people aren’t feeling this recovery, because we haven’t had any wage growth in the U.S. or in Europe.""

&gt; This trend is likely to only worsen in coming decades, as automation reduces the need for many middle-tier jobs.

&gt; “Automation really carves out the middle chunk of jobs, and that exacerbates inequality,” said another participant. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Social mobility is also a real problem.**
On both continents, there’s a palpable sense among workers that they won’t do as well as their parents, and their children won’t do as well as they have. This is fueling a toxic political environment that has fragmented political parties, making it harder for them to respond coherently to economic threats.

&gt; In the U.S., the lack of social mobility appears mostly connected to wage stagnation and the decline of manufacturing. In Europe, by contrast, participants said the roots of the trend are more cultural — driven by fears that immigrants will transform European societies for the worse. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Trade deficits are NOT a real problem.**
Although the participants came from across the political spectrum, they agreed that trade deficits are not a cause for concern, since deficits tend to worsen when the economy is strong and consumers are buying a lot of goods, and that the ebbs and flows tend to balance out over time and between countries. One participant called the trade deficit “a ridiculous metric.”

&gt; “We had a wonderful, wonderful trade surplus during the Great Depression, and we had a yawning trade deficit in the 1990s, when we added 22 million jobs,” the participant said. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Globalization will win in the end … whether some people like it or not.**
Technology and global supply chains mean that our economies will be integrated and interdependent going forward, even if politically we remain at odds.

&gt; “I think all the supernationalism is going to burn itself out in part, because it’s going to be economically unsustainable,’’ said one participant.

personalfinance,How do I intelligently balance out about ~20k sitting in my checking account?,"So I have about 23k sitting in my checking account, and I'm trying to figure out how much to throw at loans/investing and how much to keep. Here's why I'm on the fence.

I just got a big-boy job in August with a $46k salary (over 10 months, not 12) that is only guaranteed until July. There is a good chance I'll have my contract renewed for a slightly higher salary after that, but I really won't know for sure until June. This is in addition to about $2-3k I make with 1099 income per month.

Now, back to my checking account - I want to make sure this money isn't just sitting there anymore and is being used properly, but I don't want to leave myself with the bare minimum in case I don't return to that job and my income fluctuates drastically. So, I'm wondering what the best use of this money (as well as earnings for the next 6 months) is.

* I have $10k worth of a private student loan (and about $1000 paid this year which I assume I can deduct the interest on)
* I have $35k in federal student loans with $7k in interest.
* I have a Simple IRA started through the salaried job with a 3% match but only about $350 put in for the year and no other investments.
* Monthly expenses with rent, utilities, bills, and all that are roughly $1600.

My thought is to put money towards my Simple IRA (if I can make individual contributions to it in addition to my employer match?) and my Private loan to maximize my deductions for 2017, and then once the 2018 quarter begins, pay-off my $10k private loan completely. I'm also wondering if I should put my emergency fund in a savings account that would yield a higher interest (like an Ally account)?

I would love to know how sound this route may be and if anyone has insight on what to do after that, and how to adjust after I've confirmed I've renewed my contract. I've gotten some awesome advice from people on this sub already, thanks in advance for any help!",finance

CryptoCurrency,The major problem with buying crypto through Revolut,"So Revolut have just launched a crypto exchange service where you can buy Bitcoin/Litecoin/Ethereum instantly through their app, and with 'only 1.5% fees' - which is lower than Coinbase. 

However, you're **not allowed** to move any crypto you buy from their exchange to your own wallet. When I questioned support over it they said they will think about it for the future but **they're not planning to allow you to withdraw any of your currency from the app at any point**.

I've got no idea what the implications for this for things like Bitcoin forks or staking Ethereum, but right now it looks as though Revolut will be the ones benefiting from this, they have some vague mention of hard forks in the FAQ and say that they will decide on a 'case by case' basis as to whether they will list the new currency or not - but no mention as to whether they will give existing holders their forked coins. They also don't address Ethereum PoS update, and whether users will have access to coins for staking. 

I imagine they'd only make changes to this system if there was enough noise, but much of their target market probably has little understanding of forking currency or PoS. Overall i'm pretty miffed considering that I paid £70 for premium membership and the privilege of having access to their crypto markets.

Bitcoin,Keeping Your Coin on an Exchange,"I am relatively new to the Crypto world, and as I someday want to buy some coin(s), it has encouraged me to try and learn as much as I can about it. I read this subreddit daily, and one thing that sticks out as kind of a general consensus is to NOT keep your coins on an exchange, which I completely see a good argument for, but I was wondering if there were any good arguments for keeping them on an exchange. (I intend to hodl, not day trade).

I myself have thought of a good reason or two, and I would like to get some people's thoughts or clarification.

Here is my hesitance about having your own wallet: I have read quite a few examples of people having their wallets hacked, and when your coins are gone they are gone. There is no one to blame but you. You have no recourse. Same thing with a wallet being lost or destroyed (unless of course you have backups, assuming no one else recovered them before you have a chance). Furthermore, what is stopping your wallets from being hacked other than very complex keys? I understand that a randomly generated key being protected by a good password is very unlikely to be compromised, but what is stopping some computer program from making 100 billion guesses right in a row? As far as I know, there is no system in place to ""verify you are not a robot"" or locking you out after 10 failed attempts"" and so on. How could there be?

I am not quite sure how it works on Coinbase, as in everyone says ""if it's not your wallet/keys it's not your coin"" but does that not swing both ways? If Coinbase were to get hacked, and they lose a bunch of BTC, who's BTC is being stolen? Remember? It's Coinbases coin and not mine. No matter how much coin they would lose in a breach, would my account not still show I have $X worth of coin?

So unless I'm understanding it wrong, your own wallet = your own exposure, and even though the feds don't insure my Exchange account like they do my bank account, at least if ""my"" coins are stolen, I can have some sort of recourse against the exchange. And even if my account is hacked because I made a crappy password, I still have 2 factor authentication, I still get email alerts about purcased, sales, and transfers.

One last thing: if I have a cold storage wallet, something that has never touched the internet, as soon as I pull funds off/out of that wallet, is it no longer as secure because the private key has been accessed through the internet?",cryptocurrency

My maxed out credit card with Bank of America is sitting at $1,700 with a minimum payment due Jan 7th of at least $39. I missed paying off the credit card entire debt deadline by a day last time I maxed out my credit card earlier this year. Using Credit Sesame it says my credit score is 674 out of 850. 

The CashCall loan was a loan of $2,600. First payment of $271.48 is due Jan 1st and further monthly payments after that will be $388.40. My interest rate is 179.00%.

Like I said come Dec 30th I will be able to pay off one of these and hopefully the other within another month or two. 

I fear hurting my credit score by making the minimum payment on my credit card. But I also fear how much more money I'll spend in the long run with the interest rate on the loan. 

Anyone have any advice? If you need more information I'll be able to reply to comments today.

EDIT: I don't know my interest rate on my credit card, I'll try to find it out when I have a moment. All I know is I got hit with an extra $45 because of that missed day on my credit card. But as you guys have pointed out the loan interest rate is more. 

Also it turns out my parents lied to me when I got my first credit card 6 years ago that making the monthly minimum payments doesn't hurt my credit score that much.

Here's an intraday chart of the NAS100 with each candle representing 60 seconds. Now, as you can see, at 2:00 the market popped with the news of a rate HIKE. This may seem perculuar to new investors and traders seeing as theory will tell you that the reaction should have been opposite, rates up - stocks down.

A tip: The stock market is a discouinting machine, that being the price of stocks try to represent the *present value* of *future earnings*. Given this dynamic, the market ""prices in"" events *well* in advance. That being said, the probability of a rate hike today was pretty much 100% as of last month. A key lesson is that once the Fed makes the move that the market was anticipating, the reaction is often opposite of what theory suggests. This is because the market tends to ""buy the rumor, sell the news"".

The point of this post is to bring to the attention of new investors/traders that the market often acts in contrary to theory and that there is value in contrarian positioning.",finance

If sold, 15% ($7,500.00) would be taken for fed tax. I am unsure what would be taken for state tax. She makes $93,000.00 a year currently. 

The question I have is what would be the better choice to make. Sell, pay tuition and claim tax credit or hold and hopefully continue to collect gains from the stock assuming the market doesn’t turn downward?

An American investment banker was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked. Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them.


The Mexican replied, “only a little while.""

The American then asked why didn’t he stay out longer and catch more fish? 

The Mexican said he had enough to support his family’s immediate needs. 

The American then asked, “but what do you do with the rest of your time?”


The Mexican fisherman said, “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siestas with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine, and play guitar with my amigos. I have a full and busy life.” 

The American scoffed, “I am a Harvard MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat, you could buy several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then LA and eventually New York City, where you will run your expanding enterprise.”

The Mexican fisherman asked, “But, how long will this all take?”

To which the American replied, “15 – 20 years.”

“But what then?” Asked the Mexican.

The American laughed and said, “That’s the best part. When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions!”
“Millions – then what?”


The American said, “Then you would retire. Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siestas with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.”",finance
personalfinance,Pay down student loans before or after applying for home mortgage?,"Hi all. Had a quick question regarding what do do regarding the order of paying off a large chunk of student loan debt and applying for a mortgage. First,  a little background

Gross monthly income: 12k monthly
Fluid cash assets 125k (60k of which recently by inheritance)
Student loan debt: 139k federal loans with average interest rate of 6.55%
Credit score of 771

So,  should I pay down a sizable chunk of my loans off (say 100k) before applying for a mortgage or wait until after pre approval?  Will my debt to income ratio be better if I have 120k in my account or if I pay off most of my loans and only have 25k on my account?  Which will yield the better interest rates for 30yr mortgage?

(I'm not really interested in airlines card at this time because I don't think I travel enough/want to commit to a card with an annual fee at this time). I have Quicksilver Card which is a flat 1.5% back, so if I can up my cash rewards why not. I never carry a balance so I'm doing this solely for rewards, not the interest rates or balance transfer.

I know it's a fairly new card but I'm wondering if anyone has any experiences with it? Is it easy to use/redeem? Any customer service hassles? (I know Uber is notoriously lacking on this but since it's run through Barclays I assume if I had an issue I'd contact them?).

Bitcoin,Startups and Bitcoins in Tuvalu,"The global warming is one the major priorities for Tuvaluans. The islands' highest elevation point is less than five meters above the sea level. It makes Tuvalu one of the first places on Earth to be engulfed by the rising ocean.

Tuvaluan economy heavily relies on payments for fishing rights received from international companies. Tourism industry is almost absent in Tuvalu due to its extreme geographical remoteness. As the result, the number of employed Tuvaluans is reduced to three-four thousands. Central government remains the major source of local jobs. Regular budget deficit is covered by the US.

Formally, tech economy contributes almost ten percent to Tuvaluan GDP. Lease payments for the popular domain name ""tv"" brings in around two-and-a-halve million a year to the local budget. However, Tuvalu has very limited (if any) technology potentials. Lack of industries, tiny population, absence of qualified personnel, low wages and geographical isolation have made Tuvalu the least desirable destination for tech founders. Additionally, Tuvaluan telecom providers use pricey satellites connections, which significantly increases the Internet costs for end-users.

Tuvaluan regulatory system is based on the British law, which creates a better regulatory climate for tech entrepreneurs compare to neighboring Pacific states. However, under the present political, economic, social and demographic conditions the local startups ecosystem is lacking important incentives for grows.

There is no central monetary authority or central bank in Tuvalu. The National Bank of Tuvalu (NBT) carries out some monetary functions for the government and provides banking services for population. However, the Tuvaluan dollar is not an independent currency, and it's pegged to the Australian dollar.

NBT hasn't yet expressed its opinion on cryptocurrencies and trading digital cash as well as organizing ICOs both are technically legal in Tuvalu. However, there's a little doubts that, if necessary, NBT will at any time aling its official position on crypto with that of the Reserve Bank of Australia.

Business Notes for Startups Founders:

political climate: indifferent;
economic climate: hostile;
regions to focus: locally;
industries to focus: e-services;
major limitations: extreme geographical isolation, small low-income population, tiny fundamentally deficient economy, high Internet costs, absence of qualified personnel;
stimulus: political and legal stability is higher than in neighboring Pacific islands;
opportunities: e-services for local micro communities.
Cryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): legal (positive).

personalfinance,College and credit cards,"So I understand that having older accounts is moderately important for your credit score. Wouldn't it be worth it to take the hit from inquiries and apply for 3 to 5 credit cards to maximize average age of accounts early on, buying like a pack of gum here and maybe a drink there to keep them active. I think inquiries only affect you for 2 years, and college (outside of student loans) doesn't require credit history for anything, so the harms seem to go away when you graduate and need credit while the benefits are much greater.

I personally opened a Discover It Student, Amazon Store card account (not the credit card, just the store account), and Deserve Edu credit card ($500, $1,500, and $500 respectively). I only use the Discover card for benefits (1% plus 5% on revolving categories, which will all double after 12 months).

Should I open a third account? A 4th? Is there any ramifications of having too many open? Will doing so really help my age of accounts all that much, or am I wasting my time?

Edit: My goal is to reduce my interest rate as much as possible on a car loan and a home loan after I graduate college. The car is for myself, and I would probably go through my credit union. The home is for my mother who is stuck in a travel trailer, so I'm very interested in taking care of her as quickly as possible when I'm done with school. The cheaper the home loan the better, so I'm trying to prevent when I get a car loan from affecting my credit score as much.",finance

Husband has a full time job, salary pay, brings in $1412 every two weeks.

Wife (me) gave up job to be a SAHM of a medically fragile 8 year old with special needs. At this time, we have no 
other options for child care except for me taking care of him. I have looked into work from home jobs, but I haven’t found anything legitimate or isn’t another person trying to hook me into a make-up, cleaning product, or essential oil pyramid scheme. Our child care situation may be changing during late 2018 or early 2019 (we are hoping so!) and if so, I will be able to take on at least a part time job, but an 8a-3p 5 days/week job would be amazing for us.  

(No, my son isn’t eligible for SSI/disability. We tried that route when he was 2 or so, they gave us money. I paid off medical bills with is. They asked for the money back.)  

We have some hefty debt. Some we had before we were married, some is from our stupidly lavish wedding, and some we were down right ignorant about.   

Our current living situation is with family in their refinished basement. We pay no rent or utilities. They had an extra TV box they barely used that we were able to take downstairs and hook to our tv. We spend very little on groceries. We really looked at our budget recently. Found a huge, gaping, black hole: $897 to be exact! Where is it going?! Little places to be exact. So: We’ve stopped eating at restaurants, grabbing fast food, or getting “snacks” at a gas station every time we stop. Husband takes a packed lunch every day. Cancelled Hulu &amp; music streaming service. Kept Netflix because it is free for us until April, might cancel then. Cancelling gym membership before we are charged for the next month.   

We would LIKE to keep two cars: One for him to drive to work (no one to carpool with, no bus option), one for me with my son for doctor appointments, therapies, etc… but we realize we might have to give one up if we can’t figure this out soon.  

So, here is our revised situation and budget. How can we best use that extra $897/month to reduce our debt load? We have NOTHING in savings…do we build that first? (I’ll also add in, if we have a medical emergency or need something for my son, our family members have helped us out before in our time of need and have told us they are willing to help him in any way needed, we are VERY lucky to have them!)

With that said, I am looking for a really good FPS to play on the Xbox 1 that is out now.  I bought and played all of the CoD titles up through BLOPS II; I rented BLOPS 3 and did not enjoy it.  I did not play COD MW and had high hopes for WWII until I read all of the scathing reviews.

I tried BF1 this time LAST YEAR (damn time flies) and had a blast for the first month.  However, I hated the imbalance.  See, I always played LMG in COD titles.  I had gold skins on all of the LMGs in all the titles I could.  I just love the play style.  Yes, I am masochistic.  I played the support class in BF 1 and grew to LOATHE how nerfed the LMG was in that class.  I would routinely die from 2 shots from a medic while I pumped 5 rounds into him.

I stopped playing in February 2017 as it was not fun.  I tried other classes but did not enjoy them.  I picked up Titanfall 2 after seeing so many positive reviews, but did not like the small teams.  Some maps were huge and I spent half my time trying to find someone other than a damn bot to fight.  I got really good, though, at taking out titans as a pilot my loadouts (again, LMG based).

Overwatch intrigued me, but it looks too gimicky for me.  I love BLoPS II, so much so that I picked up another copy once it was ported to the Xbox 1.

So, with all that said, is there a good FPS that is out there that I am missing?",technology

personalfinance,Opening a 12mo 0% APR / 0% Cash Advance Credit Card for investments / debt pay downs purposes?,"Hey PF, last year I opened a USAA credit card that offered 12 month of 0% APR and 0% cash advance for any checks written in the first 3 months that were also deposit to a USAA checking account. There seemed to be no downsides. So we wrote a 25k check to ourselves, deposited it and put in motion a plan to pay down some high interest student loans.

After a few weeks we felt like we could commit to $1,750k payments per month so we took 21k and paid off those loans and took that extra 4k and cycled it back into the card. Then over last 12 months we paid $1,750k each month onto that card. Even if we weren't able to pay it back, interest would only only start accruing after that 12mo period.

I've regretted not doing more with that extra 4k, but I was feeling risk averse and also like this deal had to be too good to be true. But 12 months later it appears to be exactly what I thought it was,  basically a 0% 12mo loan.

Now I'm interested applying for a new card and doing this again, assuming I can get it. This year however I don't necessarily need to put it all towards debts as they're Federal Student loans below 4% APR. Is there any reason to not max out the credit line and throw it all into a Vanguard mutual fund (or similar) for 12mo to skim the interest earned? Then pay the CC down at 12mo with savings / emergency fund and cash out the mutual fund at 13 mo (for the tax advantage) and replenish our savings?

personalfinance,Student loan debt and credit card balance transfer,"I have one private student loan with a remaining balance of $19,700 at a 8.5% interest rate and Capital One credit card debt of $3,600 at 0% APR until February.  I am on track with my monthly savings to have the c/c debt fully paid come February. 


However, I have been considering opening up a 2nd credit card with Discover and do a balance transfer of the $3,600 c/c debt, paying a 3% balance transfer fee of $108. There would be 0% APR on the transferred amount for 14 months. 


I would then use the $3,600 that I've saved to help pay down the student loan debt. I have been paying around $150/mo in interest alone on this student loan (I pay $300/mo towards it). 

It is my understanding that by doing the balance transfer and using my savings for the loan, this will help lower the monthly interest on the student loan so that more goes towards principle. Of course, I would start saving again to pay off the c/c debt after 14 months.


**For the student loan,**

$19,700 left has me pay about $1700 in interest over 12 months.

$16,100 left has me pay about $1400 in interest over 12 months, with less monthly interest meaning my $300 payment has more go towards principle too.


My worry is if Discover does not approve a credit limit above what I need the balance transfer to be even though my Capital One card has a limit of $10,000.


**Essentially, my main question is:**

Would this be a smart money-saving move even if I am not approved with a credit limit to cover the full balance transfer?


For extra information,

I am 26 years old

Credit Score ~740

Income ~$20,000/yr

I do not rent or have a mortgage.

Total Student Loan Debt ~$52,000(I am on IBR for the other loans with $0 monthly payment but much more reasonable interest rates)

personalfinance,(CAN) How do Financial Advisors find investments that give such large returns? Are they safe and realistic?,"Hi people of PF, was wondering if any of you can give some insight into this topic.

First of all, I would like to say that as a recent graduate, I am quite financially illiterate so I apologize in advance if I am not understanding financial concepts properly. After reading about how important it is to save up for retirement, I have realized that I should really be investing/putting money into tax-deferred and tax-free saving plans. I am aware that the US has 401k and Roth IRA, which I guess is similar to RRSP and TFSA respectively in Canada.

Recently, I had someone recommend me to sit down and talk to a financial advisor to get started with investing. In the end, one of the things that was shown to me was placing $3000 in a tax-free growth account (TFSA in this case) while contributing $100 per month at ~7% return would give me $400000 after 45 years. I'm wondering what types of investment vehicles financial advisors are using to see such high interest rates? Are they safe or volatile?
 Is 7% even considered high?

I'm kind of afraid to make any decisions with moving forward on this without proper knowledge. From what I've gathered, banks usually only have a 0.6-3% interest for these tax-free growth accounts, but I THINK this number is only for putting money into the account with no investments.",finance

Bitcoin,"Wait, how can bitcoin displace fiat?","I'm a staunch bitcoin fan and beneficiary, but I had a thought that's got me confused.

The context of my question is the USA and if it applies to other countries then great. 

When I first saw the fiatleak animated website, I didn't think too deeply about it. I just assumed fiat was literally going *poof* as it was ""converted"" into bitcoin.

Max Keiser played into this image, comparing bitcoin as a big vacuum cleaner that will ""suck up"" all the fiat, as well as Jamie Dimon's toupee, and I laughed. 

It was only when I tried to understand **how** bitcoin will do this, the exact mechanism, that I hit this snag of a question. I like to know the nuts and bolts. See, I love the game theory and the thought of bitcoin bringing down all this corrupt oppression is invigorating .

Say Bittie has a bitcoin (let's say she mined it) and Dolly has a dollar, and Dolly gives her dollar to Bittie for her bitcoin. All the dollars in the federal Reserve monetary system are still accounted for. Now Bittie has the dollar. It didn't disappear. I can't see where any fiat ""leaked"".

That dollar will be destroyed when the loan that originally summoned it into existence has a loan payment or is paid off. A loan maybe Dolly's boss took out at the donut shop where she works. 

Dolly could have bought a rare comic book and the effect on the fiat money system would be the same. What am I missing? 

If bitcoin is just a collectable item inside  the fiat system, the central banks will never outlaw it for being a threat, because it's not any more capable of being a threat than a comic book frenzy. The IRS will go after tax evasion and the police will handle libertarian riots, but the dollar itself seems snug in its position as ""the"" currency. There's no need for boots stomping on mining equipment at 3 a.m. But it also means there's no revolution driven by math and game theory alone.  

My question is how is bitcoin going to cause the fiat system to collapse? Exactly how. The exact mechanism. I'm not saying that it can't. But I don't know how game theory or monetary theory will induce it.

I appreciate your expertise in this question.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,CCU Reward Checking Requirements - doing the minimum,"For the past few weeks I've been looking at options for my emergency fund.  I had considered a no-penalty CD, but then discovered CCU's reward checking.  I pretty well understand the requirements to get the desired interest rate and I saw some older discussions here about the account, and ways to fulfill the 12 debit card purchase requirement.

One suggestion was to auto-load $.50 onto an amazon wallet 12 times ($6.00) per month, however when I looked into this Amazon must have changed something because I could only set up an auto-charge for $5 minimum, and it would be daily, weekly or monthly.  If I did $5 a day it would take out more money than the interest I would be making each month.  I next decided to check if PayPal had something I could set up to auto-charge the card.  They unfortunately don't.  They seem to have disabled their ""manager"" function and are supposedly working on something new to replace it, but it's not ready yet.

So my question is this: Is there any service that I could use to charge my checking card small amounts automatically?  If it had to be every day of the month but went as low as $1 that would be OK, but ideally I could set it up to charge exactly 12 times per month with an amount as low as possible.

If possible I want to save my larger bills (netflix, internet, etc) for my credit cards where the rewards are greater, or possibly to help reach the $1000 in CCU credit card purchases to get the highest APY.  Since this requirement is just a number of transactions per month, ideally those transactions are as small as possible, though I don't want to have to go out and buy 1 grape 12 times or something like that.

Anyone with experience automating small charges to meet a number requirement - how would you do it?",finance

Bitcoin,AMA Request: Jeffrey K. Berns,"Back in 2016:
&gt; The Internal Revenue Service’s effort to serve Coinbase with a “John Doe” summons has received a fresh challenge, as a motion filed this week in a San Francisco federal court seeks to quash last month’s court ruling that affirmed the tax agency’s power to obtain Coinbase customer personal data and user transaction information. That motion was filed by Berns Weiss LLP Managing Partner and Coinbase user Jeffrey K. Berns, a lawyer whose firm deals with issues involving technology – including digital currencies like Bitcoin.

Mr Berns, what are your thoughts on the recent California federal court order that forces Coinbase to release the details of 14,000 users to the IRS? 

What impact will these users, and future Bitcoin traders, have to face? Will every user in this Coinbase order who failed to report a capital gain or loss (even if the $20,000 purchase was followed by a $20,000.01 sale and thus $0.01 capital gain) expect to be audited? How should users prepare for an audit, e.g. finding a good tax lawyer?

Obviously, many questions should be directed towards a personal laywer. But it would be interesting to hear how you feel about this result and how it might affect your view of the technology and ecosystem.

Thanks!",cryptocurrency

gaming,Is it Just Me?: (Gaming),"So for the last few weeks I've been sparsely playing anything. I have a decently wide selection on all the platforms, and I've worked hard to fund all this but as of recent I can't help but feel like i'm not really getting any bang for my buck. I don't know what it is but i've always played games in order to play with my friends. I first got into gaming because me and my dad would play Prince of Persia together, him doing the combat and me the puzzles. Nowadays I play with my peers as opposed to my parents, but I also feel like i've been having less fun in general. There are a decent load of single player games i've been playing that I really love but simultaneously I really want to play w/ my friends.  I won't go over the whole spiel about ""micro transactions"" and ""half baked content"". It should be obvious, no one likes throwing more money at a game they already paid for or getting a game that's not finished. Sure, it's easy to point fingers at EA, especially with the Battlefront-gate but to share the blame it's the reason why I stay away from games like GTAV and Siege and why i'm so frustrated w/ Destiny 2 and Fallout 4. 

What i'm really trying to get at is that it almost seems as if there has been a literal shift in how games are being made that has left me and my friends without much to play together. This goes beyond AAA developers just trying to follow trends. Wheres the Bungie made Halo games where I could plug in a second controller or hop online with a buddy. Wheres my Portal 2 puzzle solving/sabotage. Wheres my Project Gotham thumb-stick bending racing? Wheres my Crimson Sky aerial action? My Army of Two bromancing? Where's my Co-Op? Almost every game w/ multiplayer is some huge online affair, usually stuffed w/ micro transactions, and probably with some DLC you'll have to buy later just to get stuff that should have been in the base game. There are tons of single player games that I wish had multiplayer but they obviously don't, and I shouldn't have to pull out my Xbox, Gamecube, or PS2 just to have a good time. Im tired of D2's lack of content, of Overwatch's shallowness, and I refuse to buy yet another game that's laden with locked off content unless I throw away more money. I just want to play w/ my friends, and there shouldn't be only three games I can do that with. I'm not here to whine, I just want to know that I'm not alone out here...",technology

financialindependence,Health Insurance - Closest Thing To Federal Employee Health Benefits?,"When my [first plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/63le6m/my_plan_to_retire_at_35/) to lean fire at 35 as a single guy didn't work out, I laid out a second plan to fat fire at 57.  Over the past 8 months, this sub has made me seriously reconsider my position.  The problem is I have remained blissfully ignorant with regards to health care.


If I were work up to retirement from federal service at age 57 (younger if I were to get Voluntary Early Retirement), I would have guaranteed health care for life and only pay 25% of the premiums from my choice of dozens of plans.


If I decide not to work up to retirement, I lose the health care benefit and have to find and pay for my own solution.


The qualities I am looking for are:

* Well defined coverage that is as stable/consistent over the years as possible
* Premiums that are as stable/consistent over the years as possible


In other words, if someone could tell me that allocating X dollars per year with a per annum increase of Y% will take care of your health care coverage for the rest of your life, I would fire myself a lot sooner.


My gut tells me I am hunting for a unicorn that doesn't exist and that I probably shouldn't be worried about it.  We all have our hang-ups and this is mine.

personalfinance,I just got a pay stub from a company I haven't worked for in ~2 years.,"I received an email this morning from ADP telling me I had a new pay stub available. This immediately seemed odd to me since the company I work for doesn't run payroll or provide pay stubs through ADP. After logging into ADP, I saw the pay stub was from Vectrus, a company I stopped working for back in January of 2016. Aside from the fact that I don't work for this company anymore, the check is unusually large - a little over $7k for a one month pay period. Unfortunately, I've never been blessed with that high of a salary. The pay stub has no contact info for the Vectrus pay roll department, and my searches on Google haven't turned up any useful contact numbers, either.

What I'm mainly concerned about is whether this error was reported to the IRS as actual income - I'd rather not be responsible for paying taxes on money that isn't mine, and that I haven't even received as it looks like they're trying to deposit the money into an account that I closed soon after leaving Vectrus. Although the pay stub shows state and federal taxes were deducted, so I guess the taxes would already be paid? I'm honestly not sure how that works - I've always just gotten my W2s and filled in the boxes that TurboTax told me to.

Any advice on where I should go from here would be greatly appreciated!

EDIT: [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/inSqEWJ.png) of the pay stub with itemization and tax deductions, in case that's helpful (PII cropped out).

MORE EDITS

CLARIFYING DETAILS:

- All I have is just a PDF of a pay stub. No check was mailed as the bottom of the stub (not included in the screencap) specifies this is supposed to be a direct deposit. I recognize the last four digits of the account as the account number for the checking account I had at the time. That checking account was closed soon after I left Vectrus, and I don't even bank with the same bank anymore. I literally have no access to this money.

- I'm fairly certain this isn't back pay from checks where they paid me too little. I only worked at the job for about a year total, and less than a year with Vectrus as they only took over the contract a few months after I started working there. Even if they were shorting me $200 out of each paycheck ($400/month - bi weekly pay schedule), it wouldn't have added up to the $11.5k shown on the pay stub before taxes. This job did not have bonuses or any perks like company cars or anything. I was lucky to accrue PTO under their stingy contract.

- Definitely not a 401(k) payout as that was accounted for after I left. The little bit that I had accrued while working there was rolled over to IRA and Roth IRA accounts with my new bank.

ACTIONS TAKEN SINCE POSTING:

- I was able to find the phone number for their main office in Colorado. I called early this morning not too long after my initial post, was transferred to payroll, and got the voicemail. Left a VM with a brief summary of the issue and my call back number. No call back so far.

- Called again just a little while ago. The person who answered said that the payroll people were in meetings the rest of the day, and that she should be able to connect me with someone if I call back tomorrow. We shall see...

FINAL UPDATE

Finally got in contact with someone in payroll at Vectrus. In a lot of my replies below, I was saying I was pretty sure that the money wasn't mine, and that I'm positive that my paychecks weren't short while working there. Well, I was wrong about it not belonging to me, and sort of right that my paychecks weren't short. My checks were what they were supposed to be for the hourly rate I was getting paid at the time. Apparently, though, after [stuff I didn't really understand], it was determined I was underpaid - my hourly rate should have been higher for the work I was doing. So, this is them making up the difference. I think my being rather stressed out was still a reasonable response because it's definitely odd for a company to just drop $7k in your lap 2 years after you quit working there with no explanation as to why they're giving it to you. While I don't live at the address they have on file for me, my number and email haven't changed, so it's not like they didn't have valid contact info for me. Anywho, I gave them my updated banking details and the new address for them to send the tax info to, so I should be getting a nice Christmas bonus some time next week. There are many shiny objects I'd love to buy myself with that money, but I'm going to be responsible and use it to pay off a couple of credit cards. Adulting sucks...

Stupid questions of the day:

* Is the huge discrepancy in ~~yields~~ EDIT: *returns* due to the falling interest rates in the Euro-zone? 

* Assuming interest rates will increase to, say, 1-2% in the next 10 years, should I expect shorter-maturity bond ETFs to perform better, all other things being equal?

* What other risk factors besides interest rates can conceivably affect bonds differentially based on their maturity? For the sake of this question, let's compare the 3-7yr and 7-10yr ETFs, which have a very similar composition from the point of view of countries represented.

Currently the money is sitting in a deposit account which yields 0.85% after taxes. Over 5 years, the expected return is (1.0085)^5 = 4.3%. Do you think it would be a bad idea to move a chunk of my money into longer-maturity bond ETFs, assuming the interest rate will not stay at 0% forever?

My wife has private student loans with Navient that we are currently trying to refinance, so over the last week or two I've been back and forth on the phone with Navient, SoFi, and Laurel Road. This morning I received a phone call from someone claiming to be from Navient and asking for my wife. They claimed we knew we were interested in refinancing our loans, and they wanted to see if we would be interested in refinancing our current loans with them at a lower fixed interest rate. I told them we were potentially interested, and they said that they needed me to verify my wife's SSN or Navient Acct number before they could proceed with discussing the options. Since I have been back and forth on the phone with these people and have had to give out her SSN numerous times as a result recently, I knew it and I gave her the SSN. She started listing potential offers available to us, quoting potential savings, interest rates, and monthly payments. At this point, my inner anxiety/cautiousness kicked in and I realized that giving out the SSN to a cold caller may not have been the wisest idea, and I told the lady I would need to get back to them. I immediately called Navient and they could not confirm that they had called me this morning and said that the last documented correspondence regarding my wife's account was when I had called them last week.

Fearing the worst, I've already followed the PF wiki for possible ID theft and have frozen her credit reports with Equifax, Experian, Transunion, Innovis, and ChexSystems. She also contacted her bank to put an alert on her accounts for fraudulent activity. I closed our joint accounts with my bank and reopened them in my own name. I also plan on contacting the IRS to flag her SSN so taxes aren't fraudulently filed with her number. Is there anything else we should be doing at this time?

Should we do anything with her open credit cards (she has 10, 1 of which she is an authorized user on my primary account, and 7 of which are old cards she just keeps open to keep her AAoA up and utilization down).

10% of each paycheck I put towards my 403b (my hospital does not match). 

My private loans are about to go into effect January 2018. One private loan payment is 255 a month with 6.000% interest the other is 235 a month with 7.875% interest. Neither of them are fixed loans.... 

My total federal is around 220 a month all with various degrees of interest. I have no problem paying this one off. 

I am not worried about the federal. My private loans are my issue. I have no other expenses besides 130 on a monthly phone bill and about 100 or so on transportation. 

I currently have enough to pay one of the 2 private loans off in full, but that would leave me with 0 dollars to my name. I am paid bi-weekly so I know I’ll have money back by next Thursday. 

What would you do? I am 24 and live at home and don’t pay rent. Ideally I’d love to my out and I plan on going back to school for my masters hopefully next summer. My hospital pays 12,000 annually for furthering my education. So I’ll be able to tap into that. 

Should I pay a single private loan off in full? Should I pay a little bit of both off? Should I put less than 10% into my 403b? I really am torn. I have a few thousand in my 403b and a little bit in a fidelity fund invested as well that I don’t touch.

personalfinance,"Pay for delete on very small medical debt - debt collector will not put anything in writing and will not guarantee credit bureaus will delete, but I have recorded phone conversation saying they will submit a request to delete. Is this enough? [VA, USA]","Location: VA, USA.

&amp;nbsp;

**Please note that I have read and followed the PF wiki regarding collections.**

&amp;nbsp;

**Back story:** Over the summer, I moved to a new apartment and thought I had settled my payment for a past appointment with my PCP. I had not updated my address with them (my fault) and was not aware of mail forwarding options at the time. Apparently the insurance came back with a remaining balance for me to pay. The doctor's office tried mailing me several times after I moved, but never attempted to contact me another way (via phone).

&amp;nbsp;

At the beginning of fall, my old roommates finally told me I had been getting mail and I discovered the small debt (&lt;$200) had been sent to collections. It is now showing on my credit report and has decreased my credit score significantly (to a little below 700).


&amp;nbsp;

**Actions taken:** Please note that I have followed the PF wiki. In accordance with the wiki, all mail was sent certified, return receipt requested (CRRR) and all phone conversations were recorded on my end (I did let the debt collector know each time that I was recording).

&amp;nbsp;

1) **I sent a debt dispute letter.**

&amp;nbsp;

2) **The debt collector provided documentation to validate the debt.**

&amp;nbsp;

3) **I sent a pay-for-delete letter.**

&amp;nbsp;

I offered to pay in full in return for removing all information regarding the debt from all credit reporting agencies within 15 calendar days of payment.

&amp;nbsp;

4) **I called them to read the contents of the recently mailed pay-for-delete letter in attempts to move things along.**

&amp;nbsp;

The pleasant representative who I'd spoken with several times previously (regarding documentation that I failed to receive on their initial attempt to send) suddenly got very nasty with me. I initially thought I'd been lucky enough to find the only kind debt collector alive.

&amp;nbsp;

She immediately knew I had gone online to research based on the contents of my letter. (She wasn't nasty at this point; she just kind of laughed and said she could probably recite my letter by heart.)

&amp;nbsp;

She said the debt collector's policy after my payment would be to first submit the legally required update to the credit bureaus that the account is paid. After that, their policy is to submit a REQUEST to delete the information from the credit reports within 60 days. She said debt collectors could not guarantee that the information would be deleted as that was up to the credit bureaus.

&amp;nbsp;

She said she would not put anything in writing (even that they would REQUEST, not guarantee, a deletion) as she was not required to enter in to such an agreement with me.

&amp;nbsp;

I'd also requested in the letter that they agree not to discuss the terms of this settlement with anyone other than me and the client they are collecting for. She got nasty with me about not being required to enter into an agreement (again). She went over that there is a federal law stating who they are allowed to discuss this information (e.g., POAs).

&amp;nbsp;

**My questions:**

&amp;nbsp;

* It seems like I have tried everything possible and that the debt collector has the right not to put anything in writing. Is my best course of action for a medical bill, and for a debt this small, to go ahead and pay in full and hope they request the deletion as they said?

&amp;nbsp;

* Would my recorded conversation with the representative stating that their policy is to request deletion after payment provide any recourse should they not request the deletion? I am not sure if the representative would be considered authorized to make that statement anyway or if the debt collector could say the representative misspoke.

&amp;nbsp;

* Is it true the credit bureaus have the final say in deciding to remove the debt or do they definitely remove the debt if the debt collector requests the debt be removed?

&amp;nbsp;

*Phew.* Sorry for the book.

&amp;nbsp;

**If TL;DR:** I have a minor medical debt (&lt;$200) that has been validated by debt collector. I asked for a pay-for-delete and was told on a recorded call that the debt collector's policy is to update the credit bureaus that the account is paid and then request a deletion within 60 days. However, the debt collector would not agree to put anything in writing in advance stating they would request a deletion. Is my best course of action here to pay and hope the debt collector does as they said? Will the recorded phone conversation with a representative stating that a request for deletion is their policy be of any recourse if they do not? I am not sure if the representative would be considered authorized to make that statement anyway or if the debt collector could say the representative misspoke. Is it true the credit bureaus have the final say in deciding to remove the debt or do they definitely remove the debt if the debt collector requests the debt be removed?",finance
Bitcoin,"One of the last posts made by Hal Finney on bitcointalk.org. For the uninitiated, Hal received the first ever transaction of bitcoin. 10 coins from Satoshi.","I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.

For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.

When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.

After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.

The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.

My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.",cryptocurrency

It only takes a simple majority in the House and Senate. We can do this.,"Livestream of vote: https://www.c-span.org/video/?438447-1/fcc-vote-repealing-net-neutrality-rules

The FCC [just voted](https://www.battleforthenet.com) to repeal all existing net neutrality protections. They are giving giant ISPs like Verizon and Comcast the power to control what we can see and do online with new fees, throttling, and censorship. This will ruin the fundamentally open nature of the internet. **This fight isn’t over though, there is still a clear path to victory.**

The organizations behind [Battle For The Net](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) are launching a new campaign to demand that Congress step in and restore net neutrality via [Congressional Review Act](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R43992.html) (CRA). 

The CRA let’s our elected officials in Congress overrule actions taken by Federal agencies like the FCC. And it’s different from a normal bill because it only requires a simple majority in the Senate and House to pass. Given the level of public backlash and polls showing that 83% of voters from across the political spectrum oppose the FCC’s plan, and given that several Republicans have already started to publicly criticize the FCC vote, we have a real chance to making this happen. **But it won’t be easy, and it can only happen within 60 legislative days of the order going into effect.**

**We can’t stop now. [Contact your reps today and demand that they preserve net neutrality through Congressional Review Act](https://www.battleforthenet.com/)**

You’ll see a script on your screen, or you can say something like this:
&gt;I support Title II net neutrality, and I urge you to use the Congressional Review Act to pass a “resolution of disapproval” reversing the FCC’s December vote to repeal the Open Internet Order.”

**You can also text BATTLE to Text ""BATTLE"" to 384-387 to use a simple chat-bot to send a message to your lawmakers**

We can still win this. Even if you’ve already contacted your reps, now is the time to call them again. We need all hands on deck. Please, take a moment and make the call, then spread the word, sticky this post, or help drive traffic to https://www.battleforthenet.com",technology
Bitcoin,How BTC might die instant,"Hello

In case you didn't know, today was a big day for the internet. Today the FCC(american government) has decided to change the net neutrality. Simple explanation: the government will have control over the internet. it will be able to block acces to specific sites.

Now ask yourself do you think the government of US likes bitcoin? it's a disrupter of bankin system. So the answer is easy. I think 20k for a bitcoin is in their eyes the limit on where it can go. I'm sure this week at the fed event they will talk about bitcoin and how to kill it. They might with the CME future launch short btc, because they can choose how much money they use for it. They are in charge of money it doesn't matter how high btc goes they Always are able to use 10 times as much to short it so that the price will go down, they decide about money not the people and btcbelievers.
If that doesn't kill bitcoin they will just block all the ways on internet for btc. it's that simple.

So how take care of this. first of all btc is standing really high and RSI is overbought so it's wise to at least change some of your btc assests into other coins or stocks and maybe buy btc back at lower price?

Second, support net neutrality software.
There is cryptocurrency made to stay of the government influence on the internet, substratum is working on a decentralised internet where the people seed/mine internet for each other so that it cannot be blocked by the government. I'm pretty sure that the FCC will try to kill btc and that substratum is doing everything to save the internet including crypto. So how do you think that will turn out for substratum coin value? It will increase because demand is going to increase and supply will be limited.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,WSJ: Nearly 5 Million Americans in Default on Student Loans,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/nearly-5-million-americans-in-default-on-student-loans-1513192375

I believe this is behind a paywall... here are the interesting nuggets:

&gt; The number of Americans severely behind on payments on federal student loans reached roughly 4.6 million in the third quarter, a doubling from four years ago, despite a historically long stretch of U.S. job creation and steady economic growth.

...

&gt; The government’s student-loan portfolio now totals $1.37 trillion. That figure includes debt in repayment; debt for which borrowers aren’t required to be paying down because they are in school or have otherwise been granted temporary reprieves; and debt from an older program that guaranteed loans made by private lenders.

...

&gt; “It’s kind of phenomenal given all the tools we have at this point to avoid default that this many people are still winding up in default,” said Clare McCann, an education-policy analyst at New America, a center-left think tank.

...

&gt; In some ways, the outlook for the federal student loan program has improved. The rise in default in part reflects an overall increase in Americans entering the repayment cycle. As a share of all borrowers in repayment, new defaults fell in the third quarter compared with a year earlier.

Student loans are making up an ever-increasing portion of the national debt, and an increasing number defaults is not such a great thing, even though the default rate is lower...",finance

Credit card debt question,"So I got a new job and a new credit card recently, and I got my signing bonus too, which was about $10k.

Well, I went and basically spent all of the emergency fund save $3k. It all accrued on my credit card. 

When the credit card bill came due, I was conflicted about whether I should just pay it all right away since I had the funds or waited and paid it off over a few months. The balance was about $7k and the interest rate is around 25% a year, which by my approximation would be about $150 in interest a month.

Would I have been better off saving the emergency fund and paying off the debt over a few months, or did I do the best thing by paying it all off at once?",finance

Bitcoin,The crypto-craze is the same psychological phenomenon that led us to the dotcom bubble and housing bubble.,"Call it what you want: the ""greater fools"" theory, the ""castle in the sky"", or whatever. Right now, most people only care about BTC because of its enormous price appreciation. For the vast majority of participants who are purchasing bitcoin, they expect no utility from it other than to sell their place on the blockchain for more money to some other greater fool. There is a hope that prices will stabilize at some absurd price (I have heard $1 million/BTC). That will not happen. Like gold, BTC has--at its absolute best--a long term expected return of 0%. It produces nothing (and consumes a monstrous amount of resources).  
This Market is driven by greed and the psychology of speculation. It is enabled by low interest rates, a strong employment market and a bull market that won't quit. There is a confluence of events that encourage market novices to pour into crypto-currency. Namely, the unprecedented encouragement of a social media echo chamber, the excitement and psychology of speculation, the rush of dopamine received by seeing the price of bitcoin extend further, the fear-of-missing-out, the anxiety of getting-in-before-the-train-leaves-the-station, and society's vague acknowledgment that technology it doesn't truly understand can produce eye-popping investment returns. Low interests rates engender easy money, but also a search for returns. When investors can't make money on interest, they go searching for returns in all the wrong places. This is the same playbook we have seen before--particularly during the housing and dotcom bubbles.  
It is worth pointing out again why some investors make extraordinary amounts of money. Ideally--although not always--they are serving society by allocating capital towards the most productive means. Although this is an abstract concept, it is fundamental to a capitalist, efficient, productive and wealthy society. It is also an incredibly exacting and tedious task to identify--rationally--where opportunity exists based fundamental valuations or some extraordinary market insight. Those allocations not only stand to make the investor an outsized return, the intelligent investment serves society by increasing productivity and creating wealth. Intelligent investors are ones that base their allocations on intrinsic value, or some market insight, as in the case of venture capital. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value and is not an investment that will create wealth. Blockchain technology certainly has utility, but allocating money to bitcoin doesn't serve our society in any way. It doesn't give capital to (legal) entrepreneurs, and it won't create lasting value.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Order of Operations - Student loan vs buying a car,"Hello all, 

This is my first post to reddit, 27 year old living in San Diego with a question about which is the best path to take financially.

I currently have a good amount of debt (see outlined finances below) and am leasing a car, which will end in April of 2019. I have saved $4,000 as an emergency fund, and have started focusing on paying of the remaining $5,000 of a personal loan with Wells Fargo which I should be finished with by April 2018. After that loan is gone, I will be facing my student loans ($36k) and I am unsure whether to start the long journey to repay that debt as soon as possible, or start saving a good portion of money to pay for a car in cash by the time my lease is up, while only paying minimums on my student loans. 

Emergency savings: 3,000$
Checking account cushion: 1,500$ (bare minimum amount kept in account, usually around 2,000$

Monthly Expenses:
Rent: 823$
Auto and renters insurance: 130$
Pet insurance: 45$
Car lease: 180$
Student loan minimum: 185$ (36,000$ total loan)
Wells Fargo personal loan minimum: 335$ (5,000$ total remaining, I am paying an extra 500-700$ extra on this per month to get it paid off ASAP because of the 12% interest rate)
Internet: 20$
Power: 50$
Phone: 60$
Groceries: 200$
Misc life expenses (gas, beer, occasional eating out): 300$

Monthly take-home after taxes (and 3% in retirement with a 3% employer match): 3,375$. This number may raise in May 2018. 

Approximately 1,000$ remaining to save or put towards debt each month, sometimes more depending on if the month has 2 or 3 pay periods.   

I know i also need to increase my retirement to at least 10%, but I am following the Dave Ramsey method, and am focusing on paying off debts first. He recommends only buying cars with cash, and not leasing. So i am unsure what the best course of action would be when I get out of this lease, knowing i will have about a year to either save for a down payment on a used car. A year of savings would be 15k, that  would lower my student loans to 21,000$, but would have nothing to put towards a car...or buy a car in cash for 15k, and not have a car payment, then start attacking the student loan. This is my first car lease, and Ive heard buying the car at the end of the term is not a good decision (and i also dont want to buy it since its a manual, and i am in traffic fairly often), but unsure if there is anything i could work out with Volkswagen to get a deal on a used car of theirs or anything like that at the end of the lease term. My mileage will be well under the cap since my commute to work is very close, so maybe that could help in negotiations. 

I would prefer not to use the money in my emergency fund except for job loss or medical emergencies, as i have been laid off in the past without any savings, which lead to me having to get a 10,000 personal loan to consolidate credit card expenses accrued during that time. I would also like to get my emergency fund to 6-8k, so would need to factor that into this equation as well.

Let me know your thoughts, and I very much appreciate your help.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Tipping Point for Decentralized Cryptocurrencies,"I get that the theoretical purpose of decentralized cryptocurrencies is to try to get financial institutions, the federal reserve, and governments (autocratic or not), out of the equation. But right now cryptos are mainly being bought and sold based on their FIAT value.


If cryptocurrencies start to take more and more marketcap, then I'm assuming (not an economist) the value of FIAT (in terms of purchasing power) will start to decrease, which will make cryptos look like they're losing their value as well... so how can cryptos one day **overtake** fiat and become the new norm, if their worth started as and still is valued in fiat? Wouldn't the market auto-regulate itself in that as fiat's worth decreases so will crypto's... in an eternel limbo where none can overtake the other? Otherwise, how can a crypto reach a point where its worth is no longer valued in terms of fiat?

Sorry if noob question, I jumped the gun (full FOMO mode) and first bought a few cryptos I believe will gain in value on the medium to long term, and since now I'm hodling I'm finding time to think about the bigger picture but can't seem to see or understand how we can reach the tipping point where crypto overtakes fiat...",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Need help making some financial decisions regarding student loans,"Im new on this subreddit and after looking through some of the posts I figured I could ask for advice.

I’m 21 years old and I’m going back to a reputable public university in Florida to finish getting a Computer Science degree. About 6 months ago I got a job as a Software Developer at an insurance company and I’m making about 60k a year. Before I got a well paying job though I was struggling financially while getting my Associates degree. I’d say in the past 3 years among some bad financial decisions I’ve incurred a total of about $7000 in debt where $5000 of that are in credit cards and $2000 are hospital bills. My credit score is currently 425 mostly because I was ignoring my creditors for multiple months before I got my job. I have closed all my credit card accounts except my oldest one and have lowered the interest rate on all my cards and pay $320 a month combined. I have still not dealt with 3 collection accounts of hospital bills totaling to $2000. I’ve been wanting to refinance the debt with a loan but have not been able to due to my credit. Now that I’m going back to school I qualify for financial aid based on the wages I earned in 2016. I’ve been offered a 2,900 grant and a 5000 subsidized federal loan. Because I have 120 university credits prepaid at any public Florida university which I will be using, the grant and loan if I accept it will get deposited into my bank account. The idea I’ve been playing around with for a while is to pay my debt off with the grant and subsidized loan. Then just make sure to pay the loan before I finish school in 2 years which I think is doable considering my income now. Which in the end means I will pay no interest on the debt I currently owe. I’m pretty sure doing something like this violates the agreement but I think I’m willing to take the risk. What do you guys think?",finance

personalfinance,Should I trade in my 2017 vehicle with a high interest rate and negative equity for an older model with a lower interest rate?,"So... Backstory is that I had a Chap. 7 bankruptcy discharge in February 2017. Less than a month later, my sole vehicle (1998 Chevy Malibu) irreparably breaks down. I do not live in a city with public transportation, and my commute to work was half an hour one way, so I HAD to get a new vehicle with basically zero to put down. 

The only creditor that would approve me, would only approve me on a new vehicle at 17.3% interest. Yeah. I know. But, it was the only option I had in a time of desperation.

Fast forward ten months later (all of which had on-time payments), My credit is somewhat improved (between 580-640, depending on which source I go to) and I'm getting frustratingly sick of the interest rate. I've been trying to refinance once a month since August (I know - the inquiry hurts my credit, but I was willing to take the chance to knock down my interest rate).

Today, I finally found a lender that actually talked to me about my situation. Basically, I could get refinanced between 8% and 12% (not great, but a helluva lot better than 17.3%), but my LTV is too high - about $2,000 too high. Unfortunately, I don't have $2,000 on hand to do it.

So... at present, I see three options:

1) Continue to get raped by my current interest rate and have my LTV continue to grow, making it further impossible to get refinanced as time goes on.

2) Somehow come out with $2,000 to get refinanced (Honestly don't see how).

or

3) Trade in my vehicle with the negative equity for an older model car, with the hope that the lower interest rate would offset the higher balance and I would come out ahead over time.

So... Any suggestions/thoughts/comments? 

Any relevant information that I left out?

Edit: The vehicle I have now is a 2017 Chevy Spark LS. Potential option 4: Would it be potentially financially prudent to try to trade in the '17 Spark LS for an '18 Spark LT if I can get approved for a promotional rate (not sure if I would with my current credit)?",finance

Bitcoin,Startups and Bitcoins in Nigeria,"With its almost halve-a-trillion dollars GDP, Nigeria is the African leading economic powerhouse. In 2014, after a decade of record oil prices, Nigeria outperformed its major rival - South Africa. However, despite its heavy reliance on the oil export, Nigerian economy is well diversified into another industries including mining, financial services, manufacturing and information technologies. Another important GDP component is remittances. Almost 18 million Nigerians, which are living in USA and EU, send home more than twenty billion dollars annually.

Nigeria has the largest population in Africa. With almost halve of country's population being 14 years old or younger, Nigeria is projected to became one of the major contributors to the overall population growth on the planet in the nearest future. Nigerian major city - Lagos - is the most populated city in Africa.

Nigerian economy is sufficiently large and well diversified to host multiple high-tech startups in wide variety of sectors, including e-commerce, entertainments, social networks, e-marketplaces, e-jobs and FinTech. Lagos is internationally recognized as one of the main African centers of Internet economy.

Nigerian generation of young and well educated consumers is growing very fast and that creates a stable base for future expansion of local e-businesses. Additionally, Nigeria has maintained long lasting relationships with the Western Wold (almost all of Nigerian oil flows to the North America and Europe). Local expatriates community is very affluent and many promising high-tech companies are launched by Nigerians immigrants.

On the downside, Nigeria is still politically instable, its economy is overdependent on oil export and its bureaucratic system is notoriously slow and inefficient. That creates a challenging market environment, which negatively affects long-term perspectives of the local startup ecosystem.

Nigerian state gate-keepers are not particularly friendly to Bitcoin as well as to other digital currencies. However, they also recognize their technical inability to restrain its usage by the public. Instead, local authorities try to prevent the adaptation of non-centralized electronic money by business and government institutions.

In January 2017, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) sent a memorandum to banks and other financial institutions informing them that transactions in virtual currencies have been banned in Nigeria, citing money laundering and terrorism financing as reason for this ban. Other financial regulators, such as Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC), have also warned public on the danger of digital currencies like Bitcoins, warning that who use digital currencies do so at their own risk.

Nevertheless, trading cryptocurrencies as well as organizing ICOs are both technically legal in Nigeria.

Business Notes for Startups Founders:

political climate: not friendly;
economic climate: moderately friendly;
regions to focus: locally;
industries to focus: many including e-commerce, e-services, entertainment, social networks, e-marketplaces, e-jobs and FinTech;
major limitations: sharp GDP decline , over-dependence on country's exports on commodities market prices , high inflation, very high CB interest rate , high personal income tax rate , very high administrative and legal barriers to SME, political instability;
stimulus: communication sector is fast growing, high-low-income population , fast growing generation of young mobile Internet users, fixed Internet penetration rate is close to fifty percents, matured startup ecosystem (notably in Lagos);
opportunities: to build a variety of mobile services aimed at young generation of consumers.
Cryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): legal (moderately negative).

cardano,Can anyone please help me make sense of the last paragraph of Cardano's Monetary Policy?,"https://cardanodocs.com/cardano/monetary-policy/

Sample Text:

In terms of money units there are two points of consideration. First in Japan, yen amounts are much larger, 10,000 yen is like the 100 dollar bill and factoring this into the units you go from 25 billion Ada to 250 million. Second Ada has six digits from the decimal not eight for Bitcoin. An Ada is a million Lovelaces (the smallest unit). Adjusting for this takes you to 2.5 million. 

Can anyone clarify this for me? It kind of sounds like 25 Billion ADA (pegged to the Japanese Yen) is really 250 million ADA (pegged to the USD).  What is the real circulating supply? ~25 billion ADA?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Finally getting my finances together and getting my wife on board as well.,"Hello r/PersonalFinance!

I've lurked for a long time, but this is my first post here.  I'm finally getting my act together financially.  I've started on the prime directive and I've got my emergency fund up to three months worth of living expenses.  My wife and I started budgeting through YNAB in August and we've done very well!  Not only did we fully fund Christmas this year, but I actually managed to pay a bit extra ($246) on my student loans this month!  I actually know what my money is doing and it's one of the greatest changes I've made in my life!

I've recently consolidated my private student loans.  I was able to get a lower average interest rate, and a fixed rate as well.  It was a 20-year term, but there are no penalties for prepayment.  I decided to create an [amortization schedule](https://www.wikihow.com/Prepare-Amortization-Schedule-in-Excel) in Microsoft Excel.  I added a column to the spreadsheet where I could enter additional payments on the principal.

Once I factored in the AutoPay discount as well as the extra payment I made, I noticed that I chipped a year off of the repayment schedule!  I was estatic!  For the first time in my life, I feel like I can actually overcome my debt.  I tried to explain what was happening to my wife, and she wasn't quite getting it.  So I built a tracker:

https://imgur.com/a/QvOJo

It's a bit rough because I'm not great when it comes to making things look pretty but it works.  Every time I make an additional payment, I enter it in the amortization schedule and see how many months of repayment I saved.  I then fill those squares in on the tracker.  I will also fill it in on the top as I make monthly payments.  It's my goal to be on here in five years giving an update that the loan has been paid in full.  I posted this on our cabinet so that we can both see the progress in a visual layout.

I wanted to share this in case this idea was useful to someone else.

Also, this wasn't an overnight thing.  This has been a struggle since 2011 for me.  I graduated and could not find a job in my field.  The best I could do after graduating was to get a fast food job.  I used the experience I got there to get a small raise moving to a call center job.  I was later promoted to a Team Lead at this location.  I was later promoted to a Trainer, and now I have a career in Instructional Design.  My wife has a similar story.  We've worked hard over the past seven years to get to where we are.

I have a net worth of -71,329.30 in student loans and a vehicle.  That number used to terrify me.  It's still unsettling, and it's not something I'm proud of.  But, for the first time in my life I feel like I'm actually making progress towards being debt free and that feels good.  

Hopefully someone finds this post helpful or encouraging.  I enjoy reading this sub and I'm glad I finally have something to share.  This subreddit has been a Godsend for my wife and I.

One last thing in case you're wondering... I started reading you *after* getting in debt, not before, just in case somesone reads my post and think ""Umm... you're doing it wrong...""

personalfinance,[Taxes] IRS stuffed up and now we are needing to return money to them,"My wife sent her tax forms in for 2016 on time last year, a month or two after sending all the forms in we got some mail from IRS saying they needed to audit our tax refund and there was a check in there for roughly 6000. It's now been over 8 months since that check and we got mail stating that we now owe them just over 5000 and needs to be paid.

After 2 hours on hold with them they look into the issue and said they would call us back, once they called back they said they screwed up and have never seen anything like this before, instead of freezing the tax refund when they needed to audit us they sent us that check instead. And now they are saying we need to pay it back asap

They said we can appeal this but to do that they said they will add on 20% to the amount owed.

What advice can anyone offer would it be silly to try appeal this or do we need to somehow get this 5000 together and pay it?",finance
personalfinance,Already did it.,"I see many people asking the question of whether they should finance a vehicle for an absurd interest rate, and the correct answer is a resounding no. However, I already did it. I'm about a year in, and the truck mileage combined with my credit score makes for no hope of refi. So, what's the strategy? Just pay it off as quickly as possible I suppose? 

Westlake financial 24% apr. 288.51/mo on a 2002 f150.  Payoff balance roughly 7000, truck worth roughly 5k. 
My plan is to aggressively pay down and hopefully i can get it done by the end of season next year, as i work as a waiter in a seasonal tourist town. I work all year, but the substantial money comes from march-september. 

Edit: rough income estimation is about 500/wk for that sweet march-september season and dwindles down to about 150-200/wk. I have no savings to speak of, and at the moment a negative checking account balance. My finances are grim. Unfortunately there is very little i can do at this time, so I'm just waiting for my season to come around again and make better financial decisions in the future and properly stow money away for the winter to even out the wavy income.  

I worked as a chef in this same restaurant for a steady salary for many years before i switched to front of the house. I was ill prepared for the stark income dip. I knew it was coming all summer, i just wasn't ready for the severity. That said, i believe i made the right choice as the money will be more annually working foh vs cooking, it's just frontloaded into a shorter time. 

As an unneccesary side note, i also am in the beginning stages of opening my own small 1 man operation marine electronics installation business. It's hopefully going to take over as my primary income sooner than later but i am tentatively planning to keep working my night job full time until hopefully the electronics installation business takes off enough that I'm comfortable betting the farm on it. A full size truck is definitely at least very convenient, and arguably a neccesity to operate this kind of business.",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage refi and appraisal advice,"I'm an extremely debt-phobic person, and my mortgage is my [unmarried 31F] first and only debt. I'm interested in refinancing to get a lower interest rate, lower term, and to get rid of PMI. My home's value has gone up considerably since I purchased it. 

Purchased home in 2013 for $147,000

30 year mortgage @ 4.75% fixed

Down payment approx. $8k? (can't remember exactly)

PMI @ approx. $85/month

Monthly payment (including PMI, escrow for insurance and taxes, principle and interest) $960

Principal remaining as of Dec 2017 approx. $125k

It sucks paying PMI, but I saved money for home improvements instead of making a larger down payment. The improvements I've made are:

New kitchen appliances (fridge, dishwasher, sink/faucet/garbage disposal, added a gas line for a new gas stove); new washer/drier; fenced backyard; replaced gutters and added gutter guards; added air conditioning; replaced furnace; added carport; added wood blinds on all downstairs windows; installed new overhead lighting fixtures in basement, garage, kitchen, dining and living rooms; misc. cosmetic improvements (painting, landscaping, tree trimming and removal, etc.)

My current home value according to the tax assessment from last year was at $200k, and the Zillow price is currently at $257k. The mortgage banker I spoke with at Wells Fargo said the actual appraised value should be somewhere in between (probably on the higher end, since neither figure is taking into account the home improvements). She used a value of $230k for her estimate. 

I don't know my exact credit score. I think it's probably pretty high. I've had just one credit card for 13 years, used for practically all my expenses but always paid in full, never carried a balance or made a late payment. Also never made a late payment on the mortgage. She used an estimated score of 800. 

The refi would cost about $3k, most of that added into the mortgage principal:

$845 origination fee to Wells Fargo

$500 title closing/escrow

$1,029 title lender's policy

$40 title all endorsements

$81 recording fees

$540 appraisal fee and $15 credit check paid out of pocket (not added to principal)

And finally, here is the refi quote itself, based on a $128k loan:

20-year fixed rate @3.875%, with a monthly payment of about $945 (savings over the life of the loan: $41k)

15-year fixed rate @3.75%, with a monthly payment of about $1,120 (savings over the life of the loan: $57k)

PMI drops off automatically with the refi. The 15-year term is doable, but I would be more comfortable keeping my payments under $1k/month and just making extra principal payments when I feel like it, as I've been doing for the last four years. 

Other relevant info: I plan to stay in the home for at least another 5 years. I might need a new hot water heater soon, and maybe a new roof in the next 5 years or so, but otherwise don’t anticipate needing to spend for a lot of more improvements short-term. I have a steady job with a decent salary ($63k). 

My questions:

Do these seem like good rates? Should I shop around more first? I bank with WF so I like the idea of refinancing with them, just to keep all my accounts in one place. 

Is there any reason I should wait to do this? My girlfriend is also a homeowner, and her banker stepdad recommended she wait 5 years before refinancing. She explained to me how I would be losing money by essentially paying a non-refundable deposit, but I'm not sure I totally understood the analogy. Obviously the refi isn't cheap, but I'm willing to spend $3k to save $40+k in the long run, and it seems good to do it now to get rid of PMI as soon as possible. However, I'm certainly no expert on this topic, and I'm sure there are considerations I'm not aware of. 

If my house appraises a lot higher than the tax assessment, will the tax assessment rise to meet the appraisal amount and cost me more money in property taxes?

personalfinance,Just completed my exit interview for a Perkins Federal Loan and the interest due is about 5 times as much as it should be.,"Like I said, I just finished my exit interview for my Perkins Loan that I had to take out and as I was finishing it I saw something that wasn't right. Earlier on it had said that the interest rate was 5%, but as I was finishing the exit interview it says my principal owed was 4,175 USD, which is what they gave me to pay for school, but my interest owed was over 1000 dollars. 

Should I let them know that their math is incorrect, or what can be done? They sent me several emails threatening to withhold my diploma if I didn't complete this exit interview today, but I don't want to agree to pay them 1,000 dollars in interest on a 4,000 dollar loan at 5%.

politics,December 2017 Meta Thread: What kind of year has it been?,"##December 2017 Metathread: What kind of year has it been?

Greetings denizens of r/politics. This is our December Metathread, and our final meta discussion thread for the year. A lot has happened this year, and through it all our users were here contributing, discussing and sharing their thoughts. Let's take a look back at what changes we've made, problems we've faced and things we've discussed within r/politics. 

[January](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5o598x/january_2017_submission_rule_changes_youtubing/) [February](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5ruc4q/february_2017_meta_thread/) [March](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5xao8p/march_2017_meta_thread/) [April](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/641zv5/april_2017_meta_thread/) [May](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/69f2bu/may_2017_meta_thread/) [June](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6eum4g/june_2017_meta_thread/) [July](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6n1xhk/meta_thread_july_2017/) [August](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4wajx9/august_2016_meta_thread/) [September](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/69f2bu/may_2017_meta_thread/) October (oops) [November](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7akawd/november_2017_metathread/)

Here's a small list of things that changed internally on r/politics this year:

* We moved to a whitelist system for Youtube submissions, and later for all link submissions. The whitelist and guidelines for sources [can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/whitelist). We think that these changes have been successful in accomplishing their main goals - reducing spam and making the /new queue more legible for our users. The whitelist started with around 800 domains and has ballooned in size since its introduction to thousands of entries. We will continue to grow and manage the list as time passes.
* We started conducting two weekly threads - the 'Saturday Morning Political Cartoon' threads, and the 'In Your State' discussion series. Shout out to our mod u/optimalg for taking those projects on and managing them throughout the year.
* We adjusted our rules and settings for new users - creating an age requirement for submissions, removing low karmna comments from new users automatically and creating a much harsher ban enforcement track for new accounts.
* To cut down on user harassment, we took the step of auto removing /u/ pings in our community. 
* With reddit Inc's [announcement that they are changing their site guidelines to do away with the so called ""90/10"" rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6bj5de/state_of_spam/), we started allowing official verified source accounts to post in r/politics. As part of this change, we [created a new rule which explicitly states that sources and users with a potential conflict of interest must broadcast their employment or affiliation](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/index#wiki_disclosure_of_employment). Punishment for users discovered to be non-compliant with this rule would be banned, and would potentially risk having their domain banned from our community.
* We collaborated with an MIT research team on a study [into the effects of voting behaviour on user civility](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6o1ipb/research_on_the_effect_downvotes_have_on_user/). It is our hope that the results of this experiment will published for the community to read early in the coming year. 

Here are answers to some of the most common questions and critiques that we've seen this year:

##Our most frequently asked questions

**Q:** Why is *ABC* source not permitted when I think it should be? Why is *XYZ* source allowed when I think it shouldn't be?

**A:** The introduction of the whitelist system for sources was a major improvement to the state of the /new insofar as a reduction in spam and low quality content. The hope was that with a more manageable /new queue, we'd get increased participation in /new and rising from our users, and I think there's some evidence that we were successful in this regard. A problem that we've encountered is that many users take the whitelist as a moderator endorsement of the sources within - it isn't, and there are many sources on the list that I personally have disdain for. Our intent is to allow *all* on topic sources that we feasibly can and let the **community** be curated by the community - making the community responsible for what content gets seen and what content doesn't get seen is a fundamental principle of the reddit platform. We aren't editors, we aren't curators - while fairly keeping content on topic and relevant, we want to reduce our interference and potential personal bias as much as we possibly can. On the flip side of this are websites that we have been in order to maintain community standards (no **state sponsored** propaganda, no personal blogs or blog platforms) or purely for purposes of practicality (no serial rehosters - websites which have a majority of their content duplicated or taken from other places). We're sensitive to the concerns of users on both sides of this issue - people who would like us to be more selective with the sources we allow, and people who would like us to put *more* responsibility for the curation process back in the hands of users. For the moment, we think we've struck a fair balance between these positions, but we *are* listening and will continue to evaluate and adapt our policies in the coming year. 

**Q:** Why was my submission removed for 'Re-hosted content'? Why was my submission removed as 'Off topic'?

**A:** These are two rules that we think are very important to maintain a reasonable standard of quality and fairness for link submissions - they're also some of most difficult rules for us to enforce. The 'Re-hosted content' rule is meant to prevent content from being stolen or re-worked by multiple sources without contributing substantial reporting or analysis. This rule helps reduce unnecessary duplicates of stories that have already been submitted to us, and increases our the quality of reporting that our readers have access to. The 'Off topic' rule is meant to ensure that content stays explicitly relevant to US politics. We completely understand that there may be news stories that have content which has political subtext or political implications but as per our On Topic Statement, we need articles here to be about:

 * Information and opinions concerning the running of US governments, courts, public services and policy-making.

 * Private political actions and stories such as demonstrations, lobbying, candidacies and funding and political movements, groups and donors.


##Our questions for the community

 * How do you think we could progress towards an editorial/op-ed flair system? This proposal has stalled due to indecision as to how we would handle sites that do not distinguish between news and editorial content. How do you folks envision an editorial flair mechanism working? What do you think would be the best way to handle sites that do not make a distinction? Realistically, would we be able to implement such a system without receiving an influx of ""This is an editorial!!!"" reports on things?

 * Self-post Saturdays - who wants them? Who doesn't? Could we do anything to increase the quality of submissions if we considered re-implementing this program?

 * Special discussions and themed days - we've been very happy with our 'In your state' series, and with the special event discussion threads that we've hosted. Are there any other regular or one off threads that people have an idea for?

 * Re-hosting - this is one of our most difficult rules to enforce, but still one that we think is important to have. Does the community have thoughts on how we could be more consistent with this rule? Is there anything we could try doing to specific websites that would help submitters identify re-hosted content on their own?

 * Close to two years after implementing it, how do people feel about the 'Exact title only' rule? Are there any potential tweaks that we could make that would ensure it works better?

personalfinance,Obsessed/depressed over paying off debt??,"Hi Personal Finance! I recently graduated and have been working towards getting all my finances in order. I graduated with $25,000 in debt and have been obsessed with trying to pay it all off.

I started a new job that pays okay (above minimum wage but below $50k) and it's been hard adjusting. I have paying the student loan debt fairly aggressively (5.5% interest rate, Canada) but doing so has left me obsessing over the debt and not enjoying life.

I live with my parents (I pay utilities, groceries and a portion of rent) and commute for well over two hours a day to work and because all my friends are still in school, it's been a very lonely experience, especially since there are people I know that don't even have debt to begin with because they come from generational wealth.

Any advice on how to manage this? I know paying off the debt is more pragmatic, but work is killing my soul and obsessing over the debt is making me depressed.",finance
personalfinance,Am I conceptualizing just how great a 401k is correctly?,"I know 401ks are great because of the power of compound interest, and because of the average annual stock market return of 7%, but I thought of something else today and I want to run it by you all to see if i have this right:

Because contributions are pretax, for every dollar I contribute I save, let’s say, 28 cents  on federal income tax, 8 cents on federal payroll, and say 5 on state. So, total, 41 cents.

That means that so long as my 401k doesn’t decline in value by 41%, I’m still coming out ahead, right? (Ignoring time value of money and all that.)

Meaning even if I knew for sure that the market would decline by, say, 20% in 2018, I’d be better off maxing out my 401k the whole year than waiting till 2019, assuming those are the only two options.

Do I have that figured correctly?",finance

Right now, most people only care about BTC because of its enormous price appreciation. For the vast majority of participants who are purchasing bitcoin, they expect no utility from it other than to sell their place on the blockchain for more money to some other greater fool.

I know the avalanche method calls for paying things down in the order of the highest to lowest interest rate but I'm wondering if there's any benefit to paying one first over the other based on the product type and the impact the reduced balance will have on my credit score since the rates are nearly identical.

2) Personal Loan: Balance $7,494.39, $278.49 payment, 14.99% and loan will mature in 8/2020

CryptoCurrency,NY Woman arrested for sending Bitcoin to ISIS,"Lol, what an idiot.  SHOULD HAVE USED MONERO, BRUH.  Not to mention the amount she would have saved in transaction fees.

""A Long Island woman is accused of laundering bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and wiring the money overseas to help the Islamic State group, according to federal prosecutors.

Zoobia Shahnaz, a 27-year-old Pakistani-born resident of Brentwood, was being held without bail following her Thursday arraignment on charges of bank fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and money laundering, prosecutors said.

The former lab technician worked in Manhattan and had no known criminal history, according to prosecutors who said that beginning in March she fraudulently obtained more than $85,000 through a bank loan and credit cards to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies online.

“She then made several wire transactions to individuals and opaque entities in Pakistan, China and Turkey, which were designed to avoid transaction reporting requirements and conceal the identity, source and destination of the illicitly-obtained monies,” court documents said.

“These transactions were motivated to benefit ISIS, which the defendant ultimately sought to join in Syria,” the documents said.

During this period, prosecutors said Shahnaz accessed numerous Islamic State propaganda websites and message boards. In January 2016, she traveled to Jordan to volunteer with the Syrian American Medical Society.

Prosecutors said Shahnaz quit her job in June without telling her family and was stopped by authorities at John F. Kennedy International Airport in July while attempting to board a flight to Islamabad, Pakistan. Her flight included a layover in Istanbul, Turkey, a common point of entry for individuals trying to join the Islamic State group in Syria, prosecutors said.""

personalfinance,"Pilot with 160K in Student Loans, Can't be a Pilot anymore need a new Career","TLDR:
Went to school to be a Helicopter Pilot, recently was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I am no longer legally able to fly pending a special investigation from FAA, currently seeking loan forgiveness options and a new career 


This is my second time posting here. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/73ypda/new_pilot_in_debt_160k_career_change/) is my last post for those curious. The TLDR of that thread is: I am a Helicopter Pilot who was having a hard time finding a job and was worried I wouldn't be able to pay all my loans back. I would like to thank those who replied there they gave me hope and some great options to look into. 

But I'm afraid things have taken a turn for the worst. 

The next day I had a employer email me wanting to set up a phone interview. I responded with my schedule and available times. That was over 2 months ago and I'm still waiting for the phone call. A little while later I managed to get a phone interview that did not go well. There had to have been communication errors or something but the guy did not like my questions about his company and he didn't like my answers. The rejection and stress of life affected me a lot worse than it should have and later that night I found myself staring down the wrong end of a 12 gauge. 

It was then I decided I needed help. I'm now working with a Psychologist who diagnosed me with Depression and Social Anxiety.  I should have caught it earlier, the signs where there, but I thought it was just life and that was the way it was. I haven't informed my Aviation Doctor about my diagnoses yet but from what I've found my Medical License will be revoked and will only be reissued following a investigation by the FAA on a case-by-case basis.

It would take me months if not years to get my Medical License back and that's assuming that I can even get it back. I cannot afford to wait that long and let's be honest. How many of you would want someone like me flying your loved ones around? 

I realize that my ability to think critically and logically have been compromised and hope you can offer some unbiased advice. I am looking for a new career one that will allow me to make a $2k a month loan payment (its my goal to put 2k a month into loans) and doesn't require a lot of money to get into. Also if you guys/gals know of any way I can get some of my loans forgiven (since I legally can't fly anymore and becoming a pilot is what I used the 160k for) I would appreciate it. 
 

Loans: Federal 24,000. Private 20,000. Wells Fargo 120,000. 

Careers I am currently interested in: Avionics Technician, Welder, Plumber, Electrician, Radiation Technologist, or a Machinist

investing,"[options] Screwed up and bought an option, on expiration Friday, with unsecured funds (cash account, now can't sell), and now it's looking like it might expire ITM - don't have the funds to exercise.","Well I made a little money on an option expiring today, sold it, and with the funds bought the same strike expiring next week.

Keep in mind the option I sold (and bought) was almost my entire accounts value. It's not much, just learning money really. Only one contact worth a couple hundred bucks, but that's all I had in the account.  

Except, with some remaining funds I fucking mistakenly also bought another option with an open order I had. Same strike as the others, but expiring today. In other words I used the proceeds from the first sale to ""roll over"" to next week, but also re-bought the original one. Now, it looks like it's going to expire ITM. I don't have the $20,000 in the account to buy the exercised option, nor do I want to.

personalfinance,Inheriting Retirement Accounts,"My mother passed away unexpectedly without a will. My sister and I are each inheriting:

* Approximately $90k from an annuity that grows 1.5% annually
* Approximately $70k in an IRA account
* Approximately $60k once the probate process concludes in April (house has already sold)

The annuity and IRA had us named as beneficiaries; we can access the funds within 5-10 business days. I've discussed the situation with our estate lawyer and a fiduciary and am comfortable that I understand the process of moving accounts into my name and the timeline for doing so. The above amounts are the amounts that I can expect to inherit; my sister will receive the same. The annuity and IRA have several options for disbursement and will be classified as taxable income.

I am 34, married, with 2 children. I have poor credit that is beginning to show signs of improvement. We currently rent and pay $850/mo. My wife just started working full time again this fall now that our kids are both in school for full days and our household income is now $55k/yr. We both contribute to our employer's retirement plans and are comfortable with our savings level at this point. Our main goals with the inheritance are to improve our emergency fund, pay down high interest debt, and purchase a home.

Our high interest debt includes:

* $1200 in credit card debt
* $5000 in student loans, greater than 5% interest
* $8000 remaining balance on auto loan at 8% interest

My thought process is to cash in the annuity immediately and use the funds to pay down high interest debt in order to boost our credit scores before shopping for a home loan, setting aside about 15% for taxes. The remainder of the annuity cash would be deposited into a high-yield savings account to serve as emergency fund and down payment on a home. Once probate clears, those funds would be added to the savings account. Once a home has been purchased, the remaining funds, save for the emergency fund, can be reinvested and make more than the 1.5% that the annuity will pay.

We'd like to reduce our monthly housing payment from $850 down to around $500, so would like to put more down on the house than is typical. This would clear up room in our budget to save more than we are able to now. A home that fits our needs without being too extravagant is around $200k in our area.

My questions for you, r/personalfinance, are:

* Is the above thought process logical/optimal, or am I making a mistake somewhere?

* I'm uncertain what to do with the IRA account. If we cash it out, we may be able to pay for a home in cash, but this doesn't seem like the best option as we'll lose some to taxes. Is the best option to simply roll it over into an Inherited Stretch IRA account?

My wife and I each contribute to our own retirement 

* Should I pay off the $8k car loan, continue to make the monthly $250 payment, or try to refinance it? The interest rate is 8% from when our credit was worse than it is now.

Thank you for any and all input.

personalfinance,Best savings account to take an emergency fund and let it sit for said emergencies?,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

I am currently restructuring how I'm storing my money from just having a basic Chase bank account (checking/savings). The plan is to have keep a checking for day to day (Chase/Wells Fargo/BoA) for direct deposit, autopay for bills, Venmo, ect; switch the savings account to a split between a brokerage account and separate emergency savings account (the one that all the guides tell you to have 3-9 months of savings in case of job loss, medical bills, ect). The brokerage will act as my main savings which I will dump excess from each month into (saving about 1-2k a month currently) and the savings will be mostly untouched to just accrue interest until the day I might need it. My question to you is, which savings account is best for this purpose? I actually prefer it separate from my brokerage (which will probably be schwab/vanguard/ameritrade) since the checking/savings I open there will just be for managing inventment money.

What I know so far:

Basically looking among-st the banks that give 1.2-3% since that appears to be the highest savings interest. I do want it to be reasonably accessible since it will be emergencies that I plan to use this money for. A friend recommended Goldman's Marcus account, but from what I've read it has no online/mobile presence so depositing seems to be a literal mail-in process and withdrawing is much more complicated. Anyone have a good mix of somewhat easy to access but high interest rate? I wont be checking on this account much so it doesn't have to have a pretty mobile app, but I would like to be able to transfer to my checking without a long wait or hassle. 

EDIT: Reading up on the responses and seatcord's link, Ally and American Express both look like they fit the bill. American links to a bank account and has a .1% higher interest rate, anyone know of drawbacks? Just from glancing through it it seems pretty reliable",finance
btc,The lightning network will save us all!,"The fight for the soul of bitcoin is unfolding in front of our eyes, and YET I constantly see debate that the lightning network is ""vaporware"". People are arguing about convenience and cheap fees over why bitcoin was ACTUALLY created.

Let's just imagine that the lightning network rolls out tomorrow and is an *INSTANT* overnight success (ZERO fees, instant transactions) and manages to onboard half the population in the process. IT'S OVER! History will literally repeat itself. Bitcoin was created to replace our broken monetary policy, **NOT** be paypal 2.0. People seem to confuse convenience with economics.

Let's make some comparisons. Think of GOLD as LAYER 1 (*expensive to transport, cumbersome, impractical*), so we create LAYER 2, paper money in the form of IOUs. Naturally, banks and federal reserve got greedy, started to print more IOUs than gold outstanding and we eventually abandoned layer 1 because it didn't reflect reality. 

Bitcoin is LAYER 1. Lightning network is LAYER 2. Fees get so outrageous, no one can afford to open/fund/close channels so large centralized hubs subsidize those costs (*more convenience*), and digitally print their own imaginary bitcoins that does NOT reflect reality of layer 1 (21 million cap). They start to issue loans, other shenanigans and we're back to square one! Your dollar is **LITERALLY** worth 2 cents less than the year before. Lightning with a crippled layer 1 is the same recipe! 

Bitcoin **MUST** scale on chain! To scale any other way defeats the purpose of why Satoshi created bitcoin to begin with! Can we change the rhetoric of arguing with people over technicals to something that's more historically common sensical? If people understood some history, everything would become so much more obvious.

Bitcoin was created to empower people by giving them economic freedom. Layer 1 MUST scale. The soul of Bitcoin lives on in the form of Bitcoin Cash.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"~5k into a high-interest credit line/card (20%), potential options to reduce interest?","To expand on the title, I am about 5,000 dollars in debt to PayPal credit. About half of that is not being charged interest yet, but it will be soon. About 1,500 of that was spent on personal debts and such, about 3,000 was spent on a vehicle when I was in a tight position and denied on an auto loan (I made paying with PayPal Credit work to pay, without going into specifics). The other ~500 is tied up in buying/selling stuff, which makes me a small but reliable profit. I don't make much, and obviously the optimal solution is to eliminate as much debt as quickly as possible. I am definitely going at a good pace (~100-200 a month) and my debts are declining as opposed to rising, but I know I am going to hit a point where the other 2.5k is being charged interest as well, and I'd like to ideally not be paying at a 20% interest rate, as well as 6 months of interest piled on. I am very aware I didn't make the best choice here, possibly, and while I'm not in ruins here and feel very confident I COULD keep going through term of this debt even if nothing changed, I would like to arrange my finances to best benefit me.

Can anyone think of any solutions to this, that might finance better? I've considered another credit card with better rates, maybe being able to flip the debt onto that. I make approximately 240 bucks net take-home a week, and a reasonable bit extra 'undocumented'. My credit is not too bad, I've never been late on payments. Have student loans I've kept in good standing with so far. Only negative mark I found was one unpaid medical bill that I have to date had no interest in handling - I understand that is probably not a good thing, though. They were very unwilling to negotiate and the service was absolutely not performed (checked in but ended up leaving before being seen to seek actual care instead of being sat in a room, long story short).

Edit: In case it matters, I am male, mid-20's, live in NY, small town. Own two cars on paper, one is very much worth nothing to anyone but myself and does not run,  and the other is a mid-2000's vehicle and has been very reliable so far.

Should I make contributions to the 401k or should I focus on paying down my high interest student loans? I have opened an account with DCU,but only US citizens /permanent residents are eligible to refinance student loans. Is there another option that I am not aware of to help me with the student loans?

Any help is appreciated.

CryptoCurrency,Federal Reserve vs Cryptocurrency,"Big picture time. Let us speculate for a moment--- What if the FCC's decision was backed by pressure from the Federal Reserve? By repealing Net Neutrality, the FCC has subsequently provided our government, using Internet Service Providers as proxy, the possible means to shut down access to the near $300 billion dollars hidden within unregulated, untaxed, cryptocurrency marketplaces. As reported by the Council on Foreign Relations, many extremist groups and state actors, including North Korea, Iran and Russia (among others), are speculated to have a large share in these virtual exchanges.

Given Trump's record of rolling back Obama-era laws, the media is associating this GOP-led repeal with Trump administration politics; however, there may be a larger motivation for this recent push to repeal — especially despite the massive public outcry in opposition. With so many people concerned by how this repeal will impact streaming video services, digital entertainment and online freedom of speech— it might help to consider that the larger piece at play, at this time, could be a move by the Federal Reserve to start reeling in these blackmarket currency exchanges.

As a quick primer, cryptocurrencies are virtual currencies, exchanged through anonymous 'miner' intermediaries -- individuals who use their own computers as transaction servers. As benefit, these intermediaries acquire a tiny percentage of the transaction, added as tax to the sale, for hosting a transaction. This, in turn, encourages the reliability of intermediaries through a constant revenue stream-- available to nearly anyone. An interested party only requires a computer with decent processing power, a reliable GPU, and high speed internet, to begin acting as an intermediary and generating an income.

While the margin of cost for this can fluctuate, in recent months, it is only become more profitable to mine these exchanges.
If the backbone of these cryptocurrencies exchanges rely on 'miners/intermediaries' to facilitate the transactions, and, the Federal Reserve has adamantly expressed their concern and inability to control these exchanges, is it not safe to assume that the most efficient way to put an end these unchecked virtual marketplaces, one with no tangible/physical assets, is to target the network traffic generated by these intermediaries directly. By allowing ISP's to throttle back services at-will, the our government could, in theory, bring the a large portion of the cryptocurrency market to a halt. While there are many added, negative, consequences to the FCC's decision, it might help to consider how the Federal Reserve could benefit from such a repeal-- regardless of which agency repealed in the first place.

While this may seem like an extreme move to make, let's not forget that this has happened before to other virtual blackmarket commodity exchanges. For example, in the wake of an era rampant with software piracy, revisions to privacy laws provided Internet Service Providers the ability to monitor for torrent (the filetype associated with peer-to-peer data exchange) traffic, and, if they found a consumer to be utilizing these services, provided ISP's legal authority to disrupt your service. Recent changes to the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act have only continued to reinforce the position of Internet Service Providers as provisional enforcers in our governments war against blackmarket exchanges.

--- Of course, this is all speculation and just a brainstorm of a theoretical situation.

personalfinance,"Lender says, ""Adjustable rate mortgage in your case is a better option than 30-year fixed FHA."" I don't know if the lender is right.","For the past few years, I was always with the belief that a 30-year fixed rate loan was the smartest choice for a home in which we plan to live out our lives. However, my lender made a suggestion that has challenged that belief and I am not sure how to handle it. According to my lender, I qualify for a professional mortgage program, which means I can borrow up to 95% without having to pay mortgage insurance. The thing with this program is that it is an ARM (5/1 or 7/1). What she suggests is that we go with the ARM, because the savings we will get from paying mortgage insurance could go into paying more into the house. Once we reach the end of five or seven years, we can refinance. Although the idea sounded very good, I expressed concern that if I were to refinance later, interest rates may likely be higher (based on everything I’ve been reading in the news) and I’d rather be locked in for 30 years w/ FHA. She then counters that by saying that once I am eligible to not pay the mortgage insurance, I will have to refinance anyway. Going down the FHA route would cost me money. I couldn’t argue with her on that, but as a first-time buyer, I don’t have the sufficient knowledge/experience to know whether this approach is worth it. I am hoping r/personalfinance can help me. 

Some details that may be useful: we have been pre-approved for 603K. Our limit for a house, however, is to not exceed 550K. We have 103K of savings, of which we plan to set aside 5% for closing costs and an extra 10K for incidentals, leaving us with 65.5K for down payment. Our lender used 65K in her calculation, with ARM 5/1 @ 3.75% and 7/1 @ 3.875%. In contrast, the 30-year fixed FHA is 4.125%. I am a professor at a state university and make 80K (pretax) and my wife makes 55K (pretax) as an administrator at a non-profit. I am hoping to get tenure in 2020, which comes with a 10-15% increase in salary. My wife plans to continue working with her employer, where she is expected to continue getting pay raises (not sure how much yet). We have no debts. A solid credit score.

Bitcoin,Hyper-Bitcoinization Will Happen In 2022. Here’s Why.,"-or-

Cryptocurrencies Will See The Greatest Bull Run From 2018 to 2022. Here’s Why.

***

1. Stock market and crypto and lots of things right now are very high right? Looks like a bubble. Hold that thought.

2. Federal Reserve raised interest rates from 0-1% in 2016. https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/interest-rate

3. We know that before the 2008 crash, the Fed interest rate was 5%. So 1% possibly means we are currently far away from a bubble pop. https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/interest-rate

4. The typical credit micro-cycle lasts from 5-8 years, according to this video: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0

5. We know that from 2009-2016, the FED Interest Rate was basically 0%. This means that during that time, the economy was “de-leveraging” (people were unwinding their debt obligations, this takes time). This means that the de-leverage cycle lasted about 6 years. And that 2016 was the start of a new leveraging cycle. If this is the case, then we are now not at bubble peak. Bubble will burst...2016 + 2.5 or 4 years. maybe even longer. If we ASSUME that leveraging will take 6 years, that puts us in 2022 when the bubble pops (the wealth transition period the time traveller talks about), this is almost in-line with what the reddit time traveller said in 2013! https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1lfobc/i_am_a_timetraveler_from_the_future_here_to_beg/

6. When the bubble pops in 2019-2022 (we don’t know the exact year), crypto will be a mature asset. It will also be very expensive, because during the bubble years (2017 to 2022), everyone would be using immense credit to buy crypto, driving it’s price up right? (https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/11/people-are-taking-out-mortgages-to-buy-bitcoin-says-joseph-borg.html) Why do I say it’s an asset? Because people right now mostly buy crypto to HODL, in the expectation of future increase in price. This makes it behave more like a commodity, or asset, than a currency, for now.

7. When the economic bubble pops in 2019-2022, I believe there could be 2 outcomes:

Outcome A. 
People sell crypto assets to pay their debts, just like the housing bubble caused the foreclosure of homes. Crypto declines in price or crashes. See what happened in 2013, when the first Bitcoin bubble popped.

Outcome B.
Because crypto is so expensive, in 2022, and the value of fiat has collapsed so much...people decide to switch over to crypto. They prefer to escape the current system, rather than feed it. Crypto at this point has also matured and solved the scaling issues, through layer 2, better algorithms, maybe the hashgraph, or the lightning network. This allows Crypto to now begin to function as a currency, in addition to being a store of value! A new ruling class is created from the top 1% of people who own crypto. This is hyperbitcoinisation. B also means that conversion to crypto might happen faster than we think. It also means the rich poor gap could become even more huge! Crypto doesn’t solve the wealth distribution issue. In fact it could make it worse. https://medium.com/@BambouClub/are-you-in-the-bitcoin-1-a-new-model-of-the-distribution-of-bitcoin-wealth-6adb0d4a6a95

This is my worry: 
A complete solution for our world economy, must be a Crypto or a Constitution that also solves the wealth distribution issue. Bitcoin does not do this, neither does any crypto currency available today, I feel. I suggest taking some guidance from Permaculture on this, how to build a self-sustaining, stable system, by matching inputs and outputs. It is clear to me at least, that our simplistic economic models are unable achieve this at present.

Addendum:
I make no predictions for the future price of Crypto or Bitcoin. However there are many people out there on Twitter that predict 1 BTC will be 500k or more around 2020. Assuming that Bitcoin 10x every 2 years, 1 million USD per BTC in 2022, is not too far-fetched.

The blockchain is a wonderful tool, however like a double-edged sword, it is up to us humans to change to become better, wiser. Otherwise it’s like giving a loaded gun to a child, the societal implications of hyper-bitcoinisation are enormous, and we need to manage them properly in order to ensure fairness and civility for all.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Am I botching this Roth conversion? (401k &amp; Roth 401k to Roth IRA roller + conversion questions),"So, I had an old employer-based 401k account that allowed me to make both pre-tax and post-tax contributions (traditional and Roth).

I'm looking to have all of my money in a Roth by EOY for advantageous tax purposes due to only working / earning for a few months this year.

The traditional 401k amount was ~$35k.  The Roth 401k was ~$7k, of which ~$5k was my post-tax contribution.

I rolled over the entire 401k, and Fidelity split the rollover into a traditional IRA for the traditional portion, and a Roth IRA for the Roth.

I'm looking to convert the new traditional IRA into a Roth IRA, but this will come with a hefty tax bill (quick online calculator suggests about ~$8k state &amp; federal).  

I don't want to take out the $8k from my bank account, as I'm applying to refinance my student loans and need the cash as an asset on my application (bank looks at non-retirement accounts in approval).

Hypothetically, were I to try to use my Roth IRA to pay $5k (the part I contributed) of the tax, can I do so without penalty?  Can I do so for the full $7k that was rolled over?  

It's not clear to me whether or not the rollover for the Roth portion ""maintained"" that clear distinction of contribution vs. earnings, or if I've botched this horribly and somehow locked away post-tax contributions with this rollover.

An hour and a half of Googling left me listless, so here I am.  Any and all advice is appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Buying a house for my parents (1st time home-buyer),"I've read a few different threads on here that are similar to my situation, but not quite the same, and would love to get some advice. I’m thinking of buying a house for my parents back in my hometown, even though I’m still renting.

Some background… I’m 30 y/o, single, have a steady career, and annual salary of ~$80k. I really don't have any desire to be a homeowner right now, but my parents currently rent and I'd like them to have a house of their own again. I'd make the down payment and it would be in my name, but it would essentially be THEIR house (they'd pay the mortgage and cover any other expenses that come up). They both collect SS and my dad still works (he is self-employed) so has a decent income stream on top of that. But my credit score is much higher than theirs and I'm also not sure if they would even be able to have a house in their name at this point. Long story short, due to some financial troubles many years ago (15-20+), they had to declare bankruptcy, lost their dream house (my childhood home), and have had to rent ever since. So this might be the only option for them to 'own' a home again.

As a first time home-buyer, this is obviously all new to me. I'm trying to do as much research as I can, but it's been tough due to the uniqueness of our situation. One of the biggest things I am confused about is whether or not this would need to be classified as an investment property that I’d be ‘renting out’. If so, I read that I'd have to put more $$ down and deal with a higher interest rate on the loan. But because of the circumstances, is there a way around that? I'm not really looking to profit from this, just want to do something nice for my parents. I'm also considering moving back home in the next few years, so if we found a house with a guest house or separate living quarters, that would be ideal, as I could live there for a while. If that's the case, could it be considered owner-occupied instead? Or is that not possible because I currently rent in another state?

I'm also trying to figure out how much I need to have saved up before making this happen. We'd be looking for a house in the $200-250k range and as I mentioned earlier I make about $80k annually. I've been focusing on paying off student loans and don't have much in savings right now (other than retirement, and I'm not sure I want to touch that) but I would make an effort to save much more over the next 1-2 years to make this happen.

Hopefully I included enough info. It might seem like a crazy concept, but I just hate that my parents are still renting at their age and don't love the home they're currently in. They've done a lot for me and my siblings throughout our lives and I really want to help them out now that I'm in a pretty good situation financially.

Thanks in advance for any advice/insight!",finance

personalfinance,Increase student loan payment vs. current contribution to 401k,"Hello Everyone

I was just having a discussion with my buddy about his budget and personal finance. The question comes down to this. 
- His wife has a student loan with ~$65,000 balance. 
- The interest rate is 6.785%. 
- He and his wife can afford to pay $500/month to the loan (with budgeting, etc.). 
- He is contributing $846 per month to his 401k from work (10% of his income). 
- Employer does a 4% match
- We discussed him doing a refinance with cash out on his home. However, if he did this it would put his LTV below 20% on his $300k home (current mortgage balance is $228k). He then becomes subject to PMI which would be about $280 a month so that doesn't seem to make sense

The Question: should he reduce his 401k contribution and put that money towards the loan pay down? if so, how much?

I am really sad to say I know nothing about personal finance or saving or anything, I guess that's why I am here! Hoping to learn a lot from this subreddit and I plan on taking some relevant finance/business courses in the next couple of terms so I don't enter adulthood completely ignorant.

Basically, I currently have one checking account with all of my savings in it. I honestly can't explain why I don't have a savings account right now, I thought I did when I set this one up...

Regardless, before I create that savings account with this bank, I was wondering if I should explore other banks and whether there is a difference between them and if I could get benefit from opening an account elsewhere.

I'm currently on a student account and I don't really know what that means besides that there are no annual fees, I think. I'm so sorry for sounding completely ignorant. I mean I am, but maybe the fact that I know I am makes it a little better. Heh.

personalfinance,"$0 in Bank, Own Trailer, Need to move for mental health reasons. Advice on how to best proceed?","My need: To make money to move off of this island, and find the most lucrative solution with my trailer. As soon as possible, preferably, as the social landscape where I live is hurting my mental health. I am mid twenties, single, trailer is only asset, and socially isolated (don't feel safe or respected by poly-sexual community). Passing through severe heartbreak and need some support in appropriately and intelligently getting past this situation.

Basic facts:

Unemployed for 3 months. Sudden, unexpected end to previous job. Since it was technically a 'self-employed', the employer did not legally need to give me 2 weeks notice. This happened after I was travelling back home for 1 month, during which time I spent money in ways I wouldn't have if I knew my job wasn't going to be there when I got back.

No remaining savings.

Just got a job as a waitress PT, do freelance writing online (~$250 per month income), and invested remaining cash in a keyboard so I can build repertoire and tour giving concerts to retirement homes (25 in my area @ $50-100/hour, makes that lucrative. I have done it in the past)

Have a loan for a trailer via parents (bank will not give me a credit card), + agreed to pay $650/month to cover loan plus interest of $40/month. It is possible to just pay interest and not contribute to paying back the loan for some time if necessary, which has been the case for 1 month now.

Pay $350 for where I park the trailer

Cannot presently afford a cell phone, vehicle, nor food (using food bank).

Applied for assistance but cannot receive any because I have to apply for proof of SIN. In order to get proof of SIN, I need to provide my birth certificate, which was lost in the mail. Since I was born in Ontario and now reside in BC, getting the birth certificate is a several month process, and of course there are fees associated with this. I do not have time to wait several months, of course, since my need is immediate.

I currently live on a small island off the coast. Small population, I moved here with my partner but we have since broken up. I have a need to leave this island, as the social environment is not conducive to my wellbeing. In order to move away, I need to make enough money to do so, and find the most lucrative solution for my trailer ($12,000 remains on the loan, with interest added each month). This trailer gives me a sense of security as it is my home, and I am in a place of very low security in any life sphere, and so I have fear and anxiety in giving up the trailer. However, I also see that I need to leave the island and am not yet decided on whether to stay in BC (and move the trailer somewhere if possible - I am looking for a higher population density), or if I will go home to Ontario. I will need to buy a car to drive my belongings to my new home, wherever it is, and also consider purchasing a vehicle to A) get to work without having to hitchhike, and B) to explore new potential places to live before committing to moving

In order to sell the trailer, I need to finish painting the inside. I got it for a great deal (total $15,000 loan including moving expenses), and can sell it for probably $20,000 - $23,000 after I finish the internal renovations. So the potential for return is anywhere from $5-8,000, minus Reno fees.

I could also try renting it out and split the income with the land owner. He is giving me a special deal, and I suspect if renting to someone new he will ask for more rent. $500 for parking a trailer is more the norm where I live, versus the $350 I pay. If I rented it for $600, I could potentially make $100-200, which would cover the interest rate but not contribute much to the loan.

Any advice on how to best structure my finances moving forward? And what is best with my asset?

I realize there is still grey area about my part time waitress position. I will be earning $18/hour from that, though am having to invest in medical screening ($100 investment on my end, since I have to go off island to do it + medical expenses), and will need work clothes.

I also am not eating healthy since the food bank serves very little fresh food, Kraft Dinner, and such. I need to find a way to budget in an appropriate amount for food, and hope the kitchen I will work at will share some meals with staff.

Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,Sell my car and downgrade?,So my wife and I are teachers and when we moved back to the us after living abroad we took out a loan and got a 16k VW Jetta. We pay 289 a month on the car with an interest rate of 2.39% and have about 2 years left to laying the car off a with about $6209 left to pay back. The car is from 2013 and has 91k miles on it. Would it be beneficial for us to try and sell the car pay it off and then get a cheaper car? We cannot afford a down payment on anothet car so we would likely have to take another loan out to get it. Is this only beneficial if you are paying for the new car outright and getting rid of your loan all together? At this point would changing cars allow me to maximize my money or is it better to just pay off the car and have a reliable and newer car?,finance
personalfinance,"24, Software Engineer, Not sure the best way to invest my money","Hi all, looking to get some advice on how best to allocate my funds. The details are as follows:

* I'm 24 years old, with a gross income of $130k a year.
* I've maxed out my 401k for this current year, with a 2% employee match.
* My monthly expenses are no more than $2500, including rent and car insurance and everything. 
* I have $10,500 in student loans remaining, half at an interest rate of 4.66%, the other half at 4.29%. 
* I currently have $50,000 saved so far, just sitting in a checking account (Terrible I know, it's just losing value). I am going to set aside around $15,000 of that in a savings account as an emergency fund (Probably Ally?)

Goals:

* I would like to own a house within the next 5 years.
* I would like to upgrade my car eventually, but it currently gets the job done fine. I'm trying to not be dumb and just blow my money on a BMW. 

Questions:

* One call out is that I haven't put anything into an IRA this year. I understand the differences between Roth/Traditional, but I'm not sure which one is the best for me to make a contribution to. I'm having trouble understanding how I would be making more than I currently am in retirement, and as a result I think the traditional IRA is the best for me, any thoughts?

* Is my student loan interest rate low enough that I should be investing that money instead, or should I just pay it off to be debt free?

* Where should I be investing the rest of my money? I will have roughly $25k/$35k to invest depending on if I pay off my student loans. I'm interested in getting into cryptocurrency, but have been told that should only make up about 3-5% of my portfolio. Where should the rest be invested?

personalfinance,Need Loan Refinance Advice combined with incoming Inheritance,"My girlfriend made a huge mistake while we were in college. She took out PRIVATE loans. Ugh. I know right? No one in her family ever went to college, nor dealt with loans, and ultimately she was screwed. It's unfortunate, but I've helped her a lot get that taken care of.

Originally, she had taken out some federal loans and then made up the difference remaining with private loans with Sallie Mae. They charged insane rates at 13% and 16% variable. It took a long time, but I got it refinanced somewhere with a much more manageable rate.

It is now 5 years later roughly. It's time for a review, but I have some curve balls hitting me soon.

This is the list of her loans:

1. $50,356 @ 6.3% at LendKey (Private) = $477.92 a month
2. $13,622 @ 6.25% at Federal Loan Unsub (Federal) = 151.66 a month
3. $9,466 @ 6.25% at Federal Loan Sub (Federal) = 105.39 a month
4. $5,823 @ 6.250% at Navient (Private) = 67.11 a month (NEGATED)
5. $4,992 @ 10.875 at Navient (Private) = 71.58 a month (NEGATED)

6. $12,423 @ 1.99% at Nissan (Car Loan) = 248.05 a month

My loans:

7. $12,980 @ 6.625% at Federal Loan (Federal) = 171.30 a month
8. $12,839 @ 2.74% at Jeep (Car Loan) = 170.00 twice a month


1. Total monthly = $1,633.01 a month
2. Total monthly - NEGATED = $1,494.32

*NEGATED are expenses covered by her mother as part of a repayment back to her daughter.
---------

Annual Income:

1. Her: $52,000/yr
2. Me : ~$30,000/yr (will increase by a lot soon)

Her Investments:

1. $8,701 401K (Hourly) ** Cannot add any more money due to conversion to salary.
2. $3,658 401k (SIP) Currently adding $57.45 weekly @ 4% matching
3. $1,960 401k (Bonus) Company adds % of income to this account quarterly. Averages to $373 every quarter. Cannot add.

Mine:

**I know I'm behind on my retirement more so than her. My income goes towards alleviating debts.
1. $1,471.21 Pension (Free with Job)

I have life insurance to cover all debt incurred by either of our deaths.


Current savings:

1. $6,523 in Checking (Never drops each month, just rises)
2. $4,318 in Savings

Now that you have all this information, I have a couple of questions I need to resolve. 

1. Her grandfather passed away and left her an inheritance. It's not quite here yet, but by my estimates, it will be approximately 20k. So what should I do with this? I could pay off debts, save for a down payment on a house, or just keep it in the reserves and truck on.

2. Her $50k loan's interest rate is getting higher. When I first refinanced, it was around 4.7% and now it's up to $6.3%. Should I refinance some of the other loans in hopes for a lower interest rate? When I originally did this, she only made 30K a year and the bank would only give her 50k to refinance. That is why the Navient loans still exist.

3. The Navient loans are covered by her mother as part of a repayment plan. Before her grandfather died, he gave her an advance on her inheritance (something about taxes). Her mother then borrowed that money for a down payment on a house. Her mother has agreed to cover those loans. I've largely ignored them.

I'd love to hear any thoughts you have regarding this matter. Feel free to let me know which area you wish to focus on when commenting. Thanks!",finance
CryptoCurrency,How Bitcoin could start a recession,"A lot of people seem to think that market cap is an irrelevant figure with no real meaning. However, Market cap matters a lot in a macroeconomic sense. If a serious crash comes, for example, one involving a very damaging regulation to exchanges, a lot of people would want to take their cash out. 

The current market cap is $528 Billion and even if in the event of a serious crash only 10% of that money is taken out, it must come out of somewhere.

Exchanges work like banks, and no exchange has the FIAT amount of money to be able to pay that. In order to pay people that want to cash out, exchanges have to ask for high-interest rate short-term loans to banks, these loans are very expensive because they are short-term and have a higher than usual risk, in the event of a big crash no bank would lend them money, so they would go bankrupt and will be unable to pay back to the investors. When the asset of a bank depreciated it is incredibly easy for it to suffer a bank run, where people panic and want to take out their money, this is a risk all banks face, it happens time and time again, most recently in Greece and Chipre, and becomes much more likely when banks have a high Leverage Ratio (Assets/Capital). Considering the value of assets of Coinbase is so incredibly volatile that asset can depreciate very quickly causing panic in investors that would want to liquidate their holdings, at the rate Bitcoin is growing Coinbase and other exchanges would need to be keeping all their profits in the form of capital in order to have a safe Leverage Ratio.

This possible outcome gets exponentially worse every day and will continue to get worse when as more institutional money comes floating into crypto. Right now $528 Billion might not be a real threat to our economy, but the crypto world is starting to get mainstream adoption so, it is experiencing exponential growth and will continue to do so until a hard crash happens and settles which coins actually offer something valuable and only the ones that do will recover just like it happened in the dotcom bubble of the 2000s, if this drastic correction of the prize happens when the market is worth several trillion it could really damage and spread to the rest of the economy.

The only outcome of this scenario that is not as chaotic is that, when it happens cryptocurrencies are an at a point where they are used as a medium of exchange to actually pay for things, so they would not be affected by its dollar value because they have somehow substituted regular money.

This is very far away from reality at the moment, the crypto with the highest market cap of $324 Billion is Bitcoin and is not being used at all for regular payments anymore, and until lightning network or any other game-changing technology is implemented it will only be used for speculation, this radical improvement in the ability to process payments fast with no transaction fees does not seem to come anytime soon. And don’t think that I am just shitting on Bitcoin, I don’t see any store where I can pay with Bitcoin Cash, Ethreum, Dash or with fucking BigBoobsCoin (BBC). And Bitcoin is the one with the biggest market cap so it is the most problematic one.

In the best possible scenario exchanges would allow people (or be forced) to send their coins to a wallet, so people would not lose their coins, even if most of its value is gone. In fact, the balance of Coinbase clients is insured up to $250,000 in case it becomes insolvent, this is limited to US clients and normally exchanges are not insured. So just to be safe, don’t store your coins in an exchange.

It is, however, important to note that 40% of Bitcoin is owned by 1000 people, so they will the ones that lose the most, but regular people will still be affected, not everyone invest only what they are afford to lose.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Inherited 350k and have some questions about how to best utilize it.,"I recently inherited about $350,000, which is all currently invested very conservatively and is managed by a company that has fees that are quite high.  ~70k of that money is tied up in a Traditional IRA which begins disbursement next year, while the rest is in various bonds and funds.  I am 36, have a spouse and young child, and want to get some ideas on what sort of path makes the most sense.

My partner and I make ~86k/year gross (this could go up or down 20% in the next couple years depending on various life circumstances), between both of us we owe ~50k in student loans (3.55%), ~130k on a house appraised at ~200k (3.5%), and 15k on a vehicle(1.9%).  We have a solid 6 month emergency fund and an extra 20k to invest once we make a decision on how/where we should invest.

This inheritance thrust us into a completely different financial situation, so we have some questions already, but also know there are more questions out there that we do not even know that we have, yet.  The end goal is to get the ball rolling toward retirement in 20 years, but to make the right choices in the beginning.  Lets get started:

We have discussed closing out the non-IRA investments ($290k), adding 20k and re-distributing it in a few ways-- #1 IRA accounts for both, fully funded 2017 and 2018, $5500 Traditional (to reduce AGI below 25% bracket), $16500 Roth.  #2 begin 529 for child, initial investment 10k.  #3 invest ~100k rather conservatively for potential use in 1-2 years for property purchase, and to help wipe the student loan debt.  #4 invest the remaining ~180k more aggressively.

I have researched robo-investing and feel like it would suit our needs much more than our current situation.  Wealthfront, Betterment, MotleyFool, and Vanguard are all on our short list.  Our questions include:  

--Should we wait until 2018 to leave the current investment company, or do so immediately (what numbers do we need to examine to know how selling these investments will affect our taxes for 2017)? 

--Is this a solid plan for utilizing IRAs? Should we wait to fund 2018 to see if we would benefit from an easy AGI adjustment?

--Our state does allow a full deduction for a 529, should we split our initial investment between 2017 and 2018? 

--Any recommendations for or against any of the robo-investing solutions we have mentioned?

--Any specific ideas for a relatively conservative investment for money needed within 2 years?

--Anything we missed?

We are reading voraciously, but feel its time to ask some questions.  Thank you for your time!

personalfinance,Handling 1-time credit card debt,"Hi PF, 

My wife and I recently had some unexpected life events come up and over a few months racked up close to 15k in credit card debt. Normally we live right about at our means, put any extra money towards student loan debt and have never carried a balance before. I don't believe we will continue to hemorrhage money through spending, but the interest obviously sucks. My compensation from work includes bonuses every 6 months now that I've reached a certain level. These are guaranteed and worth roughly 10k after tax. The first of those is in May. 

What are our options to minimize interest and frankly relieve some of my anxiety and stress over this debt? Aside from just paying what we can for the next several months and then using the bonuses to pay off the debt, I'm wondering if opening a new credit card with a 0% balance transfer is a good idea in my situation (the 3-5% transfer fee would be less than interest paid). 

We do own our house but don't have enough equity to get a HELOC. I have a 401k with about 10k in it (plus more from my employer that hasn't vested yet), but my understanding is that the tax implications make that not worthwhile to borrow from. 

This is in Washington state. If it makes a difference my credit score is decent (740-780 range) and largely hampered only by the fact that we moved to the US only a few years ago so length of credit history isn't great. To that point, we want to refinance our car ASAP as the interest rate on it is brutal, but was necessary with little credit history a year ago when we bought it. Similarly we'll want to refinance our house in the summer too as we should reach 20% equity around then and be able to drop mortgage insurance. I don't want to negatively impact my credit score if it would mean a worse deal refinancing the car or house. Big picture! 

What should we do?",finance
personalfinance,Confused about mortgage rates (US),"We are in the escrow process and working through the various disclosures with the loan officer recommended by our realtor. With our 760 credit score, 20% down payment for a conventional mortgage, we were pre approved and ball parked at 4.25%, just to budget for the highest rate, since we were first time home buyers.

However, going through the paperwork, they are saying interest rates are going up, but she was able to lock us in at 4.375%. This seems high. Per month, it's only ~$30, but I don't feel like the loan officer really explained why it changed (""you know, with congress reworking the tax bills."")

Looking online, I'm seeing interest rates of 3.75%, 3.8%, 3.9% for conventional 30 year mortgages.

I trust our realtor, and want to trust the loan officer, but I'm not sure I understand why these numbers have changed. 

TL;DR, I'm not sure I understand why the interest rates seen online and from our pre approval 70 days ago is so different than what I'm seeing in the escrow process.",finance

I would like some of your valued opinions on what I should do in regards to my car. Some background, I just turned 25, $60k in liquid savings @ 1.35% interest rate (I know it's a big emergency fund but I can explain later). $6,000 Vanguard TargetDate 2055 Roth IRA fully funded for 2017, I started it this year, kinda late in the game. $13k in 401k, 13% contribution with a 4% match. No debt of any kind. After taxes, 401k and insurance my take home is $3200. My monthly expenses including misc, entertainment and fixed expenses is on average $1600-1800. My annual salary is around $60k pretax but will bump to $150k in 3 years when I finish my PhD. 

HOWEVER, I don't make a car payment. I've been driving a 2007 clubman that my parents gave me after graduating high school. Which has been running okay until the past three years where I've been making an increasing number of repairs. For 2017 $1200 in January for cylinder misfires, $1000 in July for leaking oil gasket and such, $300 brake pads in September (normal wear and tear) and as of last week $1100 for gear shift repair (my car no longer turns on without this repair).

I have yet to make the last repair because I'm not sure what to do next. If I pay for this repair it would bring me at &gt;$3000 in a year just in repairs. Which is essentially a car payment. I am unsure about what to do next. 50% of me wants to make the repair but I hate that I've been repairing my car every 3-4 months. Something new is always going wrong. The car is 11 years old and has 130,000 miles which is not awful but these european parts are getting expensive. 

50% wants to buy my dream car which is a 2016 or 2017 subaru crosstrek. They go for 20,000. My dad is gifting me $5k for a downpayment and I'll be matching the $5k and then financing the final $10k. I'm hoping to drive this car to the ground. I have enough to pay for it while I'm in school with my savings.

EDIT: Before everyone flips their shit about the $60k in savings...can I buy a car? IGNORE the $60k. I'll be broke for the next 3 years with $0 income while I'm in school hence the high emergency fund. I will be at 0 or close to 0 after finishing school due to using it up for living expenses.

Relative to the other grocery store companies, Weis ranks very well in terms of its current valuation because:

- Its P/S multiple is in the middle of the pack (less than average, higher than median).
- The 5Yr CAGR is in the same spot (and equal to Kroger).
- It has almost no debt which unique and welcome in a business which runs on very slim margins and high fixed costs. The debt it does have is a revolving credit line with a variable rate. This is good.
- The yield on the name is the second highest in the business.
- It seems a fucking steal at 9x free cash flow

**Fair Value:**

Current Price = $41.03

- No Tax Bill - $44.07 (~8.35% buffer)
- With Tax Bill - $56.07 (~26.36% buffer)
- Best case - $70.76 (tax change+industry level growth+normal margins)
- Worst case - $41.89 (no tax change+ CAGR level growth+lower margins)

- Based on the metrics shown below and using a 5% growth rate for the next 5 years on the assumption of newly acquired stores tapering off to the US10Yr Bond yield of 2.35% by year 10
- With and without a tax rate reduction, there is at least some amount of a buffer

**Reasons I would buy:**

- It's family owned and family run. The Weis family continues to run the business and this is a huge plus to me
- The business itself is a good employer. They take care of their employees. Not only is this the right thing to do, it lowers employee turnover which is a massive cost savings at the store level
- They are still small enough that added growth has a high degree of operational leverage, i.e. with every added $1 in revenue, a larger % falls to the bottom line
- They have a strategy of steady acquisition rather than chase pure price competition. In the last year they bought ~50 stores. I like this model for the grocery business because a larger operation is immediately a more cost efficient one which means buying more stores not only improves their profitability, it also adds to your existing stores' profitability

**Reasons I am apprehensive:**

- They are relatively tiny which means the big boys can seriously out compete them on discounting. Food retail is all about penny profits and the big guys have lots of pennies to play with
- The family ownership makes a takeout unlikely even though this company would be a great acquisition for someone like Kroger or possibly Costco if they decide to enter the 'modern grocery' industry in their bid to open smaller stores. 
- While their acquisition strategy is solid, this is still a low margin business and acquisition by ego can damage the operations really badly. Basically, if they get an idiot to run the show, bad things can happen very quickly.
- Their recent operating history is not good. They whiffed on growth and basic things like inventory management in their new stores. Since it was their largest purchase, I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt for now but it's worrying. Inventory control is fundamental to the grocery business. 

**What I am likely to do:**

- I will probably buy the stock.

personalfinance,Sitting on a large amount of capital gains. Are there ways to minimize the tax impact? (US/OR),"I am fortunate enough to have put some money into Bitcoin a few years ago, and I'm currently sitting on a lot of capital gains. I am curious if there are ways that I can minimize the tax impact of these gains when I sell the cryptocurrency and diversify my assets. **I am not looking to evade taxes, I am looking to follow the law in a way that optimizes my income. **

I have 10 BTC, worth about $200,000 and purchased at a cost basis of a little over $1000. My current income from my employer is $75,000, so I think I would owe in the ballpark of $28,500 in federal long term capital gains taxes if I sold it today, plus an additional $18,000 or so in state income taxes (190k * 15% for federal, and 190k * estimated 9.5% for state. Current residence is in Oregon, and from what I understand capital gains is taxed at the same rate as normal income). There is also a roughly 50/50 chance that I get a bonus next year, targeted at 10% of my income. 

I am wondering if there are any **legal** steps that I can take to minimize this amount of taxes that I would owe. 

As an initial thought, is it possible for me to reduce my income to the point where I would be in the 15% tax bracket, and then I wouldn't owe any federal capital gains tax? I'm thinking maximizing tradional 401(k), IRA, &amp; HRA accounts, making charitable donations, etc. I've thought about starting a business before--if I were to purchase equipment that I would need for such a business, could it make sense to do that? Are there other common deductions that I'm not thinking of--and is there a limit to how much one can actually reduce their income in a given year? 

Thanks for any ideas.",finance
personalfinance,"Student in Top 50 law school, GI Bill is paying my tuition and living expenses, but not sure of next step.","Hi all,

I have a few questions I thought I'd run by this sub-reddit, to see if I'm missing anything obvious coming up.  So, I'm a 2d year law student at a decent-ish law school in California.  I'm 36, single, with no kids.  I have about $50k in student loans, all from my undergrad degree.  When I was in my undergrad program it was on the old GI Bill pre-2009, which frankly sucked.  I was then able to convert over to the Post-9/11 GI Bill, which is paying for 100% of my law school tuition, plus a nice living stipend (thanks Obama!).  I'm not quite able to pay off my student loans from the stipend, however.  I will not have any debt from law school though; this is a freebie.

After the military I worked for the fed for eight years, so at this point I have 13 years of federal time towards retirement.  This means two things.  First, I have 17 years left to full retirement, and I could retire at 58 (that's the minimum age for me right now; no telling what it will be in 20 years).  Second, when I start I'll immediately be getting back my 3 weeks of paid vacation, and after two more years of work I'll be up to 5 weeks of paid vacation per year, plus you can do credit hours to get that number up to 6 or 7 weeks a year or more.  The idea of taking two months off a year to travel is very appealing to me.  I like hiking and trekking, and this hobby takes time.

That said, I'm tempted to look into private sector law jobs, because they pay more and you can get bonuses.  The private sector is also more enterprising, and generally I feel that effort is more appreciated there (there was an awful lot of laziness in the federal workplace.).  I'd be fine doing almost anything if I went back into federal service as an attorney, or even as a JD-advantage job (I didn't have a single manager in 8 years who wasn't a trained attorney). The attorneys and JD advantage people I worked for/with all loved their jobs specifically for the lifestyle perks and very relaxed vacation rules.

The federal pay rates reflect the lifestyle perks and the retirement.  But, if I retire with 30 years from federal service I'd then receive paychecks equal to 80% of my top pay for the rest of my life, which (taking a guess here) would be about $110k- $140k.  I get full healthcare through the VA, although I also have private healthcare now, and would continue to get private healthcare through my employer either way (I like having options there).

So, my question to you guys is this:  would I be better served by continuing to rack up years on my federal retirement while enjoying a pretty chill lifestyle (for an attorney) and putting money into the TSP and FERS, or could I expect to make so much in the private sector as a lawyer that it would be better to start there, even at 37 (my age when I graduate) and just hustle as hard as I can for 20-25 years while investing in other things? More specifically, how much money would have to make each year in the private sector to equal
that 80% retirement pay plus TSP/FERS investments?  Also, when I ""retire"" from the fed in my late 50s I would then go into the private sector and grab all the money I can before ""really"" retiring, or if I like it just work until I die; I like vacations but the idea of just not working isn't as appealing to me.  I really can't predict how much money I would make in that phase of my career from this point, however.  I do know some ALJs who have gone into the private section and cleaned up very nicely doing exactly this (after the required ""cool down"" period).

Also, what are yalls ideas on diversifying in the bond arena? Do you agree with the article or have you had success by sticking with a single fund or ETF.

Does anyone have any sources that can help me learn more about to handle interest rate risk and other concerns when constructing a bond portfolio of funds or ETFs.

35% of ripples trading comes from Japan. Banks are accumulating on a daily basis.

They have first mover advantage hitting the market in 2012, fastest technology, solid corporate framework and successful case studies performed by most notably by the Federal Reserve and Bank of England. In February they announced partnership with its crypto facilities to create a marketplace for XRP derivates. I am speculating this will be launched in 2018. Ripple will be the crypto bridge currency of the future. Get in now while the currency is only worth 28billion. We are going much much higher.

financialindependence,Do most FI people (in the US) pay almost nothing in taxes?,"Most people who FIRE are probably depending on capital investments to find their living expenses. 

Since the long term capital gains tax is 0% if you are under the 25% income tax bracket, which is ~38k of taxable income for a single filer. So if you had 2.5 million invested in index funds and were selling 100k a year as per the 4% rule, and not earning any regular income or withdrawing from tax advantaged accounts (which I believe require withdrawals to qualify as income), you'd pay 0% federal income tax, despite getting six figures in spending money? And so you could intentionally keep your regular income below that level and pay 0% federal taxes? And does that also mean if you earn 40k of taxable income instead, you're actually earning *less* from your capital gains since you now have to pay taxes on it, and there doesn't seem to be a marginal rate?",finance

personalfinance,My Experience with MyGreatLakes (Loan Servicer),"I am by no means claiming to be an expert or that this works for everyone, but given my talks/findings with MyGreatLakes and analysis, I think the following recommendation may be applicable for those who can readily make the _Standard Repayment_ payment each month.
While I am focused on paying at least the _Standard Repayment_ payment amount, those who cannot afford to do so may still find value in the discussion on _Standard Allocation_, as it is not completely optimal.


# Basic Plan    

__If you can stay motivated in paying above the required amount, and you can pay the _Standard Repayment_ method__, then you are better served by electing the _Graduated Extended Repayment_ plan. It has lower monthly payments for the first ~10 years, allowing you to apply the overpay (to at least match _Standard Repayment_) directly to the highest interest rate loan, which the _Standard Repayment_ does not.

While at first the _Standard Allocation_ for excess payments will work, you may need to call in for some payments; _Standard Allocation_ will apply the excess amount to the principal of the highest interest rate __unsubsidized loan__. No matter the interest rate of subsidized loans, it will pay off all unsubsidized loans first, which is criminal. If you have subsidized loans with the higher interest than some of your unsubsidized, when the subsidized becomes the highest interest rate loan remaining, you will want to call each month and pay the interest on all loans and then the extra onto that subsidized loan.

The additional benefit, beyond more optimally paying off loans (unless all of your loans are the same interest rate) is that your monthly payments are lower, and you are consistently overpaying. If god forbid, something happens - you can fall back to the minimum payment for a month or two - or if really need be, fall back on the amount you are paid ahead (really not advisable though). If you do so - it means after 10 years, your graduated payment will exceed what your standard payment was; your larger payments will be split in a method beyond your control at that point - but on the bright side, you'll have paid off your highest interest loans so this split will be less detrimental. :)

# Why not the Standard Repayment?    
It's built to finish paying off all of your loans simultaneously on your final payment over 10 years. It splits each payment so a certain percentage goes to each loan beyond the interest on each loan, such that they're all paid off in the 10th year. This means you are NOT paying off your highest interest rate loans quickly - meaning you are paying extra D:

# Credit Card Payments    
Following up on an old reddit post, MGL very briefly let me make excess payments by phone with a CC for cash back purposes. However they have since repeatedly told me this is not allowable. I have not had luck in the last 4-5 months on this.

# An Unknown    
In one of my many calls, I discovered that if I pay manually at 100% on a particular loan, it will only pay accrued interest off on _that_ loan. While I'm sure I could use this to do some other form of optimization, the fear of late payment charges or unforeseen penalty for working the system keeps me from testing it.",finance

Recently I received an offer from my bank for a 60k load to be paid in 7 years, at a 3% interest rate, no extra fees. After 7 years I will have paid a bit over 66k.

Would it make sense to ask for the money and then invest it? It is unlikely that I'll need it before the 7 years, and I'll be able to make the monthly payments without any problems. According to a compound interest calculator, even a 2% annual return on 60k would return 9k interest (compounded daily) after 7 years, so It seems to make sense from a mathematical point of view.

I'm not a risk averse investor, but I'm not sure about leveraging. Could you please give me a pros and cons list?

*Edit: I know this is a risky move, but 3% is as low as I have ever seen for a personal (not backed by my house or other assets) loan.

Also worth noting that I'm **very** determined to buy a PC Build that's the most powerful atm no matter how expensive it is (was the reason why I wanted to so work hard in the first place) so I'm setting aside millions for it. Possible or nay?",finance

I have read several posts (maybe not enough so apologies if something similar has been asked) but couldn't find something pertaining to my situation.

We are currently in the 25% tax bracket filling jointly, and 2018 we will be in the 28% tax bracket.

I have a 401k with an employer match, 2/3 up to 8% where I currently invest the full 8%. I have elected to max my HSA for 2018 as well. My wife currently has been only applying $2k/yr in her Simple IRA (might be SEP need to verify).

We are buying a house in the new year with a 2.125% interest rate and will be debt free besides the mortgage in 9months.

My question: In what order should I apply our money? (Ideally as our disposable income increases) We will have my 401k, roth IRA, her Sep IRA, and potentially opening a roth IRA for her as well. HSA being maxed. As I am currently planning it goes like this...

401k up to employer match -&gt; Max HSA -&gt; Max IRA -&gt; Finish maxing my 401k -&gt; then anything extra we can investigate options like an index S&amp;P fund.... where does my wife options fit into this? Should I max hers before my route or somewhere in-between? I know there might be several benefits being self employed that we could capitalize on, just trying to understand the correct route before we have the funds to just max everything.... hope I am conveying my questions correctly.

Future plans: We will probable hover between the 28% and 33% brackets most of our working carriers, we will work until our mid 60s (both 30 now).. and would imagine our income during retirement would be in the 25% tax bracket. I am not concerned about having enough, we will, just how to maximize! Thanks, for clarity please let me know. Thanks again!

According to said ICO's support, CoinBase (who I sent from) should automatically receive the returned ether after the contract rejected it.

It's been almost 24 hours, and nothing. I assume I'm not getting my ether back, but I'm more interested in wtf happened here.

Did the ICO's contract somehow still receive the funds? Is Coinbase cockblocking me?

btc,Scale with another block size increase?,"Bitcoin Cash is getting a lot of attention the last few days. With the Bitcoin difficulty increase, the McAfee endorsement, etc, there's been a big influx of Bitcoin Cash money and attention.


Assuming people do get fed up with Bitcoin TX fees, and see LN as a centralized banking system and migrate to Bitcoin Cash, what is the long-term scaling solution?

Even with 8mb bocks, we're still limited to what ~80tps or so at best? I get that this is ""better"", but if interest in crypto continues and Bitcoin Cash really takes market cap lead, what is the game-plan for when the 8mb blocks are insufficient?

Currently there is plenty of space in the blocks, but assuming the 8mb fill up, there is legitimate miner incentive to start pumping higher fee tx into the mempool to push up tx fees. Yes, the throughput is 8x higher, but I still would anticipate that *if* Bitcoin Cash were market leader in crypto we'd hit that in 2018 and fees would start climbing. Even if it weren't artificially inflated by spam tx, it would b inflated by normal economics. What happens when Bitcoin Cash fees hit $1 or $3, or even $10?

personalfinance,"Student Loan Debt - Navient, Credible, etc. 40k debt! Wont allow me to avalanche!","Greetings!

I am a recent grad who has around 40k in school loan debt. I did some research and found that the avalanche method seems to be the most ideal for me. If I am not mistaken, that is a payment plan where you pay off your highest interest rate first. 

HOWEVER, after speaking with a Navien rep, they told me that I do not have that option, UNLESS I pay the monthly plan (which is around $400, and is taken out of the total average loans), and then pay the highest interest rate on top of that. Unfortunately, 400 is pretty much my limit at the moment, and so I'm trying to figure this out.

My loans are shown below:

Direct Loan - Subsidized
$3,100	  5.600%	
Direct Loan - Subsidized
$1,009	  4.500%	
Direct Loan - Unsubsidized
$2,129.72	  6.800%	
Direct Loan - Unsubsidized
$1,040	  6.800%	
Direct Loan - Subsidized
$1,200	  3.860%	
Direct Loan - Unsubsidized
$1,000	  3.860%	
Direct Loan - Subsidized
$3,500       4.660%	
Direct Loan - Unsubsidized
$5,000	  4.660%	
Direct Loan - Subsidized
$4,200  	  4.290%	
Direct Loan - Unsubsidized
$6,500	  4.290%	
Direct Loan - Subsidized
$4,200	  3.760%	
Direct Loan - Unsubsidized
$5,000	  3.760%


Is the best way to pay the 400 monthly and maybe do another 100-200 on top for the highest interest ones? 

Again, the navient rep told me I am not able to pay the highest interest first, and can only do that after my monthly payment (with all averaged out) is paid, and then I can pay on top of that If I want.


Also, I have heard of credible, etc and not sure if that works for me?

Ultimately, this is a 10 year plan, however I do plan on paying this all off (hopefully) within 2-3 years. However, even If I can save some money by paying off the highest interest, that is something I would like to do.

What would you guys recommend if you were in my shoes? Any opinions welcomed and much appreciated in advance!",finance

Bitcoin,Keep an eye on jobs data,"The meteoric rise of bitcoin has been intriguing to me. I find blockchain technology and the concept of decentralized currency fascinating. 

However, I worry that many investors are overextending their positions, and the only built-in stabilization that Bitcoin has is that it isn't very liquid. It's hard to quickly pull out of the market. 

We are in the expansion phase of the business cycle right now. The securities industry is up, jobs are up, and consumers have a big surplus right now. Thus, they have the free cash to throw at fun things and limited high-risk investments  (like bitcoin).

However, once the business cycle enters recession, people will lose their jobs and require their savings to weather the storm. At that point, I predict a run on the crypto market. Once jobs start slowing and the fed lowers the interest rate again, it's a sure sign that people will be lining up at the exchanges to cash in. This may not result in a full-blown crash, but at least a massive market correction. 

Just my two cents, would love to hear others' input

Tl;Dr: Once jobs decline, crypto will decline as well. There's good money to be made on calls during the decline, so keep an eye on jobs data.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,25 Years old - buying a home or renting an apartment?,"I am 25 years old living in Tampa Florida. Single, no girlfriend, children, or student loans. My current monthly expenses are:

$365 - car loan
$175 - car insurance
$150 - gas
$60 - phone

Living how I am now (rent free with the father/brother) I invest the full $5,500/year toward my IRA as well as put 10% of my paycheck toward my company 401k which matches 8%.

My job (net) brings in about $2300/m but gross w/ two bonuses per year I should bring in about $48,000 - $52,000 / year.

Renting a 1/1 apartment in Tampa that is a.... reputable area... will be around $850/m or I could get a roommate and do a 2/2 for about $1200/m. 

I have been pre-approved for $150,000 towards a home. My loan will allow me to put down 1-3% without paying PMI as it will be wrapped into the loan. The downside is the interest rate will be around 4.250%. I figure my monthly payments (mortgage only) will be around $600-700/m depending on how expensive the home is.

My question is, what makes more sense at my age from a financial standpoint? Would buying a ""cheaper"" home in Tampa make more sense that renting an apartment? I have a good job that I plan to stay with for a long time so staying in Tampa is my (current) plan.

The only downside to both plans is I doubt I will be able to invest as much toward my IRA every year as I will need to save money every month toward rent/mortgage; and possibly property tax as well as homeowners insurance.

Thoughts and advise?

CryptoCurrency,A real possibility the US government might choose/partner with ICON (ICX) as blockchain of choice? Here's the clues.,"In September, Don Tapscott joined the ICON Foundation Board of Advisors. For those unaware of who this guy is, he is one of the most influential experts in the blockchain industry and many business and governments leaders around the world turn to him to consult them about all things blockchain. If you look at this chart, https://www.rise.global/top-fintech-people  -- he ranks just below Vitalik Buterin.

Here's the news article:
https://medium.com/helloiconworld/don-tapscott-joins-icon-foundation-board-of-advisors-519631176bb4

A month later, the US government invites Don Tapscott to the White House to advise them. 
See: https://www.coindesk.com/trump-white-house-doubles-us-commitment-blockchain/

""Margie Graves, acting federal chief information officer at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),  said that SHE WILL BE MEETING WITH blockchain advocate Don Tapscott next month to discuss use cases the government might explore – stressed that she and Mulvaney view distributed ledger technology as a potentially powerful tool. Specifically, Graves sees the possibility for its use in reducing instances of fraud and waste, cutting spending and beefing up cybersecurity defenses. Chris Liddell, assistant to the president and director of strategic initiatives at the White House, also stressed that the government must approach data management with an eye for the long term. ""

""Liddell also serves in the White House Office of American Innovation (OAI), which was created by President Trump in March with a mandate to develop recommendations on how technology can be used to improve government operations. In March, Mark Calabria, chief economist to Vice President Mike Pence, told a conference in Washington that there was a great enthusiasm within the Trump White House toward blockchain, hinting that progress toward adoption could be seen in the coming years.""

So I am left wondering why Don Tapscott would, out of all the blockchain projects to join, pick and join the ICON board?? This guy was just last month named the world’s most influential digital thinker by Thinkers50.
See: http://dontapscott.com/2017/11/tapscott-named-worlds-influential-digital-thinker-thinkers50/

There is a good possibility there might to be some type of synergy between ICON and the US gov since the loop blockchain has already been in use in several large government+private institutions in Korea and unlike some other projects, they've been working on it for years. The Inter-connectivity feature means this blockchain will connect with most others, seamlessly. I'm not saying there is a partnership, but out of all the blockchain projects on the crypto market right now, this seems most promising since it's market cap is still below that of many other top platform projects. I thought about other platforms like NEO as a candidate but it seems to have too much Chinese influence. Ethereum might of been a choice, but it seems Putin/Russia wants to be buddies with Vitalik and the ETH network can never sustain 3,000+ transactions per second like it does on the ICON loop blockchain. An important point when you are talking about government networks requiring massive amounts of data access. IOTA is still way too buggy/under developed (but still hit $11 billion marketcap)

For those who are unaware, the ICX token just started listing today on two exchanges (Binance) and OkX (big Chinese exchange). In the first 12 hours, there was over $100+ million in trading volume. I don't think I've ever seen a token go through that much volume on it's first day of trading! The demand for this project seems massive. Could it be institution/insiders buying?

Right now, the marketcap seems to be around $700 million. A project of this size should be around NEO/Cardano market cap! TRON is worth $2billion. This is the MINIMAL of where ICX should be short term as their main net will be released in a few weeks!

ICON project points:

~ The loop blockchain which is integral part of ICON has partnership with Korean government.

~ ICON owns CoinOne exchange. Top 10 largest trading exchange in the world.

~ Founder was silicon valley investment banker doing IPOs for large startups before moving to Korea to start one of the largest Fintech companies in the world, ICON is part of that group.

~ ICON blockchain has been in development for past 2 years &amp; already one of the world's largest ENTERPRISE blockchain networks working with 25 security/insurance firms, 6 hospitals, 3 universities (10 added by end of 2017) and various banks have on-boarded. All currently using the ICON loop blockchain.

~ Already established one the largest partnerships with SBI Ripple Asia announced in Sept to do cross border remittance for entire Korea.

~ Buying power. Just look at what Koreans did with all the recent pumps. They are the world's biggest crypto buyers and are extremely patriot!

~ Inter-connectivity between different blockchains, a la Cosmos/Polkadot

~ The ICON loop blockchain can do 3000 transactions per second (TPS) per channel/layer with additional layers/channels added later. This means the ICON loop blockchain can scale to 9,000 TPS or more if the demand is required. 

~ Exchange listing with Bithumb extremely likely in 2018

~ Growing list of huge partners including Samsung

~ Group has 600 employees

~ More interesting tidbits: Icon is a project of Dayli Financial Group which is owned by the largest privately held mobile start-up in Korea. That start-up, Yello Mobile, has over 100 brands underneath it. Korea including popular messaging apps, online marketplaces, etc is valued at $4B+. Icon is literally owned by that company .

~ Woori bank (one of the largest banks in Korea) is releasing a sort of customer points program in the ICON blockchain network early next year? and the consortium of 25 Korean financial institutions signed up to ICON is due to release their blockchain ID tech/app on the ICON network . Pilot programs are underway with two or three large Korean Universities as well. So the tech is already real-world ready.

~ Future events coming up for ICON project:

- main net launch in a few weeks
- possible bittrex launch (since every investor was KYC with strict guidelines). There were just 7500 investors in the ICO.
- token swap, partnership announcement, coinone listing.",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,A financial expert's very negative outlook on Bitcoin.,"*Hello there people of reddit!*

*I have translated this blog post which I would like to share with you all. The original blog post appeared in a rather famous hungarian financial blog and it posed some interesting questions. It would be really good if the intelligent people of reddit would start a debate on these topics. There is a big learning opportunity here. I personally disagree with many of the points made in the post while I agree with some of them.*

*I think that it is important to listen to the negative opinions because we can grow from them and we can either strengthen our opinions by disproving the counter-arguments of others or we can formulate and fine-tune our opinions by accepting partial truths from the opposing opinion. (Maybe we can even change our opinions alltogether in some cases) I post this in the hopes of having an intelligent conversation about the topic and it would be a bit sad if this would get downvoted because then the conversation wouldn’t be able to unfold.*

*I say let's examine the other side, let's look at their arguments, let's try to understand them and let’s try to learn from them so that we may become smarter, better, and more well informed.*

*Also this can be a very good test if you think about investing in Bitcoin. If this discourages you then your fundamental knowledge of cryptocurrencies or Bitcoin may not be satisfactory yet or you may be thinking about investing with money what you cannot afford to loose*

*So without further to do here is the actual blog post translated from kiszamolo.hu.*

*RTT314*

I am writing about Bitcoin. I didn’t want to at all but since everybody is talking about it I had to. 

*Translator's note: There was a previous blog post about Bitcoin which got a massive amount of feedback in the hungarian community.*

The general feedback I received about my previous post on Bitcoin wonderfully resembled the the feedback I got when I wrote about Kairos, Emgoldex, Quaestor and Sitetalk. *(these were all scams in their times)*

In case you don’t have time to read the comments on my previous post I’ll summarize them for you. Its quite simple because people basically write the same thing all over again (Bitcoin or Emgoldex it doesn’t matter.) The comment categories are as follows:



- You’re stupid.
- You have no idea about the topic.
- You’re wrong.
- You’re an arrogant jealous prick, who wants to screw up people’s chance of getting rich.
- You have my respect all the time, but with this opportunity you missed the point big time.
- This is different, this is a new technology, this will work for sure. This is a huge innovation, this is something people never heard before, this technology is on the verge of exploding into the mass-media. (Oh how many times have I heard this when it came to similar topics)

It’s a good idea to look at those people who wrote these comments a few years back. The people of Kairos who came here (to his blog) taunting and showing off their earnings with Kairos. And then all of a sudden it became apparent that it was just another scam and they lost all the money in a heartbeat.

What did I cover in the previous blog post on Bitcoin?

I wrote, that you don’t know anything about Bitcoin, that you don’t know who is behind it or whether there is someone behind it or not. What gives actually Bitcoin’s value? How do we know that its better than the other cryptocurrencies? How do we know if one BTC is expensive for 1000 dollars or cheap? For a long time people bought it for 1 dollar, then for a long time for 100, then 1000 and now 16 thousand. Which price is the realistic one? Or none of it is realistic and its still cheap? How can I find it out?

I have basically nothing at all to which I could compare its price. Just like in the dotcom bubble when it came to evaluating the .com companies. The normal method of evaluation didn’t work when it came to these companies because everybody wanted to think, that these companies can conquer the whole world. And because of that basically no price was too expensive for a share. And then it became apparent, that in fact even a single dollar was too much for 95% of them.

**Just because something is revolutionary and new it doesn’t mean that it has value too. Especially when anybody can copy it freely.** This happened with the .com companies too. Everybody learned fast, that just because they are innovative and revolutionary they can’t make a profit and most of them didn’t even worth a penny.

And the .com companies were 100 times easier to evaluate than Bitcoin. At least they had expenses, profits, employees, products and patents. You could at least calculate with something.

Why is Bitcoin considered money? Currently it has none of the properties of money - you can’t pay with it everywhere, it’s exchange rate is not stable at all and because of that it is not suitable for accumulating wealth in it (just in the past 12 hours the price of one BTC was between $16.123 and $17.023 and today is one of the calmer days.)

Anybody can invent a newer Bitcoin and people do so too. There’s almost ten times more cryptocurrencies today than normal currencies in the world and almost every day a new one gets listed. **This is because anybody can make a cryptocurrency.** You don’t have to have a whole country behind it with its total assets, government, and financial traffic. If you have good marketing you will be a millionaire from a new cryptocurrency. Currently there are 1324 cryptocurrencies and there is almost no day when no new ones are added. On the contrary there is only 180 types of traditional currencies in the world. 

I also mentioned, that governments can limit the use of cryptocurrencies any time by illegalizing the exchange of cryptocurrencies to real money. And if that happens all cryptocurrencies will be worthless in a blink of an eye.

I don’t want to get into new ideological debates. I just want to place Bitcoin amongst all the hype into the world’s financial traffic. Where does Bitcoin stand compared to the current world’s financial traffic and does it look like a bubble? Will it really change the world’s financial system and will it really change the old technologies?

Bitcoin’s total market cap was 15,49 billion dollars on 2017 January the 1st and what’s at least as important is that the daily traffic volume was 92 million dollars.

https://imgur.com/a/kI0Ru

Bitcoin’s current market cap (17 thousand dollars) is 289 billion dollars and the daily traffic volume is 12.135 million dollars so the daily traffic grew 131-fold since January the 1st. 

One of the world’s biggest bank - the Bank of America’s - market cap is also 300 billion dollars and that is accompanied by 2,228 billion dollars worth of assets which gives one of the basis of the actual evaluation. Bitcoin has zero assets. Bank of America every four months (!!!) profits 22,3 billion dollars and one fifth of this is net profit. The profit of Bitcoin is zero and the net profit of Bitcoin is also zero.

Europe’s 16th biggest economy, Finland has a yearly GDP of 236 billion dollars.

**If Bitcoin’s market cap doubles again, it’s market cap will be equal to Hungary’s, Ukraine’s, Slovakia’s, Luxemburg’s, Croatia’s, Bulgaria’s and Latvia’s GDP all together.** Or at least on paper. (Of course the actual BTC's market cap and the GDP is very different, but i guess you can still feel the nonsense in this)

People make 337 thousand daily transactions with Bitcoin.

**Just Visa alone makes 468 million transactions per day** and this is just a tiny slice from the total world’s transactions.

The SWIFT system which is used by banks to make international transfers even 12 years ago made 5 thousand billion dollars worth of traffic. Daily.(!) The similiar Fedwire payment system which works in the USA had a daily traffic of 2,1 thousand billion dollars, the CHIPS had 1,4 thousand billion dollars. And these numbers are 12 years old so you can easily double them to get to the present numbers. **And this data is only of three clearing houses out of a dozen!** All the national clearing houses in total can have multiple hundred times more traffic than these ones. 

Even if we would like to use Bitcoin for just one tenth of the traffic of Visa we would soon have to store a few gigabytes then terabytes of data for each Bitcoin. The whole electricity generation and bandwidth of the world wouldn’t be enough if we would want to manage and transmit this much data constantly. (Even now the Bitcoin network uses more power than Bulgaria. The investors who mine Bitcoin spend money mostly on video cards and electricity. The biggest benefitors of Bitcoin are the chinese electricity providers and the video card companies. Even a whole bank system doesn’t use this much electricity and they execute multiple hundred thousand times more transactions than the Bitcoin’s network.)

The technology is unsuitable for microtransactions. There are cryptocurrencies which are suitable for this but what will happen with you investment in Bitcoin when everybody starts to use one of these currencies?

**The future of the blockchain technology is completely different from the future price of Bitcoin which currently is just one out of 1324 cryptocurrencies and for which you paid a bunch of money.** Somehow the people who kick back and leave their future on the price of Bitcoin don’t want to understand this.

Just so you understand: I don’t argue whether or not blockchain technology (which is used by Bitcoin too) will be used in the future financial system. I argue whether or not one Bitcoin values 17 thousand dollars or even one dollar as a matter of fact. 

**Do you think there will be a single bank which will choose exactly Bitcoin when it wants to switch to this new technology when Bitcoin is a completely unsuitable candidate? Or do you think that the bank will choose another cryptocurrency?** Won’t the bank simply make its own one?

The total value of all the dollar bills in circulation is 1,59 trillion dollars or 1590 billion dollars. If we look at the M3 (unbounded money in bank accounts, bills etc.) instead of only the bills we get 11 trillion dollars. But even this is only a tiny bit compared to the total assets in the american economy which is 220 trillion dollars.  

The daily size of the forex market is (!) 5.100.000.000.000 dollars.

So think again when you see numbers which suggest that Bitcoin is the future. I wrote these numbers just so you can get a sense of the big Bitcoin which is about to knock down the world’s banking system. Just so you can understand the big Bitcoin’s place in the financial food chain.

I’d also like to talk about a common misconception. Many people think that the value of Bitcoin comes from the fact that it’s very expensive to maintain. The mining is expensive. **This is called an expense and it has no relation to value whatsoever.** Things don’t represent value because they are costly to maintain. This is exactly the opposite of value. The more expensive is something to maintain the less valuable it is. Companies which have small costs value more than companies which have big costs with the same profits.

There’s an old trick in the stocks market called pooling. A few scammers organize into a pool, they choose a smaller stock and they start to trade amongst each other with higher and higher prices. They just have to be careful not to catch attention. They have to increase the price gradually and slowly and the pool has to be big enough in order to stay undetected. 

When the whole world goes crazy because of the huge gains on the pooled stock and when everybody wants to be a part of the miracle the pool quietly sell the whole stack of stocks and disappear. 

The “investors” which are driven by greed don’t even care about the fact that the evaluation of the stock flied far above the actual value of the stock. How much simpler is this whole move when the given thing doesn’t even have a quantifiable value to which you can compare it to? Bitcoin is exactly like this.

I wonder how are Bitcoins divided amongst the wallets? Could you drive up its value by getting into pools? You can’t drive up its value because it doesn’t even have any inherent value. The value of Bitcoin only comes from the people who are willing to pay for it. Bitcoin only has a price because people want to look at it as money even if it cannot function as money.

**The american dollar will have value until the United States exists** and its government collects taxes in dollars from the world’s biggest economy and it pays its payouts in dollars. And if someone doesn’t want to pay the requested taxes in dollars the government has the power to imprison the person. 

The expression of total financial ignorance is when the believers of Bitcoin state that the real currencies are also based on nothing. The real currencies are just paper too without any value. 
**Every real currency is backed by real value:** the given country’s economy, assets, government, tax system give real value to the real currency. No cryptocurrency can present anything like this ever because cryptocurrencies are made out of thin air.

Real currencies can function exactly because of this: because they have value too not just a price. This is why they can be a store of value, this is why they can be accepted in trade. Because tomorrow they will be worth just as much as today. They’re not just empty ping pong balls which are moved based on the needs and wants of the buyer. Potentially 10-20% per day. 

(Just for the sake of the smartpants: of course after world wars a real currency can lose value too just like how the syrian fiat lost value too when the value was essentially bombed out of it. The country’s economy collapsed and half of the taxpayers died or fled out of the country. But even this shows exactly the fact, that the price of the currency changes if the inherent value changes. And also the the price of the safety fiats (swiss franc) can be pumped up if investors are panicking. But we only know that their price is high compared to what their value is because it has a value.)

Just because I invent the Reddit coin and create a lot but finite real physical coins it won’t be a currency which has value. Not even if the coins are unfalsifiable. Not even if there will be people who are willing to pay real money for my coins. Not even if other people realize that they can make coins just like me any time (that’s why there are already 1324 types of cryptocurrencies on the market) It won’t be real money even if following the current trend I create this Reddit coin as a cryptocurrency. Money doesn’t become money because I say its money. Neither does it become money because other people believe its money.

But let's take a look at the bitcoin wallets amongst the investors:

https://imgur.com/a/WN163

So basically **97,2% of the wallets doesn’t even own a single bitcoin! And 55,5% of the wallets doesn’t even contain 0,001 bitcoin!**

Of course a wallet is not necessarily a person but its apparent that there are many small fish in the sea of Bitcoin. It's good to know this when you read all the comments from the people who try to defend Bitcoin no matter what. Most of them don’t even own 700 bucks worth of bitcoin but they will become rich for life from this investment. 

0,01% of the investors - 1.677 people own nearly 40% of the total bitcoins available. (Or it may be that these 1.677 wallets are owned by one person or twenty. We can’t even know that) but even 85% of the total bitcoins is in less than 1% of the wallets. In stocks lingo this is called a low free float. 

These people are the ones who manipulate the prices however they want it to. But of course they don’t want it to because why would they want such a thing? The prices are rising just because Bitcoin is the future.

If Bitcoin wouldn’t be the Holy Bitcoin it would be simply called a Ponzi scheme. How does a Ponzi scheme look exactly? They build up a system which is new, which is alluring and about which people can believe that it’s the future. From this you’ll become rich. If you pay enough money now then you’ll be the part of the money rain too. Until more people are buying in than out the Ponzi scheme works great. Nobody realizes that there’s nothing behind it. Just the money of the depositors gives it value. 

Bitcoin is genial because it never even stated that there is some sort of value behind it so you can’t even expect it in the first place. Until more people want to put money in than out the price of Bitcoin will rise. I’ll say this again Bitcoin is alive because people want to treat it as money. “This is the money of the future, you are lagging behind if you don’t understand this. Why do you try to find the inherent value of it and the evaluation of it? You are an old prick who has no clue. This is a new world. Deal with it. You have to just believe this and don’t ask any questions.” Do you know how many times have I heard this from the faithful “investors” of the kairos, sidetalk, emgoldex ponzi schemes?

A lot of people wait a lot from the december 18th stock appearance of Bitcoin but it can bring more bad than good. If the big speculators start to go hard on it they can double the price or drag it down to 0 within days. It's rather easy for them because there is no value behind it. Just a price tag. If the British Pound was attacked what do you think what will they do with Bitcoin? Here there is no national bank which will change the interest rates or pull other tricks from its sleeves to defend its own currency from falling or from a rising. Also here the investors won’t be able to say that a bitcoin is definitely worth more than this or not because the whole english economy is not behind it so they don’t have a guide for its inherent value. If Bitcoin was volatile so far you can prepare yourself for even bigger storms. 

You think whatever you want and you pay money for whatever you want. You know what? Even I’m telling you that knowing the madness, dumbness, and greed of people it is not unimaginable that Bitcoin will rise to 150 thousand dollars within the next year. But not because its value is that much but because there are too many greedy people who feel like they were left out of a great opportunity but it's not too late to jump in.

But also don’t be amazed if its price will be 1 dollar again.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,(DE/US) Filing backed taxes from 2013,"Hi All,

First off, appreciate you taking your time to read this.

Finally the time has come to file my taxes in the US back dating back to 2013. Right now I'm looking to take down 2013 and 2014 before the new year hits, since these were my most ""complicated"" years due to a 1099-MISC that comes into play. 

I also left the US in 2013 for Germany in late fall, therefore factoring foreign earned income also into the picture.

At the time, I was a W2 employee, and also the same case in Germany.

All of my taxes in DE are paid and are up to date.

Right now I'm home for the holidays and just stopped by to see a CPA, and basically he had no experience with foreign earned income, and wasn't too helpful in suggestions around potential write offs having to do with my 1099-MISC and roughly 15k in earnings from 2013.

I need some help on a few questions, and I'm hoping the community can help.

1. Is it still possible for me to personally file my state and federal taxes for 2013 &amp; 2014 using TurboTax? Can I print out what I prepare in TurboTax then just mail it via US Post then receive my finalized amount due by the IRS, and timing? Will I be receiving any penalty for late filing? Nothing was sent to me as of yet.

2. Will I still need to file a state return if I live outside of my state of birth/previous residence since late 2013? (PA)

3. If I owe money (appears I'll owe roughly 25% on the 1099-MISC earnings as it's taxes as freelance income) would it be possible for me to workout a repayment plan with the IRS myself, or do I need a CPA to help with that?

4. In 2013/2014 I had business expenses related to my 1099-MISC, such as a computer, software and other miscellaneous purposes. Does anyone have a solid list of item that can be considered to be written off when they related to a 1099-MISC? If I no longer have a receipt, will a bank statement print off due as well?

Essentially, this is my biggest issue with 2013/2014 -- getting slapped with a large sum of money due since it appears I'll be taxed as a freelance employee due to the 1099-MISC. I'm trying to figure out how to lower my taxable income - if there's any other suggestions, I'm open.

---

5. 2015/2016 are a lot less complicated - can I jump ahead and file those now, as well as 2017 without having to worry if I finish these before finalizing 2013/2014?

Again - I greatly appreciate any feedback, and I'm looking forward to finally tackling this and never getting behind again.",finance

personalfinance,Is buying a house right now viable?,"So this is going to be a long post, but any help is appreciated. I'm currently living in a two room (total rooms not bedrooms) tiny apartment with my girlfriend and my dog and we have honestly just outgrown it. The housing market is really cheap in northern Alabama right now, and I would rather invest sooner than rather if possible and would like to only move once soon rather than multiple times.

Current Income Situation:

I currently live in northern Alabama and recently was extended a job offer. I will be making $55,000 (pre-taxes) with my final year of school covered by my job next year (2018). Once I graduate in December 2018 I will be getting a raise up to $90,000 (pre-taxes) for the year of 2019. I also plan on investing a 100% matched 5% of the $90,000 into retirement post-raise, but likely only 1% pre-raise. I currently live with my girlfriend who is making around $30,000 (pre-taxes) a year and will probably hover around that amount for the near-future.

Current Costs/Debts:

As a household as of this year we were only making a combined $55,000 (30,000$ of this is pre-tax, the other $25,000 is post-tax). With everything (insurances, rent, entertainment, car payments etc.) we as a househould were spending about 2500$ a month. This does not include health insurance as we are still on our parents. It should increase by about 200$ a month next year as we both move onto our own plans. We were living fairly light, but also were comfortable with enough money in emergency savings to cover a one time large expense such as a car repair. Both of our cars are completely paid off and are getting a bit older, but are still running fine and are &lt;75000k miles. We both have decent credit scores (hers is in 720's, mine is 784). Our only signifcant debt is student loan debt. She only has $4,000 at 4.5%. But I have a lot more (yay grad school). It is split up into two categories. $15,000 high interest private loan (~7%) and $60,000 low interest government loan (~4%). An important caveat however is I'm going to be a federal employee that qualifies for public service loan forgivness that will forgive up to $56,000 of my public loans after 10 years of service. I'm not planning on ever leaving this job since its my dream job so I'm going to gamble and pay as little as that loan off so I get the maximum possible writeoff. I've been paying interest on my private loans and plan on paying them down extremely aggressively after I get my post-graduation raise in 2019. 

The House Details:

We are looking at a few houses in the $120k to $150k range. With the realtors and consultants I have spoke with I will need to put down about 10% down payment on a 30-year fixed rate loan to see only a $100-$150 increase in monthly housing costs (including home insurance, property taxes, and mortage payment) versus my current rent. (Current rent+renters insurance is $780 /month, I was quoted around $900/month for loan payment, house insurance, and property tax with a 10% down payment). We almost have that 10% completely saved up and should easily have it by July 2018 which is when our current lease agreement ends. The only other thought is furnishing it. My brother has expressed interest in investing in the home with us as we plan for this to be a starter home that we sell within 5-10 years. They said they would either help with the downpayment or the furnishing. Right now the plan is to have them help furnish and give them straight up equity for however much that costs. I.E. we spend $15,000 furnishing on a $150,000 home I'd give them 10% equity in the home. (I think this is fair, but these discussions and research into this is still very preliminary). So I would give them 10% of whatever we sell for. I know there is also a bunch of first time homeowner programs in Alabama that I still need to look into as well that may bring some initial costs down a bit.

I think I covered all my bases here. I know that waiting for my raise in 2019 would be the most ideal situation, but I need out of this apartment and would love to avoid moving twice in 1 year at all costs. Thank you all for any help.",finance

I live in a studio. Rent is cheap, 1100. I was diagnosed with depression and ptsd, and I mentally couldn't work. So, I started trying to get back on my feet this year and in the meantime, racking up my credit cards and living off savings. I recently got back in the game and I want to pay off my debt.

I have 45k debt. 6k in student loans, one card that is 16k that has been closed recently, and a bunch of other cards that are on the verge of closing which amounts around 2-4k each. and a few small cards. My goal is to buy a condo in 2-4 years and I want to have my credit back up again. right now it is 518, mainly of the 75% utilization. I was told to settle with the cards and just pay it off. I also work full time and started getting side jobs, so I am not even sure if I should just let a settlement/consolidation agency do it for me or to try to do it on my own. i called national debt relief and they said they can settle for 50% for most of the cards. but i pay them 6.6% for each card they settle with. I called the cards myself and they offered payment plans but my cards will close.

Also, most of my cards have really high interest rates- most around 25%. honestly, if i could keep my cards open and lower my interest rates, that would be awesome. I really dont know how to do this stuff and not sure if i should take the time to do it myself. should I focus on my side jobs and just let the consolidation agency handle it.

She has no experience with financial matters and have never had an allowance.  So I thought that it's time to do something about it and give her more financial responsibilities and tools.

1. I made her an Authorized User on our three main credit cards.  Total credit limit around $40.000.  We are charging about $7,500 to the cards each month, but all balances are paid in full every month.  She's not actually getting her own cards as her name will only be on the cards for ""show"" to help build credit.  I'm not sure how effective ""Authorized User"" is to build credit nowadays.

I'm the Joint Owner on both accounts.  I put $250 into the checking account to initially fund it. I put $250 into savings and will be adding $100 more each month until she goes to college.  My hope is to give her a few thousands in savings to help her with expenses at college.

3.  I am also giving her a prepaid [Navy Federal Visa Buxx](https://www.visaprepaidprocessing.com/NavyFederal/VisaBuxx/Pages/Home.aspx) debit card.  It has $250 in initial funding plus $100 a month in allowance.  The allowance will be paid twice a month ($50 on 1st and 15th) to simulate a paycheck.

The goal is to give her experience with personal finance, a decent credit when she becomes an adult, and some savings for when she goes to college.  I have transferred my Post-9/11 GI Bill to her so college tuition is paid for and she will get a monthly stipend (about $1000) to pay for room and board.

personalfinance,"About to receive $20k, suggestions on what to do with it?","Hey guys,

 Soon I will be coming into $20,000 and I am looking for some advice on where to put it. 

I think the most important pieces of information are: i current live pretty below my means (ability to save), I have been saving towards and looking to buy a house in the next year or so (depending on inventory), and i have approx $50k in student loan debt (zero other debt). Obviously taxes on all accounts is a big factor here as well!

So where should I put this money?

I already have a good year of current expenses saved in an emergency fund and have some medium risk investments. I own my car outright and i current rent my apartment. 

I could put it right into my savings account that for the next 6 months has .6% interest rate with the rate adjusting after 6 months, I could open an Ally high interest savings account and leave it there, or I could just leave it in my interest checking account .1%. 

I would like to have as much money liquid for a potential downpayment, but I am not shy from any suggestions!",finance
personalfinance,How can I find an apartment when I just started a new part time at FedEx and I have been working with my father for the past year under the table?,"Hey Reddit I’ve been like living with my sister since she bought a house in July of 2016. At the time I was working as a Certified Pharmacy Technician making about 18/hr so paying half of her new mortgage of 1500/ month so $750 was not that hard. Plus my wife had came to stay with me and was helping with half so I only had to come up with $375 and the utilities were being paid by my father and I also threw in like 200 for groceries a month. 

I had lost my job in November 2016 and I’ve been working with for my father since around the beginning of this year since I was living off my savings and I was running out of money for my room. My dad offered to let me work for him in his so called painting business in which it really isn’t a business just him getting jobs by other people referring him from other jobs he has done.He paid me under the table and it was always just enough to just cover my bills and I’m currently trying to get my recertification but I just started a part time not night job at FedEx making 13/hr but I just got it to make extra money for the holidays and finally start having money of my own not as a main source of income. Well my father just decided to tell me in the past week things are slowing down in the winter for painters which I’m suspecting there’s something more to it I think he is just trying to stop being responsible if I have the $750 on the first for rent and I know I won’t be able to with just my part time job since they take out taxes and my child support. 

Sorry I’m not trying to rant I guess it’s just coming out like this but I guess what I’m asking is I want to find somewhere new to live. I do own a work truck that isn’t the most reliable it’s slowly falling apart and I don’t have the best credit score which is between 540 to 560. I looked up a couple rooms on Craigslist today and one sounded like I woke him up and another said he would call me back because he was in a meeting but never did. I live in Phoenix Arizona and I looked up some apartments but think it’s going to be hard since I can’t really prove my employment for the past year and the one I just started at FedEx probably won’t put me in the range to show I would actually afford the place by myself. So what I would like to know if and how do I find affordable housing because I don’t want to go back to being homeless. I had wasted my twenties in a drugs, drinking, depression binge neglecting every aspect of my life and after my last od in which I almost died and was put on a ventilator and woke up 3 days later and my then gf passed away with her own od exactly a month later I decided to get my life together and that’s when I moved in with my sister and now I’m getting my recertification and I also plan on still working my nigh shift FedEx job but until then I need to find a new place to live like now because the first will be here in a couple weeks. Does anyone know of any low income hosing or rentals in Phoenix Arizona or know a way I could get a place when I really don’t have anyone to help me or co-sign. I mean my wife hinted that she would consider moving back in with me but only if we could find a place by her mothers house since she watches our daughters when we work. 

I really want to keep painting with my father but have came to find how hard it is to work for and with family. He was constantly under paying me since he paid me daily but I was always working more than he would pay me for. I have some ideas of my own to help him expand and legitimize his business business but he seems to dismiss any of my suggestions and I am really considering maybe starting a company of my own but like everything else in life it takes money. So I am just starting to feel lost and trapped at the same time if that makes any sense and I feel like I gotten really far by turning my life around and just don’t want to end up staying on the the streets again injecting that poison into my arms again but I know if I end up homeless again I will probably relapse because I still am taking my addiction medication that I’ve been trying to taper down since I started it last year in April but I have to pay 160 a month for copays and medication which is way better since I finally got approved for this free Medicare I applied for at my local des office. 

I don’t know if this is even the right community I should even post this and if anyone knows of any other communities I probably would get better answers at please point me in the right direction but thanks for any and all advice in advance. And please I really don’t really need nor want to hear any criticism or lectures trust me I’m my own worst critic which probably contributed largely to a lot of my mistakes I just turned 30 and I feel like I’ve spent the last decade digging myself in to a hole in my life neglecting not only my financial life and responsibilities but my marriage and family and friends at least the few ones I realized who were really my friends and wasn’t just around for drugs. So please somebody help me and thanks again",finance

personalfinance,Managing debt and now need a new car.,"Hello. Thank you for your advice.

I have been attempting the snowball method to pay down my debt, but recently was in a car accident and my car was totaled (I owned it, no loan). Need another car, but need some advice on how to handle.


First, my debt:

*Mortgage: Balance is $117,255

*Car loan on husband's car: $3,800.

*Chase Slate card: $4,212. (0% interest through July 2018)

*Chase Southwest Rewards card: $13,060. (16.99% interest rate) We have abused this one and let it get out of hand.

*Capital One Quicksilver card: I just paid this off ($360), have it open cause it gives me 50% discount on my Spotify membership. Will pay that every month.



Household Monthly Budget (Me, husband and 5yr old)

*Mortgage:$820

*Car payment: $158

*Energy bill: $120

*Water: $28

*Car Insurance: Was $168, now will be $93 cause of the totaled car

*Cell phone: $82 (my employer provides a $50 stipend towards this)

*House phone: $20 (we have horrible cell service at home)

*Internet: $53.00

*Slate card minimum payment: $44 ( I pay $50)

*Chase card minimum payment: $150

*Quicksilver card (Spotify family membership): $7

*Netflix $12

*Kid's preschool tuition: $31

*Food: $640 (we eat out about 2-3 times a month)

*Gas: $160 (this was based on two cars)

*Spend: $200 (this is for any spend that is not categorized above. It includes fun money, babysitter, gifts, movie rental, car or house maintenance, etc.)


Income: $60,400/year

I just completed my 4-yr degree and was given a promotion so my income just increased from $55k/yr hourly pay to $60400/yr salary. I was using a take home pay of $1630/biweekly as our income to the budget. I have only had one paycheck on the new income, and that had tuition reimbursement on it so Im not sure yet what my new take home is. 

My husband is a stay-at-home dad who occasionally does commission paintings for gaming miniatures that will bring in $40-$60 a month. 


We do have a ""fight club"" account. Its our savings that we pretend doesn't exist. It has just over $1000 in it and I just increased my paycheck contributions from $35 a paycheck to $50 a paycheck. 

I do not yet have a settlement offer from my insurance on the totaled car. I am thinking if I can, I would take some of that settlement and pay off my husband's car. I do have to replace my car but I plan to buy used and try to keep my payment close to the one I am currently making, so $10-$14k loan. I will also have medical, pain and inconvenience payouts for my injuries, thought I expect this to be minimal. 

I was putting close to $300 a month in extra cash toward credit card debt with the snowball method. My plan, before the accident was to start putting that money toward the car loan since its my next lowest balance. Then tackle the Slate card, then the Southwest card. However, the interest from the Southwest card is really getting big. I know I need to cut that card up. It is too easy for us to use it, justifying the travel rewards we get from it. 

Should I transfer the southwest balance onto a 0 interest card and close it? Or stick to my plan?

I appreciate any suggestions. Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,A potential employer wants to hire me as an IC and pay me less than my last job on a W-2 like it's a favor for me (?),"When I answered what my last employer paid me ($17/hr - NO health benefits, etc.), he responded well we file as Independent contractors here so it won't be as much since you take home all your pay.

My response was that it seemed like it'd be a tax burden for me, to which he replied there are deductions I can use now that even it out. 

I was asking for $20/hr since I have more experience now and this job is more demanding. He wanted to negotiate down stating the above as his reasoning and that he doesn't pay the others that much so it wouldn't be fair.  

I did research on this sub about filing as an IC which confirmed my initial concern.  Is it possible to cover the 7.65% that I'm now paying instead of my employer with the amount of money I could get back with tax write-offs?  On average how much more, in the long run, am I being 'stiffed'? -- I saw someone say 8% more than a W-2 employee.

I'm meeting with him again in a couple days to discuss payment.  If this is going to be a large disadvantage for me as an IC, how can I politely explain that the amount I'm asking for is very reasonable and he was incorrect to assume that this is beneficial for me? He said he didn't want to lose me over money.",finance

Im planning on going ~25% across 4 different coins and rebalance it for them once a month or when something pumps hard.

My plan right now is 25% HST (riskyish but massive upside) 25% Ethereum 20% OMG 30% XRB. What does everyone think? I feel Ethereum + OMG are very safe choices with OMG having room to grow still, HST is at 16 mill marketcap and nothing but positive news, XRB is amazing and will go up massively, If you disagree with that one i'm sorry for you.

personalfinance,Critique My Money and Help Me With Self-Employment Retirement? (24 Years Old),"Hi, all! I'm considering what to do as far as my retirement, and I'm looking for some guidance. Here is the important info (let me know if you need more):

1. I'm self-employed running my own editorial business. That means my income isn't steady, but I've increased it by about 50% (at least) each year. I'm currently grossing about 55k. I pay federal taxes monthly and state taxes quarterly. I buy my own health insurance for $160 a month.

2. I have $52,408 in Vanguard funds. My portfolio reports I have seen a return rate of 14.4%.

3. I have 6k in a Roth IRA.

4. I have 17k in student loan debts. I anticipate being able to put at least 9k toward it by April. As soon as my student loan payment is gone, I will divert that money into the Roth to max it yearly. I have no other debts.

5. I do not currently pay into pension.

6. Grad school is paid off, and I will be finishing with a Master's in Forensic Linguistics in April.

7. I am unsure how the new tax code will affect me as a business (I am currently a sole proprietorship, but maybe I should change?). I am considering further expanding and hiring one employee by Dec. 2018, but again, I'm not sure yet how that will work, so it's still tentative.

8. I don't anticipate fully stopping my work in retirement. I enjoy my job and find it easy and generally relaxing without being time-consuming. I could (and have) earn 30k working part-time as an editor. I get antsy if I'm not doing things.

How do things look for me? Getting my student loan paid off in full next year is my primary concern, followed by expanding the business further. My SO just purchased a house, and I pay the utilities and groceries, but he pays the mortgage (which falls under the 28% rule for house payment vs. income; it's an appropriate payment for HIS income, not ours together, so we're living quite affordably here -- it's 24% of his monthly net), so I don't technically have housing costs. He and I don't have joint accounts.

Any critiques or advice welcome, especially about the whole pension thing. I'm not sure as far as self-employment what my best options are for a secure retirement. Thanks! If you need more info, just ask and I'll get it for you.",finance

I didn't want to really face the reality of the debt I'm in so I shed away from posting but I could really use any and all help. A little background: the past few years I was in college and worked a part-time job making $200 per week. With that money I paid my rent and bought food, but I continued to live well beyond my means and opened up a few credit cards which I pretty much maxed out. Currently, I just graduated and am now making about $2300.00 biweekly take home.  I now have to face the reality of poor decisions and pay these loans back however I'm confused where to even begin.

$Roughly 100.00 in utilities a month 

$35 a week in transportation fees

$80.00 month for the gym (considering canceling for a cheaper option and because I hardly go)

Cared Credit Card #2: $437.00 - Will begin collecting 27% on February 18th, 2018

Best Buy Credit Card: $2762.00 - $856.00 will begin to have 26% interest charged on 

April 10th 2018, the rest will begin to collect interest on June 9th, 2018. 

Chase CC#1: 4720.00 currently collecting 1.3% interest per month 

Chase CC#2: 1074.00 currently collecting 1.2% interest each month

personalfinance,"Putting less than 20 down on a house, even though I have the money?","I am looking at a house that costs $325000. I am considering whether to put down 20% or just 5%. I have enough money for the 20% down, but I think it makes more financial sense to just put down 5% and invest the other 15% in something else. Here is my math:

If I put 20% down:
Down payment = 65000, mortgage = 260000
Total interest paid at 4% interest rate = 186861
Total cost of home = 325000+186861 = 511861

If I put 5% down:
Down payment = 16250, mortgage = 308750
PMI = 160 per month * 92 months to build 20% equity = 14720
Total cost of home = 325000+221897+14720 = 561617

The house costs $49756 more if I put less than 20% down, but since I put only $16250 down in scenario #2, I have extra cash ($48750) on hand which I can invest elsewhere, and have it grow at 8% rather than the 4% appreciation if I had invested in the house itself.

Why doesn't scenario #2 make more sense in my case?",finance

TLDR: for my debt situation, I’m down to $18,000 for student loans and I have about $24,000 in credit card debt at various interest rates.  Never mind the fact that all that money should have gone to my credit cards.  

For my living situation and potential new job, I’m going month to month on my rent right now so that when I do find a job I can pick up and move closer to where I’ll be working.  I believe I found a job (waiting on final word) and my idea is sell my car when I move; a car that was only purchased in order to be able to effectively do my current job working as a B2B sales rep.  The area I’d be moving to would be great for not having a car as I would be on the same block as a metro station and I would be going into an apartment that is about the same price as my current place.

Question is, what is your advice on what to do with the $11,000 she gave me?",finance

personalfinance,Bank CD Advice (19 y/o),"Hi personalfinance, I'm currently a 19 year old college student and when my father passed away (2008) he left me and my siblings a CD account. The interest rate on it is .15% and there is a good amount of money in the account(~75k). The problem is, I feel as though the account does not generate enough interest as it could if I were to invest in say stocks/ETF's/commodities. The problem is, the CD doesn't mature until 2022. I'm not sure what my penalty would be, but I still feel like it would be worth it to withdraw the money and invest and diversify it into 5-10% return, although I don't have much experience in investments.

In the next few years I would like to have a new wheelchair (I’ve had this one that isn’t fitted to me for over 7 years), and an accessible van so I can drive myself places.

personalfinance,How to invest while in a fairly good situation (Scandinavia),"Hi all,

Looking for advice on how to best invest. Tried the wiki but found that it doesn't really apply to my situation perfectly so hoping for some personalised advice (partly due to being based in Scandinavia). Thanks in advance.

In short, I have around 35,000 $ available right now and am gradually saving up more. These funds are right now not really doing much except sitting in my bank account, and I'd like to invest them. I am limited partly by insider trading rules implying that I cannot freely trade many large stocks in my home country. I believe I have paid off and/or saved for all major expenses that I should not need particular expenses and might be fine keeping a bottom cash level (rainy day fund) of something like 5,000 $ which would cover around 3-4 months living expenses. I am already investing into a pension fund (I suppose what is called a 401 in American terms) with around 14% of my salary every month, which according to my pension advisor will allow me to retire around 67 which seems fine (and that is disregarding these money and what I do with them).

How would you invest these money if you were me?

Further details of my situation:

- I don't foresee any large one-off expenses (wedding already held and paid for, we have our first child and is budgeted for)

- We already own an apartment which has been paid down (the high interest part), and we have debt of around 70% of the original purchase value. This remaining debt is paid off at an extremely low interest rate (&lt;0.5%) and so I don't think it makes sense to pay off more than necessary. The apartment has, according to my guesstimate of the real estate market also increased significantly in value, and the difference in debt vs. value is probably a surplus of almost 200,000 $ (though of course, real estate is a volatile market).

- There is no real threat of me losing my job and if I do, it seems I have plenty of other opportunities. Still, I think it is nicer if these funds are somehow available at relatively short notice so not too tied up.

- My salary is around 150,000 USD and can be expected to grow somewhat over the next years

- I have a not insignificant amount of money in cryptocurrency. Let's say around 15,000 USD. I plan on keeping these as a ""high risk, high reward"" investment and already earlier cashed out some, so I'd like to keep my current level.

- There is one exception to having paid off all high-interest debt: I have a car loan of around 30,000 $ with an interest rate of 4.4%. I feel like I can make a better return by making some fairly safe investment, but perhaps I’m being irrational and should just take this chance to pay down the car loan?

In general, I believe I have room to take some risk, such as not paying down the car loan and investing this instead. On the other hand, I’m unsure if this is a good time to enter the stock market, and not sure what else I could do with this money.

The long term goal is, I think, to buy a nice house somewhere in 2-3 years time, and in general make the most of this opportunity to provide financial stability for my family and the opportunity to give to friends and less fortunate parts of my family, when relevant. But the longer term strategy is probably more important (i.e. taking some risk which by buying stocks which will definitely be paying off in 5-10 years time but may not in 2-3 years time).",finance

personalfinance,"Issue with Chase Bank, they are incapable of completing and notarizing a form with info about my loan, form is necessary to keep tax credit","Sorry for the saga.

I bought a house in 2009 and qualified for a mortgage credit certificate (MCC), which  allows me to claim a significant tax credit ($47k by the end of the 30-year loan). My original loan was with Wintrust and was then bought by Chase. 

My interest rate was 5.125% and as rates dropped it starting making sense to refinance. I could keep the tax credit if I refinanced but could only claim as much of a credit as would have been allowed under the terms of my original loan. 

I would also have to submit some paperwork, including a notarized payoff form that Chase would have to fill out *after the refinancing was completed.* It is a very simple form, a pay-off certificate that states I previously had a loan there, the date I paid it off, and the amount i paid off. 

I was nervous about losing the credit if there was a hitch with this paperwork and went in person to a Chase branch *before my refinancing* to give them the form and ask if there would be an issue filling it out for me after I refinanced. 

The MCC program is not well known and the branch employee who assisted me was not familiar with it. He made a copy of the form and made some calls to the department that would handle such a request. I believe he faxed them the form and I was assured it should not be a problem to get this form completed.

I refinanced to a 15-year at 2.875% with another lender. After refinancing, I went back to the Chase branch and spoke to the same employee and formally requested that they complete and notarize the form and return it to me. He contacted the same department to get the ball rolling and they asked me to sign a third party consent form which did not make sense to me as I was asking them to mail me the form, not send it to anyone. 

The form is generated by the local Dept. of Planning and Development (DPD), as they administer the MCC program in my area so their name is listed at the top but it does not advise the lender to mail it to the DPD and the DPD address is not on the form, there is no address anywhere on the form. The instructions for the paperwork packet indicate it should all be sent in together. After pointing this out, Chase agreed I did not have to sign the third party consent form and that they would mail me the completed form. 

Instead of receiving the form back, I received a letter from Chase asking me to sign a consent form to release information to a third party, namely, the local DPD. Whatever. I decided to just go with it and contacted the person at DPD who handles this and she said Chase could send the form separately but to mail it to her attention. 

On Dec. 5th, I faxed Chase a very clear cover letter stating what I needed from them, a copy of the letter they sent me requesting I sign the consent form, my signed consent form, and yet another copy of the blank form I needed filled out. 

I called today, Dec. 19th, to check the status of this matter and was advised they cannot complete and notarize the form, only issue me a letter. I did not feel the person even understood what I really needed.

I asked to escalate the call and was passed to a person who stated they could not complete the form for ""legal and compliance reasons,"" only issue me a letter with the needed info. 

I asked him to look at the form and see it basically asks for the same info they are willing to put in a letter, it just needs to be notarized. He looked through the pages of my fax and said the only blank form in my fax was a consent form that i needed to sign. Frustration! 

I asked him to read the title of the form--which is *Pay-Off Certificate*-- and asked him how in the heck am I supposed to sign my own pay-off certificate? I asked him to read the first line of the form--""I, the undersigned, an authorized officer of ________(name of lender)--where it is very clear it is a form for the *lender* to complete. He still said they cannot fill out the form.

I advised him that, before doing the refinance, I had gone to a branch in person, given them the form and been assured that Chase could complete the form. Why did they agree to this and are now reneging? When they sent me the consent form to sign, wasn't that an indication that they would complete the form?

I did get very angry with him on the phone and told him if they cannot complete the form I will lose thousands of dollars that I would then sue to recoup from them. I asked to speak to his supervisor and was told she is not available and will call me back.

As a precaution, I submitted a request online for a payoff quote from Chase right before my refinancing date. By chance, the quote is dated the same day as my refinancing. I have e-mailed the person who handles this at Chicago DPD to see if that is acceptable. 

What else can I do? I am also up against the clock a little bit, the tax credit is on the chopping block under the Republican tax reform so this might be a moot point but I am hoping they will keep it or at least grandfather those who already have it. 

Because it is based on the interest I pay and I will pay much less interest with the 15-year, my tax credit won't be what it was before but it would still have been free money. Rates are up again so I don't regret refinancing but am annoyed that the precautionary steps I took to make sure I could keep the credit might turn out to be futile.

**tl,dr: Chase Bank cannot fill out and notarize a simple form I need to keep the tax credit I have.**

Update: DPD called me back, she said the MCC program survived tax reform efforts though bill is not yet signed by Pres. and she can try to work with me on whatever Chase is willing to issue, though she agreed it is nuts that a bank is refusing to issue a notarized document. Since she handles these refinances, I had asked her before refinancing if people found it hard to get their old lender to comply and she said no. So I'm going to send her my part of the paperwork and go in to Chase branch tomorrow in person to talk to that same employee, when I met with him he was very interested to learn about the MCC as he was in the market to buy and seemed to qualify himself. I gave him helpful links to information on it as there's not a lot of marketing of the program around here.",finance

investing,Roast my CEF purchase: Pimco High Income,"Curious if anybody here would like to poke holes in the thesis behind a move I made this afternoon. I put 7% of my portfolio in Pimco High Income (PHK), a closed-end fund of risky credit and long-duration bonds. I funded it out of cash. As of Tuesday afternoon, this CEF sports a 13% income-only distribution and has me feeling like I did a good. Prove me wrong.

Short version of thesis: an unusual combo of interest-rate worries, tax-reform fears, and heavy tax-loss harvesting by tax-sensitive retirees conspired to batter this normally very popular CEF. To me, the worst-case scenarios are either unlikely to pass or are already baked into the price. At 13%, assuming Pimco values its stingy record re: avoiding distribution cuts, I would gladly own this thing forever and don’t much care about potential price losses. Below I will bullet out the thesis on all three areas. 

1. Interest rate worries. This CEF is long maturity (34% in 20+ yr bonds/securities) and has 22% effective leverage, so there’s no doubt that rising rates would pack a punch. But a lot of this has to be priced in already. PHK traded as high as 51% above NAV in the last year. Today the premium is 9%. YTD price performance is a 6.6% loss, but the underlying portfolio performance is a 22% *gain.* 28 percentage point delta between assets and investor behavior strikes me as extreme. So some degree of interest-rate worry is already priced in.

2. Tax reform. Wealthy coastal retirees must factor hugely in ownership. If you’re expecting a tax hike, what should you do? You will try to get your books in order. You might even be panicking a bit. That leads to point 3:

3. Tax-loss harvesting. Mid-December is always a good time of year to go shopping for CEFs. That is because CEFs sell down seasonally; December is when retirees and income investors rebalance their portfolios for tax reasons. How many areas of the market even afford the possibility of harvesting losses? Not many. Since this CEF is down 6% this year, it is inordinately a target for tax-loss selling. 

At 13% distro, I don’t really care much what price performance brings in 2018-19, since I would gladly take 13% forever. 

What are my risks? There are several, but each strikes me as acceptable:

1. Sharp interest rate increase. If the 10-yr Treasury goes to 3%, I will feel it in this portfolio. But if that happens, it’s because investors are confident the economy is OK. So my risky credit will be fine and my distribution is intact. I might take price losses in the fund shares, but again, at 13%, I don’t really care, because I will take 13% forever and ever with this money. And I believe the fear of rate increases will prove to have a sharper bite than the reality. 

2. Credit crunch. I see a chance of a recession in 2018 and more likely in 2019, but only a chance. This strikes me as the single biggest risk — trouble for junk bonds resulting in defaults and distribution cuts. But hopefully by then I will have collected at least one dosage of my 13%.

3. Distribution cuts. Sub-point of #2. It would take carnage in the junk bond market, asset backed securities and probably a recession for Pimco to cut the distribution. They value their reputation. They don’t want to do that if they don’t have to.

4. Investor irrationality. This is always a risk in CEFs, whose share prices don’t track the underlying portfolio of assets. My hope is that a lot of irrationality is already baked into the premium deflating from 51% to 9% during a period of raging performance for the underlying assets.

5. Manager resignation/turnover/scandal. I can’t possibly predict this risk, which is present across a range of fund types. My only hope is that the loss of Bill Gross and subsequent litigation and situations like the ETF pricing calculation scandal have made Pimco particularly risk-averse here. So I don’t expect anything troubling.

That’s it. What did I fail to consider/would you have approached this differently?",finance
personalfinance,Pay for a class,"Hi all, I was wondering. Would it be stupid to pay for a 3-credit class for $500 using my credit card (that has no balance) and interest rate of 18%. I don’t use the card at all for anything except a minor purchase once a year.

personalfinance,Nominal or effective interest rate for student amortization table?,"I made an amortization table on Excel by following this [Youtube guide](https://youtu.be/vjqJq_gkV2U?t=36s).

What makes it more accurate? Is it more appropriate than using `APR/12`, which I've seen other guides use? 
 
In my failed attempt to find out more, I came across nominal vs. effective interest rates--is that what's going on here? When is using effective interest rate more desirable and when would nominal interest rates be used? Which one is preferable for making an amortization table if accuracy is a concern?

I am writing because I want to make sure I am going about all of this the right way. I am 22, female and living in CA. I didn’t listen to most people’s advice when it comes to credit and debt so here is where I stand. 

CAREER/INCOME: In mid-October I began a career in my field making a salaried $47k. My employer offers great benefits (health/dental/vision for $50/month) and I have started my 401k with them, they contribute a Safe Harbor match up to 4% of my contributions. I currently contribute 4% and would like to bump that to 10% in about six months, the balance is currently $500. I currently have $1200 in a savings account with my credit union/bank as well as my checking account which usually sits around $500 once I have paid my monthly bills and gone grocery shopping. I attempt to put $500 a month into my bank savings account split by $250 a paycheck. I recently had to wipe out my savings account which was at $2,000 prior for medical expenses. The $1200 was saved in the last two months.

DEBT: I have $10,000 left to pay on my current vehicle loan, the interest rate is 2.8%. My set monthly payment is $180 however I usually pay $200 just so I can pay off a little extra. I graduated college in May, leaving me with about $25,000 in student loan debt. My monthly payment is $164/month.

CREDIT CARDS: I have a score of 665 at the moment which isn’t great but I don’t think it’s awful. I’m utilizing about $13k of my available credit which is $27k. I have a plan to not use any of my cards for six months and pay them down to 30% utilization. Prior to financing my car in October of 2016 I had a score of 730-ish. I am hoping to see a tax return of about $3,000 in February/March and will pay it all to my credit cards since they have the highest amount of interest. 

I know I probably shouldn’t have gotten so many credit cards (I have ten, scary ugh.) and used them the way I did but for some reason it seemed like the best course of action to me while I was in college. I moved out when I was seventeen and had to figure stuff out and made some irresponsible decisions. 

My questions: Should I invest in an IRA or Roth IRA instead of my bank savings account? Would it be beneficial for me to save with a high-yielding savings account like Ally? My yearly review is in February and I am wondering if I should also inquire about achieving a salary increase to $55k a year.

personalfinance,(US) A year into employment. How do I allocate my assets?,"Hi r/pf,

Sorry in advance if these generic advice threads aren't welcome.

I'm a year into employment out of college, and I think I finally have a grip on my general monthly finances. I'm starting to think about how to allocate my money, but I'm feeling a little lost at all the options. Any advice on how to best set myself up going forward?

Annual Income: $110k

**Current Holdings:**

**Savings**

Ally Savings Account: $25.5k

**Personal Investments**

Vanguard VOO ETF: $6k

* My savings account seems really high, and it seems like I should be able to just move a bunch into ETFs. Should I be looking at different index funds to diversify?

Random stocks: $3k

* Just for playing around. I don't expect any real earnings from this.

Dumb Cryptocurrency Speculation: $1.5k

**Retirement**

401k: $6k (10% contribution, no employer matching)

* Allocation is as follows: 60% Vanguard Target Ret 2060, 40% S&amp;P 500 + VANG MIDCAP + FID INTL IDX

HSA: Employer + personal contribution is ~$4k annual

* The HSA seems good, but I'm confused whether it's better to allocate between 401k or HSA. Seems like for HSA, the money will be just stuck there for years, with the benefit of it being tax free at a certain age?

* The deductible for this plan also seems very high, but my employer covers the entire monthly fee. Last time I went in for a brief consult with my PCP, I was hit with an unexpected $300 bill. I'm not really sure how all this works, and I'm avoiding going in for non-critical issues now.

**Expenses**

Rent + Utilities: ~$1900/mo

Food: I eat out regularly, unsure what the true cost is, but I'm sure it's a lot. Looking to pare down this expense.

Transportation: 0

**Loans**

I've paid off my federal college loan, the only one in my name. My parents have graciously stepped in for the rest with a home equity loan for $50k at ~3% interest. Talking to them, they don't seem too concerned about paying it off immediately, but would it be better for me to use a significant portion of my holdings to pay down the principal right now, as opposed to putting it in other personal investments?

**Goals**

While I like the idea of FIRE, I'm enjoying the career I chose (for now), and see myself working for a considerable amount of time. I'd like to set up a good foundation early on that will put me in a good place 15~20 years from now, and eventually for retirement. 

I'm having difficulty allocating between retirement accounts and personal investments, as I don't keep good track of my monthly expenses. Additionally, I'm unsure whether I should be aggressively paying off the home equity loan or just minimally working at the principal while getting my other accounts built up.

Thanks in advance!

personalfinance,Student loans have entered repayment and I don't earn enough to pay them,"Back when I was a naivee 18 year old entering college (6 years ago) I made the mistake of taking out both federal and private student loans. Thinking that I would be able to do income based repayment or that I would have gone through dental school by the time repayment came and I would have the money. Well that hasn't happened and I'm still in the application process for dental school. Repayment time has come and I have no idea how to make this work. 

My federal loans will be okay because I was able to apply for REPAYE and once approved my min payment will be $84. Can't really afford an extra $84 a month but I'll make it work.

My personal loans are where the problem comes in. They're through a company ""Mallie Sae"" and when I called customer service they said I can either go into forbearance or a graduated payment plan where I would only pay the interest. This is where I don't know what to do and my cosigner will be of no help either. I really don't want to default because a) I took out these loans and I want to pay them back and b) when I get into dental school I will be applying for a scholarship that checks to make sure you aren't defaulted on any loans/make late credit card payments. 

Here's a summary of my loans: 

* A: $21,090.38; 12%; $211 interest only payment
* B: 14,729.06; 8.5%; 105
* C: 14,483.84; 11.75%; 142
* D: 4,916.52; 10.125%; 41

I'm not able to make all of the interest only payments but am able to do a combination of forbearance and payment. But not sure what loan(s) it would be best to make payments on. 

I currently have 2 jobs and make roughly $1800 a month. My set bills come out to about $1200 but that doesn't include groceries, pet supplies, gas, or anything else. I also will be having some medical bills soon, just haven't received the payment plan yet. I am barely making it paycheck to paycheck but have been working on sticking to a budget.

personalfinance,Buying a house and renting it out,"There's a house on the same block as mine and its price dropped 30k in 4 months (from 250k to 220k) , my mother has been inside it and it looks well maintained and I live in suburbs north of Minneapolis which is a pretty safe area. I'm not experienced in buying homes or real estate.

personalfinance,What is the tax drag from investing in a taxable brokerage account vs. investing in a Roth IRA?,"How much is the tax drag really on a taxable account? Somewhere close to 0.75%?

There is tax on dividends, but dividends are about 2% of the return on stocks and the tax is 15%, so that's 0.33%. Then there is tax on any interest on bonds, that is at income tax rates, but bonds are a fairly small part of most people's portfolios, and the interest rate on bonds is very low. So that is about 0.1% on a portfolio with 10% bonds. Then there are capital gains taxes if the fund re-balances and it is a Mutual Fund, rather than an ETF. What's that? Another 0.1-0.2%/yr?

So, the tax drag annually might be circa 0.5%.

Then, you pay capital gains taxes when you sell and take out money (after retirement say). Whereas, if you had invested in a Roth you would not pay capital gains taxes. Say those are 15% on gains, and gains are 50% of your portfolio after 30 years, so that's 7.5% tax on the total value of the portfolio, but averaged over 30 years, it's 0.25% per year.

So the total tax drag on a taxable account vs a Roth IRA might be 0.75% or so.

Maybe more, as the bond allocation goes up as one gets nearer to retirement.  Say 1%?

CryptoCurrency,ALTCOIN market should move away from BITCOIN and CENTRALIZED exchanges,"It has become clear to me that Bcash is a special altcoin.

Every time it pumps, it seems to coincide with a massive dump in BTC. This time it was likely caused by insiders buying up BCash before hand, promoting media stories to panic people (https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5171016/bitcoin-guru-admits-he-has-flogged-all-of-his-cryptocurrency-because-its-virtually-unusable-in-the-real-world/), and purposely dumping BTC on the market to create a 'flippening' scenario.

When Ripple pumps for instance, it doesnt bring down the entire market. Neither does Ethereum. But the bitcoin war between Bcash and Lightning drags down the entire altcoin market in an exaggerated fashion. Every time this happens we see the same shit.

I am guessing that many others are fed up with this boring drama now as well. And I predict that 2018 will be the year of decentralized exchanges (no more Coinbase market manipulation), with altcoins traded in a stablecoin.

This is the only way to move forward IMO, and if enough people see the same thing, we can take this market to the next stage.

CryptoCurrency,"Thank you cryptocurrency, today i payed off my debt i made as an 18 year old.","Today I finally payed off my student loan I started almost 10 years ago, thinking about it still makes my blood boil. 

Some facts about the loan: When I was 18 years I was in college, my bank contacted met to offer me a loan so I could cover my expenses (like they knew what kind of expenses I had). The loan was for a maximum of 5.000 EUR, and I would have to start paying back after I finished college. To offer this to an 18 year old is in my opinion seriously irresponsible and unethical. For the people that don’t know this: the frontal lobe of the brain fully develops around the 25th year. This part contributes to planning, responsibility, forward thinking and maturity in general. As an 18 year old, all I could think of was 5.000 EUR, off course I knew I would have to pay it back. But how bad can it be? After college I would get a great job anyway right? I am not trying to make up excuses for my actions, I made it, regret it, but still take responsibility for it. As you can imagine for an 18 year old, I spend everything within 6 months or so on complete rubbish (with exception from my drivers license).

So here is the catch from the loan (which, at the time I couldn’t, or wouldn’t,  fully comprehend):

There is an 8% interest rate, you have to start paying back a minimum of 100 EUR a month 2 years after you graduate (or drop out) from college. So let me lay this out for you:

Year 0: 5.000
Year 1: 5.400
Year 2: 5.832
Year 3: 6.299
Year 4: 6.802
Year 5: 7.347
Year 6: 7.934
Year 7: 8.569

Unfortunately I had 1 extra year of college, and some trouble finding a job (financial crisis and all), so at the time I had to start paying back the loan my grand total was 8.569 EUR with an ongoing interest of 8%. The interest that I had to pay the first year (8% of the grand total) was 686 EUR. With the minimum payout of 100 EUR a month this would mean in the first year of paying back I payed more interest than down-payments. If I would keep up at this rate, I would have payed the loan off after 11 years. 11 years of 1200 EUR a year = 13.200 EUR for an original loan of 5.000 EUR. 

Fortunately I stumbled upon Bitcoin and Crypto’s in early 2017, and decided to put a little money in bitcoin, and after some research in Antshares. I rode the NEO train and this week I payed out enough to be freed of this awful loan, the feeling when I payed of this loan was such a relief. I have  a good job at the moment, but not that good to pay 8.000 EUR in one year, I still have to pay my monthly expenses and all. 

So what did I learn from this experience? The first thing is that I really have zero respect for letting young adults make these decisions that have an impact for the next 20 years. I view this as very unethical, I am for responsibility and all, but to make this kind of an offer to an 18 year old guy is morally questionable. Second, I have got minimum respect for bankers and their practicing.
So nothing good? Hell yes, this whole experience made me more financially responsible. I will never take out loans again (with exceptions of maybe a mortgage for a house), I am starting to save money and try to be very financial aware. I’m hoping to start accumulating diverse assets in the coming years so that one day I can be truly financially free. The last good thing is I am really into the crypto market, for the profits off course, but maybe even more for the idealistic part. I think cryptocurrency in general is the perfect way to be financially aware, you are seriously thinking about investing, saving, and being financially active. The decisions you make can have a very large impact on your live, this can be applicable to the “fiat world” as well. I still have some crypto assets left, and hoping this can be the start for something beautiful. I just want to say thanks to this amazing technology and the very helpful community of Reddit in general, and a toast to a good future for all of us.

""The Bitcoin revolution is shaking the financial world,"" the paper declares.

It is perhaps the biggest economic surprise of 2017, the paper says.

Unknown to the general public three years ago, bitcoin has just made a sensational debut on the international financial scene.

On Monday, le Monde tells us, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange launched cryptocurrency futures. And that's just the beginning.

Bitcoins were valued at 1 000 dollars - around 850 euros - at the beginning of the year. By Monday they were close to 19 000 dollars Monday - that's 16,000 euro.

In the universe of low interest rates, where nothing pays, investment funds flock to it; start-ups raise funding using cryptocurrencies; even individuals, bewitched by the surge of prices, buy them.

""This ""bitcoinmania"" raises concern,"" the paper says.

Nobel Prize winning economists call it a dangerous ""bubble"".

""Those who join the adventure risk losing everything if the bubble bursts,"" warns le Monde.

currently I do put in 12% into my 401k and company matches another 3%.  but other than that I have no savings or any kind.

is it better to just knock out my loans like I was planning on? or would it be smarter to start a ROTH IRA or something like that?

Currently I am sitting on a bit over 16,000 in credit card debt between three cards at 9%, 23% and 24% interest (the later two due to cash withdrawals due to emergencies). I was contacted by freedom debt relief which is this company that seems incredibly fishy. They basically said they can help and id only be making payments of 300 something a month and be debt free in 48 months. However they went on to say basically you default on your monthly payments and they negotiate with the company that you have a hardship or whatnot. This is all cute and all but I know I signed a contract with the creditors saying I’ll make my payments and can’t they sue with that? He basically said once you can’t pay they’ll negotiate and settle with the funds you’ve payed them every month.

My current plan is this: I’m using the debt snowball and paying my lowest card first which luckily also has the highest interest rate. I pay this lowest card first and will then dedicate these funds to the next highest card. I believe this still is the most solid plan for me. I have roughly $300 a month to put towards my debt because all of my other bills are solid and can’t be lowered. I have a great budget on YNAB. This debt has just been pressing me for months. 

I’d appreciate any help guys. The other confusing thing is each month I obviously have monthly payments on all three cards. I want to pay $300 a month into the lowest card and continue from there. But the minimum payment on the other two is still there. I’d be fine adjusting that $300 each month to fit into the other two minimum payments however the billing statements are all released at different times so it’s next to impossible to coordinate how much does each card need each time?

personalfinance,refinancing a mortgage (US),"Hello! I'm looking for some judgment-free information about refinancing a mortgage. We are a married m/f couple in our mid-40s, no kids, combined income $100K per year, approximately $300K banked in various retirement accounts, and an ample emergency/home repair fund.

We have a 30-year fixed loan with a balance of around $170K at an interest rate of 6%. We purchased the house in 2002 and refinanced (from 7%) in 2003. It's a desirable urban area so property values have climbed, to a current value of around $600K. We have no plans to sell anytime soon. I'm a risk-averse person with no debt other than this mortgage--my biggest goal at this point in my life is to get the house paid off. There may be an eventual goal of using a HELOC to do major renovations, but that's very uncertain and at least ten years in the future if it's even realistic at all.

Apparently 6% is a very high rate these days. (And apparently I've missed the boat for the lowest rates, but I'm not going to wallow in regret over that.) There's one simple reason why I never saw a need to refi: our monthly payment (around $1800, adjusted yearly for escrow) has seemed reasonable and comfortable, especially in the context of this area's costly rental market. I realize now that there would have been a benefit to lower payments in the form of more money for savings. Expensive lesson learned.

But, I read that refinancing is more effective for younger loans, when more of the payment goes to interest. We're fifteen years in at this point. What does that mean?

I used a quick online calculator that gives a ""monthly payment"" of $1257 for $170K at 4% for 15 years. But I would have to confirm our taxes, insurance, etc. and add them in to this amount, yes?

Namely, SO is pressuring hard to refi, but I am the one who manages the finances, so I just want to be sure I understand if this really is a good idea.

personalfinance,Financial Check-Up / Advice On Maximizing Retirement Contribution,"Hello! Love this community and had a few questions despite browsing the sidebar. As background, I am 24 years old living in California.

1) Is there any way to maximize 2017's retirement contributions, or is it too late?

Switched jobs at the beginning of October. The new job doesn't allow 401(k) contributions for the first four months. Consequently, I didn't hit the annual limit from my September YTD contributions. My income is too high to qualify for a ROTH IRA. Can I still contribute to a Traditional IRA to bridge the difference between my current contributions and that $18,000 limit (might be apples to oranges)? Annoyed that I might have lost out on the potential to invest in the last quarter.

2) Is saving for an MBA through a 529 plan in CA possible and/or make sense given 2-4 year time horizon?

I am potentially looking to get an MBA in 2-4 years. I read a few posts that said I may not get any tax advantages living in CA with regards to using a 529 for an MBA. This is a new topic area for me, so not sure if this is accurate online information. Alternatively, not sure if saving for retirement is more optimal given earlier compounding vs. low potential school loan interest rates.

Current financial situation:

Annual Income: $170k (as of Oct 2017)

Investment Accounts: $70k in Roth/Traditional IRAs, $25k in taxable accounts

Putting approximately 600-1000 a month in credit card payments.  This is pretty much the minimum payment with maybe a little bit going towards the principle.  

Our spending habits have improved greatly to where we are a little bit net positive every month, but I just don't see where I can save enough to put a large dent into the debt at a rate where I wouldn't keep taking it in the shorts on the interest.  

I have 110K in my 401k.  I realize that touching the 401k isn't a great option, but neither is having this debt over my head.  

Is this one of those rare occurrences where actually taking out the loan would make sense?

personalfinance,Received conditional approval for Jumbo 30 Year Fixed loan after disclosing a foreclosure in the last 7 years but then was denied based on the foreclosure 2+ months into the application process,"I recently started going through the refinance process with a local credit union and ultimately was denied with very little willingness from the bank to communicate with me. Ultimately, I'm just confused at how the process carried on for as long as it did and felt like this might be a forum to just hear some opinions on how others might view this series of events. 

Below is recap of some of the key events and I'd be happy to elaborate or clarify anything that needs more context. 

We started the refinance process for my home with local credit union and submitted the initial application and requested financial documents in late October 2017. 

As a first step in the application process I responded 'Yes' to two separate questions related to being involved with a foreclosure within the last 7 years. 

All communication from the bank rep was positive and the interest rate was locked on 11/1/2017. 

The conditional loan approval letter was issued on 11/7/2017 with conditions for a property appraisal and 'inquiries to be addressed' in addition to a request for me to pay a deposit of $1K for ordering the property appraisal.

Feedback was immediately provided by us on the inquiries that were to be addressed which were related to recent hard credit checks that had not resulted in us obtaining any new/additional credit and there was no further questions on this topic. The deposit for the appraisal was also paid at this time.  

There was no other feedback at this point and the next communication from the bank did not come until 11/29/17 when they first inquired about the foreclosure with the following request:

&gt;Can you provide the final document or discharge papers or something of that nature to confirm the date is within waiting periods?

Unfortunately, I have no other documentation from Countrywide/Bank of America/Nationstar other than what was available through my credit report (which shows closed accounts with BoA and score over 700) and asked for guidance on what else could be provided.

In the response from the bank on 11/30, I was basically told by the rep that they were unsure what the 'back office' was looking for but would try to get clarification. The last part of this email then confirmed that the appraisal would be due back shortly and, ""once it is received, we begin to finalize figures and process to close.""

On 12/4, we were then sent the final appraisal report 

On 12/7, our rep inquired again with another vague request related to the foreclosure but still unable to provide more detail other than, ""there should be discharge paperwork – something that confirms dates and finalization"". I dug up and provided MLS documentation along with my own explanation of the foreclosure and related timeline of events (which spanned 2007 - 2010).

On 12/8, I received the following:

&gt;We still have not gathered the needed info around the former property. There should be discharge paperwork outlining what happened with the property – dates, amounts, notice of transfer/sale, etc.

In this same email the rep also stated:

&gt;Loan amount has been updated to get closer to $XX cash back. Your debt ratio is still under 30%, so we are good there.

I responded within hours with Notice of Trustee Sale documents for the property I pulled from public records and asked if additional information was needed.

On 12/12, I followed up with no response.

On 12/14, I followed up again to ask if we were still on track to close and received the following response:

&gt;I need to clarify for underwriting if the former house was a true foreclosure or a short sale. The waiting periods are different for the two – if short sale the period is 4 years, if foreclosure it is 7 years.

I responded and stated that I was unaware of what category the scenario would fall into but again tried to provide more context of my understanding (i.e. I didn't negotiate terms for a short sale and at least one document I provided references a 'foreclosure sale') and provided additional documents from public record showing multiple trustee reassignments since we initially had defaulted on the loan in August 2010. 

On Friday, 12/15, I had not heard back in 24 hours since my previous message and followed up again asking about alternate options should we not be able to move forward. There was no response to this message.

On the morning of 12/16, I logged into the site for tracking loan progress and was surprised to see that the loan was no longer active.

I spent some time on 12/16 going through the 800 number to speak with anyone that could provide more context and ultimately spoke with some one in an adjacent department that was unable to understand the exact status of the loan and why it was cancelled end of day on Friday, 12/15.

I have since recovered the deposit we made for the appraisal but ultimately found it very difficult to get any proactive outreach or written communication from the bank since the loan was closed. For example, the reimbursement for the appraisal originally was only partially paid back then when I followed up to address the discrepancy I just got another transaction email saying another credit would be made back to my credit card but no acknowledgement from the reps I had been working with. 

Ultimately, I get that the 7 year timeframe with foreclosure is a mostly objective rule and there's not much else you can do about it but wait. However I continue to feel like the bank really screwed up by letting this drag out over 2 months, flipped it to cancelled heading into a weekend and then have been mostly radio silent without significant prying on my part.

Again, my intent here is to just get opinions from folks with a better understanding of this subject matter so I can better understand and move on from this experience (and maybe learn something useful, too). Thank you!",finance

* I have ~28k in federal and private student loans that begin repayment in February

* My monthly expenses total around $1,000-$1,200

* I will be on my parents' healthcare plan until late 2020 (I am 23 years old)

* My employer does NOT make any matching contributions to our company 401k

* My credit score is 715


**My plan:**

1. Get my emergency fund (3 months) into a high-interest savings account and shut that away
2. Try to refinance my student loans for a lower rate
3. Apply for ONE good credit card for cash back or miles (paying it off every month)
4. Repay my student loans as quickly as I can
5. Open up a Roth IRA and slowly contribute 8% or more of each paycheck

Is there anything big I am missing? I want to be able to tell my friend that I'm doing ok. I will still venmo him $100 or so for the few hours we have talked, but I don't want him to think I'm going to hire him to manage a portfolio or something for me.

I'm currently in my 30s with bad credit (~500) due to student loans I let slide into default in my mid 20s, while I only had a part time job and irresponsibly fled from the debt rather than addressing it.  I'm better now financially, making ~75k per year and steadily paying down my debts.

I do, however, keep getting pre-approved credit card offers in the mail.  I'm aware the catch is typically ridiculously high interest rates.  They prey on the poor and end up gouging them for a profit if they end each month with a balance.

CryptoCurrency,HST A Sleeping Giant - Token Value,"With HST (Horizon State) getting more exposure lately I thought it would be good to make a post taking a more in-depth look at what role the token has in the platform. For those who don’t know what HST is here is a quick summary before going into the token details and what use the token has. Horizon State is a blockchain company that hopes to revolutionise the current outdated voting system by utilising blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent digital ballot box. This would make voting unhackable, incorruptible, completely transparent but anonymous, and much more efficient, all at a fraction of the price of the current voting systems. This is a business to business platform targeting governments, councils, businesses, institutions and any other entities that may need to hold a vote. HST has partnered with a United Nations IGO (intergovernmental organisation) and SAP (a multinational software corporation with $22.06 billion revenue in 2016). For more information about the project and partnerships see the links at the bottom.

&amp;nbsp;

One of the most impressive parts of this project is the token mechanics and the role that the token plays in the platform. The HST token acts as an access token for end users to vote on the platform. Clients who want to hold a vote need to buy HST to conduct the vote. The HST will be bought from the open market (this can be done through the Horizon State platform with fiat, so no need for the clients to touch any crypto markets as some may be averse to that). The way it will work is a client will come to HS and say we need to hold a vote for 5 million people, HS will then quote them a price in fiat. They will then purchase however many tokens that fiat figure allows at the current market price at the time. One important thing to note is that it is not 1 hst = 1 vote. Because the token is divisible by 18 decimals this allows the amount of hst needed per vote to vary depending on how many tokens are able to be bought at the current market price with the quoted amount. This means that the price of the token is irrelevant to the client and does not affect them in any way. They get a quote in fiat at the beginning and pay that. As the platform grows with new modules such as deliberation, audiencing, analytics, fundraising, incentivisation, social impacts, submissions etc, HST will be used as access rights for more services in this same manner. As the customer savviness of the cryptoasset ecosystem improves, they will also have the opportunity to manage their own reserves of HST. The greater success of the platform and its features, the greater the demand for the token.

&amp;nbsp;

After the tokens are used for the vote, up to 8% of the used tokens will be burned, this will slowly reduce the number of tokens circulating. 5% of the used tokens will be recycled into charities. They will initially be handpicked charities that align with the company values: equality, democratisation and justice. Looking forward however, these tokens will be fed into a charitable decentralised organisation (DAO) which would allow the community to be directly involved in the decision of where these tokens will be spent. 5% of HST used in the non-government, public services domain (e.g. city council elections) will be recycled back to the community voting. The plan is that councils wishing to participate will run their voting on the platform, adding a specific question inside the ballot that will have people selecting which public infrastructure project they would like the tokens used to go into. The remainder of the tokens will be liquidated on the free market by Horizon State. As tokens are used and come in, they will be entered into a pool of ready-to-be-recirculated tokens. This pool will be returned to the market at a rate of 20% per month.

As always do your own research but with a market cap of about only $15 million at the time of this post, I believe this is one of the most undervalued projects right now. This project is solving a real problem and has a real world use case and is a perfect fit for blockchain. They have been in talks with global NGOs, multinational enterprises, national governments, and city councils, and have been shown a lot of interest. Client announcements and clients starting to purchase HST to use the platform could happen at any time.

personalfinance,I'm receiving $102k this week. What do I do with it?,"Hi guys! A little background. I'm 27 and married with a 2 year old and one on the way. The $102k is coming from an acquisition of the company I'm with. I live in a tiny house on wheels, which we still owe $28k on at 10% interest rate (personal loans). Once we pay that down, we'll have no money going towards housing. I have a car which we still owe $18k on at 7%. We also have some credit card debt. This $102k check is about half of what I'll get. Another check comes in the summer for $57k. Then another comes the following summer. I make about $120k annually as salary. I have about $10k in a 401k at 90% S&amp;P 500 and 10% Vanguard bonds. I have a $1k emergency fund and about $5k in a checking account. I want to squeeze every drop out of this opportunity and put our family at a good spot. Our goal is to be financially independent ASAP. The tiny house was a first step as we'll be mortgage free pretty quickly. 

So, where should the money go? Pay off debt? Invest? A mix of both? Where should I invest? 

Also, any tax advice? 

My initial thoughts are to pay off most of the debt, essentially securing a ~10% interest rate buy-back. Put a little in crypto while the timing is right. Then leverage future income and future acquisition checks for investment opportunities. I'm seeking counsel from a financial advisor, but I'm open to any and all advise from the amazing PF community.

financialindependence,Deposits in Foreign Currencies to Take Advantage of High Interest Rates,"I just moved from the US to ""overseas"" to a small country where I intend to work and live for a while. The country's currency is pegged to the US dollar, so there are no exchange rate fluctuations. The interest rates on bank deposits can be up to 6% at some banks, provides that your money is locked there for one year.

The idea of a RISK-FREE return of 6% seems almost too good to be true. The only risk I can think of is something major happening like a war breaking out or a complete collapse of the economy (Greece or Argentina back in the day). 

Am I missing something here or should I jump on the opportunity and put a big chunk of my cash holdings in a deposit account as soon as possible? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: 
Thanks for all the good points raised in the comments. This is why I love this sub! I am no finance major but I'll try my best to provide more context:
- Tax rate on earned interest is 5%. 
- Yes you have to be a citizen or a resident, which my wife is. 
- Inflation is currently 3.5%. 
- Mortgage rates for 20 year fixed interest mortgages is 9.5% (probably explains why they can give 6% on deposits and still have a healthy spread). 
- Deposits are federally insured up to $15k. 
- Exchange rate is a constant figure, not a range of values. 
- The only fees are early withdrawal fees. 
- Sorry can't reveal the country but I can say it is a developing country. Corruption is relatively low (keyword is relatively) but the economy and political atmosphere is shaky.",finance

I’ve been bouncing between consolidating, doing the snowball method with starting with the smallest total amount first, and or doing the highest interest rate first. 

 

Here’s some background – I make approximately $2,100 a month (moved due to husband’s relocation and there aren’t a lot of job opportunities as of yet and I wasn’t willing to wait a long time to get an income), but housing is paid for since we live in military housing and only pay approximately $300 a month total on internet, electric, phone, and groceries (I split those bills 50/50 with my husband). I spend maybe $50 on gas a month since I have to commute a good distance to work each day. We have no other debt besides my student loans. I have $1,000 in my emergency savings but I do send money frequently to my parents, as my mom is dying and her medical expenses and care are extensive for only being on one income now. So, while that won’t be a forever expense, it is one that is important for me to continue to do for the time being. I also don't have any retirement accounrs set up, but I plan on figuring out which one to start next year. Anyways, here’s a breakdown of my loans:

 

Sallie Mae:

$3,381.00 (8.875% interest rate)

$3,042.43 (6.625% interest rate)

AES Success:

$1,790.74 (4.82% interest rate)

Unsubsidized

$2,687.90 (6.8% interest rate)

$2,551.25 (6.8% interest rate)

$2,194.55 (3.86% interest rate)

$2,159.63 (4.66% interest rate)

 

Basically, I’m hoping someone can give me direction as to what my best options might be? I’ve done some research on the different options my mean for me specifically, but I’m not very knowledgeable on this and am hoping someone can give me a better perspective!

personalfinance,Financing a car and I need help deciding and understanding the whole interest rate thing!,"Good evening reddit! 
I am trying to purchase a 2017 Altima. This will be 3rd vehicle but first brand new car and also first time financing. I'm considered a ""ghost"" in the credit world because I have no history at all.

I can put $10k as down payment. I could probably manage $11 but that's pushing it. The total cost including taxes, etc is slightly over $19k.  Now I have to decide how much and where to get the loan from.

I was approved 8k maximum auto loan with 10% from USAA.
Dealership offered 8% with Ally, which I haven't heard of.
My sales guy is ""advising"" me (aka pressuring the life out of me) to put down 3-4k and finance the rest to ""build my credit"" 

What I feel comfortable with is to put down 11000 and finance 8k with USAA.
Second option would be to do the same, or maybe 10k down and 9k loan through Ally.

Now this is where I'm really confused -
when a salesman ran a loan calculation with 9.99% (before they offered me 8%) $8842 loan over 60 mo would cost me $2470 total in interest. I get the whole compound interest thing but that seems a bit excessive! Is that my sign to run away from Ally/ dealership finance?

Some of the interest rates are embarrassingly high but I was stupid and did not understand them when I signed up for them and consequently I have been drowning financially under the weight of all of the interest. It seemed like all of the payments I could make were instantly negated by interest.

personalfinance,Should high-income earners max out their Roth 401k?,"This is the logic provided to me by a 30 year old friend of mine who just finished graduate school and now finds himself in a high income bracket ($300K+).

Let

c = current marginal income tax rate (including federal, state, and local taxes)

r = marginal income tax rate at retirement (including federal, state, and local taxes)

We don't know r since we don't know our income level at retirement, the city and state we will be living in at the time, nor the possible changes in law and regulation by then. Let's say we have an estimate for r.

""Should we invest in a Roth 401(k) or a Traditional 401(k)?"" is a common question.

""If r&gt;c, choose Roth, else choose Trad"" is a common answer. However, for high income earners who are aggressive about saving for retirement, this may be an unsatisfactory answer.

First, note that if you are going to invest a small fixed sum such as $1000 in either Roth 401(k) or Trad 401(k), then the common answer is in fact, correct.

However, the situation that faces folks that are extremely thrifty in their spending and aggressive about saving and investing is different.

Let 

M = limit of annual contributions to a 401(k) (eg. for 2018, M= $18,500)

c = current marginal income tax rate (including federal, state, and local taxes) (eg. c = 40%)

r = marginal income tax rate at retirement (including federal, state, and local taxes) (eg. r = 35%)

t = long-term capital gains tax rate at retirement (eg. t = 15%)

F = multiplicative factor by which money will grow between now and retirement (eg. for a 30 year horizon towards retirement, F=10, so an investment of $1 grows to $F)

W = M/(1-c) = wealth that you wish to save towards retirement

Let's see what a Roth-saver and a Trad-saver would do.

1. The Roth-saver pays tax on her wealth W at current tax rate c and thus, invests M dollars in her Roth 401(k) account.  The Roth-saver finds herself in retirement with real MF dollars and owes no taxes on that.

2. The Trad-saver pays no tax on M dollars out of the wealth W to place those M dollars in his Trad 401(k) account. Additionally, the Trad-saver pays tax at rate c on the amount (W-M) to place (1-c)(W-M) in his taxable account, although he expects to withdraw from it only at retirement. The Trad-saver finds himself in retirement with MF dollars in his 401(k) plan on which he pays taxes at rate r. Additionally, he finds himself with (1-c)(W-M)F dollars in his taxable account on which he pays the long-term capital gains tax rate of t. Thus, after paying necessary taxes, he finds himself with real dollars given by MF(1-r) + cMF(1-t).

The Roth-saver has more real wealth at retirement than the Trad-saver if and only if

r &gt; c(1-t).

So, if r=35%, c=40%, t=15%, it follows that the Roth-saver is the winner, while the naive comparison of r vs c suggests that the Trad-saver should be the winner.

Some more consequences:

a) For those who think that our current annual income in the early years of of our career better be lower than the annual income we find ourselves with, after retirement, it is natural to suppose that r &gt; c, from which it follows that even if t=0 (which it won't be), Roth is the better choice.

b) The long-term capital gains tax rate underestimates the actual tax that a taxable account will leak out of you. Each year, the investment would yield ~ 2% in dividends which is assumed to be reinvested. This would require you to separately (using some extra money each year) pay long-term capital gains tax on the dividends (assuming they are qualified dividends) each year as you go. While this raises the cost basis of your investments and you would end up paying the same dollar amount in tax if the payout each year was delivered as capital gains instead of dividends (which it won't), it is the case that you pay a lot of taxes early on instead of later. $100 paid in tax 30 years from now is much better than $100 paid in tax today because of inflation.

c) There is always a danger than any money kept in a taxable account gets withdrawn prior to retirement and spent away on something or the other. Having your hands tied with the money in a retirement account is a blessing in disguise.

For this reason, my high-income friend advocates that high-income earners max out their Roth 401(k) each year (and of course, front load it too).

personalfinance,The Avalanche Method for Student Loans (little income),"I'll try to keep this very brief. First of all, I would to give my thanks to this community. I have learned a lot by lurking around.  The responses here are very helpful, and it's easily one of my fav. reddit pages.

I have a ton of student loan debt. For the past five months, I have been working part-time. My job is trying to get my position to full-time. I am about to work a second ""part-time"" by adjuncting. This will probably give me an extra few hundred dollars a month. 

I took out both federal and private loans for undergrad years ago. I went back to grad school, and took out mostly fed. loans and a couple of private loans.

I qualified for the zero payment a month on the income-based repayment plan with the feds. Before applying, I was paying around $270 a month towards these loans. I'm trying to use this to my advantage. I pay around $390 a month with Navient.

I would like to use the avalanche method, despite making so little. I calculated that, along side the Navient loan, I have around $800 extra dollars a month to pay towards loans (I live with my parents right now). I am putting about 10 percent of my income into savings to pay off debt. I currently have $600 saved. I am trying to also increase my income through another avenue. Though, I have not figured it out yet (Perhaps, freelance writing?).

The loans with the highest interest rates are both Navient loans that I haven't started repaying. (They're not pooled in the monthly payment for some reason as of now). One is $2,399.05 at slightly over 10% interest. The other is $7,692.55 at 12.875% interest. I can easily pay off the loan with the ten percent interest rate if I just keep saving my money. However, I do not want to leave the federal loans untouched. I would like to put some monthly payments towards them. I'm not sure what is the best approach to take. I'm currently taking home only $1600 a month, and will get an extra 500-600 a month for the next few months (until about May).

Something to consider is that my mother had to cosign the loan with me since I wasn't making much as a student and we were just focused on the lowest monthly payment at the time. I am completely independent since I have gotten my job, and I want to refinance for two reasons:
Higher monthly payment to speed up the repayment and
To get my mother's name off the loan.

personalfinance,Mortgage or Student Loan,"Hey there. I currently have $224,000 left on my mortgage, and after this month's payment goes through, I will have about $17,800 left on my student loans. 

The base mortgage payment is $1619/month. We've been paying $180 extra in principle per month, bringing our monthly principle payment to about $550. As for the student loans, I have four separate loans. They balances vary from $4k to $5.2k, with interest rates either 5.4% or 6.8%. The rate on my mortgage is 4.25%. The minimum monthly payment on my student loan is $500, but I've been making roughly $1500 payments to knock it down as quick as possible. Of each monthly student loan payment, roughly $110 is interest.

My wife and I have some changes coming up to our finances coming up (child going into daycare in the near future), so I will no longer be able to make the same student loan payment. Once our kid goes into daycare, we'll probably bring the student loan payment down to about $900, while still paying the extra $180 on the mortgage. 

Would it be more beneficial to shift the $180 from the mortgage to the student loan to help knock it out faster? Thoughts?

I am 25 and just finished up my last semester in University and started a job post-internship this past July with a salary of ~$97,900. To date, I have a student loan balance of about $52,000 through the Federal Government that I can consolidate to be around 4.5% (the average of all my loans).

Now, I've done a lot of research into this and even after looking at the flowchart, I am unsure whether aggressively paying these down over the next 1.5 years would be better than contributing (more, or even max) to my company-sponsored 401(k)?

From July-Now my current 401(k) balance is about $3200, which includes my employers half as they contribute 100% up to 4.5% not yet including a 3% flat contribution for the end of the year that I have yet to receive.  Come January 2nd 2018, they will be increasing the match to 6% and decreasing the yearly year-end contribution to 1.5%. I've already set up my contribution to increase automatically to 6% at the beginning of the year, but unsure what to do beyond that.

I do not have any outstanding debt outside of a car loan (including insurance) brings the monthly cost to about $500. Additionally, I currently am living with my parents and plan to for at least a few more years as well.. so my only other additional cost would be cost of living, and my student loan payments (I'm very thankful for this.. lived on my own for four years undergrad and got that experience out of my system, so meh). 

My questions is this: how do I approach my student loans? Do I just pay the minimum and max out my 401(k) every year? What about a Roth? I don't know much about this, can I have both? Should I have both?

Additionally, as it relates to my student loans, should I just choose the amount with the smallest interest paid? It would be about 10 years w/ payments in the low-to-mid $500s @ 4.5% interest.  Of course, there are tons of other options that lower the monthly payment by extending the years to 20 or even 25, but I would be paying a lot more in interest over the course of that.

Which.. brings me to my next point.  How do I decide which route to go? This is a bit overwhelming.  Lets say over the course of 25 years I paid $40k in student loan interest and my monthly payments were ~$180. Assuming I contributed more to my 401(k)/Roth (maybe? Again, not sure what it really is).. wouldn't that growth be a lot more than the $40k extra I would have paid by a large margin?

I hope this post makes sense.  I don't mean to sound ignorant (as I don't think I am generally smart with my finances), but the math of this specific scenario and what would be best for me is a little over my head.  Any help, advice or tips would be very much appreciated!

While normally I love to talk, both the Court's advice and your attorney's advice will most likely be the same: do not contact me. They'll tell you why. :)

 It's my understanding that with the sale of all remaining assets owned, the only likely folks to actually be paid will be the IRS and the State of California.

 As Gizmodo so plainly put it, [the company is broke, I'm broke, and the bot is broke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7eNkpNGw18). Hindsight is 20/20 of course, and while I wish I had reached out to the community 2 years ago and asked for help, but I didn't. I'm sorry.

A few things to help clear up some errors in numbers:

1. DP2BEjABenG8XiK3HPxMCaNG783RmY36JT — Birdie and the archives are gone, but either GoodShibe or Fulvio did publish the Cold Storage address in Very Much Wow Magazine.

Dogecoin has always been a generous community, and I hope that those who choose to remain here continue to keep that spirit alive. I understand that many of you have made significant amounts of money recently — continue to give it away and use it to help people. Make Hood proud. She still is around, btw.

I'm grateful for the awesome things we did together, but I'm ashamed of the mistakes I made. I'm moving on — unlike some others here who came back to Crypto, I'm out for good, and you probably won't see me much on the Internet anymore. Don't own any crypto and don't want to.

personalfinance,Old Savings Bonds,So I recently came across about $2500 worth of savings bonds I received growing up from relatives. Not all of them are fully realized but the interest rates aren’t great either. Is it worth it to cash these bonds early and put the money in a CD or other instrument that has a higher interest rate then these bonds have? With Ally’s 2% CD offer I’ve been thinking of using that.,finance
gaming,My Steam hacking fiasco,"So, it's been a whole year since my Steam account was stolen. I mean, it happens to all of us, right??

However, this wasn’t my first rodeo.

As a youngling, I lost my Runescape account more times than I can remember, I’m still waiting for that Abyssal Whip and Obsidian Shield I was promised by that 'moderator' way back in 2006 come to think about it. So after emailing Steam and raising a case with them, I set about investigating myself.

I kinda documented everything on Twitter and saved it as a moment. So to save myself from typing a feature length story out here, you can check it out for yourself:

Anyway, as interesting as the story was (and still is, I guess), what I'm curious about is how accurate the information I gathered was. Of course, it's incredibly likely that the IP address I found was just spoofed, this fella called Dmitry doesn't exist, and he certainly doesn't live in a grotty warehouse in the middle of Glazov, Russia.

personalfinance,(CH) My bank will start charging 0.6% negative interest on current and savings accounts. How to avoid?,"I'm in an unusual situation and I'm trying to find out what my options are.

I moved to Switzerland a few years ago. I just sold my previous business and plan to invest the money in a new business over the next 12 months. 

In the mean time, the money is sitting in a Credit Suisse retail savings account denominated in EUR.

Credit Suisse contacted me this week saying that they would start charging 0.6% negative interest from February 2018, for anything above 1M. This only applies to EUR accounts, not to CHF accounts. 

I do plan on exchanging about half of my EUR savings into CHF, but I'm expecting the exchange rate to rise, so I'd rather wait it out a little. 

CS has offered a temporary solution: The way I understand it, they would sell a 6 month call option to purchase half of my EUR for CHF. If the exchange rate rises beyond a certain price, I am forced to exchange my EUR for CHF. If it doesn't rise, I get compensated by about 0.6%, offsetting the negative interest rate. Either way, my savings would not shrink. 

Does that sound like a sensible deal? I am a complete newb when it comes to derivatives, so I can't really judge.

What other possibilities do I have? Any idea is appreciated!

PS. Yes I have seriously considered withdrawing the entire EUR amount in banknotes and storing it in a safe deposit box. But I just don't have the guts for that. Safe deposit boxes are not insured, and insurance would cost more than 0.6%.",finance
personalfinance,Need advice on the best way to be financially responsible with a refund check please read,"Hi! I'm a 23 year old college student. I am graduating with my undergrad in May but finished my courses early so am using the spring semester to start on graduate courses. I am attending the same school for my graduate degree starting in the summer semester. 

Since I am taking graduate courses, the amount of credits is half of what I needed per semester for undergrad. Therefore, my tuition rate is half of what it normally is. According to my student finance portal I should be getting a refund of 6800$ without taking any loans (scholarship, grants, financial aid).

Here are my current debts:
House - 84k (it is an investment property we plan on selling within 4 years, have already done a lot of the renovations and am continuing to do more throughout the next few years. All updates paid in cash)
Student loans -

Sallie mae:

$6648.60 at an interest rate of 11.25%

$4615.15 at 9.125%

Navient:

$16174.22 in subsidized loans 4.660% 

$7477.11 in unsubsidized 4.45%

Total student loan debt $34915.08

Car is paid off and I have no credit card debt or other debts. 

I have some money in investments but nothing exceeding 2k and make 12/hr full time at the moment. Also work part time occasionally and get roughly 150/month extra 

Monthly bills:
300 mortgage
150 groceries
150 gas
50 electric 
100 heat 
160 internet tv home security and Netflix 
(Split expenses with SO, this is my share)

What would be the best option here ? I know the rule of thumb is to pay off highest interest first, but wanted some outside opinions if I should pay off the gov loans that aren't acquiring debt yet or knock off multiple smaller ones (some gov ones are 1- 2k) OR should I save it as an emergency fund ?

Also, going forward what should I be doing regarding after the refund check to get in a better spot.

CryptoMarkets,"CNBC talks marijuana cryptos, mentions POTcoin","praise denis rodman https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/15/bitcoin-offers-the-cannabis-industry-an-alternative-to-banks.html

The cannabis industry may offer clues to the future of bitcoin.

Although medical use marijuana is now legal in more than half the states and recreational use is in some others, the drug is still illegal on the federal level. As a result, most major banks shun the marijuana business.

The cannabis industry, projected to grow to $50 billion from $6 billion by 2026, has long been in need of a financial solution.

Many in the industry are hanging their hopes on cryptocurrencies.

Technology companies like SinglePoint and POSaBIT are working to generate a payment method for dispensaries and consumers using bitcoin. In recent years, some cryptocurrencies have cropped up specifically for cannabis transactions, like PotCoin and HempCoin.

Before bitcoin was dominating headlines with its spectacular runup, there were people using it to buy illegal drugs. But now, ironically, some people in the marijuana industry are hoping bitcoin will bolster its legitimacy.

""That reputation is being turned around,"" said Wil Ralston, president of SinglePoint, which is creating an app called ""SingleSeed"" in which consumers and dispensaries can exchange bitcoins.

Some even say that the cannabis industry can lead other businesses to embrace virtual money.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,"Highlights from ""The Crypto Show: Jay Smith &amp; Brian Deery Of Factom""","(cross-posting wasn't an option from the original thread for some odd reason)

Recently listened to ""The Crypto Show: Jay Smith &amp; Brian Deery Of Factom"", and tweeted out highlights I thought were relevant. I wanted to put together a little summary so below are the points I found interesting:

show link: https://t.co/Zbv1mEuge8

* factom really the only chain to have proven themselves, aside from store of value (BTC).

* signed second contract with Bill &amp; Melinda gates foundation, first contract turned into project being worked on in South Africa currently

* VERY common in tech and crypto to have NDAs in place. 

* Stash wallet adding factom in Q1 2018

* apparently people didn't realize that factom has a native wallet with encryption including the crypto show hosts

* Milestone 3 date moved up to Q2 2018

* Realize crypto community felt slighted, but now that factom feels they are #1 for blockchain in the mortgage space they are pivoting focus back to the community on a regular basis

* sponsor a hack-a-thon. and want to support the community

* 300k-500k loans yearly from large mortgage provider, 100s of documents per loan. loans can last 30 years and need to be updated frequently. even on a 2x a year basis you can see how this becomes exponentially larger in terms of EC usage as time progresses

* ""repeat customers are always good"" - in reference to bill &amp; melinda gates foundation projects. shows confidence in the core technology of factom

* Jason said 20-30 NDA's during the NDA but said he wasn't sure on the #. Jay Smith (CMO) clarified that it is in fact over 30 NDAs.

* representative from federal reserve talking to @paulsnx2 at recent congressional hearing was excited about the prospective of crypto facilitating financial transaction settling times. specifically utilizing factom

* for those of you confused with BTC vs BCH or are just caught up in all of the BS, ~an hr into the the crypto show Brian Deery gives his perspective on the whole thing. much better than the usual BTC is crap! BCH is crap! narrative

If you have time, the show is definitely worth a listen (link at the top of post).",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Federal Withholding Taxes increased by $400?,"Hello. I'm kind of freaking out right now about my most recent paycheck. I went and looked this morning at my paycheck and noticed that I barely received 1/3 of my total pay for this period. 

After looking at it I saw that my medicare taxes doubled, my OASDI (whatever that is) doubled and my federal withholding in my check went from 200 to 600. Now I can't pay a lotof my bills because i'm short on my check about 500 bucks.

Can anybody explain why these taxes would jump so high? I've been with this company for 6 months and every job ive ever had, including this one, I've marked Single and 0 dependents on my W2 or whatever tax form it is.

I'm on the phone currently with my payroll department but any other insight would be helpful because the people i'm talking to don't really seem to know.

Edit: Just got off of the phone with our corporate payroll department. Our company uses a mileage reimbursement program called MOTUS. Apparently what happened is I was receiving money for my old vehicle but it was not in compliance (bought a new one about a month ago that is now compliant). While I had my non-compliant vehicle, I guess I received about $1300 (considered fringe benefit) which they did not tax until this paycheck. It sucks but I can understand that. What I don't understand is why them finally taxing the 1300 would make my federal withholdings go from 200 to 600 and my OASDI and Medicare double.",finance

personalfinance,Convert 401k to Roth: Pay Taxes w/Loans?,"I'm about to graduate from a full-time MBA program this spring (school is being financed primarily with student loans). I'm considering getting a second Masters degree (from which I would graduate in December 2019 going full-time). I have about $130k in a 401k. I know that it's generally best to convert a 401k to a Roth during years when income is low (such as while a student). My question, however, is whether I should do this considering that any amount of taxes I pay on the conversion is money that I can't put towards my tuition. My student loan interest rate is around 4-5%. 

I'm currently thinking I should go ahead and convert about 30k in this year (2017) and then some more in 2018 and 2019. It seems the future tax benefits will outweigh the interest expense I'll incur from essentially financing the conversion tax payment with student loans. Am I thinking about this correctly? Thanks in advance!

personalfinance,How am I doing overall?,"I just wanted to check in and see how I was doing financially. No, I'm not some person making six figures, but I'm rather good with budgeting with what I receive. FYI, age 29 from Long Island, NY.


*Income*

Local Government Job: $1715 biweekly (around $45k, or almost $25/hour)

Side Business: Fluctuates a lot depending on clients. On a good week now, I make around $130 a week doing a few hours of work, but I'm working on getting more clients (fitness training).

Child Support: $50 a week, plus half of all medical expenses not covered by insurance. My daughter's mother is thousands in arrears. I have recently seen like $40 in total from her, but that's it.


*Debt &amp; Expenses*

AMEX CC: $200 (almost done being paid off. I put $600 towards it today on my payday).

Chase CC: Like $50... I'm waiting on a return to go through before I pay off whatever is left.

Cell Phone: My wife and I are on a Sprint plan now. It's $130 a month, so around $65 each.

Car Insurance: $101 a month (Geico, it's the best quite I received)

Car: $0. Paid off August of 2017. 2010 Ford Fusion with 112k miles on it now. No issues, but just needs an inspection by the end of the month. Warranty (third party) just expired, but I got my money's worth over the years.

Rent: Wife pays $250 a month. We live in an apartment above my parents due to high cost of living. This is allowing me to save a lot of money while she pays down debt. She's also looking for a new, better paying job as well.

Copayments: $150-$200/month. I am on testosterone replacement therapy, see a psychiatrist, and a therapist. My daughter (8) also sees a psychiatrist and therapist. Luckily my insurance is very good (Empire BCBS), so my copays aren't much ($25 or $30). I also get prescription copay reimbursement once a year through my union. I also use my credit card most of the time to get some cash back, then pay it off immediately thereafter via the AMEX phone app. I also use my Flex Benefits.


*Check Deductions Breakdown (Biweekly)*

Federal Tax: $104.24

State Tax: $70.37

Social Security Tax: $106.99

Medicare Tax: $25.02

ERS Contribution: $51.45

Union Dues: $28.00

Flex Benefit Plan: $52.00 (this I put in for and get reimbursement for medical expense, which is generally copays)

Work Group Contribution: $1.00

T Rowe Price Deferred Compensation: $85.75

*Net Pay: $1196*


*Checking, Savings, &amp; Investments*

Checking: I use TD Bank. Usually $200 or so after expenses. I try to keep my budget tight, and need at least $100 balance to not get hit with a fee.

Savings: Goldman Sachs savings. $20,700ish. We had been using TD Savings which gave next to nothing (like $2 or $3 a month). With GS I get around $20 or so. I put in $200 or so per week. I'm going to increase this.

Vanguard Mutual Fund: $5700. I forget the ticket it is under... but it's a pharmaceutical one with a big dividend. I'm planning on taking a bunch out for next year's IRA.

Vanguard Roth IRA: Target Fund 2045. $20,800

Pension: Not sure... they take the 3% from my check. It will be something like 75% of my salary when I retire in a billion years. 


*Goals*
My wife and I want to get a house or condo eventually. Maybe in a year or two. My parents said they'll give us $20k towards it. I want to increase my wife business, so I'm working on that via advertisements and other means. At my full time job I am always taking tests for new positions. I also am trying to get a grade increase since we are vastly underpaid for our responsibilities. Denied twice, but taking another route that'll take a year or so to even get reviewed.

I'm 29 years old. I've always filed my taxes as single and independent. And every year I've gotten back about $900-2500 by putting 2 allowances for federal and state.

This new salary increase put me in a new tax bracket, I'm guessing. My first plan was to increase my allowances from 2 to maybe 3 or 4. I see on the W-4 form that I put 1 for no one else claiming me as a dependent and 1 for being single and only having one job but that would only count to 2 again. I don't quality for C-G, so I can't put a 1 in those. There's a part in the form that asks ""Additional amount, if any, you want withheld from each paycheck"" but that asks for a monetary amount which I don't know what to put without messing things up.

A few of my coworkers said to get a 403B from American Fidelity because it'll contribute more money towards my retirement tax free while also putting me in a lower tax bracket, which would even out my paychecks. This is where things get uncomfortable for me because it's so intimidating to read through the details and know if I'm doing things the right or wrong way.

Would it be a good idea to put more allowances on my W-4? Do I even qualify for more allowances? What would be the best route to keeping more during the year but not end up paying out of pocket when filing my taxes?",finance

However, if I have student loans or a mortgage that have interest that get me right around that number, is it worth it to give a charitable donation to push me over the standard deduction?  Does that just mean that my charitable donation essentially washes out?

Also, can someone explain how it really works?  Does that mean if I paid $12,000 in federal income tax, but I took the standard deduction - I get that all back when I file my return?  I'm really lost on that part of it all.

Future Endeavors:

As for my credit cards - $6,000 maxed out. I have been approved for a loan at 7% that will pay $5,000 dollars of this immediately. I expect my credit core to jump up 55 points. I'm currently paying like an average of 19% on the interest of the 4 separate cards. Is this a good idea to go through with? 

As for savings I plan on adding to the 2k with my tax return (roughly 1.5k) and my bonus (about 3k after taxes). 

Is there something I'm not seeing? I have the 2k but that's nothing special. I should have more. The first 5 months or so into this first year I took care of my terminally ill mother so I see why I couldn't save as much but still. Things seem to come up ($500 to get my moms car out of the impound lot, $350 for doctor visit, damn deductibles). 

I am getting married in July and my in laws are footing 2/3 of the bill. My fiancée is contributing most of the rest (about 8k-10K) but I would like to throw in about 3k. The contributions that fiancée and I make are small enough to optimistically assume we'll be reimbursed in gifts for our share but that may be irrelevant. Should I just sit back and let FW deal with the wedding. She gets a much higher bonus (17k) and she makes more than me. 

Any help is greatly appreciated. Maybe I'm doing fine and I just feel so behind. I just want a savings account in the 5 digits and get rid of this damn credit card debt!

personalfinance,Bought engagement ring - looking for a strategy to pay off loan,"I (25) bought an engagement ring the other day and took out an 18 month, 0% interest loan. 


I had to buy the stone and the ring itself independently (because the stone was in stock and the ring had to be custom ordered). My loan for the stone started yesterday and is $3,926. The loan for the ring will start sometime in January when I am able to pick the ring up. The ring will be $1,471.50, bringing the total of both loans to $5,397.50.


A little financial background - I have been saving for this for a while now. I hate the idea of being in debt and could pay it off immediately, but am open to other solutions if it is better for me longer term. In a savings account with a 1.09% interest rate - I receive an interest credit to my account every month - I have approximately $15.5K.

As such, I welcome any criticisms to my 'plan' to switch as well as any advice/considerations I should have in mind when switching.

I've got a little over $30K sitting in a savings account at U.S. bank, which does not pay much interest. (~$1 per month).

I was thinking of putting the first $15K in an Amex Savings account (paying 1.35%).

Then, putting the second $15K in a Chase Savings account (+$250 in a checking account). This way I'll earn a $300 bonus for the checking account and a $200 bonus for maintaining $15K in the savings account for 90 days (I'm aware the entire $500 will be taxed as interest).

I'll set up direct deposit to split my paycheck equally between the Chase Checking account and the Amex Savings. After 90 days (whereby I'll earn the second half of the bonus from Chase), I'll close the Chase Savings account and transfer the $15K to Amex Savings since it has a higher yield interest rate.

personalfinance,Requesting lower CC interest rate,"Hey all, I'm normally not a person that allows a balance to carry over on my credit card unless it's a specific large purchase on 0% cards. However, this year has been a bit unusual for me financially.

Earlier in the year, we purchased our home (25% down and only 1 year's gross income borrowed), then I found out I would be leaving for 6-9 months for work. Normally, they would pay to move the entire family, but we instead opted for my wife to remain since I'll be moving back and she has her career here. This means we are managing two households during this time. Just before leaving, our refrigerator and dishwasher quit (we knew it was coming when we bought the home) and so we purchased about $6k in appliances on a 0% interest store credit card.  

I say all of this to explain why I have, for the first time since I turned 18, found myself carrying a balance that is not on a 0% interest card.  It is also, the first time since I was probably 25, that my credit score is less than 750 (sitting about 730 right now).

I just paid off the appliances 9 months earlier than planned. And I know that l will have the credit card paid off by March. 

I received an email today that CitiBank has raised my credit limit another $4000 and this started me thinking that I should request a better interest rate (currently 16.99% and no cash back).  I originally started this card because it was 0% for 18 months and I was remodeling our last home.

Should I go ahead and request a better rate or wait until my credit score begins to return to it's norm? Should I instead request a different account that offers cash back or other benefits? Or is there a better option?",finance

personalfinance,Best way to refinance?,"I am looking to refinance my student loans, but I don't know the best approach.

I have a private student loan that is currently $43,900 at 6.89% fixed interest, that I am for certain going to refinance.

I also have federal loans, that are handled through the same lender, but broken down as such:

* $3015 at 6.8% fixed
* $3830 at 5.6% fixed
* $2065 at 6.8% fixed
* $4630 at 4.5% fixed
* $6780 at 6.8% fixed

I currently have no credit card debt, and can afford to pay an extra $200/month above my minimum payments. I just am not sure what the best course of action to refinancing would be. Should I refinance just the private loan, and worry about the smaller balance loans later? Should I combine all of the 6.8%+ loans? Should I just try to refinance all of them together?

I'm not sure how to figure out what ever best is in the long run to minimize the amount of interest I am paying, and where the sweet spot between interest and balance is. I have a 721 credit score, so I know that I'll get a lower interest rate than at least the 6.8%+ loans.",finance

While I'm on a 10-year payment plan for my loans, I've been reluctant to pay them down faster, especially while I've been making killer gains in my retirement accounts (+$16k through index funds in past year). I made a big move in my career and am making far less than the ~$85k I was making previously, but that should correct itself within the next 6 months (new job is more sales-y and waiting on commission)--this has kept me from making any major decisions. Assuming my income situation corrects itself in the near future, should I focus all my efforts on paying down the student debt (highest interest loans first), refinance into lower rate private loans (but lose federal protections), and/or continue on my 10-year payment plan and just continue putting money into my retirement accounts to continue taking advantage of the market?

I'm guessing most people will say to focus on the debt, but it's just tough when the retirement account gives me a nice security blanket and is currently earning almost triple the interest that I pay in student loans.",finance

investing,Discussion: What do you plan to buy with your 2018 IRA or Roth IRA Contribution?,"It's almost that time of year again. Time for a big $5,500 deposit -- if you follow the lump sum investing strategy -- at the beginning of the year. So that brings up the question that we all struggle with every year. What do we buy?

Are you planning to simply stack more VTSMX or VTSAX on top of our current holdings, or are you going to try picking your own stocks? Or will you try to identify which sectors are going to benefit the most in 2018 and snag up an ETF of that sector? Or a little of all three?

For me I'm looking at the following things.

1) Tax reform just passed, so we expect to see some repatriation and reinvestment of tax savings. How much remains to be seen, but clearly there will be some affect on stocks. 

2) Travel and ""buying experiences"" will continue to be more important in 2018 than ever before, as more millenials and younger people get new jobs and start exploring what to spend their hard-earned cash on.

3) New technology developments. Even if you aren't picking stocks and trying to gamble on which company will come up with the next big thing, it may be a good idea to pick up an ETF with lots of tech holdings to take advantage of these new developments. 

4) Financials. Interest rates are going up and taxes are going down, so all bank stocks look like a great buy right now -- but are they? Clearly they aren't as leveraged as they were in 2007, but the risk of over-leveraging is always there. 

5) Healthcare. 2018 is the last year of the individual mandate, and lots of analysts predict that healthy people will start dropping their insurance quickly in 2019. That means that the insured pools become riskier, so prices will probably go up. But that doesn't necessarily mean more profit for the insurance companies, because riskier pools are obviously more expensive. So will healthcare stocks continue to soar like they have been since the ACA was passed, or will they go bearish?",finance
personalfinance,Accidental Student Loan Circa 2012,"Hello PF,

Not too long ago I declared bankruptcy and all my debts were discharged in August of this year. Since then I have been more in tune with my finances and rebuilding my credit.

When I got an email/notification regarding the loans I contacted the financial aid department and they corrected the mistake. When looking at mt credit report I noticed that both these loans are on my report as closed. Stating they were opened on November 12, 2012 and closed on December 5, 2012. According to Credit Karma it states ""Payment Deferred"" under the remarks section and has a zero balance.

Should I attempt to have this removed from my credit report? Is it even harming/benefiting me at this point?

I know my debts are not super large and should be easy to fix but I'm just looking for the best route to go so I can get into a new home in 3-4 months.

$496 - open - 8/14  
$333 - open - 8/14  
$322 - open - 8/14  
$215 - open - 6/14

$400 capital one card, $0 used  

I normally keep my used amount below 10% on both each month.

Credit score:
620 - 628 - 684
---------------------

I know medical debt doesn't really hurt my ability to get a mortgage but it is holding my credit score down and making it more difficult to get a 0 down loan and to qualify for a local grant for $15k down payment assistance. I currently only qualify for FHA with 3.5% down.

My goal is to pay the most important debt that would help my credit first as well as the route I should go to pay them.

Then, once my credit score looks better, I want to refinance my car because the interest rate is very high.

Finally, speak to my lender to apply for a mortgage.

Another question, should I look at getting a personal loan to pay off my medical debt? Since a loan will help my credit and pay it back asap.

What is the best route I could take to get my credit as high as possible in the next 2-3 months to have a mortgage in 4 max?

CryptoCurrency,Belgium's tax services just decided that any profits speculating bitcoins are to be taxed 33-50%,"""The Belgian tax authorities have decided to withhold 33% tax from the revenues that would speculate with bitcoins. This is evident from a new ruling from the Federal Public Service Finance.
Anyone speculating with the virtual currency as a private individual, so buying and selling bitcoins with the clear goal of making a profit, will now have to pay 33% taxes on the income. The tax authorities regard the proceeds as 'various income', writes the tax authorities in the ruling on which De Tijd reports.

The decision comes after the case of a student who had developed an application for the automatic purchase and sale of bitcoins for his studies. ""Thanks to these automatic purchase and sale transactions, he has realized revenue"", says the tax authorities. And taxes have to be paid on that.

**Not as 'good family man'**

The tax authorities do not consider the profits made by the student as an added value such as those from ordinary shares, since they were not under the normal management of their private assets. Trading shares as ""good housefather,"" you say. Then the capital gains would be tax-free. Since the aim was to make a profit from the price fluctuations of bitcoins, taxes have to be paid.

The student, named X in the ruling, is relatively easy with 33 percent since the tax authorities decided not to consider their profits as professional income. The tax can then rise to 50 percent.

""He developed the application he used as a hobby and out of interest in his study domain"", the tax authorities said. ""The development of the application was intended to test to what extent he could convert the theoretical knowledge from his or her training into a concrete application. The resources he has used to make the application work are limited and little organized. The realized added value is not linked to a professional activity and therefore does not have a professional character. ""

**Steep advance**

The bitcoin has been on a particularly steep rise in recent weeks. Today 1 bitcoin is worth about 16,000 dollars, compared to 900 dollars a year ago. Last week, the price also fluctuated around 20,000 dollars.""

So far it's just a single court ruling ... but knowing Belgium, it'll soon find it's way into law.

CryptoCurrency,"Tether, Charles de Gaulle, Game Theory and the coming market correction","**Summary**

Tether (or USDT) is a dangerous and growing problem in the cryptocurrency market. I will prove this by drawing on modern macroeconomic history, game theory and Tether's own claims.



**Bretton Woods and President De Gaulle**



At the tail end of World War II in 1944, economic and political representatives from countries all over the world convened in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire through the United Nations. Their goal was to develop a system and the institutions necessary to establish an international financial order at the end of the war. They hoped to facilitate economic prosperity throughout the world.



The Bretton Woods Conference, as it came to be known, had three major results:



1. The creation of the International Monetary Fund, a multilateral institution designed to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty.



2. The creation of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which later became a part of the World Bank, a financial institution that offers loans to low and middle-income developing countries.



3. Countries involved agreed to peg their currency within 1% of the U.S. dollar, which would operate as the informal de facto world currency.



The final result was arguably the most contentious and most powerful. John Maynard Keynes, a prominent economist of the time and architect of the Bretton Woods Conference, wanted to make a world currency called ‘bancor’—a basket of several countries' currencies—as the de facto reserve[1], but U.S. representatives at the conference balked. The U.S. dollar was given its place as the post-war reserve.



To increase faith in the U.S. dollar and assuage criticisms and fears, the U.S. agreed separately to peg the dollar to gold at $35 an ounce. The world financial order was now predicated on dollars, which were in turn predicated on a backing of gold in U.S. government reserves. 



This system worked with minor adjustments for several years. In the 1960s during increased U.S. involvement in Vietnam and President Lyndon Johnson’s ambitious “Great Society,” the U.S. began leveraging its “exorbitant privilege” as the world’s reserve by expanding its monetary base without the proper gold reserves backing it up. In other words, the government printed U.S. dollar to fund its own programs without increasing its gold reserves. Economist Barry Eichengreen summed it up best, ""It costs only a few cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce a $100 bill, but other countries had to pony up $100 of actual goods in order to obtain one.”



Countries from all over the world began to grumble and feared a complete international economic collapse—a global run on U.S. gold reserves which would crumble confidence in the entire system and turn the world upside down. At the head of this anti-dollar movement was French President Charles de Gaulle. 



De Gaulle spent years criticizing the U.S. government for its reckless use of the dollar. He even sent military armadas to America to exchange France's dollars for gold. In a famous speech in February 1965, De Gaulle asserted the dollar’s position as the international reserve was predicated by lies. De Gaulle believed the USD had taken an unfair advantage in the international market. He expressed his irritation in the U.S.’s expanding monetary base without the gold back despite the their overt promise otherwise. He requested countries all over the world to follow France’s lead and cash in their dollars for gold, warning of the coming global economic meltdown.[2]



**Exorbitant privilege and Tether**



Rankled by De Gaulle and others, President Richard Nixon notoriously (and temporarily) ended the U.S. dollar’s convertibility to U.S. gold reserve in 1971. A few years later, this “Nixon Shock” was made permanent and the U.S. dollar has not been tied to gold since. With some growing pains, wild inflation and crafty diplomacy during the 1970s, the dollar remained the world’s majority reserve currency and enjoys that position to this day.



De Gaulle was proven wrong. Or, at least, not proven totally right. The world economy did not collapse. However, the U.S. dollar dug its foothold in an asymmetric financial system where the world must support ""American living standards and [subsidize] American multinationals.""[3]



What does this have to do with cryptocurrency?



Tether is one of over a thousand cryptocurrencies on the market right now. Its name is in reference to claims it is “tethered” to the U.S. dollar. One Tether is worth one dollar. Right now, according to https://coinmarketcap.com/†, Tether is trading at roughly $1, with very little fluctuations in value. Tether itself claims its price is derived from being fully backed by the dollar. For every tether “minted” or issued into the economy, Tether claims they hold one USD (or a traditional currency's equivalent value) in a bank account.[4] Moreover, many exchanges deal almost entirely in Tether when it comes to USD. Regulatory compliance to clear in USD is difficult, and several exchanges simply aren’t able to trade USD. To get around this issue, several exchanges have begun listing USD in customers wallet when in actuality it is dominated in Tether without informing the customer.[5]



This behavior by the exchanges and the assertion by Tether backing 1:1 to the dollar is what gives Tether its value.



Tether is impossible to buy with real USD. Wells Fargo once was in partnership with Tether as an intermediary for USD, but quickly backed out earlier this year.[6] Many people who find themselves holding Tether also find it difficult to exchange the currency straight to dollars. Tether does not appear to have direct convertibility to USD, despite claims it is backed by USD and maintains that liquidity.



One of the largest institutions that buys and provides its users Tether is Bitfinex. The relationship between Bitfinex and Tether is murky. According to documents made available by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (Panama and Paradise papers), the majority share holders of Tether, Inc. are also the founders of Bitfinex.[7] Tether and Binfinex deny any collusion or relationship. This is difficult to corroborate or contradict as Tether, Inc. is registered in the British Virgin Islands and there is no public record of their principals. 



Over the last month, Bitfinex and Tether have been publicly distancing themselves. Now OKEx is the largest exchange that deals in Tether. I’m not very familiar with OKEx and know little other than the company is based out of China. Interestingly, OKEx is dumping a lot of Tether into Nuls—another mysterious Chinese company—I can’t speculate on why, but it seems this behavior has driven Nuls to the 13th most voluminous coin despite its relatively small market cap.



**Tether’s role and root in the cryptocurrency market**



At the time of writing this paper, Tether’s market cap is roughly $1.18 billion. This means, according to Tether, Inc., there is a bank account with $1.18 billion USD. This liquidity is part of Tether’s value. Tether states they will have full public oversight and several audits of their books to confirm the liquidity , but has not conducted any substantial audits or provided any insight into where the money is or where it comes from.



In the last few days, Tether has “minted” $100,000,000 worth of Tether.[8] There is no way to buy or sell Tether in USD, therefore, this $100,000,000 must have come from a private donor/investor. The idea Tether is actually backed 1:1, as they claim it is “100%,” is dubious. 



Tether’s market cap puts it on any given day in the 20s to 30s rank of cryptocurrency. It’s not small, but it’s definitely not a major coin like Bitcoin, Ethereum or Ripple. For this reason, many people dismiss the theory that Tether is a fraud because even if it is, it’s a relatively small portion of the market. While this is true, Tether has been consistently in the top five of cryptocurrencies by volume. Over the last month alone, Tether made up roughly 6.15% of all transactions in the cryptocurrency market. This means that for every $16 real dollars transacted in the market, there is a fraudulent Tether dollar. This is massive and it’s only slated to take further root. In the last year, Tether’s market cap went from a little over $10 million to $1.18 billion. With no resistance, Tether will continue to grow.



Some analysis has been done to show Tether’s huge market cap growth actually offsets a large portion of mined Bitcoins.[9] Meaning, Tether’s growth has filled so much phony demand in the market it has inflated cryptocurrency values across the board. 



A sudden and abrupt drop in Tether’s value might take a sizable chunk out of the market and precipitate a crash. This isn’t an issue only for people holding Tether, this is a problem for everyone invested in crpytocurrency. This is wholesale theft of your money, right in front of your eyes. When Tether mints hundreds of millions in a few days, it pumps and dumps. They’re printing U.S. dollars, and even with a 50% overhead in fees or negative arbitrage, they’re netting millions under false claims. They are commingling their bad money with your good money for unfair profit.



**The Prisoner’s Dilemma and this Sand Castle**



The sentiment I'm presenting has all been repeated by others since the notorious Tether hack last month.[10] However, these concerns and criticisms have done little to Tether’s value. I can’t help but think of President De Gaulle’s horror as he watched the U.S. leverage its position in the international market for self gain.



This leads to my last point. Those who believe Tether poses no threat—despite its growing expansion as the base of cryptocurrency markets and fraudulent backing—must believe Tether’s value will remain even after the wool is pulled from our eyes. It has held for this long, so why wouldn't it continue?



There are rumors, since the hack in November, Tether and its alleged surreptitious partner company Bitfinex are now under federal investigation. If it is discovered Tether is fraudulently deriving its value from the USD and collusion, its collapse will go beyond MtGox proportions.



But even without any outside help, will this collapse happen organically within the market?



To illustrate how this might happen, I’ll use a modified Prisoner’s Dilemma game.



Imagine only two people own Tether. **Person A** owns 5 Tether with a value of $5 based on his belief Tether is backed by the dollar and his demand for the dollar. **Person B** also owns 5 Tether worth $5 for the same reason. Tether announces it has no backing in USD, the only way either party will get their money back is if the other agrees to buy the Tether. These are the possible outcomes:



* If **A** and **B** each try to dump their Tether, supply far outpaces demand and Tether is worthless. **A** and **B** lose everything 



* If **A** sells his Tether to **B**, **A** will maintain his full net worth of $5 and **B** will be left holding worthless Tether and vice versa. 



* If **A** and **B** decide to hold, they both keep their $5 value.



The best outcome for **A** and **B** is holding. However, if either **A** or **B** feel the other might sell their Tether, they’ll try to sell themselves, and thus diminish the value of Tether to 0. Moreover, if **A** and **B** do hold, they are explicitly giving Tether the power to mint more value while they must produce goods to obtain it.



The collapse of Tether will come on slowly, then all at once. The losers will be all of us.



**Conclusion and ways forward**



The first action everyone must to take is avoid all exchanges that use Tether. Unless it’s made clear we all do not condone the collusion exchanges and Tether are engaged in to prop up its value, Tether will continue to grow.

 

Unfortunately, I do not see an easy way to divest safely from Tether at this point. There is $1.18 billion on the ledger in Tether. This is money someone is going to be left to pay, and it won’t be Tether. It will be the entire market. If a plan isn’t put into place quickly, the market is going to take a hit.



For those who are still not convinced and would rather continue Tether’s fraud out of fear of crashing the market, you are explicitly giving Tether the exorbitant privilege the USD has today. The exorbitant privilege De Gaulle warned the world about. You are handing over control. You are allowing a single company to make gold. You are giving Tether the most powerful role any individual entity can have in a market, the ability to create value and demand. If you give them that power, they’ll use it. It will get worse before it gets better, and if something isn’t done sooner rather than later, the eventual fall will only be more precipitous.



Market correction might be unavoidable at this point, but this should be a learning experience. We are constantly told not to invest in crypto what we cannot afford to lose. This is a perfect example of why. Also, we must now be more vigilante about these types of predatory schemes, and continue to cultivate the cryptocurrency market in a fair and equitable way.

personalfinance,Consolidating debt question,"Hey everyone.

I am currently in about 10k (@ 20% interest) plus 4k (@ 22%) in credit card debt. I can take out a fidelity personal loan on my 401k at a 4.25% interest rate to consolidate this debt, which I'm currently planning on doing.

Even at minimum payments + interest fees, the automatic payments from my paycheck through the 10-14k loan would be less. I'm mainly concerned about the 10k card, where my minimum payment is $275, interest charge this month at $167. The monthly loan payments would be even lower than that minimum payment alone.

I'll be making some extra income next year, so one of my concerns is credit cards are easier to pay off early (not that I'd come close to actually paying it off next year). I know there are some fees associated with paying off loans early. But I can't imagine they'd compare to how much I'm paying in interest.

I was wondering if there are any other 'gotchas' I should be considering before I pull the trigger on this loan.

Thank you so much for your time.",finance

personalfinance,Wondering about FHA-Insured Loans for First-Time Home Buyers,"I've been doing a little bit of reading on FHA-insured loans for first-time home buyers, and wondering if anyone has positive/negative feelings about them, or, given my specific situation, any advice.

I'm in my early 30s, married, with a kid on the way. I'm in graduate school right now, but I have accepted a job offer that begins later next year. Our combined annual gross income once I'm working will be ~$250k. This time next year, I expect we'll have about $10k in savings. We'll be debt-free...EXCEPT for about $115k in federal student loans that I'll be paying back over 25 years. We live in a high-cost area, although it doesn't qualify as high-cost for the FHA loan. A 3bed, 2br house in a decent town costs about $650-800k. It seems that if we can put together around $50k, we can pay the 3.5% down payment plus up front mortgage insurance premiums and closing fees. That's way better than the $150-$175k we'd need for a 20% down payment.

Also, as far as the FHA mortgage insurance premiums, I didn't see any information about waiving that if you refinance the loan down the line. It seems like that should be how it works, but not sure.

Bitcoin,The Economics of the Current State of BTC,"(Tried to post but I think it got auto-mod deleted? Not sure why...?)


The goal of this post is not to convince you one way or another, but to start a discussion. Disclaimer: my “formal training” (aka academia) is in economics and psychology - a combination I thought could help get a full grasp on the world of finance and how markets work. Second disclaimer: I’m a huge proponent of the free market and a libertarian, go figure. I’m also blessed with a life that allows me to make some risky (although not fuck it yolo risky) moves, so I’ve got about a 20% exposure to crypto total, spread across A few, although weighted about 75% towards BTC.


Ok, now that all disclaimers are out of the way,  I want to create a dialogue about the economics behind Bitcoin. The goal is not to bicker about what “should” happen in an ideal world (I am a Libertarian, after all, so in my perfect utopia the answer *is* bitcoin, assuming the transaction issues get addressed), but to discuss the most probable outcomes.


- The Fed is never going to “allow” BTC to continue indefinitely unless the people at the top figure out how to get a slice. 


- Id say the same thing about the banks, but they seem to be on the path to figuring  it out.


- Money NEEDS TO BE SPENT and NOBODY IS GOING TO SPEND DEFLATIONARY MONEY AFTER A CERTAIN POINT. Why would you spend, in a continuous way (the way we swipe credit cards), an asset that by its very nature will only increase in value (In the RELATIVELY SHORT TERM compared to a retirement acct)


- People compare bitcoin to the stock market, but that is due to misunderstanding. Even comparing it to a forex market is faulty because there’s no one backing the faith of a bitcoin. I think most people underestimate just how catastrophic it would have been had the US govt not been able to step in during the subprime mortgage crisis - the backing of a government is a HUGE necessity when it comes to transfer of wealth and value, even though the individual will always side with the masses of “regular” people, believing, truly, that as long as enough regular people “decide” something has value, that it does.


- Expansion ^ the government and by proxy the Fed will always be the final decider of if something has value. All you need to do is understand the basic macroeconomic implications of the USD as the global reserve currency to understand why this is so. 


- I DO believe there is a place for bitcoin, but solely as a storage of value (at a much lesser valuation than it currently has, eventually) not as a currency. That being said, considering institutional money is largely at bay still, I think the climb continues.


- Expansion ^ if you think institutional investors are going to bet HEAVILY on a currency with 25-50% volatility you are not living in this reality - these people have jobs and lives they want to preserve too. They will wait - the introduction of the futures contracts was only step 1.


- Expansion ^ the lack of volatility (I.e. meteoric rises) will cause the public to lose interest and eventually the individual investor speculation money will move elsewhere to “get rich quick.” The current state (up to about 3 days ago) was the epitome of the hot hand fallacy. If it’s been rising it will keep rising. As we all know, this is not the case. Lots of people feel smarter than they are right now. Or did, until they started to get nervous.


- The age of social media has exacerbated the public’s perception of and reaction to FOMO in all aspects of life. Another contributing factor to why you have people who have never even considered opening a 401k dumping money into something meanwhile they couldn’t even give you a basic description of the investment vehicle’s underlying technology.


- Let me be clear: I don’t think Bitcoin going away. But not expecting a major correction/crash before it stabilizes at a much lower level than it sits at right now, and maybe SLOWLY building back up as big money gets involved, is naïve.


Like I said - trying to open a discussion about the economics of BTC today, not the ideology behind why it SHOULD or WILL or WILL NOT succeed for the greater good.  These are just meant to be some high level talking points. Really interested in COUNTER points more than anything...

personalfinance,22k in student debt. Budget is tight. Withdraw from Roth 401k + Savings to pay off student loans?,"So, I've been doing research on people's opinions about student loans and using retirement to pay for this.  My wife has 22k worth of debt.  She does not work as she is on FMLA for maternity leave.  We spend $550 a month on this loan, interest rate is 6%.  My retirement is worth about $16,000 as of this point and we have $16,000 in savings (still have medical bills to pay).  Thoughts on paying this damn loan so I can have more financial freedom?  My thought was to take that $550 after the loan is paid off and reinvest it into Roth IRA, which I already have and is worth about $1,500.  I understand the importance of saving and investing.

FYI I am 27 making about $34,000 per year with a wife and two kids.   Being 27, I feel like the gains made from 5-6 more years of crippling interest payments makes it worth it in the end.

""6.2: Monthly Payments for Amortization Period: Beginning on the first day of the month following the expiration of the Interest-Only Period, and continuing on the first day of each succeeding month thereafter, Borrower shall make a payment of principal to Lender (each a ""Payment Date"") in an amount (the ""Principal Payment Amount"") based on a 5% per annum interest rate and a twenty-five (25) year amortization schedule.

personalfinance,I need A LOT of help...,"I have been putting off posting here, so this situation has been going on for a while. It is now finally becoming a real problem and I need help. I'll break issues down by numbers for ease of reading.

Edit - For some reason its changing all of the numbers to 1?

----------

1. Budgeting

I have tried to do budgeting, but I have never found a good way of doing it. I never learned anything about budgeting, so what do you recommend for starting off?

----------

2. Student Loans

I currently have two kinds of loans out. One is a Federal loan through FedLoan. It is broken up into 5 different smaller loans, but I pay on the entire balance. The other loan was a private loan that is now owned by American Education Services.  I have tried consolidating them into one large loan, but have been unsuccessful. Out of desperation I tried switching both to ""Income-based"" repayments.  FedLoan allowed me to so now I pay $0 on it, which I know is not smart but I literally cannot afford it. AES rejected my request so I'm still paying that loan.

---------

3. 401k

I currently contribute about 6% of my check to a 401k. My employer matches up to 50%. Is the 6% okay? I don't know if I can afford to contribute anymore than what I am now. What can I do to maximize what I am getting into the 401k? Are there any other kind of investments I should be doing as well?

---------

4. Banks

I currently have a checking/savings account through Bank of America.  I want to switch to a credit union because I am sick off all the fees and problems I have had.  I am nervous to close out my account because of some horror stories that I have read. What is the best way to go about doing this? And does anyone have any recommendations on credit unions?

personalfinance,Student: Should I stop returning my unused loan money?,"I am a 22yr old student in the US currently attending a private dental school in New York City. I am taking out federal student loans for my tuition, but for the rest of my spendings (rent, food, subway passes, etc) my family has generously supported me. So at the beginning of each semester when my student loan stipend check comes in, I've been returning it back to the school -&gt; the DOE.

Recently I've been looking at student loan payment programs and stumbled upon the REPAYE Program. If I understand it correctly, I will have to pay 10% of my income for 20-25 years, and if there is a remaining balance, it will be ""forgiven"". (IE: taxed as income for that year) 

As it stands, by the time I get out I will have accrued 500k in debt from school, probably a little more from the accrued interest from the years I've been in school. An average dentist's salary in the US is 200k (rounded up). Therefore I would be paying (ballpark) 20k a year to my student loans. Multiply that by 20 years and you get 400k, which is less than 500k. (IE: making a difference of 100k+probably 300kish from compounded interest = 400k added to my income on 20th year)

So the question stands: Why am I returning the student loans I'm not using, when I'm likely not even going to pay for them? 100k added to my income in 20 years vs 150k added is not a huge difference) I'm asking because times have been getting hard and I'd really like to take on some of the responsibility. 

Edit 1: Tackling the debt head on isn’t really an option because my real goal when I get out of school is to start saving up to either buy/build a dental practice. 

Edit 2: I don’t think they would rescind the REPAYE program and screw everyone who is already signed up (since 2015) for it right now. But Yes, there may be a probability of them which would leave me with a whole bunch of debt and I understand that but for the sake of this conversation let’s just assume. Please. Thanks lol",finance

It doesn’t mean that btc isn’t going to work in the long run, it just means you are one of the original pioneers of this new frontier and to expect it to not have its near term draw backs is ridiculous. If you wanted to come on board when everything was running smooth then you wouldn’t have had the chance to enter at the price you entered at. 

This reminds me of two events that happened in my time day trading.  When google came out I had purchased it on ipo day for $90 a share and everyone was bashing that the P/E ratio didn’t sustain a $90 value.  I said fuck that google is the internet and held on.  When Facebook ipo’d I got in at $35 and it tanked to $15 and I kept buying more because I didn’t give a fuck what the talking heads were saying I based it on the idea that every human on earth is going to be connected by Facebook in some way and all that data they had was worth a shit ton. Even now people bash on Facebook about how it won’t be around or can’t grow anymore. Another one was Bank Of America after the housing crash, shit traded for almost $5 and people were worried that they would go under (despite the fact that the fed admitted they were too big to fail- meaning there’s no way they would collapse...) talking heads all went off about the danger etc etc.  

Point is if you keep doing what the crowd is doing then you can’t expect to be rewarded in the long run. How often do you hear that someone did real well in the stock market by following what the talking heads at Bloomberg or msnbc suggest? They go with whatever the general consensus is at that moment because they need viewership for ad dollars. They won’t report unpopular opinion because that won’t get the viewership.

That leaves me left over with $785. I'll need to get full coverage on a new vehicle, which will make insurance go from $95 to around $150. That leaves me at $730 a month left over. I currently have 1k in savings and plan on establishing a nest egg before making a purchase. As I won't be debt free until April, I don't plan on buying anything before August at the earliest.

My current car is a 2004 Toyota Corolla. I've driven it for 10 years too long. I'd like to purchase a new vehicle, not exceeding 22k after taxes and fees. Idealy I'd like to put down 30% upfront including my trade in value, which would be $6600. On a 48 month plan, assuming my interest rate is around 12%, that leaves me a car note of $359.33 a month.

Is this number too high for my finances? Looking at it is a little worrisome. I can afford it, but will I be gimping myself? What do you think is a resonable budget for a new vehicle. The last thing I want to do is go from being debt free to too much debt, but I really want to replace my current vehicle.

personalfinance,"Recently graduated college and started my career, I need a financial plan","I'll try to keep this as brief and to the point as possible. As the title mentions, I'm 24, graduated last May with a degree in Math and Computer Science and started a job in IT in late September. Although I have a job with a decent salary and reasonable living expenses, I have very very little savings as I basically started out of college with nothing (I had to spend most of my money on college), and I have a lot of student loans so I just want to make sure I have a good plan for my financial future so I can be well off and avoid the same struggles my parents have gone through their entire life.


To give you a basic idea of what my situation looks like right now, I'll give you some of the numbers I'm currently looking at.


Salary: $50,000

Regular Monthly Expenses(Rent, utilities, food, everything that's necessary): ~$1500

Savings: ~$1,000

Debt:

* Student Loans: ~$37,000

* Loan from family: ~$700 (To help me move)


Now I know that building up an emergency fund is probably the most important thing for me to focus on right now, so I've recently opened a high yield savings account and set up my direct deposit to put 8% (~$104) into that account. I plan on putting more than that into that account each month but this way I at least know SOMEthing is going into it without even thinking about it. Based on my expenses I figure I should go for about $9000-$10000 if I want to reach that 6 month recommendation.

After that though, is where things seem to get a little more complicated. Since I have a pretty big chunk of student loans, I'd always figured that it would probably be best to just pay that off ASAP, but after doing more research on investing and seeing the kinds of returns you can expect, I'm wondering if that is really the best option based on the interest rates I have on most of my loans.


Basically, about $7000 of my loans are at a higher rate of 6.8%, and the rest are 4.8% or lower; I'd say 4% average. I've read that with 401ks and IRA's, you can basically expect 6% returns, and with other stock investments you can expect 9-10% in the long run. Based on this information, it seems pretty obvious to me that I should focus on paying the 6.8% loans off ASAP, and then just make minimum payments on the rest while instead focusing my money on investments.


After a year of working at my company, I'll be eligible for our 401k. Based on what I heard from HR, my company contributes 3% regardless of what I contribute, but I could be wrong and this percentage is subject to change each year. However, this particular position wasn't really in the field I was looking to get into and I am planning on job searching again after a year or so. With my educational background, I was hoping to get into some sort of software development position. 


While I have completed a web development internship, I didn't have much luck while applying for full time positions. Thus, when I got the offer for this position, I felt like I didn't have much of a choice as the grace period for my loans was months away and I was running out of money. However, I do believe that taking this position did allow me easier access to a lot more of the opportunities I'm interested in, as I moved to NYC from a very small town for this job. I figure I would probably make more in a development position here but I'm not sure how much exactly I could expect.

Does this make sense or is there something I'm missing? I'm very new to the world of investing and personal finance but it's something I'm very interested in.",finance

investing,"Help Research Stock, Please Read, SoftBank","So Freaking sorry this is so long

Ok. Just a bit of back ground, you can totally skip this section. So I am a Dyslexic/ADD kid (I guess I am older now but this is always how I have identified). I am very fortunate to have finish college (and debt free). I work in the hospitality business. This is what I went to school for. On the side, I have been investing to get out of the income that I am. Typically, because of my dyslexia I don't look great or organized, so I have been killing as an employee, low key. I saved up enough money to move to NYC. I have saved another some on the side that I use to invest (I was staying at home so rent was free) Anyways, I have been kinda killing it in the investing game. I have averaged around 20% my first two years. This year I will be at 30% (50% of my funds are in cash so technically divide by two to get my total return. I really hope that hedge works out for me in the future) That's where I hit my question today:

Ok. So I have seen a few article in WSJ about SoftBank. The first one was an article about how SoftBank was going to by Uber at a 30%. REAALLLY COOL DUDE! Don't buy Uber stock, buy SoftBank that is (not completely) but more diversified and at a discount. Second article came from yesterdays (12/22) or the day before's news paper. SoftBank end up investing 120Mill into Lemonade inc. Its an insurance app for car and house. I have done my research on it, but what I assume is way lower employee cost, no need for a retail front, and very Freaking (but I don't mean freaking) scalable. Dude, if you figure how to integrate the different laws for different states........ MONEY MONEY MONEY :D. So typically I can use Value Line to Research stocks, but SoftBank is a Japanese stock and I couldn't find much there or basically any sites for numbers on the company. So that brings me to an e-mail that I wrote to my dad:

"" Attached is my schedule. I will forward this week's after this.

So I cannot find reliable number on this company. I was talking with a friend a few days ago cause she just took a job up here with a Japanese company here in NYC. She is working for a restaurant run by a solar company. Almost word for word what she said. So to my understanding the corporate structure is completely different.

As far as I know, SoftBank is a telecommunication company that also is a venture capital company (I call it this because VCs are having to raise more money to compete with bids by SoftBank). I was reading that it was an early investor in Alibaba investing 20million and recently selling it for billions (that's a b at the beginning 😂👍) I'm getting this from a wiki article history section. The company have been selling alot of their old investments and seems to be making investments right and left(scattered news article should be screen shots attached). This made me skeptical cause I thought it was ego until I read this: On December 6, 2016, after meeting with US President-elect Donald Trump, chief executive Masayoshi Son announced SoftBank will be investing US$50 billion in the United States toward businesses creating 50,000 new US jobs. seems With the new tax bill passing this may be the green light for this company. I know my FedEx went through the roof cause of it.

I know I don't have much in a factual numerical basis but I am really liking this company. If you have a second you should go read the history section on Wikipedia.

Love you David

personalfinance,Suggestions to refinance my auto loan?,"I'm currently searching for options to refinance my auto loan and was wondering if anyone here has any experience/cautionary tales about doing so

I currently have my car loan through State Farm Bank at 11%. I realize this is very high, but when I bought the car, not many lenders would offer me any better for the small loan I was needing. My credit was also quite a bit lower then, it's now repaired.

My monthly payment is currently $125, and I am paid 7 months ahead on it, so that's a nice safety net to have. I have a remaining balance of $3721.29, with $1.16/day interest. Obviously this is crazy high and just at the amount I'm at now, I'll be paying nearly an extra $900 by the end of the loan. 

I have a credit score of 718. 

All that said, to be honest I don't even understand how refinancing works. Would I essentially be getting a loan from a new company at a lower interest rate, and State Farm would just let go of the debt? Why would State Farm do this? 

Are there any companies you recommend to do this with? Specifically ones that have mobile apps with great interfaces that make it easy to schedule payments and check my balance. 

I'm only just now beginning to get the personal finance side of my life under control after years of being a total deviant doing super sketchy shit with little regard for the consequences. Any help or advice you can offer is greatly appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Bank lost $100. Where did it go?,"Hello r/personal finance,

Let me begin by saying that there are two banks involved in this fiasco.  Lockheed Community Credit union and Fidelity.

About 2 months I made a new bank account at Lockheed.  This was to remove a joint member from the account.  My cards and current balance just transferred over to the new account and everything was the same but the account number.

An automatic transfer template to send money from Fidelity to Lockheed on a monthly basis failed because I forget to update it with the new account information.  Two $50 transfers failed because I mistakenly sent them to the old Lockheed account.  Fidelity immediately sent me messages saying that the transfer failed and would be returned to my Fidelity account.

I fixed the transfer template and everything worked fine.  However, the two $50 transfers to the old cancelled account were never refunded to my fidelity account.

Despite receiving two automatically generated messages from fidelity saying that the money was returned, it was never returned.  Lockheed says they gave the money back.  Fidelity says it was never returned by Lockheed.  Both banks tell me to talk to the other one to solve my problem.

Lockheed was not very helpful until I threatened to report them to the Federal Reserve, then they were able to provide me with type 99 forms detailing when and how the 2 $50 transfers were returned to Fidelity.  They both appear to have transferred back to Fidelity the day after the transfers failed.

I have printed and discussed the type 99 forms from Lockheed with the manager at my local Fidelity branch.  He affirmed that the money never popped back up in my account and he commented that the situation was strange and that he would look into it and call me back.   That was 2 weeks ago.

This has been going on for too long.  Both banks are telling me it's the other's fault and don't want to work with me unless I threaten them or show up in person.  Meanwhile I am out $100 and I don't know how it was lost.

What do now?",finance

 Alot of things are going on in my life, not sure where to start or vent or if this is proper. The school per year is around 20k in total god willing i will graduate in 2.5 years so depending in the credits it'll be around between 45k-50k when all said and done.

CryptoCurrency,It is actually time to stop using Coinbase.,"Our conscious decision as a community to keep playing into their unethical business practices, which fule a marketplace that preys on new investors and ties them into a system that creates value for the central company while actively manipulating both bitcoin and the altcoin market on a global level. This is completely against what Satoshi envisioned and would be investigated on a federal level if not for the current unregulated nature of this industry,

Shady business practices such as suspension of service during large swings, unannounced token launches (taken advantage of by employees) and overall absurd transaction fees/ markup on current open market value, make this a trap for those who have not been in this game long enough to know better than to use the service.

The growth of equitable crypto, open markets, decentralization etc should not be an unregulated moneymaking scheme for a largely monopolistic company. The idea was to create a P2P payment system that operated separately from this type of centralized corruption.

it is times like these where we see massive movement in the overall crypto world that we must revisit why we work in, invest in and believe in this space. Reflecting upon this today I realized that crypto can do so much more good for the world than what this company stands for.

CryptoCurrency,I slept well last night,"I've been in the stock market for a little over a decade. Technically I was part of the 2008 crash, but I only had a couple years' worth of 401k investments, so I didn't care too much. Over the years, I've gotten more and more into the ""buy and hold low fee index funds"" mindset, so HODLing is nothing new, but I haven't really been emotionally invested in a crash.

When I joined crypto just a few short months ago, I started to wonder how I'd react in a crash. I've actually had a couple restless nights at various points when stuff I had rocketed upwards. I had no idea last night if that was just the start of a crash (and really, nobody does yet), but I have to say, I slept like a rock. No worries at all.

I woke up this morning, fed the cats, looked at the market, literally laughed out loud, then continued about my day. I'm not going to start issuing ""buy the dip"" memes or anything, but for now, I'm content to sit and just watch how this unfolds. Will I feel differently if it drops another 90% and stays there for the next year or two? Who knows? I certainly don't. I'll be interested to see how I react if it does happen. Whatever happens, hopefully it'll be good training for the next stock market crash.

personalfinance,I have a question that I could not get studentloansgov or even my lender to answer. Can someone please tell me if I have a solid plan here?,"Ok I am doing my best to plan my repayment on student loans when I graduate. I would like some clarification on a few things. Thank you for the consideration. I am basically trying to calculate how much of the interest that I pay will be deductible. I found that I can deduct up to $2,500.... Good! .. Next I take my collective debt, $117,000 at 5% (roughly)... 5% is $5858, I am assuming this is the correct calculation for the interest. So my thought is now that if I pay $5858 a year towards my loan that It will will deducted. If I pay an addition $5858, the federal deduction will basically match my payment. The loan would be paid down by $11,716 ($976/month) but I would actually only be paying $5858. This seems like the most efficient way to pay my loans off. I would be most productively using the deduction and could then put my additional (if any) savings into a 401k or something of that kind. According to my math I would pay my loans off in 10 years using this plan. Does this sound right, or could I do it another way? I am planning on going at this fairly aggressively but will only have a starting salary of 35,000-40,000. Thanks

Edit} After reviewing my post and a few comments I realized that I screwed that math up! Oops! I was suggesting that I pay 11,716k per year.. which is very similar to the standard student loan payment of 1,100 per month.

personalfinance,Looking for advice: paying off students loans vs save for house down payment,"I am looking for some advice on if it’s a better idea to put extra into my house savings fund to have the largest down payment possible, or start paying some extra on my student loans.  My goal is to have 20% set aside for house. If I can make it work would like to purchase by end of next year. I am willing to wait if it makes more sense. I am 32 years old and live at home and I really need to get my own place. I would be looking at houses around 150k. I never had a budget until 2017 and ever since then has been so much easier to track spending and put away for savings – wish I would have started sooner!  

Monthly take home is $2850. I put $1050 towards house fund, $150 to emergency, $150 to other savings. Student loan minimum is $590 a month (I usually pay $640). Rest goes to bills and extra goes back into savings. My take home used to be $2600 but I recently got a raise and put less into my HSA account so I have to adjust my budget as I should be able to save another $200/month.  I made an extra $4,000 this year doing some side jobs which all went into savings.  I plan on doing the same thing next couple years but don’t want to rely on it as guaranteed money. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Current:**  
House fund: $16,000   (Goal is $30,000)  
Emergency fund: $4,000    (Goal is $10,000) 

&amp;nbsp;

Here is my student loan breakdown. I am listing the minimum monthly requirements.  $41,290 remaining

&amp;nbsp;

**Loan 1:** $1,124 – 5.6% interest. $50/month


Any extra paid per month will roll over to next month. Only option would be lump sum payoff. Paying this off would free up $50 a month, but interest is very minimal per year.

&amp;nbsp;

**Loan 2:** $11,796 – 4.98%. $100/month

I considered paying around $2,000 now and then increasing payment to $150-$200 a month to save a lot in the long run. This loan costs the most interest over time if I continue to only pay minimum. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Loan 3:** $14,802 – 3.5%. $267/month

&amp;nbsp;

**Loan 4:** $13,568. $169/month. Consolidated Loans through Fedloan
&amp;nbsp;

	$215 – $6.3%. $3/month
	$4,350 – 6.3%. $53/month
	$2,173 – 1.29%. $27/month
	$2,773 – 3.15%. $35/month
	$2,240 – 4.25%. $28/month
	$1,815 – 3.03%. $23/month   

If there is a better way or place to consolidate these and save money I would love to hear some advice. 


 I have crunched some numbers recently and could save a lot of money in the long run if I choose to pay some off and/or pay more per month. The trade off would be less going into house fund and this is where I get confused.  What is the smartest option? Short term? Long term?

personalfinance,Should I pay off my rental?,"Hello everyone!  To start off I know nothing when it comes to investing in stocks, bonds, ect.  I currently own a rental property.

personalfinance,Checking Investments and Priorities,"Hello all,

I've been lurking for a while and decided to make a post outlining my situation to see if there are any areas I could change or improve on.  I graduated in May and started work in June.  The end of the year seems like a good time to reflect and see what others can recommend.  I think I will include all necessary information, however, let me know if there's more info that is needed.

**Salary:** $68,000

**Savings Account:** $12,000

**Checking Account**: $1,200

**Roth 401k:** $8,717.71 (WF TRGT 2055 CIT E3, 20% of Salary, 4.5% Match Starts in June)

**Roth IRA:** $3,606.10 (American Funds Global Growth Portfolio Class F-1 PGGFX, $500/Month)

**Employee Stock Purchase Plan:** 1% of Salary

**Student Loans:**

Balance| Interest Rate
- | -
$3,738.06 | 3.76%
$5344.67 | 4.29%
$2,053.78 | 4.29%
$4,047.09 | 4.66%
$2,495.19 | 4.66%
$8,75.51 | 3.86%
$4,978.30  | 3.86%

This comes out to be roughly $23,000 @ 4%.  I'm paying the minimum balance ($250/month) since the rates are lower and would much prefer dumping money into my 401k and IRA.

I have been logging my expenses pretty closely and usually break even after all my contributions, loan payments, rent, utilities, entertainment money, etc.

I do make some side money every now and then.  I've been putting all of that in my savings until I hit 15K for my emergency fund (6 months of expenses plus a bit more).  I then want to bring my checking account's floor up a bit (~$2000).

In total my monthly minimums are $390.35, and if I can snowball the remainder of my budget (assuming I kept my food at an average of $375), I could pay off an extra $210.

My short term goals are to pay off the deferred interest credit cards, go back to school part-time for a finance degree, ask for a raise in March at my work, and move out. My long term goals are to pay off all my debts, have a one year salary in my 401k by the time I’m 30, with a six month emergency fund and a down payment on a house $50,000 for 20%.

stocks,2018 All Clear,"For people scared of a ""market crash"":

1) Yield curve (10 - 2) hasn't inverted yet, and when it does you still have 6-15 months before recession. 

2) Economic growth figures for 2017 look decent - even if growth slows, it should remain above 2% for at least the first half of 2018. 

3) Jerome Powell is a dove, and he'll be very cautious when it comes to rate hikes/QT. Speaking of central banks, the ECB and BOJ are printing money like there's no tomorrow - this should counteract the Fed's unwinding.

4) Jim Cramer is scaring people into hoarding cash. Do the opposite of what Cramer says and you'll be fine. 

Now that's said, it might be smart to diversify with international stocks because their central banks, unlike the Fed, are still printing money and inflating asset values.

altcoin,Why I went from IOTA enthusiast to wanting to sell and get out,"So I started out really keen to see IOTA succeed and loved the idea of a new technology to take on blockchain. Now however I am fed up and regret suggesting IOTA to 7 other people. I am cringing because I feel I have set them all on the wrong path.

I made the suggestion to get Ripple and IOTA. Ripple has been an absolute breeze while IOTA has been a nightmare.

I started off transferring 10 IOTA to my wallet and then sent over the rest (over 100) in a couple of batches. After restarting my wallet, the original 10 disappeared but the other 100 plus coins were there. I sent out a small number of these and then restarted my wallet.

After restarting the wallet, the original 10 coins were there but the others were gone. So I tried every single node but none restored my other coins. So then I tried the suggestion to generate and attach endless new addresses to the tangle. After over 20 attempts, I am no closer. I then tried to send 2 of my 10 coins out and they are pending for hours. I then tried sending some more coins and it says the address has already been used even though I have generated new addresses and attached to the tangle.

I don't know ifI will ever see my coins again. If I do, I'll send out those that I promised to friends and family and then I'll transfer the one I have left for myself to the exchange and sell them for whatever I can get for them. I want out.

This is basically a useless system, akin to linux, great for super techies who are happy to spend hours trying to retrieve coins that should be there, search the internet for novel ways to try save their coins, wait ages for their coins to arrive, require coins that did not arrive to be resent (that will really work in business /s), have to constantly generate new addresses to send from and even have to claim your coins back because they were effectively confiscated.

Take a step back and look at this from an ordinary persons perspective. this coin is horrible. It should not have been released yet given how poorly it performs. Is this coin ever going to actually work or is it always going to have these issues? Why the hell doesn't the client take care of all the processes to keep track of your coins, why is it so incredibly slow and what is being done to fix that.

Sorry but I feel like this is borderline a scam coin and should not be touched by anyone who understands that utility has to come first and the price is way off, this is not worth 2 cents to me n it's current state. It may never be worth anything.",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,The cryptobubble is a symptom of more,"The following article was written by Olav Dirkmaat, professor of economics at the University of Francisco Marroquín in Guatemala, and translator of the masterpiece Human Action by Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises in Dutch ('Human action'). He previously worked at both GoldRepublic and Nxchange. He is also a PhD candidate in economics at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Spain. 

I would like to share these thoughts with the community. Not because I believe in them, but because there are some good arguments in the article and I think other viewing points to crypto will in the end make crypto win. 

What are your thoughts about the article? (If you liked the discussion or the article, please vote me up. If you disliked the article, but think discussing crypto is a good thing, don't vote me down :P)

-----------------------------------------------------------

When there is an (artificial) economic expansion, driven by cheap credit and too low interest rates, we know that sooner or later things will go wrong. What we do not know is exactly how it goes wrong. We only know that - at artificially low interest rates - some ill investments are made in certain sectors. In the 1990s, it was (starting) internet companies, domain names and the NASDAQ. In the run-up to the 2008 crisis, it was predominantly house prices, (amateur) property speculators and mortgage lenders. And this time? Where do bubbles form?

We have previously discussed how - thanks to artificially low interest rates - equities are again overvalued, mainly technology companies. But also the recent craziness in the crypto coins can not be overlooked. In a few months Bitcoin rose to a record high of almost $ 20,000 dollars. Many crypto investors seemed to become dormant rich; even gold investors began to doubt why they were investing in precious metal and not the crypto-mired mists. While (in the 90s) some amateur speculators in domain names became very quickly very rich, this time amateur speculators get rich in crypto coins. Just like domain names then, crypto coins are now - unfortunately - the victims of speculative excesses.

Do you still doubt if crypto coins are in a bubble? Take the Dell share. Dell is a company that I invested in just before the acquisition by Michael Dell himself (and accomplices). Dell is a technology company whose stock price first scored less than a dollar but within a short time frame reached a record high of nearly $ 55 dollars per share. During the dotcom bubble, Dell was one of the many internet companies that achieved a billion dollar valuation.

THE DELL SHARE PRICE INCREASED RAPIDLY DURING THE DOTCOM BUBBLE AND COLLAPSED AGAIN LATER. ALTHOUGH DELL CERTAINLY HAD FUNDAMENTAL VALUE, THE PRICE WAS MUCH TOO HIGH. SOURCE: YAHOO FINANCE

Why do I call Dell? Very simple. Dell was (and is) a valuable company with products, customers, distribution channels and revenues. But the price paid in 2000 for a Dell share was simply excessive. 

We must be very careful that we never mix price and value. And when we pay too much for something, even though it is valuable, it is not a sensible investment. Unfortunately, many crypto investors do not seem to have learned this ancient lesson.

I hope to have some credit with you. After all, I have been familiar with the crypto coins for years. Since 2013 I own a Bitcoin fraction and since 2014 I have nice amounts of Ripple (XRP). I still visited the cryptocongresses when only nerds and libertarians visited them, and men in suits were still absent. I will certainly not become the next Bitcoin millionaire, but I am more than familiar with the opportunities and limitations of this new technology. I even had the chance to spend time this year with Nick Szabo, a crypto veteran who already invented the forerunner of Bitcoin in 1998.

Although I am a fan of this technological revolution, I warn of a bubble. A bubble that even harms Bitcoin does not help. Bitcoin does not benefit from the current mania. And according to my conviction, even the biggest Bitcoin defender can not but admit that there is an enormous crypto soap bubble. 

The most important quality of money is that it is a unit of account (a ""unit of account"" in English). And Bitcoin's current popularity is aggravating volatility rather than reducing volatility. Less volatility means a more stable unit of account. Note: the problem is not that there is ""deflation"" because the Bitcoin appreciates (rises in price). There is nothing wrong with that. Prices can adapt perfectly to a rising currency. Just like prices nowadays - as a rule - adapt perfectly to a falling currency (central banks aim at at least two percent annual inflation which eats away the purchasing power of our money). The problem is that the price of a Bitcoin is far too unstable to ever be money or a unit of account. The following joke shows immediately what the problem is:

FREELY TRANSLATED: A SON ASKS ONE BITCOIN FOR HIS BIRTHDAY TO HIS IN-BITCOIN-INVESTING FATHER. HIS FATHER IS OUTRAGED: WHAT ?! $ 15,554 ??? $ 14.354 IS A LOT OF MONEY! WHAT DO YOU NEED $ 16,782 FOR?

We are talking about day volatility here. The bitcoin price can increase or decrease by ten to twenty percent in question, something that would be exceptional in the precious metal market, for example in the case of the gold price. The current speculation and buying drive of a larger, largely ignorant public - only makes the bitcoin price more unstable. The volatility is getting worse, not better. The question is whether the introduction of forward contracts (futures) can change this. Last weeks, bitcoinfutures were introduced on both the CME and the Cboe. According to the theory, a forward market reduces price volatility, but it remains to be seen who has the stomach to resist the volatility of bitcoin prices. If we currently look at the liquidity on these bitcoin futures markets and the number of contracts traded, then the conclusion is that these futures markets (unlike other raw materials) will not solve Bitcoin's volatility problem.

Some Bitcoin supporters, however, still believe that Bitcoin is not a bubble. They want to silence ""doom-thinkers"".
The Bitcoin has, according to them, absolute value in a world full of fiat money. Admittedly, our current financial system is very fragile and has enough problems. But that does not mean that Bitcoin is valuable. Bitcoin has the problem that it is too volatile to actually serve as a currency or an effective means of exchange. This does not matter in some contexts (take Venezuela, where capital controls are a reality and the currency, the Venezuelan Bolivar, is as unstable as Bitcoin itself), but in the context of developed countries such as the Netherlands or the United States, it does. Moreover, Bitcoin seems to be losing its own success, given the enormous waiting times and the huge transaction costs (lastly, a Bitcoin transaction cost about thirty dollars).

And who is currently buying Bitcoin to use it as money? The answer is: nobody. There are only investors who buy it in the hope of selling it later (and the term is getting shorter and shorter). The only ""real"" transaction that takes place are investors who have already made a good profit and want to ""cash out"" a part by exchanging these for gold, goods or real estate. Okay, nobody is perhaps exaggerated: there is a limited group of Chinese (and Venezuelans / Nigerians) who want to circumvent capital controls in their countries and find a way to get money out of the country. But that is really not enough for the current price of well over $ 10,000.

Then there is the argument that the question will first be speculative, with the origin of investors hoping to earn a profit by buying Bitcoin well before that moment. This question would ""stabilize"" the price and reduce volatility over time. However, the evidence seems to point the other way at the moment. Even though the current Bitcoin price would be justified by fundamentals, there is still a cryptobubble. But even then, if we accept the above arguments for the sake of simplicity and pretend that Bitcoin already has a lot of fundamental value (that is, it is used as a means of exchange), even the biggest Bitcoin defenders have to admit that there is a cryptobubble.

Why? The reason is simple. Bitcoin is not the only crypto coin. And that while there is a strong ""winner takes all"" effect in the money industry. A coin has value because many people want it and actually use it. A dominant currency therefore quickly has a large market share. Take for example the dollar and the euro, the two largest coins in the world, also the most liquid coins in the world. But the same principle also applies in cryptoland. We can never use five hundred different coins; no fiat coins nor crypto coins.

So how can someone explain that there are more than a hundred cryptocurrences with a valuation of more than one hundred million dollars? And how can it be explained that there are more than five hundred crypto coins with a valuation of one million or more? If Bitcoin really were so valuable, and there is no question of a cryptobubble, then the Bitcoin price would be followed by at most some complementary coins (Ether, Ripple?), But certainly not by hundreds of other competing crypto coins. Let alone that these, predominantly worthless, crypto coins earn millions valuations. In other words, if someone wants to dismiss a cryptobubble by stating that the current Bitcoin price is justified by the fundamental value and usefulness of Bitcoin, then surely that does not apply to the 500+ other crypto coins?

The cryptobubble can not be denied. This is one for the history books. This chapter in monetary history will probably go down in the books as the cryptobubble. At the next crisis, investors will enter the boat again. Make sure you do not let yourself be led by the issues of the day. As a gold investor, do not be fooled by friends and family who seem to double their money every week. Patience pays off, as always, on the stock market. It is about the long term, not the short term. And gambling is not investing.

The cryptobubble is accompanied by a huge bubble elsewhere: mainly the stock market and large parts of the bond market. The current zero interest rates are destroying markets. And as I said earlier, we do not know in advance where the soap bubbles form, just that bubbles form. But now we know that one of those soap bubbles is the cryptobubble.",cryptocurrency

I’m a very debt-averse person and try to be debt free.

investing,Taking a punt on Fortress Paper Debt (x-post),"Fortress paper is one of those business which should be slam dunks. You know the ones, long term customer orders, producing something integral to the world economy and irreplaceable in the short term.

Fortress had 2 business lines:

1. *Currency Paper*: They produced special secure paper that has been very popular with reserve banks around the world. They have supplied Kazakhistan with their currency needs for years and most they are the ones producing for the new Swiss Franc notes. This is a business hard to get into and very easy to maintain as it depends on experience and the buyers are low risk

2. *Dissolved Pulp*: This is the business of producing synthetic fibre for clothes. Viscose in particular. Again, massive demand which is growing but FTP is based in Canada and much of the world's production and consumption occurs in SE &amp; E Asia. 

I say **had** because they just sold their currency division to the Swiss national bank. They did it after a large customer delayed/cancelled an order which was 17% of total 2018 production. Not normally an issue for most businesses but FTP has had some really bad management in the past and has a lot of debt that needs servicing. 

That's where I am.

I own FTP convertible debt ([2019 notes](https://web.tmxmoney.com/quote.php?qm_symbol=ftp.db.a) specifically). This is the second time I have held FTP debt with the first being 2 years ago. Then as now, the company faced a financial hurdle that seemed insurmountable. Then as now, the company entered a sale-leaseback contract on the very same mill they just sold and used the cash to extinguish their debt.

This sale generates C$29 Million in proceeds. There is $6.2 Million of currency division debt that goes away with this deal. That leaves a total of [C$204 Million in debt](http://financials.morningstar.com/balance-sheet/bs.html?t=FTP&amp;region=can&amp;culture=en-US) of which $150 Million has a maturity over 10 years. 

That means the only large debt owed by the company in the short run is the convertible note of $62 million (of which I own some) carrying a 7% interest rate. With this sale, the company could extinguish that entire debt as soon as the sale completes. 

The risk is that this is an unsecured note and the company has the option to repay the debt in common shares but will require approval from &gt;75% of the owners of that debt. This risk can be mitigated by going short on the common shares and long the debt.

Going forward though, the company is essentially a dissolved pulp business with $150M to $170M in annual revenue and EBITDA margins of 11% and pre-tax margins (x. D&amp;A) of ~8% and interest coverage of 1.56x. 

The convertibles trade at [89% of par value](https://web.tmxmoney.com/quote.php?qm_symbol=ftp.db.a), pay a 7% coupon and mature in &lt;2 years. That's a 17% CAGR if redeemed in 2019 and about that much if redeemed next year.. It would also cut their interest costs by 37% giving significant incentive to redeem early.

I think this is worth a punt

edit: just to add that the day they announced the sale of the currency division, the convertibles saw more than 600,000 notes change hands for an aggregate daily trade value just north of C$54 Million, i.e. almost the entire outstanding stock of notes changed hands (~84% of that volume came in a single trade!) That is the largest single day volume for the issue in about 3 years and the second highest since it's issue. A lot of money flowed into the convertibles that day, of course an equal amount went out as well, but I take this as a positive signal.",finance

personalfinance,"Messed up taxes, getting wage garnished by Cali FTB if I don't pay full amount. Need advice.","To make a long story short: I fucked up and forgot to pay my taxes. 

I got a notice of wage garnishment and am looking at losing ~$300 a paycheck for about 2 pay periods. I owed ~$230 to the state and didn't have it at the time and ended up forgetting about it. Now thanks to their $270 ""Collection Fee"" the total amount owed if ~$600.

I don't remember getting any other notices from them. I called and was told that it is too late to get on a payment plan and that my options are:

1. Have my wages garnished. 
2. Pay amount in full and them call back with the confirmation once it is processed. However if this takes too long they may still garnish my wages. 

I don't have the $600 so my only realistic option would be using a credit card. That said I really don't want to use a CC for this due to the interest rate. 

**My main question is this:**

* Is there any negative consequences to my wages being garnished other than the social stigma and the loss of income during the garnishment period? Will it hurt my credit or have any other long lasting effects? 

If not I am tempted to just let them garnish and tighten my belt for a month or two. 

**My next question is this:**

* Is there any real chance or getting the collection fee reduced or waived? I was told my only option was to write a letter to them and pray. 

I get that I messed up and I get that they need to cover the expense of collecting but $270 seems excessive when they are already charging interest and a late fee. It feels like extorsion to be honest, especially since the fee is more than what I owed in taxes!

Any advice would be appreciated,

Thank you for your time.",finance

personalfinance,Need help understanding bank fees,"I'm thinking of switching from Capital One 360 to Alliant Credit Union, in part because of the higher interest rates on the checking and savings accounts (I'd also like a physical branch and better customer service).

The problem is that I'm very fee shy, and Alliant's long [fee schedule](http://www.alliantcreditunion.org/fees) is intimidating next to 360's ""fee-free"" accounts.

I'm trying to understand Alliant's fees, so I can tell what's likely to impact me, but I can't find good explanations for some things.

In particular:

* Sight Draft Deposit Fee (per item) - $25:
The only definition I can find seems to be that a ""sight draft"" is any instrument I can present and have converted into cash. That sounds to me like it includes checks and savings bonds. Does this mean I'll have to pay $25 for each check or savings bond I cash? Because it seems absurd that anyone would charge a fee for that at all, much less one as high as $25. I hope I'm misunderstanding this.

* Return Deposit Item - $15:
As far as I can tell, this means that if someone pays me with a check, and that check bounces when I try to deposit it, or if it goes though temporarily but then gets yanked back for some reason, I will be charged $15. I hope this is not the case because charging me for someone else's screw up is unconscionable, and an instant deal breaker.

* Manually Paid Checks and ACH Items - $5:
I don't understand this at all. What exactly does it mean to ""manually"" pay a check or ACH item? Doesn't the money just get taken from your account automatically when someone deposits a check or pulls cash from the account via ACH?",finance

personalfinance,Investment returns on different ways to use RESPs: Canada Registered Education Savings Plans. Hope this helps someone.,"The body of the blog post is pasted below, but last I checked I can't link a google sheet in this forum.

[The full, illustrated post is here.](http://alejandroerickson.com/j/2017/12/23/what-i-learnt-about-canada-registered-education-savings-plans.html)  Selling tax advice is not my job, and I don't sell advertising space on my blog.  It's just a personal project that I think will help some, but not all, other parents.

Canada offers a registered account to incentivise people to invest in their childrens' education. It's a bit complicated and most blogs and news articles I found only offer this very basic advice: ""take advantage of the free money"". It's not that bloody simple though.

**Anything and everything in my blog post could be factually incorrect. Please verify any information you get here with other, more reliable sources.** If you see a problem please let me know in the comments.

At a basic level the RESP works as follows: You incrementally add after-tax money to an account, to a maximum of $50,000.00, and the Government matches your yearly contributions with 20% each year, to a maximum of $7,200.00. You invest this money aggressively early on, and less aggressively later, while it is sheltered from taxes.  When the beneficiary, usually our child, attends a post-secondary they take can receive money from the *gains* made by the investment, as well as from the *grant* itself, and pay tax on the money as if it were the beneficiary's income.

[The details, provided by the Canada Revenue Agency](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/registered-education-savings-plans-resps.html), get complicated though, which makes it hard to answer a number of questions without breaking out the spreadsheets.

  * How big will the investment be, after tax, if the beneficiary does not use the money?
  * If you have $50,000 when you open the account, should you dump it all into the RESP, or take advantage of the grant and make several payments over several years?
  
These questions pertain to how the money is paid out, so let me define those
ways. An
*[EAP](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/registered-education-savings-plans-resps/payments-resp/educational-assistance-payments-eaps.html)*
is a payment from the gains on the whole investment (grants and gains) made to
the beneficiary who is enrolled in a *qualifying educational program*. 
**EAPs are taxed as the beneficiary's income**.

An
*[AIP](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/registered-education-savings-plans-resps/payments-resp/accumulated-income-payments-aips.html)*
is a payment from the gains *on the contributions* to the subscribers (who
originally made the contributions). Grant money cannot be paid to the
subscribers, and it is lost if the beneficiary does not use it. The original
contributions were made by subscribers with their after-tax money can be paid
out without additional taxation. **AIPs are taxed as the subscriber's income
plus 20%** (12% in Quebec).

Obviously there could be a significant difference in taxation between EAPs and
AIPs, so you need to consider the chance that AIPs will be paid out instead of
EAPs, and how much that will cost you. An additional, hidden cost, is that in a
normal taxable account, capital gains and dividends are taxed at a lower rate
than regular income. Let me illustrate this with a simplified example. 

Let's say you invest $10,000.00 for 10 years and it grows to $15,000.00. You
sell the investment in year 10 and declare $5000.00 in capital gains. Suppose further that
your combined federal and provincial income tax marginal rate is 32% and your
capital gains are taxed at 16%. Your beneficiary's income tax marginal rate is 21%.

  1. If the $5,000.00 gains are paid as EAPs, the beneficiary pays $1,050.00 in tax.
  2. If the $5,000.00 gains are paid as AIPs, the subscriber pays $2,600.00 in tax.
  3. If the $5,000.00 gains are paid as capital gains, the account holder pays $800.00.

The 20% penalty against AIPs is huge, of course, but the difference between
investing in a taxable account and getting EAPs is more subtle. Many investments
pay dividends, which are taxed a bit more heavily than the capital gains
mentioned in (3), plus the RESP account in (1) may have accumulated some
additional grant money. Let's consider that situation. Suppose the RESP also
earned the full 20% grant on the $10,000.00 in contributions, and that the
investment included some dividends that were taxed at 25%. Again, we are simplifying things.

  1. There are $5,000.00 gains and $2,000.00 in grants to be paid as EAPs. **The beneficiary receives $5,530.00** and pays $1,470.00 in tax.
  2. If the $5,000.00 gains are paid as AIPs, **the subscriber receives $2,400.00** and pays $2,600.00 in tax.
  3. If the $4,000.00 gains are paid as capital gains and $1,000.00 are paid as dividends, **the account holder receives $4,120.00** and pays $880.00 in tax.
     
As expected, the AIP payments remain the same, but the EAPs now yield a 34%
improvement on the gains in a normal taxable account. Of course, this is still a
bit too simple. Firstly, the $10,000 cannot be contributed to the RESP all at
once if the $2,000.00 in grants are to be obtained. That means that for some of
the time, that original $10,000.00 sits in a taxable account. Secondly, only up
to $36,000.00 of the RESP benefits from a 20% grant, because of the $7,200.00
limit on the total grant, so we can't apply the same logic to a $50,000.00 RESP
account.

We are considering three ways of investing $50,000.00.

  1. Contribute the $50,000.00 to the RESP and get a $500.00 grant.
  2. Split the $50,000.00 over the RESP and a taxable account, and gradually move the money to the RESP to maximize the $7,200.00 grant.
  3. Put the $50,000.00 in a taxable account.
  
And we are considering three ways the investment growth and grants can be taxed.

  1. Grants and investment growth are paid out as EAPs, taxed as the beneficiary's income.
  2. Grants are lost, but investment growth is paid out as AIPs (**after the beneficiary turns 21**), taxed as the subscriber's income.
  3. There are no grants, and the investments can be paid out any time, taxed as investment growth (capital gains, dividends, interest, etc).
  
We don't know in advance whether we'll have EAPs and not AIPs, so we factor the
likelihood into our assumptions. We need to make a bunch of assumptions, in fact
so let's make them.

Assumptions:
 - 6% growth (mostly stocks) for 10 years, then tapering off to 3% (mostly bonds) for the final years.
 - The money is tallied when the child is 21, the earliest year AIPs can be paid. Realistically the EAPs will be paid earlier.
 - The subscriber's family income is over 90k (if not, the grant gets paid a bit more aggressively).
 - Subscriber marginal rate is 32%.
 - Beneficiary marginal rate is 21%.
 - Avg investment tax is 20%.
 - Likelihood that EAPs are NOT needed is 20% (child gets scholarships, dies, drops out of school, whatever).
 
 The first 6 bars plot the investment proceeds that would be paid out as AIPs,
 or as EAPs combined with whatever non RESP money exists in each investment
 method, after tax. The last three bars plot the expected value of the
 investments based on our assumptions above. The assumptions can be changed in
 the spreadsheet.
 
**[The Bar Chart](http://alejandroerickson.com/j//images/resp.png)**
 

Remarks: The definition of qualifying educational program is fairly broad and
inclusive, so if the beneficiary is alive, half-serious about any sort of
educational program and doesn't have a scholarship, they will probably use the
grant. Note also that some of the provinces offer an additional grant. For
example BC offers another $1,200.00 or so when the Child turns 6.

personalfinance,Figuring out budget for next year as a college student.,"Hey everyone, there's so much information out there that sometimes, when starting out, it can either be confusing or makes you wonder if you're doing it relatively right. So, a bit about me: I am a 20M going to school in the US. Tuition is paid for by my scholarship, and I currently live at home, so luckily, I do not have to pay any rent or big bills. 

Next year, I will start working part-time while going to school, making roughly about $1500/month post tax. The company has provided me with housing with utilities, and so I only will have to take care of what I eat and how I handle the rest of the money. 

I am trying to build a monthly budget around this and think it will be great practice for me to learn how to handle money.

Currently I have:

4k emergency savings (not sure if that is too small, or enough)

Maxed IRA for 2017.

With the 1500 monthly, I split it up as such:

460 IRA

300 Build savings/emergency fund

500 Groceries/Restaurants

200 Fun Stuff

Does this sound reasonable, or like a good idea? At first, I was panicking at the groceries budget, thinking it wasn't enough, until I asked my friends who went away for college what their food budget is like and that calmed me down. Is there anything else I should keep in mind, or budget towards?

Another question along these lines are which types of accounts I should have open. Before the emergency money used to be in a regular savings, but i realized I should take advantage of the higher interest rate of discover/amex/ally and opened up an account today and moved some money over there. Is this a bad choice?

Thanks for all your help!

Who Do I Mail My Objection Federal Student Loan Garnishment Form To?,"I know there's an option to object (temporarily) from wage garnishment if you have been at your current job for less than 12 months. I've only been at my job for 6 months. And before that I was involuntarily unemployed for 4 months after having temps jobs for almost 2 years to pay bills. And I took a month of unemployment right before I was at my current job. I've looked online for whom to send wage garnishments objections to &amp; what to send. Some sites say to send to the guarantor, others lender, some say send to dept of ed, and others say the collector.

I received a wage garnishment notice from at first glance USA Funds about an defaulted federal student loan. But the address is coming from ACT (Account Control Technology) I know they are contacted collection agency, but the letterhead is confusing. There is a USA Funds Logo in the letterhead but within the letter all they ask for is me to send all info to ACT's address ATTN: Wage Garnishment Unit. The entire notice looks suspect so I couldn't tell if it was genuine. Because according to my NSLDS sites it's through USA FUNDS INC. But I think it is real and not a scare tactic. So I'm doing this in writing because I don't trust over the phone. 

Here's where it get tricky for me: If I go by my info on NSLDS (and studentloans/studentaid.ed.gov) it says that my loans are currently w/ USA FUNDS. But when I go to the site it says they were bought by Strada. And if I go to Strada, it says all student loan default accounts are now with Great Lakes. I'm not sure if most people know this is a thing. I can provide links if needed to prove this.

Because I know this is a long process, so I don't want to send my letter to the wrong person only to start all over again. So this is where I ask for help; Who do I send my objection letter to? ACT the collection agency? Dept of ED? USA Funds? Great Lakes? I know this is just a band-aid. But it will help me get prepared when I set up a payment plan to get out of default later.

**TL;DR: Who do I send my wage garnishment objection letter to? The collection agency who sent the letter? Dept of ED? The guarantor USA Funds? Great Lakes? Because I know this is a long process, I don't want to send my letter to the wrong person only to start all over again.**

CryptoCurrency,Exposed the charity fighting cancer to crypto,"Hello Cryptofamily, 

I made some reasonable profits this year as hopefully you have done. Now that Christmas and the New Year are just around the corner I’m trying to give something back to those who were less lucky. 

I started to help the charity fighting cancer that was initially started by my teacher many years ago. The volunteers work hard every day to save lives of children and adults in the harsh financial and political conditions.

Advita USA is based in Houston, Texas.  Their goal is to make sure that cancer patients' lives depend not on their income or birthplace, but on the progress of modern medicine. They help cancer patients from Russia and the former parts of the Soviet Union get access to the most effective treatments available.  Advita USA has been active since 2009, is staffed by volunteers only and focuses on two issues: 

•	Small number of bone marrow donors.  Approximately 13,000 donors are registered in three registries within Russia; this number pales in comparison to 9 million donors available in the US, or 7.7 million donors available through German registers (see https://statistics.wmda.info/ ). As a result, in most cases blood cancer patients who need bone marrow transplants from an unrelated donor have to pay 20,000 euros for donor searches abroad and delivery of stem cells.

•	Low level of clinical research.  As of December 2017, only 232 clinical trials for cancer were underway in Russia, compared to 4,354 in Europe and 7,083 trials in the US (see https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results/map?recrs=ab&amp;cond=cancer&amp;map= ). 


To improve cancer patients’ outcomes, Advita USA helps to raise money for bone marrow donor searches in foreign registries, and to purchase medications unavailable in the former Soviet Union in pharmacies abroad.  They also obtain consultations from cancer specialists in the US and Europe and help patients enroll into various access programs for medications, or clinical trials abroad.

As an example, of what Advita USA was able to accomplish, here is a story of Vanya:   http://advita.ru/en/IvRus1.php. Vanya was born with a rare genetic disease, Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome.  His older brother died from it.  Vanya’s situation was difficult, because he needed a transplant of blood stem cells from a donor, but there was no match.

Bitcoin,Exposed cancer fighting charity to bitcoin,"Hello Cryptofamily,

I made some reasonable profits this year as hopefully you have done. Now that Christmas and the New Year are just around the corner I’m trying to give something back to those who were less lucky.

I started to help the charity fighting cancer that was initially started by my teacher many years ago. The volunteers work hard every day to save lives of children and adults in the harsh financial and political conditions.

Advita USA is based in Houston, Texas. Their goal is to make sure that cancer patients' lives depend not on their income or birthplace, but on the progress of modern medicine. They help cancer patients from Russia and the former parts of the Soviet Union get access to the most effective treatments available. Advita USA has been active since 2009, is staffed by volunteers only and focuses on two issues:

• Small number of bone marrow donors. Approximately 13,000 donors are registered in three registries within Russia; this number pales in comparison to 9 million donors available in the US, or 7.7 million donors available through German registers (see https://statistics.wmda.info/ ). As a result, in most cases blood cancer patients who need bone marrow transplants from an unrelated donor have to pay 20,000 euros for donor searches abroad and delivery of stem cells.

• Low level of clinical research. As of December 2017, only 232 clinical trials for cancer were underway in Russia, compared to 4,354 in Europe and 7,083 trials in the US (see https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results/map?recrs=ab&amp;cond=cancer&amp;map= ).

To improve cancer patients’ outcomes, Advita USA helps to raise money for bone marrow donor searches in foreign registries, and to purchase medications unavailable in the former Soviet Union in pharmacies abroad. They also obtain consultations from cancer specialists in the US and Europe and help patients enroll into various access programs for medications, or clinical trials abroad.

As an example, of what Advita USA was able to accomplish, here is a story of Vanya: http://advita.ru/en/IvRus1.php. Vanya was born with a rare genetic disease, Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome. His older brother died from it. Vanya’s situation was difficult, because he needed a transplant of blood stem cells from a donor, but there was no match. Advita USA’s volunteers located a new clinical trial in Italy that involved gene therapy, a revolutionary approach that was only possible thanks to recent scientific advances. Vanya became one of the first few patients that underwent the therapy and the treatment worked very well. Vanya is now a thriving 7-year old that is able to live his life to the fullest.

Advita USA (www.advitausa.org) is a public charity that is tax-exempt under US Revenue Code section 501(c) (3). They publish their financial reports and accreditations on their website: http://www.advitausa.org/about/financial-reports/

Bitcoin,Is it possible that governments could attack Bitcoin by buying all available BTC slowly over years?,"According to this article ""https://www.thebalance.com/is-the-federal-reserve-printing-money-3305842"", Federal Reserve printed $4   Trillion Between December 2008 and October 2014. I didn't manage to get the data for Chinese and Russian government but It seems that  if government wants, they can print infinite money as they wish.

According to this reddit post https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5qnw5h/when_will_we_reach_the_21_millions_bitcoin_cap/ , Bitcoin will reach 20.67 million by 2032. 

Based on above information I did some quick calculation

//It takes 14 years(5110 days) to reach 2032 A.D from 2018 A.D
2032 - 2018 = 14 years = 5110 days

//Dividing 20.6 million by 5110 days. 
(20.6 * 10^6) / 5110 = 4031(rounded)

So, if governments buy approximately 4031 BTC a day than it's possible to acquire 20.6 million BTC within 14 years.

Could such attack be even possible?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Wife and I purchased our home right before the market collapsed and we went negative big time.,"We’ve been making mortgage payments for about 11 years now at a 6.25 percent interest rate. At some point relatively quickly after buying the house and the market crashing we couldn’t sell it and we had two children. Soon after that I lost my job and had to get a new one so our credit ended up getting bad when we got behind on the mortgage.
Currently our credit isn’t good but we are all caught up on the bills. That being said the bank still will not refinance and we simply can’t afford to pay this high mortgage payment anymore.

A refinance at this point would cut our monthly payment down by about $500 which would make it manageable but we can’t find a bank that will do it with our credit. I read something about HARP being a government program that gives assistance for this kind of situation. Does anyone here know anything about that and if we might qualify? We are no longer upside down on the loan but after making payments for 11 years we now owe what the house is worth and we can’t afford to make necessary home repairs such as fixing the old roof and replacing the broken HVAC.",finance

personalfinance,Great Lakes not allocating payments as they say?,"I have several student loans in Great Lakes, on automatic repayment. I have my excess payment preferences set to ""Standard"", which states that after taking care of accrued interest, all excess money will be applied to the loan with the highest interest rate. 

However, when I look at my ""payment history"", which breaks down where the money has been going, ALL of the loans have some money ""applied to interest"" (as desired), and some ""applied to principal"", even the ones with lower interest rates.

Shouldn't I be seeing zeros in the ""applied to principal"" columns for the loans with lower interest rates? Is there something I'm overlooking? Is this a known issue with Great Lakes?

They have the ""custom allocation"" option to change excess payment preferences to apportion payments manually by loan, and I would do that, but that option doesn't appear to begin with paying off interest on all loans before customizing allocation among principals.",finance
personalfinance,Got a letter from the IRS claiming an error in my filing. Please help!,"Happy Holidays, Reddit.  I appreciate everyone's help in advance.  

The IRS thought it would be a great gift to send me a proposed change on my 2016 tax returns.  It's not a bill, but the letter says, if they are correct, I owe $1394 in tax plus $43 in interest.  I filed independently and am single.  This is what the changes specify:

                            
Taxable income, line 27--$44692, Difference = $0
Tax, line 28 -- $6949, Difference = $0
Education Credits, line 33 -- $1394, As corrected by IRS = $0, Difference = -$1394
Total tax, line 39 -- On return = $5546, As corrected = $6940, Difference = $1394
Tax you owe:  $1394 (plus interest)

So, clearly I did something wrong with the education credits. My university's 1098-T BOX 2 (Amounts billed for qualified tuition and related expenses) says ""7,0002.00"" and there is nothing for Box 1 (Payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses).  I did the filing on H&amp;R block online.  I did this last year with virtually the same income and tuition costs and did not have a problem, but it clearly seems like I accidentally filed for education credits this year and not amounts billed for qualified tuition and related expenses.  I can only see what the finished 1040 looks like, not the step by step process I did on H&amp;R Block online, so I must have did something wrong when it asked me how much money I spent on books and supplies?  I spent hundreds on books but did not pay the university - I did it through Amazon.  

Anyway, my federal tax refund was $1055.  Now I owe  $1394?

Anyway I can adjust this?  I actually lose money?!

Please help!  Let me know if you need any other information.",finance

Ripple,The Case for XRP in 2018,"Cryptocurrencies have grown exponentially not only in price this past year but also in public awareness and popular attention. The novel feeling to an emerging financial and technological market is reminiscent of the rise of the Internet with its innovative potential. In turn, a heightened collective societal awareness of this new innovative potential has led to a change in the nature of the market dynamics of cryptocurrencies. As Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle posits, “The observation of a phenomenon changes the phenomena itself.” The observation of thousands of young millennials, and now middle-aged investors, will only accelerate the rise of cryptocurrencies as times goes on.

Today, we are seeing the real-world effects of a newfound intrigue into cryptocurrencies. This new interest is causing a narrowing of the divergence between truth and fiction over accurate knowledge about cryptocurrencies. The force drawing this gap narrower each day is an increased dissemination of truthful information that has generated legions of individual investors into new cryptocurrency markets; in particular, Ripple’s XRP.

As the public expands its understanding of Ripple’s XRP, the capital inflow from both individual and institutional investors combined will likely grow to levels that will exponentially grow the liquidity of XRP and, as a byproduct, its price.

Here, in this report, I will provide an overview and analysis of Ripple’s XRP and the implications Q4 2017 and the year 2018 and beyond hold for the future of XRP and its price.

**THE CONCEPT: WHAT IS XRP?**

XRP is the digital asset used by Ripple to offer financial institutions an option for liquidity to conduct cross-border payments. It is predominantly used for Ripple’s solution for the minimization of liquidity costs. In contrast to most other cryptocurrencies, XRP’s application here features a real-world applicability that extends to real-world transactions.  It is used for the xRapid solution provided by Ripple, and is the only one of the three solutions Ripple offers (The others are xCurrent and xVia) that employs the use of XRP.

**THE RATIONALE: WHY XRP?**

There is a myriad of factors that distinguish XRP from other cryptocurrencies and establish it as a forerunner to what may become the dominant cryptocurrencies in the years that lie ahead.

Cost: Comparatively, XRP has the lowest cost per transaction at $0.0004. In contrast, BCH is $0.26, LTC is $0.37, DASH is $0.64, ETH is $0.96, and BTC is $28.23.

Scalability: XRP can handle over 1,500 transactions per second whereas BCH can handle 24 per second, LTC can handle 56 per second, DASH can handle 10 per second, ETH can handle 16 per second, and BTC can handle 24 per second.

Speed: XRP can conduct transactions at a rate of 3 seconds per transaction, BCH at a rate of 58 minutes per transaction, LTC at 17 minutes per transaction, DASH at 15 minutes per transaction, ETH at 2 minutes per transaction, and BTC 1 hour and 6 minutes per transaction.

XRP’s availability is ever-expanding. It is currently available on over 50 exchanges including Bitstamp, Bithumb, Bittrex, Binance, Bitfinex, Kraken, and Poloniex. The volume of XRP availability is, in addition, in an expansionary phase. The primary location of exchange volume is concentrated in Asia; in particular, South Korea. However, as mainstream media attention increases, so will American interest as well. There already have been tell-tale signs indicative in news outlets that have covered Ripple recently in the wake of XRP’s rise in CNBC, Bloomberg, Forbes, Investopedia, and Yahoo Finance.

Simply consider the mania generated by the media attention to Bitcoin. Repetitive news stories featured on CNBC, Bloomberg, CNN, CBS, and other mainstream media news outlets. Countless articles disparaging it as a bubble and hailing it as a force that could deconstruct the financial apparatus governed by the Federal Reserve and other central banks. Now, consider the results of media attention directed towards the substantive information behind XRP. Once news segments and articles are shown and written that illustrate the comparative superiority of XRP to other cryptocurrencies, then the viewers and readers will likely flock to XRP in pursuit of acquiring a tried, tested, and proven cryptocurrency with real-world usage.

In turn, a virtuous circle intensifying capital inflow to XRP is predictable and probably to occur. We can expect FOMO to rise and a number of oscillations up and down for the price to unfold. Nevertheless, the price of XRP is bound to not only remain but rather accelerate its demonstrated upwards price trajectory pushing us to new heights.

Additionally, if the collective fear among cryptocurrency investors materializes, that is, if new regulations are imposed on our activities, then Ripple is stand to likely gain. Dr. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a scholar and risk analyst writes about a concept called “Antifragility.” Antifragility is a term used to describe things that gain from disorder. Considering Ripple’s ties to financial institutions and regulators, it wouldn’t be too far-off to speculate that XRP is positioned to gain if such a black swan event were to occur.

**FURTHER REASONS TO ADVANCE THE CASE FOR XRP:**

Financial institutions, renown investors, and accomplished financiers have already taken notice of XRP. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has advocated on Ripple’s behalf. Zoe Cruz, former president for institutional securities and wealth management at Morgan Stanley and former global head of fixed income, commodities, and foreign exchange has joined Ripple’s Board of Directors. She has been named to Forbes list of Most Powerful Women for three years straight.

Perhaps most notably, a consortium of 61 banks – organized by SBI Ripple Asia – will be adopting Ripple’s technology to settle transactions between its members with the eventual goal of applying XRP to usage. Mr. Yoshitaka Kitao, the CEO, Executive Chairman, and President has publicly stated, “Forget about bitcoin, we’re all in on XRP!”  In fact, SBI has already confirmed that XRP will be put in usage in Spring 2018. If successful, expect the price to reflect it.

Moreover, TechCrunch Founder Michael Arrington has, as of November 2017, announced a $100 million XRP hedge fund. His efforts have already raised $50 million which will engender a ripple effect of new large net-worth individual and institutional investors. The entity will be called Arrington XRP Capital and new information about its activities are set to be released in the months that lie ahead.

Also, David Schwartz, Ripple’s Chief Cryptographer, has said that there are two major “household” companies (Not financial institutions) that will be announced in Q4. This is likely to provide a substantial boon to XRP.

Finally, the Chief Technology Officer of Ripple, Stefan Thomas, has said that in 2018 there will be a “big push on XRP.” For years, Ripple has kept a relative silence in expressing the superiority of XRP. 2018 will be different. 2018 is bound to be Ripple’s year. **I expect the price to rise as high as $10** and as low as $4. 

At any rate, this report only scratches the surface of Ripple and XRP’s potential. For far more nuanced and in-depth analysis and information, I suggest reading from Ripple firsthand at www.ripple.com and perusing the best blog on XRP itself at https://xrphodor.wordpress.com/

personalfinance,Does refinancing once affect your ability to refinance again shortly thereafter?,"I was hoping r/personafinance might know something about this:

I recently finished grad school and am have been thoroughly introduced to the grand ole’ world of crushing student loan debt!

I had to take out 3 separate private loans with a bank (in addition to federal loans) on separate occasions throughout undergrad and grad school to finance my way through. Once I started working, the bank wanted to make me repay all 3 private loans simultaneously, so I recently went through the process of refinancing those loans through the same bank to consolidate my 3 loans into a single loan with a longer repayment period and a WAY higher interest rate.

Now, to get that interest rate under control, I’d really like to refinance again through a separate company that’s offering a much lower interest rate. So, in theory, I would take out the new loan with the separate company, pay off the loan from the bank, and begin making payments on the loan from the separate company.

My question is this: assuming I have a co-signer with enough assets to help me qualify, will the second company I hope to refinance with at all care that I just underwent a separate refinancing with the bank? Will the fact that I just refinanced affect the chances that other companies will allow me to refinance with them?

TL;DR: I just refinanced my student debt through a bank, but now I want to refinance again elsewhere to get a better interest rate. Will the fact that I just refinanced prevent me from doing so again?

Any advice or pointers would be SUPER appreciated! Thank you!",finance
Ripple,XRP's 'Drake Equation',"XRP is one of the few Crypto Coins for which a **deterministic** future price is possible, due to the specific use case.

**Value of 1 XRP in 5 years** = (USDt * USDr *  Banksm * Banksmr * XRPtkr ) / Bankt * XRPt

**Total Mkt cap of XRP in 5 years** = (**USDt** * **USDr** * **Banksm** * **Banksmr** * **XRPtkr**) / **Bankt**

a) Total Daily amount in USD currently sent over the Swift  Network (**USDt**)

b) Percentage of Total Daily amount in XRP needed on the network due to recycling of the same XRP (**USDr**)

c) Total Number of bank branches on the Swift Network (**Bankt**)

d) Number of Banks that are Small or Medium (**Banksm**)

e) Ratio of Small or Medium sized Banks that will adopt Swift (**Banksmr**)

f) Total circulating supply of XRP in 5 years (**XRPt**)

g) Ratio of banks using XRP over the Ripple network vs using their own crypto tokens (**XRPtkr**)

**So let's do it people. Let's figure it out!!!**  -- What **numeric values** would you assign to the above? And what is the deterministic value of XRP in 5 years? 

Then a bit of math --- assuming that current interest rates are 2% annually.. and we get what should be today's price!!!

Let's start off, by **fixing our parameters** and stating a few **assumptions**.

**Parameters**

i) The Future price we are looking at is in 5 years time - after all the XRP in Escrow has been issued

ii) Only Small to Medium Sized Banks will use the Ripple network &lt;-- larger banks will use their own dev teams to issue their own cryptocurrencies and form a handful of consortiums

iii) XRP will only be used for Bank settlements (yes, it's larger than that.. but we'll comment on that later

iv) XRP usage will last for 20 years  -- so any adoption costs need to be factored to a daily amount by dividing by 365 * 20

**Assumptions** In general, for a bank to adopt Ripple the below needs to apply:

1) The Bank's daily payments to the Swift network (SwB)

2) The Bank's daily operational support cost of the Swift network, tracking down payments etc (SwO)

3) The cost per transaction (SwT) * the number of transactions (SwN)

Must be more than:

A) The initial cost to purchase XRP (XRPp) * (XRPn)

B) The initial cost for joining  the Ripple Network (XRPj)

C) The ongoing transactional cost (fee) per USD Equivalent settled over the network (XRPf)

D) The pro-rata'd cost of retraining staff to use the Ripple Network factored converted to a daily amount (XRPs)

For a bank to have sufficient incentive to change to Swift.

Ie this becomes the max price of xrp, over which a bank will not switch from swift to xrp **edit1 added comment. Edit2: this is wrong as per u/frowsyEdinburgh... if xrp price goes up, banks buy less volume but same overall usd equiv amount**
So no max price!!

Gross pay after 401k contributions: 65000  
Standard deduction of 12000 = **53000** of taxable income  

Federal income tax taking new standard deduction:  
&gt;12000 @ 0% = 0  

&gt;9525 @ 10% = 953  

&gt;29175 @ 12% = 3501  

&gt;14300 @ 22% = 3146  

Total federal income tax: **7600**  
Fica @ 6.2%: 65000 * .062 = **4030**  
Medicare @ 1.45%: 65000 * .0145 = **943**   

State taxes:
&gt;60550 @ 3.75% =  2271   

&gt;4450 @ 4.75% = 211  

State tax: **2482**  

State disability tax @ 1.2%: 65000 * 0.012 =  **780**  

So, all together, taxable income-federal taxes-state taxes: 65000-7600-4030-943-2482-780 = **49165**

personalfinance,"20, in college, I think I've dug myself into a pretty deep hole (with rent for upcoming year and student loans). Would appreciate any help; I am scared.","OKAY so I'll try to be as concise as possible. I'm in a bit of a bind. I'm currently a sophomore in college at an esteemed 4-year public university with somewhat steep tuition. I chose this school knowing I'd be going into debt because I knew it was what I wanted and needed to flourish, etc. etc. etc. (this will become a trend). 

My parents help me with miscellaneous expenses, but are not contributing to my tuition/housing. As such I have paid for my education thus far with scholarships, some federal aid, and borrowing the rest. I realized I was digging myself into a hole, but my parents always said ""you don't need to worry about the debt right now"" or something similar when I expressed fear about borrowing more. If I mentioned deferment not being the best choice, it was met with a ""you don't have the money to pay right now, so just don't think about it and worry about it later."" Well. I am realizing how much I've screwed myself, and this is only one example.

I have never worked a job on campus (did not have the time/mental capacity - I have depression/anxiety and maintaining my high GPA is taxing enough) and all of my money from a job I briefly worked in high school was quickly spent on textbooks and the like. This upcoming semester (spring '18) I will have an unpaid internship in addition to my classes, and no opportunity to work. Ideally I would be able to work in the summer, and living at home would be the most cost-effective way to do this if I couldn't get a paid internship (chances are very scarce there given my degree) but living at home is a *very* bad idea for me.

Some fast facts: 

* I have currently less than $100 to my name. Yes, it is terrifying. My parents give me money for the things I absolutely need. I do not have the time to devote to a job during the semester.
* I have no emergency fund, no savings. Yes, it is terrifying. Some of my friends and my SO have IRAs set up by their parents. I am well, well, well aware of how behind I am on preparing for my future financially.
* My parents *cannot* afford to take on my loans - they are already paying my older sibling's, and they don't make much anyway, ~$80k yearly. 

Here is the current situation and most pressing issue. With the intent of saving money overall, I opted to live off-campus next year (on-campus housing was ~4k more for only 9 mo. of residence during the academic year vs. my 1 full year of rent) in a 4-bedroom apartment. I have already signed the lease.

So the first problem is finding a way to pay for my apartment next year. If I have to, I will take out loans to do this (my parents: ""just borrow more, that's all you can do at this point""). I would *really* rather not.

Second problem: I have not yet run the numbers because I am scared to, but I feel that with all of my loans hitting me at once when my deferment is over after graduation, I won't be able to feed myself or have a place to live. I *cannot* live with my parents - I am from a small town with very depressing job opportunities (fast food) and being at home is not healthy for me. Unfortunately. Meanwhile, my SO will be graduating nearly debt-free with an engineering degree. I'm scared shitless.

I have tried thinking about ways to make money to address the rent issue, and begin saving for the debt issue, but all I see is gathering a sum of money (either from working or from a scholarship) and promptly having to burn it all up on bills, etc. I don't know how to manage money; I have never had it. 

**Some figures, hopefully they make things clearer:**

My in-state tuition is $17,900 per academic year. I don't have to pay housing fees for next year, so this will be the sole charge on my student account.
My rent for the full year of my lease from Aug 2018-Aug 2019 is $645/mo totaling $7095 (signed with a cosigner so I don't have to pay security deposit. Or maybe the security deposit is extra, in which case I'll be paying $7740 for 12 mo.)

As it stands I have borrowed $23,500 in private loans. Broken down:
* one loan of $8500 with a fixed rate of 7.89%, deferred until after graduation
* one loan of $15,000 with a fixed of 9.23% (RIP), also deferred until after graduation

Federal loans:

* Unsubsidized loan of $2000
* Subsidized of $3500
* Unsubsidized loan of $2000
* Subsidized loan of $4500

Now maybe a few positives..

Scholarships

* One award of $4500/academic year for my academic performance
* One award of $3400 received last year that I can hopefully renew with successive applications.
(There are one or two I'm leaving out because they're not renewable and only applied to last year)

Prospects...kind of?

* I'm pursuing a degree in English - wait, don't run just yet - with a minor in tech writing and potentially fluency in Chinese by the time I graduate. 

**TL;DR: I made decisions on the basis I would figure it out later. I want to start tackling the mess I've made before it's too late. It's catching up to me now because I have to pay for an apartment, and will bite me more later when I graduate. What can I do to begin?**

**Edit: If your comment isn't constructive and is just scolding me for my choices, save it. If your comment is constructive, and addresses any of these issues in a thoughtful manner, thank you very much - I'll get back to you. You've been helpful.**",finance

personalfinance,Unemployed 22 years old in $5000 of CC debt confused on how to refinance his debt.,"Debt:

$2500 0% APR 18 month promotional deal with Apple's Barclaycard.  

I was paying it off until I had sudden large expenses and the deferred interest deadline ends on January 2nd.  If I don't refinance, I am going to earn about $500 of deferred interest on January 3rd, and the debt will continue to grow 20% every month afterwards.

$1350 Paypal credit payment.  My 0% interest is set to end very soon, and deferred interest will kick in as well as the predatory interest rates.

Bottomline, if I don't get refinanced, I'm going to pay a ton of deferred interest.  I am in between jobs with no savings (broke college student, who is graduating in May), and I have until Jan 2nd to fix this.

I'll respond to every question asked in the comment section.  Help me cope with my financial irresponsibility.  I have definitely learned my lesson, and I just want to come up with a solid game plan that can help me refinance so I can have more time to pay my debt while minimizing additional cost.",finance

1) Rising inflation putting downward pressure on yields.  Some say bonds are inflated (along with all assets) from QE, and could very well fall with equities under the right conditions (inflation, QT/rising Fed rates).

2) But counter to that, an inevitable pull back in equities (possibly caused by the above) would put downward pressure on prices (and potentially rates through ""accommodative Fed policy"", raising yields).

I'm thinking I could buy TIPS to hedge the inflation risk, as one option, but how do they fare as a ""flight-to-safety"" (~1% yield, VTAPX).

Or, I'm looking at Intermediate term Muni's, for the tax incentive and equity retraction hedge.  (~2-4% yield, VWIUX)

personalfinance,Been fighting to get fraudulent items taken off of my credit report. Have hit a wall. Advice on what to do next?,"I am seeking some advice on the next steps to take in my attempt to get incorrect/fraudulent items removed from my credit reports. Please forgive the lengthy nature of this post, but I'm trying to provide as much info as I can possibly can upfront.

Despite being in my 30's, I haven't really had much of a credit history in my life. My parents paid for college outright, so no student loans. Never owned a car or home. In my 20's I had some minor credit cards, all paid off and eventually cancelled. So I never paid much attention to my credit reports.

After the Equifax hack, I went to CreditKarma.com to look at my credit report. I was shocked to find a number of negative marks and a very low score.

The short version of what I came to discover is that about 2 years ago someone living in the same building as I (a small complex with 3 apartments) managed to steal my identity. This person opened two credit cards, a line of credit with an online retailer, and several utilities in my name. Of course they then defaulted/never paid. The person was a drug addict, and has since died, for what it's worth.

Obviously as soon as I figured this all out I filed a police report. It was really just to cover my own ass. The police didn't care, at all. They literally said to me ""We're not going to do anything about this.""

The companies that were reporting on my reports were almost all 3rd party debt buyers. This is what appeared on my reports back in early October (just giving you general info, not super detailed):

Jefferson Capital Systems (original creditor Fingerhut)
Portfolio Recovery (TWICE - original creditor Capital One Credit Cards)
SouthWest Credit Systems (TWICE - original creditor Comcast)
Trident Asset Management (original creditor Verizon Wireless)

For a total of 6 accounts showing in collections.

In addition, there were two accounts listed as closed: Fingerhut and Verizon.

I began the process of disputing these items. The first thing I did was dispute each item with all 3 major CRAs. This resulted in literally no progress. All of the creditors reported back that the debts were valid.

I then sent out proof of debt letters (debt validation) to all of these companies. I could provide a copy of the form letter I used. I tried to education myself, and as I understand it validation is different than verification. These letters demanded a list of information I believe they are required to provide upon request. This included what the money owed is for, how it was calculated, copies of papers showing I agreed to pay, identity of the original creditor, proof they are licensed to collect in my state, license numbers, etc... I sent these via certified mail. The letters also contained a starting paragraph in which I stated clearly that these debts were opened fraudulently, and I included a copy of the police report.

Over the course of the next month, I got the following results:

* Jefferson Capital Systems sent no response, but removed themselves from all 3 credit reports.

* Portfolio sent me responses with copies of billing statements from two Capital One accounts as well as letters stating this was sufficient to establish validity and their investigation was completed.

* Trident sent a response with a copy of a Verizon bill accompanied by a letter saying ""Orion Portfolio Services"" purchased my debt and placed it with Trident for collections, and demanding notice within 30 days that I disputed the debt.

* Southwest Credit sent me responses with copies of Comcast bills and a letter saying ""Enclosed is the information you requested...""

* Fingerhut sent me a letter that stated they could not help me because the account had been sold to Jefferson Capital. They enclosed a one page printout of the purchases made on the original account.

* Verizon did not respond at all.

In early November, I sent out follow up letters to everyone who had not yet pulled these marks from my credit reports. I reiterated the items I believed they were required to send to validate these debts, and pointed out the various things they had not sent. I made it clear that if these debts were not properly validated or removed within 2 more weeks, I would have no choice but to sue in federal court. I sent these letters certified.

In response:

* Portfolio sent me copies of every billing statement associated with each Capital One account, but no new or additional information. A week later they sent additional letters reiterating that they claim the account is now validated, and if they receive further inquiries they will not be answered because they consider the matter addressed

* Southwest Credit did not respond a second time. However they have removed ONE of the two collections accounts (the higher balance) from all 3 credit reports; and they have removed BOTH from my Experian report.

* Trident did not respond a second time.

* Verizon still has not reponded.

* Fingerhut sent a response. A lengthy letter stated when the account was opened online, pointing out specifically that ""during the application process the customer clicks the box that states yes I accept these terms and clicking submit constitutes my signature to this application for credit."" The letter details the purchases made on the account, and the fact that it was charged off. It says ""we cannot revise this information we are reporting to the credit bureaus as we are required by law to furnish accurate reporting."" Included was a six page document, some kind of insane grid with random numbers and information that I couldn't possibly begin to decipher.

As it stands on December 25th, 2017, the contents of my credit reports are roughly identical and thus:

Positive:
A 20+ year old American Express account that is actually my elderly father's, but which he added me to when I was 18. It has an extremely high limit with a relatively low balance that is always paid off on time and has no negative marks whatsoever.

A capital one credit card with a $300 balance that has no negative marks.

A credit one credit card with a $300 balance that has no negative marks.

Negative:

A closed Verizon account showing a charged off/collection balance of $749 amount past due.
A closed Fingerhut account showing a charged off/collection balance of $0 amount past due (but highest balance of $663.)
A collections Portfolio Recovery account with a balance of $389.
A collections Portfolio Recovery account with a balance of $462.
A collections Trident Asset Management account with a balance of $826.
A collections Southwest Credit Systems account with a balance of $116. (Does NOT appear on Experian.)

During this ordeal, I began receiving calls from Southwest Credit Systems attempting to collect. BOTH of my letters to them demanded they cease and desist calling and only contact me via mail. Because of this, I am currently being represented by an attorney through Lemberg Law in a federal lawsuit against them. I'm being represented at no cost as the firm will profit by suing both for me, and to collect attorney fees.

I am deeply appreciative of any advice anyone might offer as to how I should proceed next.

This upcoming year, my #1 priority is re-working my financial situation. I'm going to budget better, start saving, and work extra hard to pay down my debts so I can start feeling a little more stable and financially comfortable.

For Christmas and my birthday this year, my mother paid off one personal loan I had to take out earlier this year when I lost my job, and she's paying about half of my student loan off. 

Currently, I have a Direct Subsidized student loan through Navient with a balance of $3,102.17 at time of writing and a 4.040% interest rate. My mother wrote me a check for $1500 that I can put toward it after the New Year.

I'm certainly putting the money my mom gave me toward January's payment, then the rest to the principle balance but I'm wondering what to do next.

Assuming it's possible (I have to reach out to Navient to see), would it help me technically pay off my loan sooner if I refinanced it so that my monthly minimum payment is lower, keeping my target pay-off date the same, but I continued making the $50 monthly payments? Is this even an option I have, and would it be worthwhile?

I've paid off my credit cards in full every month since they opened, so I have zero balance by the time the statement is due. My average combined spending on my current credit cards is $600 a month, but I spent nearly $1500 combined on November and December because of the holidays.

I'm mainly going to use an AMEX card for discretionary spending, gas, and food. I bike to school so I don't spend a lot on gas or car maintenance, but I go home every weekend to visit friends since the campus is a commuter school and there's nothing to do there; it drives me insane. 

Which AMEX card would allow me to take advantage of it based on my spending habits?


tl;dr Which AMEX card to get based on **my situation/spending:**

* Tuition is taken care of thanks to savings account my parents built up for me.
* $600 for monthly rent (paid by cash, not card).
* $45 for cellphone.
* $100 on gas.
* $200 on grocery.
* $100 on fast food.
* $200-300 on discretionary spending.
* The rest of my monthly income and allowance goes to high-yield savings.

My dad was very adamant that even putting 100/mo into an IRA or savings account even with a lower interest rate than the loan would yield a better result.

When I got home this evening, I was curious, so I did a quick excel sheet to check. Surprisingly, it appeared that he was correct. Can someone confirm that my math is correct? And if so, is there a good explanation for how this is possible? I always assumed that paying towards somthing with a higher interest rate was always better.

I feel dumber than dumb because I truly believe more in the paradigm shift than the money. Money comes and money goes, but global financial corruption on the level we have now is difficult to overcome. I believe Bitcoin will change the world. It will kill that corruption. It will have its own corruption, but it's better than what we have now. It will be the biggest transfer of wealth in history. I haven't been so excited about a technology since I heard my modem dial up to connect to AOL so I could bomb chat rooms with middle fingers using Fate X ""hacker software"" (that's what I called it when I was 12). Those were exciting times.

Good things have happened in my life and I've been able to start reinvesting. I've been buying back in since BTC was $2,500ish, and though I don't have a full coin, I'm proud to be part of the movement. 

On a great note, I convinced a good friend of mine to sell a hefty investment of gold coins and buy BTC at $4,200-$4,800 (it varied because of his buying limit).  We'd have the same amount if it wasn't for that ONE VERY significant decimal, hahaha.

He just got his Ledger Blue, and I'm still waiting for my Keepkey (hurry up Keepkey). 

I'm happy he did that though. It's a great feeling to watch your friend of 15 years invest a chunk of his retirement into something you've been ranting about for years. It showed me that he believed in not only our friendship, but that our view of the world is very similar. It's also great because he has three children that will live a better life because of that move. It's my silver lining to my stupid decision. 

I needed to get this off my chest. It feels right to tell the story. I learned to never lose faith in something that is truly good, no matter how hard it is to believe in. Hodl 4 Life. Fuck banks. Fuck the Federal reserve. Buy every moment you can. Be a part of the change.

personalfinance,22 Y/O Cancer Survivor with Financial Worries,"Long time reader, but first time poster! I’ve spent a lot of time browsing this community and it’s helped me tremendously, however, I’d really like it to see if anyone could shed some light on my situation. 

When I was 20, I was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. I’m now 1 1/2 years cancer free, and am seeking advice to pick up the pieces from my battle. I underwent 6 months of chemo where I was unable to work, so I took short term disability to pay my month to month payments like my truck, insurance, etc.. This didn’t leave much on the plate for Co-pays and other expenses given the fact I was totally unprepared for this at 20. 

Therefore, I maxed credit cards to cover day to day expenses and pressing co-pays to the approximate sum of $6,000. As soon as I was able too, I refinanced that debt into a personal loan from a credit union with a reasonable interest rate of 6.5%. I currently owe about $4,800 on that balance. 

However, this summer some medical bills from my battle came down the pipeline, and with the threats and nervousness of screwing my credit for life, I paid all I could and maxed out another $9,500 approximate on cards. I know now, this was not the best decision, but I can’t go back in time and have decided to learn from it. 

I recently took a new job that’s going great, My package equates out to $38 an hour with $5 going to stellar health insurance and $5 into a pension fund, so my take home pay is about $28 an hour. On top of that, the company paid off my auto loan and bought my vehicle to become my personal work/commute truck, with all expenses including fuel being paid by them (which they’re awesome and pretty lenient about doing whatever I’d like as long as I’m not crazy with it). I still live at home, and now that my vehicle is paid for, I’ll essentially have no bills other than that initial personal loan which is $170 a month minimum, an old $2000 student loan from Navient, and a few remaining balances held by the hospitals I was at that I pay a minimum of $20 on each month. 

I’ve tried incredibly hard to set myself up to overcome this unfortunate event, and I’ve been going to school full time and working full time (Scholarships I apply for have paid my tuition each semester) to even go further. Also, I’ve been otherwise responsible with my credit and have no derogatory marks or anything like that. 

What’s my best course of action? I’d love to go get another personal loan to move that credit card balance, but I’m almost certain no one will give me one even with my net income because my utilization rate is sky-high and brought my score down to a 601. I’m terrified of my score and my situation at my age, and as I’m trying to pick up the pieces and start my “new” cancer free life, things like saving to purchase a home seem almost non-obtainable because of what’s happened. I’d appreciate any and all advice, tips, or “what would you do’s”! Thank you all.",finance

I know I am extremely blessed to have parents who are even offering to help, let alone pay it off in its entirety, but I can't help but be worried. My little brother started college as well, and they will be paying +10k for the next four years (if he graduates on time) for him as well. I also plan on going to pharmacy school, which will be another +200k in tuition in the future. My parents are immigrants with a small family business. They are hard working, but definitely not rich. Am I screwing with my parents' savings, emergency plan, etc? Will it be safer for me to just pay the monthly payment with my part time job making slightly more than minimum wage, and deal with the less than 5% interest rate?

personalfinance,"As a mostly commission 1099 employee/contractor, should I form an LLC to reduce my tax burden?","Hello,

I work in franchise sales. I have a base pay a little over $2k/month but I get $5k on all deals I close and I know taxes are not taken out of that commission pay. I've been setting aside 1/3 of all deals for the past year in anticipation on taxes and have hopefully laid up more than I need to cover my tax burden. I have had multiple people encourage me to form an LLC to write off more of my everyday expenses like a portion of my rent and car payments as I work from home pretty much all the time. Does moving to an LLC actually protect me or should I just file my taxes as I always have? (I fully confess, I'm an idiot when it comes to this shit and was never taught what to do, that costed me an audit by Maryland because I paid state and fed but not local taxes for the city of Rockville, and I've been trying to figure out a better way.

personalfinance,In what order should I pay my student loans?,"Bit of background: I graduated with $65K+ in student (mainly federal) loans in 2013 and haven't really made much of dent in it. I'm currently in grad school part-time while working full-time so some loans are in deferment. The past year I've been putting the monthly payments towards the subsidized loans and neglecting the ones that don't accrue interest because I thought that was the smart thing to do. I just compared my current loan amount to those in August and they all went up, so I'm obviously confused and concerned.

personalfinance,First-time homebuyer. My credit was run after about a month of sending in paperwork for a home mortgage loan. Credit score dropped!,"I recently decided to buy a house this year and went to two different mortgage companies. I submitted all necessary documents to both of the companies, and I decided to go with ""company A"". Company A ran a hard inquiry on my credit within a couple of days, which was fine because I wanted to get approved. 

Company B kept delaying the process for weeks and I pretty much forgot about them because I decided to go with the company A. 

When I decided to use company A, I didn't feel the need to tell company B I am not using them since I didn't have any contact with them in a long time. Fast forward a month, I find a house I want to buy &amp; the other day I get a notification saying that company B did a hard inquiry on my credit, this is after ZERO contact with them in over a month. Them doing this dropped my score down 20 points. I feel as if they did this to spite me just because I took my business elsewhere.

I am worried this might end up hurting me in the long run if I do close on a house and causes my interest rate to go up? I am sure my loan officer will check my credit again before everything is all said and done.

They ran my credit this month on the 5th. 

I contacted my loan officer and made him aware of this situation already. Am I able to contact someone regarding my situation to get this removed from my credit report? I don't want to do anything if it will drop my score even more. 

My loan officer JUST responded me as I was typing this up, he said ""We would have to update the report- but I can do that once your contract is executed so save you the pull in case this doesn't work out""

personalfinance,How to move my family out of my parents' house someday! Saving vs paying down debt,"My husband and I are in our late 30s. We bought a house in 2006, which quickly ended up hugely underwater thanks to the housing crash. That crash unfortunately coincided with several years of huge pay cuts since my husband's field was drastically impacted. He was able to get a new (higher paying) job this year, and we were finally able to move for the job because we reached the point of breaking even selling our house.

We're living with my parents right now, which is really helpful and allows us to get back on our feet. However, now we have to decide how to structure our budget best because this is not a permanent solution (their house is good size, but we have two kids and things are tight, plus I feel like the longer we stay the more we take advantage of them and disrupt their quiet empty-nester life). We just sold our house in May 2017, but we moved last summer for our daughter to start at her new school, so we've already been living with them for over a year.


We make $125k/year gross combined, and take home is about $6900/month


Our current bills:

$600/month daycare  
$225/month storage unit (most of our furniture and belongings from our 3 bedroom home are in here, there's no room at my parents' for it)  
$110/month cell phone  
$120/month car insurance  
$200/month gas  
$300/month food (for 6 people...we don't have a formal arrangement, but we usually end up paying for about 2 shopping trips per month at about $150/trip)  
$150/month takeout/eating out  
$50/month diapers  
$100/month (car taxes/registrations)  
$200/month misc (kid's clothing, haircuts, medicine, etc)  
$10/month Netflix  


Debts: 

Car 1: $280/month ($8,700 balance @ 2.5%)  
Car 2: $350/month ($21,000 balance @ 4.9%)  
Personal loan: $566/month ($17,000 balance @ 7.9%)  
CC: $40/month ($2,400 balance @ 7.9% - this one was low priority since the interest rate was much lower than our other credit cards (15.9-23.9%) and is the same as the loan)  


We have about $8,000 in our bank account, plus DH's 401k and my IRA that we hope to bump up contributions to. 


Where I'm torn is what to allocate our money towards. My main goal for the last 8 months since we sold our house was paying debt. We've paid down quite a bit, and have consolidated the balance to a much better interest rate now, and I don't know if we should start putting more into savings to be able to move out of my parents' house sooner and give them their life back!",finance
litecoin,For Christmas I've joined the litecoin family! My litecoin story. (Long),"**As a preface, the £ amounts I will speak of are scaled down considerably, the real amounts are significantly higher but for obvious reasons I've just kept a ratio on all of the values so it is consistent but not parallel to IRL**

Back in June, when my family were finally starting to come up in the world sort of thing, I spoke to my dad about investing some money into crypto. We had made several purchases with BTC prior to this, dating back to 2013 when we were purchasing NewsBin usenet subscriptions with it (for anyone unaware, usenet is a decentralised means of file sharing, and was predominantly used for piracy). Seeing the transactions of 3 or 4 bitcoins for a months subscription to the service is painful, and i just think why did i not just buy in advance or leave some in? Hindsight is a bitch, I had no reason too as i didn't understand bitcoins at the time, so i can'y kick myself for being ignorant bearing in mind i was very young at the time. Then i moved us onto torrenting and we didn't use BTC until 2016 when we were making other anonymous purchases i shan't go into. I used to buy coins in advance for convenience, and when i got around to spending them, i would see what value had increased quite noticeably. This went on for a while and it didn't click that there was an investment opportunity there. 

At this point in June i hadn't hear about any other cryptos other than BTC. So i went into researching BTC and it's future prospects. I was blown away by the predictions, and then my whole mind was melted by the implications BTC could have on society and money as a whole. From here i soon segway to reading about ETH and finally LTC. Again I was taken aback by their potential. At this point i was just as invested in the idea of decentralised currencies as i was making money. My visions of the future had completely changed. It's strange that when you think of the future, some things still stay the same; flying cars, space travel all paid for in good old GBP or another fiat. Not any more. 

After having my eyes opened to the world of cyrpto currency i wanted to get onboard. But i had no money I could afford to loose should things go south. So i instead just rattled on to my dad about how amazing decentralised currencies could be, the potetntial to change then world, and of course the money making potential in the long term (at the time I thought long term, as it turns out short term too!). There's a bit of a stigma around these parts about investing to make money, but at the end of the day most people can't afford to invest just for the love of what they are investing is. 

After a few nights of my rumblings and grumbling my dad turns to me and says he can pull together £250 (remember, scaled down) for me to invest if i really do believe what I'm saying. My eyes lit up, even though it wasn't directly for me that i was investing, the thought of having a stake in this vast market was exhilarating, and would also be a nice chance to repay my dad for his years of service to me as a child, as even through our toughest times i never went without or felt others had it better than me, and we were far from an affluent family. But £250 was a lot of money, more than i had ever earn't in my 18 years alive and more than i will see for some time. I asked him if he could afford to loose it should the worst happen, he said yes. I knew the money was coming from his pension fund he was trying to build so i knew he *could* afford to loose it but i would be heartbroken if i did. I took the plunge. I put £100 into BTC, £100 into LTC and £50 into ETH based on the information i had found online and my own personal thoughts. If i could go back i wouldn't have bothered with ETH, but two months ago if i could've gone back I wouldn't have bothered with LTC, oh how times have changed. 

This money just went into my wallets of choice, and that was it. It was weirdly surreal to have all of that money just disappear into a medium I had only dabbled in and most wouldn't touch due to the apparent risk. I rationalised it by thinking of it as investing in stocks with a very volatile company, which i know was a flawed analogy but it let me sleep at night. 

In coming weeks steadily the coins rose and rose, and come November the bitcoin flew up, come the end of November/start of December the litecoin skyrocketed. Early December i was sat on £1400 of coins, and I was ever so chuffed and fairly active in the relative communities. That is down to £1000 as of the dip, and i still couldn't have been happier, the only thing that pissed me off was that i didn't have access to more fiat to buy the dip! 

My dad is very proud of my choice to invest and confidence in the coins, and he's always asking me questions about them as as he finds out more information about them, he wants to learn more, and as he does so he is just as interested in coins than profit. 

As it turns out, back when litecoin was peaking and bitcoin had hit a sort of plateau my dad sold a small number of the coins behind my back, as he had come to grips with all of the technology and market movement in his own time and through me. For Christmas among the usual gifts was an envelope. In said envelope was £100 (still dealing with scaled values) cash. The most money i had ever held in my hands, let alone my own money. He gifted me this so i could buy a new car, buy a new phone, have a 7 day coke binge in the bahamas; whatever. He just said no strings attached enjoy the money and thank you for your advice and time. 

This was £100 i had, that i didn't need to live on, and can afford to loose. The criteria for investing my own cash had been met, and so the only thing in the world i wanted to buy was coins. In looking at the market today I have put it all into LTC and intend to sit on it until i leave university and have to manage my finances completely on my own two feet. In 4 years i cannot foresee the litecoin being worth less than what it is now, and any money i make will be a bonus. I'm just so pleased to have my own stake in the future of currency, and i can do but thank you all for your wealth of information and news updates.

That is all.

personalfinance,Student Loan Tax Credit (MD),"Greetings &amp; Happy Holidays r/PF!

I recently received a $1200 tax credit from the below program for the state of MD.

It states I must use the $1200 towards the loan within 2 years, and prove that to the state, or I could have to pay back the $1200.

My question:

Since my monthly payments will eventually add up to $1200 for 2018, can I apply the $1200 to a credit card with a higher interest rate? Or do I need to pay a $1200 lump sum payment to the student loan on top of my routine monthly payment?

personalfinance,Is it a bad idea to cash out federal bonds that have reached face value?,"I'm back home for the holidays and my mom and I were going over finances. When I was a kid different family members gifted me numerous small denomination EE Federal Bonds. They go up to 2005~ and all the ones prior to 2000 have made their face value and then some.

The pre 00' bonds total around 1.4k~ but still have around a decade of maturity they could still reach. I think the interest rate is around 1.29%.

About 2 years ago I moved out and for various reasons burned through savings and lived unwisely. I'm just starting to get the hang of being a human person without a direct safety net and free lodging. I'm still working towards being financially literate, and I feel that while I have improved a great deal, things are still a bit tight. That money could go towards some really useful things that improve quality of life (shoes that aren't falling apart, a repair or two, etc)

Is it a bad decision to cash out all the bonds that have reached face value? The way I look at it is even if they accumulate their full potential in a decade a couple thousand dollars should not make a huge difference in my 30s unless I've done something wrong. Any input would help, and if I'm dead wrong please tell me.

personalfinance,Which loan to pay off (Mortgage vs HELOC),"First time posting here, so please excuse any formatting issues. 

I'm not sure which property husband and I should focus paying off in the next 5-8 years. We are in Seattle, WA. We have a healthy emergency fund squirreled away. No other loans/debts aside from the two below.

Here are the details:

* **MORTGAGE:** A condo with $130k, 3.125% APR, 10.5 years remaining on loan. Currently sits vacant as we had purchased &amp; moved into a single-family home. Hoping to rent this condo out within next 4-6 weeks. We have set aside money to help pay this mortgage &amp; HOA dues for next 6 months in case it takes longer to find an ideal tenant.

     Once the condo is rented out, we would nearly break even since our PITI + HOA dues equates to what market rental rate (and some leftover for maintenance, fixes, etc.). Once this condo is paid off, we’d net about $1,500/month. 
 

* **HELOC:** We took a HELOC on the condo to help with a 20% down payment for a house we just purchased. HELOC balance: $115k, 4.24% APR. 10 year draw period then converts into a 20 year repayment plan.

Husband &amp; I considered paying off HELOC first since it has a higher interest rate, but my husband pointed out that if we paid off the condo first, we could net the $1,500/mo sooner to help pay off the HELOC.

I’m 26 and just received a ~40% raise so I’m making $80k/year. I contribute 12% to retirement right now and I’m going to increase it to 16% in the next month or so. My 401k balance is $24k. 

My husband and I have $20k in cash savings. Anytime our savings gets above $20k we use it to pay down our mortgage, which we have reduced by $20k in the last few years beyond our regular payments. We have about $90k in equity in the house after closing costs. 

We are looking to buy a new house in 2018 so we are going to focus on keeping more cash in savings rather than paying down the mortgage because the new house will likely be a fixer-upper. That’s the only way we can afford a house in our desired area but we are totally fine with that. 

Our goals for 2018 are:
Build savings up to $30k

Increase 401k contributions to 16%

Pay off my car - I have about $6k left and the interest rate is &lt;2% so I haven’t felt the pressure but I’d like to just get rid of it in the next 6 months (before we buy a house)

Bitcoin,Why will bitcoin survive the future?,"This holiday season, Bitcoin was brought up many times at the dinner table. Being the good hodl-er I capitalist dog I am, I advocated for the purchase of Bitcoin and touted it as the currency of the future.

I was hammered back by other family members who brought up points that I couldn't confidently counter. I was wondering if you can help me parse the arguments and to understand whether they're valid (and why?) and whether Bitcoin can confidently trump these issues.

- Bitcoin is only speculation and holds no real value [of course, so is most Fiat I said], eventually, I was told that USD though not backed by any physical commodity, it is backed on the power of the US government to tax its economy to pay back its debt. Having no specialty in economics, I made no attempts to argue a point I don't fully comprehend (or even know if its a ""true"" statement)

- Bitcoin will be killed by the Federal government who will implement a blockchain system for the introduction of USD into the economy [is there anything that would prevent this from happening? and if so, won't this be widely adopted by the american people] / I'm not actually from the US but I do hail from a G7 country where he told me our nation's Central Bank alongside the largest retail/commercial banks is actively working on implementing a blockchain solution

I know these aren’t 100% accurate, but it’s definitely that low. I was denied when I applied for a secured credit card.  I have 6 derogatory marks, no credit card utilization, no payment history, and no age of credit. I owe about $5k to various lenders.


My mom was a single parent growing up and she is very uneducated (she is disabled, legally blind, cannot read or write, and is a paranoid schizophrenic) her income is from Social Security and disability checks. I knew nothing about handling money and saving because no one had taught me. I took out a loan when I was 17 for $300 and never paid it back and that was the beginning of ruining my credit. At 18, I got a Victoria’s Secret credit card for about $350, maxed it out, never paid it. 


When I was 20, I got my first car after winning $2,000 gambling. I used that money for a down payment and got a brand new car at a 20% (!!) interest rate. I am horrible with handling money and even though I had a job and was fully capable of making the payments, I spent it on other dumb things and fell behind. I had the car voluntary repossessed. 


I’m 24 now and realize how essential having good credit is. I’m very self aware and take full responsibility for being dumb and reckless when I was younger. I need a car and eventually I’ll need to buy a home, etc. and I can’t do any of that with my credit as it is now. My monthly income is $2,500 but I am about to get a promotion next month where I will get a significant pay raise. I only pay around $350 for bills currently so I definitely have extra money to apply towards fixing my debt and credit. My issue is, I’m not sure where to start and I need help budgeting and saving. Like I said, I’m horrible with money. I didn’t have much of it growing up so when I do get paid, I HAVE to blow it all on unnecessary stuff. Spending makes me feel good but then I’m broke again and it’s a vicious cycle. 


How do I begin tackling my debt and saving my credit score? What do I do about the repossession on my report? How can I start saving money and stop feeling like I need to spend money to feel good?

personalfinance,Taking out a student loan when it's not completely necessary,"So my problem is a mix of r/relationships and personal finance. I am working on the relationship aspect of this, so I need financial advice. 

I am a college student in the Western US. I signed a lease to live the next school year in a house off campus with my friend and a couple other people. Long story short, my friend is acting in a way that I really cannot live with. I am attempting to deal with it, but the thought of living with her for an entire year is giving me major anxiety and I do not think that I can handle it. 

If I cannot find someone to take over my lease (I am actively looking), I am very tempted to take out a loan to pay off the rent in whole so I do not have to live there. I am currently very fortunate that I do not have any student loans currently, and this should be the only loan I need to take out. Since I have never taken out a loan, I do not know what the process/repayment process is. 

I would need $5400 (rent is $450 a month), rounded up to $5500. If I got a Direct Unsubsidized loan (I do not qualify for subsidized) the interest rate would be 4.445% as of today. There is also a fee of 1.066%. How do I calculate how much I will need to pay back?

I am majoring in business and I have had 2 internships, so I have solid job prospects. I know that taking out a loan would be a burden on me straight out of college, and that is why my parents did not want to have to take out loans. But I am trying to weight the financial aspect with the emotion stress. Plus, I feel like since the amount is so low, I could also get a job during school to start trying to pay some of it off now. 

Can I please have feedback on this plan? I wanted to post here because I need perspectives.",finance
personalfinance,Help with budgeting and retirement investment,"I am looking for info on where to invest for retirement here are some details about myself and current financial situation:
I recently doubled my income and feel like I can start saving heavily for retirement at this point.

Making $300.00/ month payments minimum
No credit card debt
My cars are both paid off- combined value of about 12 K, I have no plans on getting into any more car debt anytime soon, at least until my student loans are paid off. 

About 10k in savings account and 2500 in my current IRA through my work. 

Here is what my budget looks like: 
5800 take home ( after 3% contribution to my IRA, taxes and dental insurance) 
1308 house payment

I spoke to the administrator and the companies fee's are quite high in my opinion, but since my employer has the match I am going to keep that there. So I am looking for advice on where to start investing in a ROTH IRA that is going to have the lowest fee's. My plan is to invest in index funds as from my research, there is no reason to try and ""beat the market"" because it rarely works.

personalfinance,"Debts, savings, and retirement; oh my! NJ teacher seeking financial advice.","Hi r/personalfinance! 

I've been a lurker for a while and have always been appreciative of this community. As the title states, I’m in need of some guidance. I feel I’m on the right path but could definitely use some fine tuning. In the past year and a half I’ve paid off approximately $20,000 while managing to live without worry but feel there’s much more I can do for a more secure future.

**My goals are to:** 

* Get my retirement plan in order 
* Plan savings to build an emergency fund, then save for a downpayment on a home
* Plan debt payoff 


**Background and Current Income Info:**
I am a 27-year old teacher in NJ. I plan to continue teaching but to leave NJ within the next 5 years. Within the next two years (give or take), I hope to have all of my debts paid and schooling completed along with maximizing savings. I don’t plan on any major life events in the next couple of years - getting a handle on my finances is my primary concern.

In 2017, my gross take home was $57,500; net about $34,600. My current financial responsibilities leave me with very little if any leftover but allow me to not worry about bills &amp; food, each month these are:

Total take home is about $2800/month.

* Rent: $1000
* Utilities: $50 average
* Groceries/Household Supplies/Entertainment: $500 average
* Phone: $40
* Cable/Internet: $35
* Car Insurance: $100
* Car Payment: $245
* Gas: $75
* Personal Loan (taken out to pay off that Sallie Mae with a lower rate): $267
* Federal Student Loans: $225
* Savings: $150/month

I have about $4000 combined in my checking/savings accounts with *insert generic major bank here*. I recently moved and went through a very long summer so my accounts were drained.


**Retirement**
Current accounts:

* NJ Pension: $11,000 (~$400/monthly)
* Unmatched AXA 403b: $9000 (~$250/monthly)
* Prudential “NJ Defined Contribution Plan”: $3000 (previous employer - not making contributions)

I want to maximize the returns on my investments, of course. With my 403b being unmatched and AXA having a pretty bad reputation, I’m wondering about the following scenario:

Cease contributions to 403b. Rollover the NJ Defined Contribution plan into a Vanguard IRA (unsure if traditional or roth is the way to go) and begin making contributions here. I’m hoping this rollover is allowed, I’m pretty unclear on that, but it would cover the required minimum fee.

Keeping in mind that moving from NJ in the next five years will affect this as well. From my understanding, I will be able to withdraw my pension contributions when this occurs and this can be rolled over into a different account (I’m not sure if that would go to the IRA or how that works exactly). In addition, I would rollover the current 403b funding into that same account. My end goal would be to have 1 pension account and 1 Vanguard account (less is more).

**Debts**
No credit card debt (and ideally it stays that way). I pay everything off in full each month and try to use them wisely for cash returns.

Currently, my student loans are in deferment since I am going to school. I’ve planned to take advantage of this and make just above the minimum payment on all loans to cover interest plus few dollars, and focus on the highest interest loan.  I will, at most, accrue another $6,000 in student loans by the time I finish, and at minimum another $3000. I should make up this debt within a couple years of employment due to the change in salary.

In June 2019, if all goes to plan, I will be eligible for $17,500 in federal student loan forgiveness for having taught a high need area in a Title 1 school.

* Car: -$7,350 @ .49% fixed (ends May 2020)
My car is currently worth about $13k. I'm considering selling it and purchasing a car worth the difference.
* Personal Loan: -$3,800 @ 7.9% fixed (ends May 2019)

*Federal Student Loans: ~$28,100 total*
Most I am paying between $10-15/month except the one noted, which I am more aggressively paying.

* Direct Loan; Subsidized: -$4,800 @ 3.4%
* Direct Loan; Unsubsidized: -$2,270 @ 6.8%
* Direct Loan; Subsidized: -$4,900 @ 3.4%
* Direct Loan; Unsubsidized: -$1,750 @ 6.8% (I pay $100 on this loan)
* Direct Loan; Subsidized: -$4,970 @ 3.86%
* Direct Loan; Unsubsidized: -$1,850 @ 3.86%
* Direct Loan; Unsubsidized: -$4,650 @ 3.86%
* Direct Loan; Unsubsidized: -$3,100 @ 6%

**Savings**

With my current setup, I’m contributing a less than ideal amount towards savings. To attempt to maximize my efforts, I’m considering canceling my current banking savings account and starting a Vanguard savings account to begin investing. I believe there is a $1000 minimum for this. Order of saving is to build up an emergency fund of at least $6000, then push towards saving for a downpayment on a home.

I feel I have a very novice understanding in most of these areas, so confirmation that I'm making the right choices or a nudge in a better direction is greatly appreciated. Thank you for any help!",finance
personalfinance,Inheriting alot of debt in the new year.,"Hi guys, regular reader here and I think I may have posted once or twice. I'm going into the new year with alot of debt. I originally got serious about my finances when paying off a 2004 car I brought in cash and wanting to save. That 2004 has unfortunately met it's end and I spent my contingency fund on a down-payment. Now I'm looking for some sound advice so I don't make any more missteps. 

- I'm 25 and I work full time. I just started putting money into health insurance and I would like to start putting money into my retirement as well. My company won't let me start investing into my 401k until my six month mark, around March but I really want to invest in that as well. What's a good medium that with tax won't cut my checks into a third that I can do that? (After taxes I make about 1400 a month)

- The new car loan with the warranty is about 8,000. The interest is only 4% because I have decent credit and a good payoff history. The monthly is around $217 and with insurance hopefully I can get it down to $200. (I live in an expensive county, and I drive a 2 door). I'd like to start paying on the principal but should I be concerned with paying down the car loan so quickly?

- My student loans are currently at 0$ payments because of my income level, in May that'll stop but when I spoke to them they said more than likely unless I have a very big windfall I'll remain on that. I'd like to start paying something weekly on them, even if it's small. They currently stand at 35,000 which was my cap. I can't take out anymore loans and am in my last year but have deferred.

- I'm planning on getting a small loan for my teeth through financing. I think that the interest rate will be high , but I know I can get approved because of my credit score. I've already spoken to the company about it. It would be around 3,500. This would be the one I'd be most interested in taking on first. I do have dental insurance so it may be less once I pay that deductible. I also have a loan I owe to my mother for travel last year I desperately would like to get rid of in the first quarter of the year. I also was hoping to start investing a little money in an IRA or stocks. (I've been reading alot of r/investing but can't make heads or tails right now of what a portfolio actually is)  

So in short:

Car loan: $8,000
Student Loans: $35,000 
Loan for DW: $3,500
Loan for travel: $2,500

Expenses:
Rent: $300
Insurance: $200
Gas, Incend, etc: $250

Paycheck:
$1,400 monthly. 

What would be a good way to navigate this and save some money and not financially wreck myself? 

Thanks in advance for the help.",finance
Bitcoin,What Gives Bitcoin Value?,"What Gives Bitcoin Value?

Unless you’ve been living under rock, chances are you’ve heard of Bitcoin by now.  Along with hearing about Bitcoin you’ve likely also been told about its rising market price.  At the time of writing this Bitcoin is currently trading for $15748 USD.  That’s a lot of money for a piece of code that can be transferred around on the internet.  The question most people have on their minds after discovering Bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency, is what gives it value?  I hope to help shed some light on this subject.

The main price driving force of Bitcoin is quite simple. It’s supply and demand.  The supply part is easy to explain.  There is currently a little over 16 million bitcoin in circulation.  There will only ever be a maximum of 21 million bitcoin.  The last 5 million which are not in circulation yet will be distributed through a computer process known as mining.  Currently a new 12.5 bitcoins are distributed approximately every 10 minutes to successful miners.  The process of mining for bitcoins becomes harder and harder as there is less available.  The reward (amount of bitcoin you get) for mining also becomes less and less until the year 2140 when the last bitcoin will be mined. 

Having a cap of 21 million bitcoins makes it a scarce commodity.  Bitcoin is not like a government issued fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar, where the Federal Reserve can continue to print more and more causing inflation.  Bitcoin is literally anti-inflation.   Rather than going down in value, it is more likely to go up.  Another factor contributing to this is that many bitcoins are presumed to be lost.  Owners of bitcoin can lose their private keys and if you do, there is no getting it back.  A bitcoin without a private key will be out of circulation and lost forever. There are rumors of a man who lost millions of dollars in bitcoin because he threw out an old laptop which had his private keys on the hard drive.  A lesson learned the hard way for him.  

Now that we’ve covered the supply of bitcoin let’s talk about the demand.  Market demand is the main driving force currently for Bitcoin.  Bitcoin has value basically because people agree that it does.  Bitcoin is traded on exchanges from people all over the world, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Bitcoin exchanges work on a peer to peer platform where you can trade fiat currencies for someone’s bitcoin.   What people are willing to bid or pay for Bitcoin fluctuates a lot on these exchanges and hence we have a ton of volatility.  When Bitcoin was first introduced in 2009 it’s first hurdle was if people would buy into the technology behind.  People weren’t sure if they could trust the technology.  Now we are past that and many people have adopted blockchain tech as a feasible and trusted means of currency.  But ultimately the driving force behind Bitcoin’s price is what people are presently willing to pay for it.

It helps if you think of Bitcoin as an asset like gold or silver and not so much like a US. Dollar.  Gold is a valuable asset, but what makes it valuable and what determines its current price?  The market! And it’s exactly the same with Bitcoin.   The market for gold can go up or down.  It all depends on what people are willing to pay for it.  There are actually a lot of optimistic speculators who claim the market cap of gold is the potential market cap of Bitcoin.  The current market cap of Bitcoin is 160 billion while gold is at 7 trillion.  If these speculators are correct we could see Bitcoin rise a lot higher.

Bitcoin,Big Brother and his lapdog banks giving me even more reason to buy and support bitcoin.,"I left the U.S. a few years ago and I go back as infrequently as possible.  I was pissed to find out this week that I have to make an emergency trip back there.  I was even more pissed at the reason why.  

I'm a partner in a hydroponic supplies store in California and I have to help shop for a new bank that will ""allow"" our business.  The federal government is now putting pressure on banks to close accounts belonging to hydro shops, and the banks are hopping in line to follow orders.  Yep, you read that correctly.  An entire *legal* industry of hard working, tax paying citizens is under siege by a government using extralegal force to manage behavior through control of financial institutions.  

In a nation of laws, what justifies this use of force against a legal business?  If they don’t want these types of businesses to exist there are processes by which laws are enacted to ban or control them.  What gives anyone the right to effectively criminalize behavior outside of this framework?  

Bitcoin is a much needed protection from government overreach.  If they use control of the banks as a weapon against one thing today, don’t be surprised if it’s something *you* care about tomorrow.

Loan Amount | Fixed Interest Rate |

Some of the refinancing options I got quoted on were in the range from 3.64% - 5.625%. (With an average of 4.89% if I calculated that correctly)

I'm guessing that it wouldn't really be worth it to refinance then? I make $50,000 in yearly salary and only have about $600 in bills per month. I've been paying $450 per month on my student loans with the minimum being $385 per month.",finance

Me(27m) and my wife(26f)and I feel like we are finally starting to get on our feet. Student Loans are crippling us.

Anyways- the short of this is my wife just finished school and will be getting a raise at her job due to this degree. She will be going from part time(working during school), to full time hours and making $7 an hour more. 

The numbers:

My income: 65k
Her income: 46k
(Total $111,000)

We each put 3.5% into our 401ks as per our company match. We are working on our emergency fund and plan to use my bonus/tax return as a good holding point(should be about $10,000 total)

I did not include my wife’s future student loan payment because I’m not yet sure what it will be..more on that below 

Student Loans: $130,000 between the two of us. 80k me, 50k her) 

For my loans, only one $5000 portion of it is a private loan. The rest are fixed interest federal or parent plus loans with rates of either 3.8%, 6.8%, and 7.9%(the parent plus loans).  I want to attack the personal loan first if possible.


The dilemma:

I have been on income based repayment since I graduated. The payment above is actually a reflection of what my loan payments will go up to this coming summer.  The parent plus portion of that is about $800. The $450 is for my federal loans. If I follow this plan it would all be paid off in 10 years, but this isn’t factoring in her payments. It’s hard to imagine paying over $1500 a month in student loans. I get it, but there has got to be a better way?

Should I reconsolidate with a program for student loans from a bank with the lower rate and one easy payment?  I’ve seen them advertised with rates of 3.25%. 

How can we work to save SOME money but also pay on our loans.

personalfinance,Want to purchase a VR Headset with PayPal Credit. I would just like to bounce my understanding off of other folks to make sure I'm understand it correctly.,"I just want to say, first of all, that I've been with PayPal for many years... probably 8 years?

I've used PayPal to pay for a lot of things and have never really had any issues. In fact, they've helped me quite a bit in regards to issues with companies that stiffed me on services. I have a 100% charge back success rate with them so far (3 over the course of 8 years).

I'm also very aware of this subs motto of ""If you can't pay for it now, then don't buy it.""

Here's the thing, the VR headset I want to get is about $600. I know that I couldn't pay for it in a single paycheck, but I can definitely do it in 3 paychecks (1 month and a half).

I've always been a very cautious person and have dabbled on the fence with applying for PPC in the past but have always regressed to my fiscally conservative ways (thank you, Grandma) and held off on purchases until I had the money for them. However, back then, I also didn't have a solid income like I do now (Roughly $900~ a month).

I just played VR for the first time a couple of weeks ago at a co-workers house and to me, it was just like what us 80's and 90's kids imagined it would be. It was amazing and currently, there's a really good promotion going on right now for the headset (Effectively an additional $250 off) that's only lasting... maybe one or two days.

I got $200 for Christmas and am getting paid this Friday. Basically, by the end of this week, I'd be able to put $500 towards the credit payment in which case, one more paycheck and it'd be paid off (basically 3 weeks).

So, while I've read up and down the PPC terms and conditions probably 100+ times over the last 8 years (particularly the 'no-interest-for-6-months-TAC), my fiscal conservatism can't shake. I have such a bad perception of credit and the credit industry, loans, and all that nonsense that I've never been able to commit to one. I still don't have a CC and I'm 25.

I just want to bounce my thoughts off people here to make sure that what I'm reading is what I'm understanding.

This purchase will be about $600. I understand that it has zero effect on my credit score.

My questions are this:

1. Is there NO monthly fee for having the credit account? Purchases aside, is there effectively a 'membership' fee?

2. If I the entire amount due before the 6-month period without EVER being late on a payment, do I literally not have to pay a penny more? (The description seems so cut and dry, but I'm so anxious about stuff like this despite paying my car insurance and phone bill online and having years of experience of paying for things online).

3. The APR of 19.99%; I just want to make sure I'm understanding it clearly that if, for whatever reason, I don't pay off the total amount within the 6-month window, I pay 19.99% APR for each month of that term (6 months)? So, in essence, $600 x .19 x 6 which equals ~$684 in APR, or basically $1,200+ because I wasn't able to pay it in time.

4. There's no application fee, yes?",finance

dogecoin,I bought 50k doge 2 weeks ago. im a full stack developer. i want to build something useful that actually uses doge as a currency,"it's 3am and I woke up dreaming about doge e-commerce but when I got into the logistics, in my head, about shipping and utlizing doge to integrate with the likes of usps, ups, FedEx etc i started to have my doubts. these seem like blockers into real world application when most places only accept fiat.

I guess my question is when will crypto be widely accepted to accomplish this? Are there interim partial solutions to integrating doge into online selling?

craigslist, to me, where the person to person exchange is required seems to be the best suitable use for using doge to get products that would normally have to be shipped through a large mail carrier in a smooth transaction.

what sites do you shibes use your coins on, if any? or what types of transactions do you make with doge apart from tipping?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,What to do with a $1000 bonus,"23 year old here. I am getting a $1000 bonus from work and am wondering if I should just sink it all into my credit card debt. I have around a $1000 balance on two cards, one of which has a high interest rate. Beyond that I don't have anything to do with the money other than save it. 

Should I completely pay off that high interest card or save half and pay off half, or just keep chipping away with $200 a month as I have been?

Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,First loan (USA)- some questions,"This is for a school program but not a federally accepted one, so I have 2 main sources for loans. Tuition is $15k and I'll need living expenses since I won't be working so I've decided to take out $18k to be safe.

2 companies work with the school and basically pre-approve all students. I have an offer from each.

*Climb*: 

$18k with a fixed interest rate of 8.44% for the life of the loan (3.5 yrs): 6mo interest only payments of about $132, and after the 6mos it goes to full payments of $596.

$900 flat fee that's factored into the monthly payments

No penalty for prepayment, including during the 6mo interest-only period. This is very important to me since the hope is I'll be getting an awesome-paying job and will be able to pay off the loan earlier than the 3.5 years.

I don't need to start payments for about 2 months.

*Meritize*: https://imgur.com/a/V0nQw
edit: I want to do the 5 year plan

Also no penalty for pre-payment. I'm not required to pay a dime for 6 months (though I definitely will start payments; interest is evil).

What's hard is I can't compare these loans apples to apples. Since Meritize is variable based on LIBOR I've had a really hard time making calculations I can compare with Climb. My solution is to think of a worse-case scenario kind of thing. Even if it's inaccurate, the idea is: let's assume LIBOR goes up by 1% a year, and let's just apply a fixed rate on my whole loan based on year 3. 

Under that model, my fixed rate is is basically 8% on $18k. Doing that math, it comes out a lot closer to the Climb loan than I would have thought. 

Is there a problem with my thinking somewhere? Something obvious I'm missing? Which would you personally take?

Thanks so much people. I'm a classic American in that I have no education in money matters. I only learned what the LIBOR is an hour ago when I was doing research for this.",finance
btc,We've beaten Blockstream and Bitcoin Segwit on second layer scaling solution!,"Tipper bot transactions are not Bitcoin Cash transactions: they are actually our widely used 2nd layer scaling solution!

Tipper bot is a trustful and centralized payment method developed over Bitcoin Cash, which is hardly worse than Blockstream's federated sidechains, that are also trustful and centralized!

But contrary to federated sidechains, it is much simpler, has a much broader reach, as anyone with a Twitter or Reddit account can receive from it, and most importantly, doesn't cost thousands of dollars to maintain, paid directly to Blockstream.

And the biggest irony: such thing can only work on a low fee and predictable confirmation time blockchain, otherwise nobody would be funding the tipper bot nor cashing out.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,I'm planning to pay off 85-100% of my student loans in 2018 - should I delay a few grand to max out a 2017 Roth?,"Hey /r/personalfinance, I'm a 27 year old finance newbie but I've gotten some great advice from this sub so hoping I can get this question answered! I just paid off my private student loans (good lord that was a good feeling) and the goal for 2018 is to either entirely pay off or get close as hell to paying off my federal loans. Assuming my financial situation stays about the same, this should be pretty feasible. 

However, I am very new to investing (as well as PF knowledge in general) and right now I only have a Simple IRA (with match) through work and an Acorns account for some mindless investing. I'm planning to start a Roth but right now most of my income is going toward putting a dent in student loans. I wondered if it would be financially viable to set myself ~1.5 months back and use $5500 to get my Roth IRA started in 2017 rather than 2018? It wouldn't really delay me that much but I just wondered if a year head start would be worth it. Appreciate any advice!",finance
personalfinance,Need advice about Credit Card debt consolidation,"I make around 100k and after a nasty divorce and a flooded house I'm finally stabilizing my finances.  I have everything paid off except around 14k in credit card debt.  I'll be soon moving to a new city and buying a house.  I currently paying down 1,500 a month on the cards but won't be able to get it down much before I move.

My thought is... I will take out a personal loan at a lower interest rate.  For the sole purpose of lowering my revolving account utilization before I apply for a mortgage... hopefully getting a lower rate and better loan.

I'm usually anti consolidation cause it will probably cost me money on origination fee.  But the idea seems good based on the prospect of a better mortgage.

Bitcoin,Federal Reserve too nervous to issue Central-Bank-Issued Digital Currency,"In the [Speech by Vice Chairman for Supervision Quarles on thoughts on prudent innovation in the payment system](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20171130a.htm)

#Central-Bank-Issued Digital Currency

&gt; I am particularly concerned that a central-bank-issued digital currency that's held widely around the globe could be the subject of serious cyberattacks and could be widely used in money laundering and terrorist financing. The effect of all this would significantly divert our focus from work to improve or establish new private-sector retail payment systems based on existing institutions. The prospect of a government-sponsored digital currency might even derail private-sector plans to enhance the payment services provided to their customers, thereby significantly disrupting the financial networks that exist today in ways that could create instability. For example, if payment activity radically shifted from using deposits at financial institutions to using central-bank-issued digital currency, deposits could significantly shrink and potentially disrupt financial institutions' ability to make loans that spur economic activity.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Just fucked myself up by working 2 jobs :(,"So I do sidework for my old boss and submit my hours per diem (~400/week). I made about $30,000 in the last 12 months and I chose to elect 0 deductions for this job. My main fulltime job paid me a salary of $55,000. Both of these jobs deducted based off the assumption it was my only source of income (I can only presume), because when I entered the numbers to guesstimate my refund in TurboTax (using the YTD values from my paystubs), it says I owe close to $5,000 in Federal Taxes (probably because the IRS determines my taxable income to be $85,000 and not $55,000 and $30,000 separately.

personalfinance,A couple of questions about credit card balance transfers,"Hi all, here's my situation:

* Credit Card A (rewards card) has an interest rate of 20% 
* Credit Card B is offering 0% interest on balance transfers for X months

Due to many factors I am now out of money and starting a new job in a week. I won't be able to pay the monthly balance for credit card A until February. So I face a 20% interest rate on that balance. If I choose to transfer the balance to Credit Card B, what are the repercussions?

* Is my standing with Credit Card A affected at all? I will keep that card and continue to use it for all expenses.
* Does this affect my credit score? If it will affect it significantly I can just take the 20% hit. Edit: I just read the credit card wiki and noted that it will affect my credit score as a ""hard inquiry."" How significant is this hit?

I hope this is clear and thanks for your help in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Am I doing this correctly?,"Hi guys (and girls), long time viewer of PF but first time poster. Just wanted to make sure I am on the right track here. 

Here are some of my details: 

Recent college grad making 54k/year I’m taking home about 1325/per paycheck (I get paid bi-weekly) so that is 2650 a month. I make a 6% contribution to my Roth 401k and currently have $1078 in that account and my employer matches it 100% up to 5%. 

I have two savings accounts, one with my local bank that has a little less than 2300 in it and then a capital one 360 account with a little more than 1000 in it. 

I live at home and do not have any expenses other than gas and student loans. My student loans currently sit at 54,463 (26,915 refi and 27,548 federal). The interest rate on my federal ones is 4.37 and the interest rate on my refinanced ones is 6. 

I pay $1700 a month to my student loans with 1400 going to the 6% loan and 300 going to the 4.3% loan. I also pay them bi-weekly. So I pay 850 to my student loans every time I get paid. These amounts are also above my monthly payment so I am paying extra to try and get them knocked out quicker.

personalfinance,Diversification between retirement and non-retirement funds OR Should I have all stocks in retirement and all muni bonds in non-retirement accounts?,"So I have about $110k in retirement accounts and around $60k in non-retirement funds above and beyond my emergency fund stash.  I have always allocated the retirement funds in a risk-for-age appropriate manner.  So right now the retirement money is about 70% stock and 30% bonds.

Having recently increased our household income we are in the 24% marginal bracket for federal and 9% for state.  At a 33% marginal rate, muni bond funds look like a good buy.  So my thought was to go about 75/25 in non-retirement funds (75% in a muni bond fund and 25% in a stock mutual fund).  But in thinking about this more, it seems by being diversified separately in both buckets I am compromising tax efficiency.  Would it not make more sense to go to like 90/10 stocks/bonds in retirement and 0/100 stocks/bonds in non-retirement?  Especially since the bonds are more liquid?

Not to complicate things but to provide more context: I may or may not want to buy a house in 5-8 years.  Have decided for sure not to buy one for the next 5 years.  So I think my time horizon is long enough (and my risk tolerance high enough) to justify investing the $60k in stocks and bonds.  The argument for having more in stocks might be that their higher yield will put me in a better position for a large down payment 7-8 years from now.  Or, if I decide not to buy at all and just rent forever, then I would want to be more in stocks.

Any advice?",finance

We both have great credit and have looked at multiple refinancing options (CommonBond is giving us the best interest rate at 4.4% for a 7 year loan). Our questions are the trade offs: 1) Do we get rid of the personal protections and low monthly payment that is offered by GreatLakes which allows for more monthly budget flexibility and become aggressive about paying off our loans with a private loan that would mean less room for unexpected life events or expenses such as a house? 2) How successful has publican loan forgiveness been so far for others? 3) Has anyone had unexpected expenses come up or life changes that made aggressive loan payment difficult.

So I'd love to hear from redditors of any advice / suggestions / avenues I may not have looked into yet for a banking solution I can be happy with. I'd like for my money to be secure, I'd like to get the best interest rates possible on my savings, and I'd like to not support yet another unethical corporation that supports conservative political agendas that I personally disagree with and don't want to play any role in supporting.

personalfinance,Taking over the Parent PLUS loans for my education that are in my Mom’s name. Any advice?,"Against all odds, my mom raised me and my brothers and helped to put us through college. Most of my loans were in my name, but there were some Parent PLUS loans my mom took out in her own name. I’m doing well financially, and my mom is getting ready for retirement, so after many years of me saying I’d like to take over the remaining loans in her name, she has finally acquiesced.  

My question is whether anyone has done this before, and is aware of tips or pitfalls. A little research suggests I could take them over by refinancing them under my name with a third party like SoFi. This also makes sense because for my existing student loans (currently with Citizens Bank) I have an interest rate that is less than half the rate my mom is paying on those loans. On the other hand, I could instead just pay my mom’s monthly payments and leave them in her name, or if necessary I have savings that I could use to pay the loans off immediately (savings I was holding onto for buying a house; my emergency fund is unaffected).

At the same time, I don’t want to create any artificial and detrimental tax consequences for me or my mom. So if I assume these loans (which were always for my benefit, as they helped pay for my school) I’d like for her not to have to report the amount as income on her taxes if avoidable (But we would of course follow the law if we have to report it on taxes). On the other hand, I have a higher income than my mom and I itemize deductions, so I am wondering if maybe formally assuming these loans and reporting them on my taxes could be a net positive.

TL;DR: I want to take over the student loans my mom has been paying on my behalf, and I’d like to do it smartly and without creating bad tax consequences.",finance
personalfinance,"My fiancée's car loan is at 21% with a payoff amount of $9,200. Any advice in how to get her out of this interest rate?","She had got herself into a car loan at a 21% interest rate and she still has about 3 years to pay off the loan. The payoff amount right now is at 9,200. 

I have mortgage and I would assume im in enough equity to pull a HELOC or I would go for a personal loan. These are preferable options because i would also save money on insurance for the car being that i would hold the title. 

A refinance would require me to co-sigh because her credit os pretty bad and mine is at 720+. Also, that leaves the lender with the title requiring me to pay for collision insurance. 

So i guess my real question is what is a better option between a HELOC or Personal loan?  Please im not really great in understanding finances and i can provide any more info for the help. 

Thank you very much!!",finance
personalfinance,Is refinancing a good option for me?,"Recently I entered into repayment for my student loans and I am sitting at roughly 70k dollars in student debt. Luckily I have been afforded a nice position working and my parents are allowing me to live rent free at home, thus I have been paying quite a bit over my minimum payment for my loans attacking the highest interest loans first. Now I have 11 loans over the 70k with the highest loans being 11.25% and 9.75% and the lowest being around 3%(average of 6.08%).

I have been pre approved for a refinancing with SoFi with interest rates at 5.5% 5 year plan. In your opinion is it worth going through with the refinancing?

personalfinance,reducing PMI prior to refi?,"My wife and I bought a house in june of 2016 for $365k. We put 5% down..credit scores in high 600s (nearly done suffering from the 08 mortgage meltdown crisis).  Interest rate is 4.125% for 30yr fixed.

We now owe $338k and 5 mi comps are in the $425k-$450k range.  We've had a year of perfect payments + extra principle when possible. Credit scores are in the high 700s now.

My plan is to have an appraisal done this summer to see if we're eligible to have our PMI removed completely since we'll likely be in the 75-80% LTV range but I was wondering if anyone has had luck negotiating their PMI down prior to a refi? We're paying $400 per month just for PMI and I've heard it suggested that it's more of an arbitrary percentage based on a number of things including down payment, credit score etc.

My goal with the refi is not to pull equity but reduce the monthly payment.  Hopefully with our credit jump we'll qualify for a lower interest loan and if we can squash PMI at the same time that would be a double bonus!

How likely are we to score a reduction in PMI while I wait for the summer to get an appraisal and see about removing it completely?

Thanks all!

personalfinance,IRS guidance on prepaying property taxes states that taxes must be assessed in order to be dedutible,"From the notice:

&gt;IR-2017-210, Dec. 27, 2017

&gt;WASHINGTON - The Internal Revenue Service advised tax professionals and taxpayers today that pre-paying 2018 state and local real property taxes in 2017 may be tax deductible under certain circumstances.
 
&gt;The IRS has received a number of questions from the tax community concerning the deductibility of prepaid real property taxes. In general, whether a taxpayer is allowed a deduction for the prepayment of state or local real property taxes in 2017 depends on whether the taxpayer makes the payment in 2017 and the real property taxes are assessed prior to 2018.  A prepayment of anticipated real property taxes that have not been assessed prior to 2018 are not deductible in 2017.  State or local law determines whether and when a property tax is assessed, which is generally when the taxpayer becomes liable for the property tax imposed.
 
&gt;The following examples illustrate these points.
 
&gt;Example 1:  Assume County A assesses property tax on July 1, 2017 for the period July 1, 2017 – June 30, 2018.  On July 31, 2017, County A sends notices to residents notifying them of the assessment and billing the property tax in two installments with the first installment due Sept. 30, 2017 and the second installment due Jan. 31, 2018.   Assuming taxpayer has paid the first installment in 2017, the taxpayer may choose to pay the second installment on Dec. 31, 2017, and may claim a deduction for this prepayment on the taxpayer’s 2017 return. 
 
&gt;Example 2:  County B also assesses and bills its residents for property taxes on July 1, 2017, for the period July 1, 2017 – June 30, 2018.  County B intends to make the usual assessment in July 2018 for the period July 1, 2018 – June 30, 2019.  However, because county residents wish to prepay their 2018-2019 property taxes in 2017, County B has revised its computer systems to accept prepayment of property taxes for the 2018-2019 property tax year.  Taxpayers who prepay their 2018-2019 property taxes in 2017 will not be allowed to deduct the prepayment on their federal tax returns because the county will not assess the property tax for the 2018-2019 tax year until July 1, 2018.
 
&gt;The IRS reminds taxpayers that a number of provisions remain available this week that could affect 2017 tax bills. Time remains to make charitable donations. See IR-17-191 for more information. The deadline to make contributions for individual retirement accounts - which can be used by some taxpayers on 2017 tax returns - is the April 2018 tax deadline.
 
&gt;IRS.gov has more information on these and other provisions to help taxpayers prepare for the upcoming filing season.",finance

personalfinance,"Took out a private loan to fund this past fall semester, what does it mean for filing taxes?","Hey guys. Had a quick question and I would really appreciate it if anyone could help me out!

So I just finished my 5th semester at my private university. For the first four semesters of school, my tuition was paid for by a combination of my parents' money and federal direct loans. For this last 5th semester, my parents didn't contribute any money so I funded my tuition through a federal direct loan and a private loan from Sallie Mae. The private loan was for ~$10,000 (with an absurd interest rate). This private loan was NOT cosigned by my parents, but by a close friend of mine. My parents and I had a falling through of sorts before the start of the semester, so they refused to help me pay for college this semester. We're now on good terms though, they said they would continue to help with tuition for my last three semesters.

Every year for taxes, I usually just print out the 1098-t that my school provides me with and give it to my dad. He usually has an accountant fill out our taxes so most of the work is left up to him. 

1. Am I simply to do the same thing again once it is available? Or is there another form I have to request and submit with my tax returns?

2. Is there anything else I have to print or make sure the accountant includes in my taxes? (I think usually I fill out the 1040EZ form) 

3. In general, what does taking out a private loan mean in regards to the possible tax return I might receive? Would I get more or less back?

4. Lastly, does my cosigner have to do anything differently for his tax returns this year? I want to make sure he has all of his tax information correct as well.

Anyways, sorry for the long post but thanks for all the help!",finance
personalfinance,30 years old. Took out 200k cash out refi on my primary home to invest in rental properties. Now I am rethinking everything.,"Just a brief synopsis of my financial situation.  I am 30 years old, no kids, engaged to be married. I own a home worth 700k with a 360k loan, 30 year 4.5 interest rate.  I bought the house back in 2012 for 260k, did a cash out refinance 3 years ago when it was appraised at 500k.  I took out 200k to invest in rental properties. I bought 4 single family homes out of state, all cash, totaling about 120k.  I also bought a 4 plex an hour from where I lie for 180k with my parents with each of us putting 12.5% down.  The loan on the 4 plex is 130k, and that property appreciated nicely as it is now worth 300k.

I recently decided I couldn't deal with owning properties so far away, it was a pain in the ass and costing me a ton of money.  So I sold all of the out of state houses and now I am sitting on 130k in cash.  I still own the 4 plex.  I have no idea what to do with the 130k now.  I live in CA and the market is very expensive, hard to cash flow, and I don't know how much property will continue to appreciate.  Real estate is all I know but I am starting to get burnt out of being a landlord, especially because I work as a property manager as my primary career. Although I suppose I could always hire managers if I found another investment to take the load off.  But the market is dead.

My day to day career consists of managing properties for my family, my salary is about 72k a year.  I sort of regret taking out the 200k, as my mortgage (PITI) now is 2500 a month.  I am thinking of refinancing again to a lower rate.   The 4plex I own with my parents cash flows 400-500 a month.  I have credit card and car payments that cost me 600 dollars a month.  I have no retirement savings.  I basically fell ass backwards into money during the recession, buying a house in a very expensive part of CA at the bottom of the recession.  But my salary can barely pay for my expenses anymore.  It really is paycheck to paycheck.  I own my primary house with my Dad, and if I sell it we would have to pay a ton of capital gains (even with my 250k home owners exemption, because he doesn't live here with me so we would split the gains).

Sometimes I don't know what the hell I am doing with my finances.  What would you do in my situation, particularly with the 130k I have that's just sitting there?  Also do you think I should rent my house out and downsize somewhere else?  Market rent on my primary home is 3k a month and if I refi to a lower rate (3.875 30 year which I think I could get) then my monthly PITI would be 2200 a month.  

I'm at a loss here of what to do, any advice would be helpful.  I don't know if I am missing anything, if you have any additional questions I would be happy to answer  them",finance

btc,The lightning network will have very few users and it will be expensive.,"It will be primarily used by exchanges and large companies.

To get started using the lightning network you need an on chain transaction, it will be a standard fee like it is now. Your funds are then locked and only usable on the lightning network.


In order to be able to route a payment, every channel along the route needs to have enough money to be able to send the payment. Large hubs will route your payments. The hubs funds allocated to your transactions are also locked.

 
The hub can only service so many open channels, this is limited by the amount of capital the hub has.


As long as your channel is open your funds and the hubs funds that are used during this process will be locked.
The channel needs to be routed, it needs capital to support it and it also needs to be monitored 24/7.


That is a service.


The fees won't be like bitcoin transaction fees, **they will likely become a subscription service or interest rate**, much like a the lending going on at Bitfinex, because for the time your channel is in use the hubs funds allocated to the channel can not be used to service other clients.
 
How many users are realistically going to lock funds in lightning to make micro-payments that we are charged a secondary fee for?

You have $100 of bitcoin, pay a $20 on chain transaction to get on the lightning network, then pay 2% or more of whats left to hubs so they route your payments and don't prematurely close your channel before you are ready.",cryptocurrency

What is the smartest way to do that?,"My dad recently came into a lot of money and expressed a desire to help me clear out my student loans.

I had been struggling for the past five years financially. I wish I'd had better advice in college regarding loans and finances, but I didn't, and I have them. Still, I take responsibility and have been paying them off for the past five years (monthly approx. $700 altogether) and have never missed a payment. I now have a more stable job and have been able to pay off a bit more on my own. I would like to be able to save more, and my dad's ""big gesture"" is intended to help me save more money (so he said). I'll also mention that our relationship isn't great, and he's almost impossible to get to sit down to talk about money, so this whole thing has been very vague and unclear for me. 

I have three student loans: two private ($23k and $31k) and one federal (about $4k). The interest rates are 8.39% variable, 9.67% variable, and 3.1% fixed, respectively. I also have two credit cards with balances of approximately 3k each (both with interest rates of about 19%). 

Supposedly my dad intends to help me pay off the full balance of my loans, but for Christmas he gave me a check for $10,000. I believe he intends to follow up with more next year (something about taxes/gift amounts), but in the meantime I'm trying to determine what the best plan of action for me is with this amount. 


I'm thinking it's smarter to put the money toward the balances with the highest interest (the credit cards) and not worry about the smallest loan at all. However, I would like to not have to worry about my loan payments through the year, but making a larger payment isn't going to lower my monthly amount due (as far as I know), and if I put the entire 10k toward the largest loan, that still doesn't help me at all in the short term. I would appreciate any advice on this. Happy to clarify any other questions that come up. Thank you!

EDIT: TL;DR: What's the smartest way to apply a gift of money to my debt?

EDIT 2: I would not be applying the full $10k to my credit cards- I should have clarified. I was thinking of putting $1000 each toward those and then the rest toward my loans.

personalfinance,Does my investment plan make any sense?,"My wife and I are both government/teaching employees with reliable income.  After much deliberation, I've decided to keep teaching, and doing some little dumb things that are required to maximize my income as a teacher.

Our income is about $115k, and will go up to $130k total over the next couple years.  Our expenditures are about $7k a month, but will go down to $6.5k a month next year with truck payments coming off the books.

My wife and I flipped our post-college/grad school home (back when student loans were at 2-3% and student loans could actually cover more than just tuition), and made about $135k on it.  Now, a lot of that had to do with the market climbing between 2005 to 2007, but we did add a bedroom and bathroom, remodeled another bathroom, finished a basement, upgraded the electrical, all to code and permitted.  We bought that house on craigslist, and did a FSBO purchase.  My father is a former real estate attorney, so he generally guides us through the paperwork.

We bought a new house, and took a bit of a bath on it during the real estate crash of 2008/9, but have now built up a bit of equity in it (180k or so).

Our local union-run credit union was willing to extend us a home equity line to 110k at 6% (variable).  It can only go up once a year, though it looks like it's due for a bump up to 6.5 to 7% with the fed likely bumping their rate.

So, this spring we (my wife and the cat) were craigslist lurking, and found a cabin with two parcels for $75k at our favorite ski resort.  We were already spending about $2-3k a year on rentals in the area, and the interest payments for $75k weren't a whole lot more than we were paying in rentals during the winter.  It's a gorgeous property, and probably has some off-season draw as well.

So, we bought it.  We cashed out some ($22k) long-term stocks, as well as our savings.  That gave us $35k of buffer from the HELOC, which we have now paid down to $45k already.  ($75k purchase with $22k down, which we have paid down $8k more in 6 months).  We estimate we can finish paying off the property and cabin in 32 more months or so, having paid $5k in interest.  (Property taxes in the area are exceptionally low, thankfully.)

Because of our ""jobs"" we can only go up to the cabin once every 2 weeks, meaning I think we can put it up on AirBNB/VRBO for the weekends we're not up there.  (Under an LLC, of course.)  We have already turned it from a 1 bedroom (the old layout was stupid) into a 3 bedroom, remodeled the kitchen (laminate flooring is the stuff of gods), installed a dishwasher (I f-ing love Bosch dishwashers.  So sexy.), and put in a ductless heat pump without putting anything else on credit/HELOC.

So, after we pay off the balance of the HELOC and build up some cash on hand, we're thinking of building another cabin on the adjacent property for about $80k, with us putting in about half of the labor in 6 months or so.  I do electrical with my eyes closed, have started working with PEX, and hang drywall.  My wife is actually a really good drywall mud/sander, but hates it.  Everything else would likely be sub-contracted out.

Once the structure is completed, we can refinance the house, allowing us to pay off the HELOC and put it into a traditional mortgage (10 or 15 year) at a lower rate.

This means we would be up to 2 cabins, and could start establishing some real vacation rental income.  We would then purchase properties (can usually be picked up for 15k) as they come available, and do builds or remodels.

I am so accustomed to working 60-80 hours a week that I like to put my energy into something creative and useful.

So, my questions are:

What pitfalls have I not considered?

Has anyone had experience with such a plan?

As long as we don't sell, is our (non-property) tax just going to be based on our net income of the LLC from rentals?",finance

~$7k Student Loans (around 3% interest)
~10k Car Loan (2% interest)

I spent last year paying off $15k in student loans in the 4-6% range, so those are out of the way. Given how low the interest rates are on what's left, I'm tempted to pay the minimum, but might be a bit more aggressive with the remaining student loans.

I put away around $10K into my 401k in 2017, which will be closer to $15K once my 6% match vests in an year's time. I'm planning to max my IRA contribution as well by the deadline - the differential income here will be in the 25% bracket, so I'm planning to use a traditional IRA for 2017.

Looking at 2018, I can afford to max my 401k and IRA with $5-7K leftover after expenses. And based on that differential after expenses, I don't see why I couldn't max those accounts every year after either - especially since I expect income (and frequency/quantity of bonuses) to go up year over year, and plan to move to a lower COL area in the near term. My expenses are already low and seem to be getting lower. (not going to bother breaking out a full budget here, but the rough calculation of $5-7k remaining was done very conservatively)

I don't see a lot of career risk - I'm getting high quality technical experience (military/aerospace) which will always be in demand, and the type of work/projects means I could transition to another industry fairly easily just on the merit of projects I've contributed to. I should have a graduate degree (fully employer financed) done in two years while working (starting at a top school's distance learning program in two weeks), and possibly an MBA by 27-30 if I care to do one. 

Based on this, I would think I could retire sometime in my 40's - maybe sooner depending on how things work out. 

Now I know life will probably happen - unexpected expenses, a spouse/family, and so on, and all of this will be in flux for the future - but I want to lay out plans/goals for the long term as well. Any input is appreciated on the following questions!


**Questions:**

**1\.** Higher level question - it was mentioned to me by someone that you can claim to contribute a dollar figure towards your IRA when filing taxes (i.e. in February), receive your return, and then allocate some portion of that return towards the original IRA contribution figure. Laid out, does this work?&amp;nbsp; 

* Thru January 2018 - Contribute $3k towards 2017 IRA Limit&amp;nbsp;
* February 2018 - File 2017 Taxes, Claim $5k in deductions from 2017 IRA contributions&amp;nbsp;
* March 2018 - Receive $4k in 2017 tax refunds. Contribute $2k of this towards 2017 IRA contributions since it's still pre-deadline.&amp;nbsp;


**2\.** Maxing out my retirement accounts, in my early 40's I'd have around $1M in my 401k, and another $200k or so in my IRA's. Now this money would continue to appreciate from this point to my mid-late 50's pretty dramatically. This leads me to the question - is there a guideline of age to dollars, where one can have too many dollars tied up in age-locked retirement accounts? Does it make sense to contribute aggressively until 30-35, and then peel off those dollars for other investments which aren't age locked - money accessible during my late 40's/early 50's? Or maybe start this approach from now, since I plan to save aggressively in the coming years as well?

**3\.** My employer offers a ""Roth 401k"" option. Considering I'll be knocking down my taxable income considerably in 2018, is it worth having any dollars I earn beneath the 25% (or 22% in 2018) bracket which I've earmarked towards maxing my 401k contribution put into a Roth 401k versus a traditional 401k? 

**4\.** Are there any guidelines on how to diversify dollars saved outside of retirement funds? I know there are guidelines in splitting between stocks/bonds or using mutual funds - but I'm curious with proportioning this with relation to owning land/property, or other ventures. Nothing really planned yet, but something I'd like to keep in mind. 

**5\.** Buying a home is something that will probably happen in the next 3-5 years for me - and once I get settled in an area, I'll start planning in earnest. But, just thinking out loud, would it not make sense to get a 0% Down Loan, and simply refinance as you attained every additional 5% of equity in the home? That way month over month, you can contribute the dollars you would be saving towards a down payment and the dollars you would be spending on rent towards the value of the home - only eating a higher interest rate and mortgage insurance for that differential time. My gut tells me that if the value of the house doesn't change, you come out ahead with this approach from a net dollars perspective, but I'd like more opinions on this. (0% Down might be extreme, but you would still come out ahead with starting at 5% or 10%, no?)

Again, thanks for reading (much longer than I expected), and any input is appreciated. If there's anything I left out, please let me know.",finance
personalfinance,Credit destroyed by failure to pay student loans. Trying to find a way back.,"I’m currently stuck in a financial stand still due to my credit.  I took out several loans (consolidated) to pay for my education.  After a few years on IDR and a couple thousand extra when I could, I still owe about $50,000.
I had a tough year and let the payments get away from me for a couple of months.  My FICO score went from around 680 to 450 because of this.

I’ve reached the end of my 36 month car lease and now have to either buy out, lease another vehicle, or walk suffering $1300 in excess mileage penalties. Due to my ravaged credit, I cannot qualify for a loan with my bank or credit union - leaving me with only the car dealer’s 60 month 21% interest financing.

I know a few things I should’ve done - establish credit early on with a credit card and punctual payments.  Pay my student loans on time.  Etc.  I don’t think I can make the payments on my car at that high of an interest rate and still get by.  I’m 25 with little experience in credit and only a hardworking penny pincher’s approach to understanding financing as a whole.  Any advice on how to handle a lease buyout in my circumstances or how to quickly rebuild credit would be greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,"Detailed Budget Sheet with Analysis, over/under warnings, debt tracking, and daily spending sheets","###I want to preface with the fact that this worksheet is a work in progress and as such there may be some bugs that need to be worked out, as well as some improvements that can be made. So if anyone that is rather skilled in excel finds a way to improve it, please let me know so that it can become better for anyone who decides to use it.

I decided a long time ago that I needed a budget, and with the help from this sub I was able to create one. Over time I wanted different features, and as such, the budget morphed into something else as I pulled idea and features from either other workbooks or ideas I came up with on my own. The Home page of this worksheet has instructions on how to use it, but I will cover it here as well.

##[Home Page](https://imgur.com/dmD1liZ)

This sheet as you can see, has instructions on how to use it, and with what method you choose to go forward with, either the quick budget version, or the more detailed budget by month version. The only part that is not described here is the Debt_Tracker since I just recently added that this month for the new year.

##[Quick Budget](https://imgur.com/RF6Adpd)

This sheet is the quick budget option. You can enter the frequency of an item, and is suited for someone who has set payments and spending habits for the year. Those who have things that vary would prefer to use the monthly sheet. If you choose to use the Quick Budget version, then make sure to select it for your comparison sheet. 

##[Budget By Month](https://imgur.com/0qnSkjD)

This sheet is the one I use, and is the meat and potatoes of any budget. You can enter the income sources if they change, and the expected expense for each category over the months of the year, with the yearly totals shown to the right. Category names can be changed here, and it will be reflected throughout the workbook. The debts category pulls names from the debt tracking sheet. The starting month can be changed, and the different categories can be selected for the budget summary visuals. Rows can be added for more subcategories, or hidden for ones that only have a few that are needed. 

##[Debt Tracker](https://imgur.com/TBk3jTH)
This sheet is still a work in progress, more so than the others. As it is now, The debt names column will populate the same category on any of the other sheets. The Starting balance should be the balance for the month of Jan (if you are using it starting fresh this year) and the interest rate should be entered as a percentage, 3% for example. If the interest rate is left blank, calculations will be made as if there is 0% interest. The months pull the payment data from the budget sheet, and subtract it after interest is calculated and added to the principal using the following formula

    =((D5+(D5*Days_since_last/365*E5))-(Budget_By_Month!E168))

I plan to link this properly to the rest of the workbook, as well as add visuals, but I literally just threw it in earlier this week.

##[Tracking](https://imgur.com/5WUtne4)

This sheet pulls all the relevant date from the budget section, and the daily spending sheets to give you a high level overview of your performance. If you are under budget, it will tell you so, and if you are over, it will tell you too. You can get granular and see which category in which month you blew it. The Chart selection drop down allows you to select specific periods for the visuals.

##[Comparison](https://imgur.com/YJJlRo0)

This sheet gives a more in-depth look than the preceding sheet. The drop down allows you to select the time period. This sheet is a direct comparison for your budget. 

##[Analyzer](https://imgur.com/0F3hCVb)

This sheet analyzes each month, or time period you select from the dropdown and gives you more visuals. The Spending by month visual breaks down into the different categories. Planned upgrades to this sheet are having the subcategories listed in the Top Over Budget visual instead of just numbers.

##[Daily Spending](https://imgur.com/kExz973)

This sheet is the important part of any budget. Keeping track of what you are actually spending. **USE THIS DAILY** for maximum effect. Depending on how detailed you are here, the rest of the workbook will have better data to work with. You can add notes to any cell for even more record keeping. I have this workbook in my dropbox and it is saved on my phone so I can open excel while out on the go and enter data and it will automagically be there when I get to my laptop or desktop.

That is pretty much it for the workbook. Again, if anyone has any suggestions for improvement, please let me know. Good luck in 2018.

personalfinance,"23, Big College Debt, How to Start Saving","I am 23 years old and graduated college one year ago with about 70k in student loans.

I currently have a full time job that pays $35k a year and nets me about $2,140 per month. I am currently living with parents and wanted to start putting the money into an IRA, but realized that this debt is just going to be hanging over my head.

My job is also weighing on me. 35k/year is about 20k under what the average pay for my job title is, but I feel stuck because there is a stipulation in my contract that if I leave the company I need to pay back the $~8000 in education expenses that they have payed toward my masters (not sure if that would hold up, but it's there). I'm at this job being asked to justify why I deserve even $5k more a year.

That being said, I work in a field where I am in-demand in government (local, state, and federal) opening up PSLF (40k of my loans are federal) as a possibility.

What is the best way to go about saving? Would it be better to throw $1,500 a month at the student debt now while I'm living at home and contribute the minimum to retirement? Or would it be better to contribute less to student loans and more to retirement?

Also, I was looking at consolidating the private portion of my loan (750+ credit score with no other debt, which could probably get those to about 5% interest) and leaving the federal alone because of the PSLF possibility. Is that the right call?

Sorry for all the questions, I am just lost and overwhelmed on the topic.

investing,Help me understand the pros/cons of REITs.,"So I will say first off that I'm looking at putting a REIT ETF into my IRA, so I understand the dividend/tax benefits of that. From what I've read, REITs seem like a ""too good to be true"" investment for those *focused on income*. Additionally, I saw [this image recently that showed REITs outperforming all other asset classes over the long term.](https://i.imgur.com/4a3rcqn.png)

My main concern is I've read the dividends can be given as simply a return on capital--is there any way to see how often a REIT does that? I've also read conflicting statements on rising interest rates: A) It makes REITs take on more debt vs B) Rising interest rates is tied to a rising economy so more people will invest in RE.

personalfinance,"Dutch 25 yo (M), unsure future, asks advice about his 7k ""savings""","Hello there, longtime lurker here! I have to explain a lot of things about the Dutch system to make you guys understand my situation, hope you're up for it, thanks in advance.


I'm finding myself in the position that I almost graduate in a pretty unemployable degree (Intercultural Communication) and that I have about €2000 in my regular account and €7000 in my savings account I don't know what to do with.


The point is that of all this money, none of it is mine, I owe €25,000 to the Dutch state in terms of student loans. I have no job lining up for me once I graduate and I have no idea what I will be doing next. 


The Dutch system works as follows: once you graduate they check your student debt in that point and that's the figure that will be semi-public for banks and other financial institutions to check if you can apply for a mortgage or a car loan and the likes. This figure will be the figure that pops up if a bank asks information about you until you paid of every single penny, so in my personal situation it's gonna be either €25,000 until it is €0 if I don't do anything from this point on.


The interest rate for loans is state regulated and will be 0% in the next five years, after that theoretically anything can happen but it's very, very unlikely that it will ever get higher than 2% percent. I have to start paying back in two years and the monthly minimum that I have to pay is the amount that would make me payoff my debt in 35 years with interest. If after 35 years you still have a debt, that debt will be canceled. 


It is important to know that healthcare is no issue, if I get an accident, rare disease or anything I pay a maximum of €385 a year in addition to the monthly €120 I already pay. My parents are not wealthy in any way and I need some €800 to get by on a month. 


My question is this: Should I put an amount (let's say €5,000) in lowering my student debt before they establish this figure so that I will end up with a lower student debt for the coming 10(?) years. Or is it more important to have this emergency fund now or do something else with that money? Regarding work: I expect to find some shitty minimum wage (€10 net) anytime, the economy is growing finally in again in The Netherlands and I live in a city where there's a demand in all kinds of sectors, this is however almost always temporarily work for minimum income. 


I'm afraid only being able getting a shitty mortgage if I have a €25,000 debt on my name: even though in reality it might be possible that in that moment it is still only €5,000, for example.   



Any recommendation or comment will be appreciated, have a nice day you all!

personalfinance,Why do people treat credit cards as if they are a bad thing?,"I’ve noticed this attitude from friends, and especially family, when I discussed getting a new credit card recently. I ran into a few unexpected, pretty large bills. While I could have paid them outright from savings, I opted to grab a 2nd Credit Card and dump it all on there. 

Now when I mentioned this plan to family and a few friends, most reacted the same way - mainly that holding credit card debt is a bad thing, I should be just clearing the costs outright and not bothering with the credit card. 

The card I went for offered 30 months at 0% on purchases, and a couple of the bills I got allowed me to split the cost over a couple of months, at no extra cost. So instead of taking a big chunk out of my savings, I can comfortably pay these costs off over 2 and a half years, at no extra cost, while also improving my credit card rating. If I was doing this with a stupid interest rate, and I couldn’t handle the monthly payments, I could possibly see their point.

personalfinance,I need help deciding where to apply extra student loan payments [Credit][Debt][Planning],"My credit keeps getting rejected and one of the reasons stated is that I owe too much money on my outstanding loans. I am saving up for a real estate purchase within the next 1-2 years, so I am hoping to improve my credit score rather quickly.
I have three student loans, all with the same interest rate 6.8% with different amounts, 4k, 6k, and 8k. I screwed up early on (I'm on track now) so I currently owe more than the principal. I plan on paying an extra 400 
each month, and I think I have a couple of options.

1) Pay minimum on all three loans. Make an extra payment of 400on the loan with the smallest balance.

2) Pay minimum on all three loans. Make an extra payment on each loan proportional to the principal i.e.
88 on the 4k loan, 133 on the 6k loan, 177 on the 8k loan.

Both options ""cost"" the same, so I'm wondering if the credit implications are any different. Using two years as a reference point, option 1 allows me to pay off completely pay off the 4k loan and the 6k loan. Option 2, allows me to bring down the to half, but will not fully pay off any of the loans.

Note: The situation is a little bit more complicated...I have several more loans with balances above the principal, but those interest rates are below the 6.8% so I'm only going to pay the minimum on those.

It's very possible that both options are the same from a credit stand point, but I'm not sure if either is more of a benefit. Is it better to have more loans paid off...or is it better to have a bigger balance paid off the principal on ""Active"" loans.",finance

Ripple,XRP COST MODEL PAPER : back to the fundamentals,"https://ripple.com/files/xrp_cost_model_paper.pdf

Any XRP investor should read this piece.
A few highlights :

""Our respondent bank that processes $12 billion in international transactions a year (over 5
corridors with an average transaction size of $6,30019) can assume a conservative, estimated
$10 million one-time cost of deploying Ripple and a payback period of just over 11 months.20
As noted above, integration costs will vary depending on the bank size and infrastructure, but a
bank’s associated savings would accrue faster for a larger bank due to higher payment volumes,
resulting in a comparable payback period to the model.""

""Specifically, Ripple can eliminate 6.8 bps or $18 billion24 annually in liquidity and payment
operations costs. Implementing Ripple with XRP, which further improves liquidity and treasury
operations costs, can lead to a total savings of 8.8 bps or $23 billion25 annually. As the volatility
of XRP approaches that of a global currency basket, cost savings can amount to 12.6 bps
or $33 billion26 annually. Furthermore, as banks globally adopt Ripple and as liquidity costs
are eliminated, there is a real possibility that the marginal cost of international transactions
approaches zero. To accelerate market thickness and reduce volatility for XRP, Ripple will soon
introduce an XRP incentive program to algorithmically rebate market makers who provide
liquidity through XRP. ""

""Ripple and XRP offer the same benefits of
cost savings and collateral elimination to all corners of the global financial system. Collateral
usage has been on the rise in areas of particular relevance for financial stability. Trillions of
dollars are trapped in collateral accounts to support repo and reverse repo transactions, offset
counterparty risk in the derivatives market, and minimize credit risk in payment and settlement
systems. To give just one example, in the $100 trillion-plus market for non-cleared interest rate
swaps, $5 trillion in collateral was required to offset OTC counterparty risk in 2014, while the
margin for cleared derivatives rose to $455 billion.""",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Trying to find fault with two arguments supporting the standard student loan repayment plan.,"I will graduate with a professional degree with roughly $200K in federal student debt. Single with no kids, car, or house, and living *very* frugally, I can pay this off in 5 years. This was my plan until I visited my family this holiday and they all advised me to use the standard 20 year term using two arguments:

1) The value of today's dollar is higher than tomorrows. Inflation will happen, raises will happen, 401k's will always increase. My student loan is fixed for 20 years. ""Why pay off today's dollar when you can pay off a smaller future dollar?"" 

Under this argument, they essentially said I would be ""wasting my 20s"" by living frugally, which is more of a personal choice I understand. 

2) The amount I would be saving in interest (if I payed off my loan in 5 years) would be much smaller compared to investing that same capital at a standard 8% return. If I invested instead of paying off my loans, I would have roughly 400K in the bank when I am 54 and the remainder of my loans would have been forgiven (if loan forgiveness programs still exist).  

r/personalfinance seems like a big proponent of paying off debt as soon as feasible and I am interested in your stance using the above arguments. I'm not looking for tailored information as much as I am the general thought behind using the standard repayment plans vs. paying off debt as fast as possible. Perhaps paying off debt after a professional degree isn't the right move?

Thank you!

personalfinance,Company gave me an almost insulting amount for a raise.,"tl;dr at the bottom

I’m 25 years old and this is the first time I’ve requested a raise with this company. I make 36k/year currently. I’ve worked here for a little under two years. I work 50 hours a week AT MINIMUM as well as being on call one weekend a month, which requires me to go in for a few hours on Saturdays and work from home the rest of the weekend.  

Since I started here, I’ve held three different positions. In the first position I held I was one of, if not the, top performers in the company. My numbers were always at the top in the monthly company-wide newsletters and whatnot. About 7 months into my employment there, they asked me to help start a brand new department for the company. I was excited for the opportunity so I accepted. I did not receive a raise for my time but was given the opportunity to finally make commissions off my work. I was okay with that. Day 1 was just me and two Vice Presidents for our company. I was the one who trained every new hire for this new department. And now the department has almost 20 people in it.  

About another 6 or 7 months into my new position, I ended up hating the work. I never slacked off and still pulled consistently high numbers, but it was not what I wanted to do at all. So, I approached one of the VPs and told them. They were fine with it and actually offered me a position to work on an exclusive team for our company’s largest client. By taking this new position, I lost the opportunity for commission. Again, I didn’t mind that.  


I have never been a complainer. Ever. I express my feelings and opinions on things, but I never whine about the workload or anything. The team I am on is horribly understaffed. My boss knows it, the others in the office know it, everyone knows it.  My direct supervisor even said out loud that I, me personally, have too much work and that people shouldn’t be coming to me with issues because I need every minute I can to try and stay caught up. After just a few months, we have over double the workload we originally had from our client which is great, but have had 0 additions to our team. And if I’m being honest, the other members of my team are unreliable and/or checked out from the job. It’s annoying. However since we are so short staffed for this team they don’t want to make any cuts and instead are taking forever to bring on a new member for the team.   

So I finally decided to request a raise. I obviously didn’t mention this when asking for the raise, but I know what others in the team and throughout the office make. Everyone’s work is easily measured and accessible for literally anyone else, so I know the kind of work and numbers people put up. I can say that without a doubt I am probably the most productive person on this team, and in the entire office itself. There’s not a shadow of a doubt about it.  


It took them two weeks to come to the decision of giving me a 2k raise. This would put me on par with the SECOND least paid person in this office. With others making 40-43k, and some of those have commissions too.   

I went back to my boss and explained that this would’t cut it as not only are my student loans increasing by almost $2400/yr in a few months, but that I know I deserved more than that. My work was worth more than that. That day I went on Christmas vacation and I won’t be returning until January 2nd.  


On one hand, I love the people I work with and the company culture, but me liking my job doesn’t pay the bills. I’m eager to see what they decide when I get back, but should I just go ahead and start submitting my resume to other companies?  


Any insight or advice you guys can give me is appreciated.

personalfinance,Understanding how my taxes are broken down -- how does tax bill affect me?,"So, I am trying to figure out how the tax bill affects me, and I am using the tax calculator here:

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/17/upshot/tax-calculator.html

This thing says I will get about a $4,200 tax cut. Other tax calculators say I can expect to pay around $25,000 in taxes. This is for income between my wife and I.

I am looking at my last paystub, and the total taxes I payed this year were 38,829.57. The break down is:

Federal: 19,605.2
SS: 7886.42
Medicare: 1864.11
State: 9445.00
State WBF: 29.04

My income is around the $130k mark and my wife's income is around the $40k mark. My annual before-tax deductions (health savings, 401k, etc) is 9,440.

All figures above are just mine, not my wife's. 

So my question is: when the tax calculators say I can expect to pay $25,000 in taxes, is that JUST federal withholding, or is that federal withholding plus social security and medicare? 

I am a little worried that we might owe taxes this year (and next year when the tax plan takes effect) because my federal withholding is quite a bit below the 25,000 mark. This is, of course, excluding my wife's taxes but she doesn't make much so it's not like she pays a lot in taxes.

We file jointly, we have no kids, and we don't have property. My wife isn't yet doing a 401k or a health savings account (she will this coming year, but for 2017, no. She also only worked for half of a year, so her total income is around $25,000).",finance
btc,Just posted this to r/bitcoin: HODLing since before the word HODL came to be. Run a few crypto businesses. BTC fees are effing me.,"Hello r/bitcoin.  I rarely post, but after going through an end of year audit on all our systems, I had to come on here and post this.

Over the last 6 years I have been fortunate enough to be involved in the bitcoin space and see the amazing growth.  Due to me being involved in a few businesses, I have received tens of thousands of BTC transactions over the years, most of which are very minuscule.  These payments were for various reasons, but let's just say that due to doing the ""right"" thing, I mostly never reused any wallets for payments, except for some hot wallets.  Each of those small transaction ended up in a new wallet address and hasn't moved since.

With fees the way they are, I have no hope of moving the low value ones anywhere any longer.  The fees are just too high.  These collectively add up to dozens of BTC right now.

WTF happened to micro-transactions?  WTH is core doing saying this is meant to be ""Digital Gold / Store of Value"".  I effing signed up for electronic cash, not for a transaction layer that can only be used by the rich.  

I'm sure I'm not the only one with this problem.  There must be thousands of BTC, maybe even tens or hundreds of thousands of BTC stuck in wallets that don't have enough to cover the transaction fees.

And you guys think this is OK?  And you keep applauding and supporting a development team that thinks that this is the way to move forward????  Newbies are being turned off by paying $40-$80 fees on each TX.  Moving a $100 and paying 50% of that on fees is not evolution. 

Just to show you how EFFED this is:  I just bought a ""bitcon"" domain and the seller wanted payment in ETH, LTC or BCH because of the fees involved with BTC.

You guys keep touting the benefits of SegWit, Lightning Network and efficient overview of the Mempool to make transactions.  Newbies don't know any of that.  If that is what you guys expect will be the saviour to this network you are HIGHLY DELUSIONAL.  

STOP. THINK. This is BULLSHIT.

2018 is the year people will realize BTC is dead as it is and move to alts.  LN will not help move ""dust"" BTC.  SegWith won't help there either.  Newbies are going to turn to other coins.  Even old-schoolers like me are saying screw all this.    You guys can keep circle-jerking each other on the price.  Price goes up just as fast as it can come down.  With things the way they are, there will be a reckoning by way of flippening some day soon in the future.  

Please don't let this amazing project die due to these 3rd generation core developers effing all of us over for their so-called ""improvements"" to BTC that do next to NOTHING to help this DIRE SITUATION we are in right now.  

INCREASE THE BLOCK SIZE ALREADY TO HELP ALLEVIATE THIS PROBLEM FOR AT LEAST A SMALL TIME BEING.  Yes it's not a long term solution, but even LN will require a min of 150MB blocks to meet the demands of the planet.  If it needs to be done eventually, why not RIGHT NOW to stop these pain in the ass fees.  

Let's see if this post makes it thru the r/bitcoin moderation / stays up / trolls come out.

I don't think the Joshua Tree thing is actually an option, but I like the idea of a more high maintenance investment, something that I can be more actively involved in. Where my return on investment is more directly correlated to time and effort I put into it. -----Again, this could also be the stupidest thing I can do, that's why I am asking you guys!

personalfinance,Credit Reporting - Credit keeps removing and re-reporting same late payment - options?,"Hey Redditors,

I have 26 accounts with Fed Loan Servicing (student loans) and during the process of a loan repayment plan, the creditor reported all 26 accounts 120+ late past due in march of 2017. They specifically stated that no credit reporting will be done during the process, which took 4 months (120 days), but they ended up reporting me anyways. That dinged my credit about 300+ points in 1 month! ridiculous, i know...!

So, I spoke with them in regards to this issue and they said there is nothing they can do about it anymore since its been reported. I was pretty furious and decided to contact Lexington Law firm and signed up with them. 

This past September, 3 of the Fed Loan Servicing accounts removed the 120+ days past due mark off my credit due to Lexington Law Firms actions(upped my credit). October, same exact 3 were added back on (dinged my credit once again). The firm sent another dispute and November it was removed once again (upped my credit). 

And here we are now...Damn creditors, reported the SAME 3 accounts 120+ days past due, which dinged my credit ONCE AGAIN!

I spoke with Lexington Law Firm and they said that there is nothing they can really do besides send a notarized letter to the creditors which i agreed to do. 

The thing is...I have 26 accounts with Fed Loan Servicing, this is only happening to 3 of them...imagine all 26 being removed and readded back on every month -_-

CryptoCurrency,Concerning Raiblocks (Long post),"**Warning: I am going to be as objective as I can about this coin, but I realize it might look like heavy shilling. However you can check my history to see that I have never really shilled for anything, ever.**

So, Raiblocks has taken the crypto community by storm in the last few days. I got in relatively late, due to not trusting projects that I cannot understand, and the whitepaper went over my head the first 10 times I read it. But I got in at 1$ for a few Rai, and boy was I happy I did.
But after getting them on the actual wallet, I bought more at 3$... and more at 5$ and 11$. Because it works, and because I was fed up with Bitcoin.
And I have experience with the early days of Bitcoin (messed around since 2013). And Raiblocks *feels* like early Bitcoin.

But how can a (practically) single-man project become a billion dollar project overnight? It does not allow for anything except the instant, feeless transfer of value in a truly decentralized network. No Dapps like ethereum, no privacy like monero. No banks involved like Ripple, no lending like SALT, no charging your car with m2m transactions like IOTA. Just transactions.

But maybe that is what we actually *need*, and what drew me, and so many others, to the project. People never asked for fancy million dollar ICO projects that promise the world and end up having no actual product or being vaporware. Bitcoin itself was a single-man project and a stroke of genius. Raiblocks could be the same. And now, I believe that maybe that is its true potential. In addition, I absolutely loved the distribution through captchas over many months, and the fact that it was sitting at a stupidly low marketcap for half a year, as no one will ever be able to claim that it was unfairly distributed (I'm looking at you, dash)

To be fair, Raiblocks has one big con, and it is the reason I am not fully invested in it yet. It is brand new code, and untested. If I want to be fair with myself, I actually give it a more than 70% chance that it will not hold up to scrutiny and will fail spectacularly, and I am psychologically prepared for it. I don't care as much about the price at this point as I care about Come-from-Beyond's (and other specialists) audit of the code. If there is a fatal flaw to be found, I'm sure he won't miss it. Of course, there is also a good chance that the whole project is the biggest pump-and-dump since Verge, but I doubt it, so I will risk that.

If in the following weeks/months Raiblocks holds up to code auditing and the (unavoidable) attacking of its network, it has a chance to be what I waited for: Bitcoin 2.0. And yes, it will deserve a trillion-dollar valuation.

P.S. There is another, darker side on why I am not fully invested. It's technology is so revolutionary, that it is a threat to not only miners, but also to people that got rich on coins such as litecoin, vertcoin and other ""Bitcoin-complementary"" coins that completely lose their value proposition when faced with a minerless, feeless and infinite capacity coin. But, most importantly, it threatens the monetary status quo (banks etc) in the same way the early bitcoin did. Which, at this point, is crippled (maybe intentionally), giving banks a chance to conquer crypto with their Trojan horse, Ripple. Raiblocks, as a small team project, is vulnerable to being bought out and killed in its crib, or having the developers threatened in order to stop it. I hope that these are irrational fears, but they give me sleepless nights and I had to get it out there.

Both loans are backed by the DOE and I've been under the PAYE plan since graduating (about four years ago). Both loan amounts right now total to about $250k, with a (wonderful) interest rate of 7.9%. 

My salary is about 63k gross, or ~$3,200 a month after taxes. Under PAYE, I currently pay $350 for both loans. If I were to pay down the principle, the payments would eat up most, if not all, of my paycheck (something like $2,900). Interest only payments would be about $1,370. Still a significant chunk and would ruin a debt-to-income ratio if I ever wanted to buy a house. 

Other expenses are minimal because I'm frugal. Cash savings is about 75k due to a prior high paying job and a legal settlement. 401K is about 30-40k. Rent is only $300/mo because I recently moved back home to help save money. 

If I continue in the PAYE program, the principle will be forgiven in 14 years with a huge tax bill.

So I can continue to save aggressively, put money into my 401K, and not live like the working poor if I remain in PAYE. If I make interest level payments, then I'd be subsisting on half my income and would really hamper my ability to save for a house or something.

personalfinance,"Unemployment filing date confusion, did I screw myself?","I worked as a US Forest Service Wildland Firefighter in California from May until November 2017. This was my first fire season, and also my first time filing an unemployment claim after.  

When I filed at the end of November, the person who filed my claim told me that she couldn’t see what my benefit amount would be since I was a federal worker and it takes time for the government to submit wage information to them. 

I told her I worked mainly in the summer and wanted to make sure I would be getting the most benefits I could based on my income. I was under the impression that my benefit amount would be updated based on when they got my federal wage information. She couldn’t tell me what that amount was, but when I got my 150$ a week benefit amount, I was pretty confused at such a low amount. 

I spoke again to someone from the unemployment office asking if that was taking into consideration my highest quarter, and she seemed confused saying that they hadn’t received my highest quarter information if that was Jul Aug Sep and that I would have had to file in January for those quarters to be included. 

So basically my claim was based off a total income of 1800$, instead of the 12,000$ I made during my highest quarter. 

I’ve been panicking and just spoke to an unemployment filing specialist who said he will try to get my claim cancelled, but that since I’ve already accepted 1 week’s worth of benefits (150$) that it may be futile. He said it’s easy to cancel a claim unless you have accepted money, but that I could pay back the 150$ and then have a chance of cancelling the claim and refiling in January for full benefits.

I’m so confused, he said I would have gotten 1800$ a month versus the 600$ a month I now am going to be given for filing in November instead of January. Why wasn't any of this explained to me when I filed, I was led to think that it would update to include my highest quarter?

btc,"There Are Actually 2.4 Billion Bitcoin, If Measured As Real Money","Most of BTC's maximalists like to champion the ""limited supply"" of BTC, justifying the price by claiming there are only 24 Million. Yet, BTC is also divisible by a million, hence the price in Satoshis. The same is not true of any FIAT currency, which is only divisible by 100.

With the dollar, you can only divide and move decimal place by 100, two units to the left. $2.99 is a thing. $2.993746253 is not. We have agreed that a penny, 1/100th, is the smallest unit. If Digibyte was sold at a store, and the price fell to half a penny, the minimum the store would be able to sell is two DGB. There are no half-pennys. Same with a bank. A $2.99626472 charge shows up as $3.00. Insert Office Space virus scam here.

So, if the Fed decided to declare a thousand dollar bill ""one USD,"" making the USD unit more limited and divisible, then a cup of coffee would be 0.0035 USD. The ""one"" unit may be higher by definition ($1,000 = 1 ""USD"") but it's still the same out of pocket expense (half an hour of minimim wage labor). It does not mean they cut the ""supply"" of USD down. It means they used postmodern economics to reduce the supply by redefining what ""one"" USD unit is.

AS LONG AS BTC IS BEING SOLD FOR CURRENCY, the USD/CNY/EUR decimal places determine proportional supply as well as spending power.

Bitcoin is 1,000X more divisible than any currency or price tag. Thus, if held to currency standards, there are actually (1,000 x 24 Million) ""whole"" BTC (and 100x that amount of useable units, pennys, smallest amount accepted, etc).

So, there are 2.4 Trillion useable units of BTC. If units of BTC worked like any other currency, that would mean there are (2.4 Trillion divided by 100) whole units.

24 Billion BTC, folks.

This math would put BTC at a maximum of $197 or so, currently $140. May drop to $80, but probably will floor at $100. Hmm...history repeats itself.

TL;DR: It doesn't matter how many are mined as long as the goal post (decimal place) can keep moving. Until any other currency adopts the 1/1,000,000th divisibility, this will be true.

TL;DR;420

I have a ""bag"" of weed. It's an ounce. I cut in in half, two half ounces. I now have two ""bags"" of weed. Did the supply of weed just double? Nope. I just made it more divisible. Think of ""one BTC"" as a ""bag"" of money. It's only as limited as you want it to be. I can declare a pound to be the accepted unit of ""bag,"" claim that most stoners will never own one entire bag of weed and charge $17,000 a pound because there are ""only 24 Million bags"" of weed in the world.

personalfinance,Keep whole life insurance?,"Hello PF! Stuck on making a decision in regards to keeping a whole life insurance policy and hoping to get some outside opinions.  
  
Roughly 2.5 years ago, before I had my current financial knowledge, I signed up for a whole life insurance policy at age 24 through advice from my parents. It's valued at $250,000 from Transamerica Premier and I currently pay $150/month for it. A few months after I got the policy, I was diagnosed with an life-long autoimmune disorder that I feel would drastically increase my costs if I were to sign up for one today.  
  
My dilemma is I'm currently trying to buckle down and reduce my monthly expenses to greatly increase my take-home savings rate at the end of 2018(shooting for 40-50 percent). I also have some debt(18k student loans and about 9k across credit cards, mostly on a sub 10 percent interest rate card) that I'll be diligently working to pay off before I realize the high savings rate mentioned above. I'd love to put the extra $150/month towards the debt to pay it down faster but I'm unsure if I'll regret tossing the policy? I don't have any idea if I'm getting shafted for the premium as I don't know anyone else besides my parents ts with a whole life policy.  
  
Part of the reason I originally got the policy was to cover a home I owned so it would stay in my family if I passed away. I've since sold the property, and don't intend to have a mortgage payment that large ever again. None of my debts(except student loans?) are co-signed by anyone and I have 3 other life insurance policies(1 thru work, 2 from parents) totaling about $120,000 and the premiums are minimal/not paid by me. 
Should I drop the policy in the near future? I already have plans to reduce my spending in other categories in the next few months that should be equal to or more than my monthly premium. Getting rid of it would only help me realize my goals faster.

I'm pretty sure I'm being scammed, but I'm naturally cynical so I need reassurance. 

I own a horse and recently listed a saddle for sale on a Facebook group where you can buy/sell tack and apparel. A buyer reached out to me with interest and we started texting about the saddle. She is apparently a business owner and wanted to use a personal courier/moving service to receive the saddle rather than have me ship it. Okay, fine. 

She goes on to say the lowest amount she can deduct from her business account is $900, and she wants me to wire the rest via Walmart to Walmart transfer (I sold the saddle for $300) back to the mover's accountant. Okay, weird. The check got here via FedEx, and says it's from a ""Pamela"" in South Dakota. The original person who reached out to me on Facebook was named ""Misael"" and her Facebook profile says she's from Florida. I looked up this persons phone number and it says it's from PA. The accountant is supposedly in Georgia. Even more suspicious. 

To wire money, it's $50. She said to take that out of the money as well as $30 for the hassle.

personalfinance,Am I Fucked For Not Making Estimated Tax Payments On A Large Capital Gain From June?,"I'm trying to pre-pay my state tax for 2017 tomorrow as it's the last day this year banks are open, so I don't have time to discuss this with an accountant. The reason I'm doing this is so I can deduct the state tax against the federal tax liability. 

I realized a large amount of capital gains in 2017. These were split about 50/50. One realization in June and one in December.

I have only ever made income from salaried jobs prior to 2017 so I had no idea that estimated tax payments were even a thing.

When I realized the gain in June, I held enough for when I would file taxes. Now I've realized that because of ""estimated tax payments"" I should have paid the tax in June and I'm subject to a penalty. 

From the [2017 IRS Estimated Tax Payment Form] (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040es.pdf):

&gt; General Rule
In most cases, you must pay estimated tax for 2017 if both
of the following apply.
1. You expect to owe at least $1,000 in tax for 2017,
after subtracting your withholding and refundable credits.
2. You expect your withholding and refundable credits
to be less than the smaller of:
a. 90% of the tax to be shown on your 2017 tax return,
or
b. 100% of the tax shown on your 2016 tax return.
Your 2016 tax return must cover all 12 months.

Point 1 obviously applies to me, and point 2 I think does. I'm unsure how to check my withholding for the current year, but I almost maxed out my 401k in 2017 (compared to 5% contributions in 2016), and made about the same salary. So I'm assuming that means I have less withholding in 2017 than in 2016.

So am I fucked?",finance
personalfinance,Trying to understand the timing of traditional IRA and roth IRA taxes,"I am having a hard time understanding when taxes are taken out for IRA accounts. 

I know that traditional IRA is taxed when you withdraw the money during retirement.

But conceptually I am having a hard time following the timing of all this and logistically how it all works out. 

Scenario 1/Question 1
Let's say I have $20,000 in my bank of america savings account. Let's say I take $5,500 of this out today and put it in my traditional IRA. This money has already been subjected to tax right? I paid federal income tax on it already withheld from my paycheck. How is this money referred to as pre tax? 

Scenario 2/question 2
For 2016 tax year I put $5,500 into my vanguard roth IRA. For Roth IRA you are supposed to get taxed now and withdraw later without getting taxed. I look at my IRA account and there is still $5,500 in it, why wasn't I taxed?

CryptoCurrency,"ETHLend - Buy this! It has already pumped, but it will continue. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow. Here is partly why.","I read this in a telegram chat and it really stuck to me. I thought it was a fresh read. I am not advising you to invest or to not invest. DYOR.

""A story from a former Salter lol, and why me and my tribe believe Lend is the game changer. Theres no comparison between salt and ethlend. You guys represent the true movement of crypto, the vibe that great ideas + great teams + great community is what crypto really represents. The empowerment and purity of decentralization, where the people not banks and governments have the control. There is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come (crypto, blockchain), and the unlimited worlds of ideas within that idea (Lend). You guys are the Uber within this new economy. (Not sure if its possible but OMG if this ever becomes app based instant click lending with the option of it attaching to a debit card in real time, IT WILL BE GAME OVER!) but beyond that its the energy and vibe and courage of yalls team. 

I have a friend who is an advisor and large investor with Salt. When i told him last week that im letting gonof salt and putting my money behind these kids at Lend, he was shocked. He asked why and here is my answer, from someone with 20,000 sales reps in 195 countries, a ceo of multiple tech companies and traditional businesses, a 43 year old father of 2 teenagers, and KNOWING Salt was a guarantee money maker, here is my answer to him. 

""For me, its not just about making money, its about what my money is being used for, what my money is empowering. Salt will flourish, but its agenda is to be another version of the same system we are freeing people from, and the absolute #1 driver behind it is capitalizing on the crypto world. Nothing wrong with that, nothing wrong with capitalizing on opportunity with innovation and value. But after reading Simon Seneks book ""Start with Why"" I was reminded that WHY WE DO A THING is more important than the thing we do. Bro, when i saw these young brilliant world changers on youtube, no flash, no billionaores giving them open check books to fund them, filled with gratitude that they raised 16M to further their project, building a true community around authenticity and vision for a better world, when I heard them talking about providing funding to ppl in 3rd world countries, with a plan for LOW INTEREST financing vs maximizing profits and interest and compromising integrity, I knew that Lend has what matters most, they have their WHY right when it comes to the future of crypto."" 

He said ""what do you mean compromising integrity?"" So i showed him their own website, as they defend their EXTREMELY HIGH INTEREST RATES, and the defense was a lie, point blank a lie they convinced themselves was real to justify a path to quicker and bigger profits through maximum interest rates, and that lie was that they fall and align with the current rates of UNSECURED LOANS. My friends, they are attempting to pull in the support of the masses with a trust free model (just like lend) but in the same breath betray the very power of smart contracts and collatoralized lending by framing their price points on a TRUST based comparison. And if the Lend team grabs what i am saying, you will play a major role in empowring the economic impact and intrinsic value that is at the very DNA of crypto and blockchain. Keep the lending as low cost as possible, create the best user platform and user experience the world has ever seen, make 2 click lending (or whatever it ends up being) your mantra, be the best in evwry detail, because your ideas and leadership is the best. Lend team, keep being you, because our world isnt looking for the same old thing in a new suit, this crypto movement transcends the rules of the centralized world and so does Lend, keep being who you are at your core, let your WHY lead the way, and you will attract strategic relationships, other brilliant minds and creative geniuses who will complete the mosaic environment and help your vision fully appear, you will attract the right endorsements with people of influence, the right mentors and thought leaders to inspire you and unleash the potential of Lend and beyond. And for what its worth from a guy that doesnt know 1% of what you know about this space and project, but for what its worth, protect the heart and WHY of your company from ppl who will say almost all the right things, offer to be a part and maybe even promise the promise land, ppl will show up with great talent but the wrong intention, the wrong WHY, so my advice to you is that anyone who tries to partner with you who is driven by the potential money/shares/etc vs the mission 1st, regardless of all their credentials and talent, if the alignment of intention and purpose isnt there, have the courage and wisdom to say no. Ive seen this already from you guys in your posts, you are already walking this out, but just a reminder, if they havent paid the price in their journey that you have, if they havent sacrificed short term gain for the long term game, they probably arent a part of your evolving tribe. 

Your webinar impressed me most, ive told 100 ppl about the REALNESS OF YOUR VIBE (not extravagant, not trying to impress with fancy offices and ceo type hype), the genuine and courageous and humble energy i felt. And i know that you are going to impress the world with your platform, your idea coming to life, and as it does youll have it all, and for you guys this is only the beginning. SO CHEERS FROM AMERICA, HOPE 1 DAY I CAN BUY YOU ALL A DRINK AND THANK YOU IN PERSON, BUT FOR NOW VIA TELEGRAM, THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE GUTS TO BE YOU, AND THANK YOU FOR BIRTHING THIS PROJECT FROM SUCH A SOLID PLACE OF INTENTION, BRILLIANCE, AND PURP0SE.

personalfinance,Student Loans- no cosigner,"Hey everyone! I am a college student trying to figure out how on earth I am going to pay for the last year or so of my undergrad degree. 

Some background; right now I get tuition paid for up to 120 or 128 credits (not sure which) due to my dad's disability from the VA office at my state college. I am a junior heading into my second semester of the degree and I am expecting to go about 5 years total, maybe one more semester since I added a double major that will make me much more marketable in the job field. I am headed into music education and am expecting a teacher's salary in a public school. 

The VA benefit counts credit by credit, so if I take an 18 credit semester, it takes 18 credits from the 120/8 limit, same as if I would have taken 12 credits. The only limitations are that I take at least 12 credits per semester and maintain a 2.0 GPA. My GPA is currently a 2.75, well over the necessary amount, and I will be taking pretty heavy credit loads (at least 15 credits per semester) until I graduate. As of right now I have taken out 19,500 USD in federal unsubsidized loans. All that I qualify for from the FAFSA is unsubsidized federal loans and I'm pretty sure you can only get 4 years worth of those though I am not sure,  and I will be in school for 5-5.5 years at the most.

I am claimed as a dependent on my parents' taxes. They make good money, but are not helping me pay for school outside of the VA benefit. They also point-blank refuse to cosign on any private loans I may or may not need after this benefit runs out. My degree will wind up being about 160-180 credits total. I have been applying for scholarships but since I have no 'demonstratable financial need' due to my family's decent financial situation as a whole, I don't qualify for hardly any of them. I am renting a house with roommates, and all the bills are in my name. I have not had a single late payment in the 9 months that I have been paying bills here. I expect to continue this for the foreseeable future until graduation.

My brother will be starting college next year, and my sister will start college in fall of 2020. I'm hoping this might affect the federal aid I get, but I'm honestly skeptical as to how much.

My question is, how on earth do I pay for the last 30-60 credits of my degree when I get no grant or scholarship money and I don't have a cosigner? Even if I work my ass off through the year and summer, I only expect to make about 5,000$ at the most given the outrageous schedule of a music major and a single semester of tuition is 8,000 or more? Is it enough to just have the credit score by a year or two of bill-paying to qualify for a loan of my own?

TL;DR parents make too much $ for me to qualify for scholarships or federal assistance past the minimum unsubsidized loan amount and also refuse to cosign for when I will have to pay tuition in full.

Don't take this to seem like I am ungrateful for the VA benefit, it's a huge help to me, but I won't be making a ton of money after graduation and I still need to figure out how to pay for it all somehow and I'd rather not be eating ramen into my 30s.",finance
Bitcoin,The true mooning has yet to come...,"In my opinion, 2018 is highly likely to see a large correction in the financial markets (capital markets, real estate, etc.) due to anticipated rising interest rates in the U.S., unsustainable fundamentals across the board for Dow/S&amp;P 500 companies, and various other factors. When this occurs, retail and institutional investors are unlikely to retreat to gold. Instead, they'll retreat to bitcoin as an uncorrelated asset and store of value. Why? because Bitcoin is a superior store of value than gold, has far greater upside, and likely has an even lower correlation to capital markets than gold. By the time this correction comes around, financial advisers will have had to educate themselves due to growing curiosity and demand from their clients (if you're a financial adviser and still haven't educated yourself in this space, then you're not very good at your job), who will also be much more educated in the space. Mark my words- as soon as we see a relatively large correction in the capital markets, Bitcoin is going to reap the benefits. BUY BUY BUY.

personalfinance,"Finally entered workforce post PhD, seeking advice for setting up accounts for long-term","Hi Reddit! Looking for planning advice. Husband and I (32 and nearly 30) make $125K in combined income, some debt, decent savings, but minimal assets in retirement. Please help me set up a solid long-term plan!  

 
**Background**: Spent 2006-2016 (age 18-28) as a full-time student, entered the workforce last September after finishing undergrad+grad school. Had a livable stipend during grad school and I managed to save $15K, and put about $5K in a Roth IRA that admittedly I don't know much about. I'm doing an industry post-doc and as a trainee, I am not offered any 401k plan so focused heavily on paying off debt and saving for the past 15 months.  

My husband (32), is a math teacher at a public school, just finished his M.Ed and contributes 13% to his retirement pension plan. He'll receive 80% of the averaged of his 3 highest-paid years but want to figure out some additional retirement accounts to set up.
    
**Debt**: Almost there! Paid off $30K of student loans in last 2 years and have $15.5K left in husband's federal student loans (at 5.75%). He is currently on track for federal student-loan forgiveness since he's a public school math teacher, but he won't be eligible for another 19 months. Making $163 minimal monthly payment. Car loan (1% interest) has &lt;$1K left and will be paid off in 2-3 months. No other debt.  

**Take home Income**: Roughly $6500 after taxes/insurance/husband's retirement+union dues.  

**Expenses**: Roughly $2900. Recently started using Personal Capital to really track expenses and eliminate unnecessary spending.   

**Savings**: Currently at $55K, excluding $10K emergency fund. Monthly savings is minimum $3K, sometimes up to $3.5K. Once we paid off everything but the last federal loan, we shifted to putting money into savings.   

**Goals**:  
1. Buy a house in 1-2 years. Our target downpayment is $80K to avoid PMI. Husband's credit is very good, mine is excellent.  
2. Figure out how to start contributing to a Roth IRA--and maybe an additional joint fund for both of us? Trying to educate ourselves on retirement savings now that we're finally both done with school. Liking what I've recently read about Vanguard and index funds but not sure where to start.  
3. Finish my training and get into a permanent position with a 401k matching. Ideally, I would like to contribute the full $18K to 401k and $5K to a Roth IRA yearly since I am behind in what I should have for retirement. Beyond that, would like advice how to funnel additional income to smart investments.  
4. We do want kids in the next 2-3 years and would probably have to figure out how to pay for partial day-care. 

**Specific Questions**:  
1. Do we take the risk of waiting to get his $15.5K forgiven knowing current administration could eliminate the student loan forgiveness before then? If I did the math right, he'd pay $3K in 19 months but would have ~$13.8K eliminated...hard to ignore.  
2. What are the best strategies to save for a house and retirement, particularly for myself, at the same time?   
3. Can I rollover my current Roth IRA held through my credit union to Vanguard? Realizing I'm overpaying for poor-performance and would like to take advantage of the lower costs at Vanguard.  
3a. On a similar note, I keep reading on this subreddit to purchase the Total Stock Index Fund, which has a $10K minimum...but a Roth IRA contribution is capped at $5.5K. How does this work?  
4. Given I spent my 20s in school instead of saving for retirement, is there anything else I should focus on to play catch-up? Feeling a little overwhelmed! Not sure if retiring early is something we're interested in, but is it even a viable option for us at our ages?  
5. Any good resources to seek out? Recently started reading JL Collins ""Simple Path to Wealth"", but would love additional trusted material.

By 25 y/o I was making about $52k and I paid off the student loan debt and had a net worth of about $20k I think. 2.5 years later at 28 y/o, I now have a net worth of about $105k. I am currently maxing my t401k and rIRA, along with a bit more being saved in a taxable account.

I currently work as an investment analyst with a base salary of $85k, and a total comp of about $100k including retirement contributions and bonus. My money is invested 50/50 bonds/stocks right now. The high bond portion is a recent development because I may purchase a home soon. The stocks are value stock ETFs (VBR and QUAL) and the bonds are intermediate and long term corporate bonds (VCIT and VCLT). I also have $2k in crypto....just in case.

Secrets to my success:

* I paid off my student loan debt ASAP. Ever seen the ""miracle of compound interest"" charts showing how much you can gain after investing for *x* years at *y* interest rate? Well debt is like the reverse of that and thus is exponentially worse in the opposite direction. Also I would like to say that FWIW, aggressively paying down debt is what taught me the budgeting discipline to be able to save money aggressively once the debt was gone.

* Sold my car. Paying interest on debt is already bad enough as discussed above. Taking out debt to buy a ""want"" only to pay interest on a depreciating asset is stupid on steroids. Strategically aim to live in low rent areas near public transportation. If you do buy a car, the value of it should be less than 20% of your salary.

* If you're in the 25% (soon to be 22%) marginal tax bracket, make pretax contributions to save on taxes.

* Have cheap rent and get roommates if you need to. No one really expects anyone younger than 25 to have their own place at this point, and having roommates is good for your social life.

* Be aggressive when it comes to shopping around for your recurring bills. Auto insurance going up with every 6 months renewal? On an old expensive Verizon cell phone plan? Did Comcast just increase your internet bill $80 after the end of the 1 year promotion period? Shop around when it comes to these types of bills. Back when I had a car, it was not uncommon for me to switch auto insurance just to save $5 per month. I switch back and forth between Comcast and Verizon cable TV in order to get the promotion rates. I'm currently on a pay as you go phone plan for only $40/month. Having these kind of ""leaks"" in your budget can be a symptom of a greater problem with your budgeting which can lead to much larger financial mishaps.

* Don't let people convince you that you need to spend money on *x* in order to achieve something. You don't need student loans for an education. You don't need to travel to become cultured. You don't need to go out to bars to have a social life. You don't need a ""reliable"" new car to get in to work. You don't need to buy organic in order to be healthy. You don't need that new kitchen gadget instead of knife skills. You don't need $50 yoga classes to become flexible. You don't need supplements to lose weight. You don't need to buy a home in order to have peace of mind. Anyone who tells you different doesn't under the concept of a ""need"". Start from zero and build up from there and decide what it is you need and want for yourself rather than having someone else decide for you.",finance
personalfinance,Feeling overwhelmed. Please help,"I’m 32, my fiancé is 31. I switched careers at 24 and took on 80k in school loans (40k government, 40k private). I’m in school for my master’s right now (taking another 40k in loans) and she just finished her doctorate. I make roughly $60,000 a year and she is making roughly $30,000 doing her post doctorate. I realized recently that between the two of us we will have nearly $225,000 in loans with a combined annual income of $90,000.  I know our priority should be to pay down loans first but we have a wedding coming up to pay for, own nothing (both still paying off our cars), have very little saved for retirement, and no money in the market. I feel like I’m throwing money away in rent and my goal is to buy a house in the next couple years so that we can cut our rent payments and start turning them into equity. We currently have roughly $20,000 in savings between the two of us. 

I am looking at starting a Roth IRA but I know I’m supposed to pay down student loans first but it seems like an insurmountable number with our current incomes and goal to have a house before we have kids in 3 years. We also moved for her postdoctorate and have had a difficult time making friends so we’re dying to get a dog as we need the companionship but I’m concerned about the potential cost that comes with it. We’ve both been dealing with depression and my financial concerns have been literally keeping me up at night. I feel lost and overwhelmed 

Rent: 1550

Utilities: $250

Student loans (mine): Currently in deferment due to full time student status and needing to take an $800/month paycut to keep up with school. I’m currently maxing my allowable government loans with an interest rate of 5.35% and using the remaining $5300/semester once tuition is paid to pay my private loans down (6.49% interest).

Student loans (hers): about to come out of deferment and not positive what her payments will look like though she is going to need to do IBR plan for now.

Car payment: $270 (roughly 13.5k remaining with 1.9% apr)

Insurance $120

I will also be receiving roughly $7,000 (pretax) in education assistance from my job in the next month or so, however I am hesitant to put it towards my loans yet as it requires an 18-month commitment to this employer (where I’m already unhappy) and we will likely move in 12-13 months from the area. The amount that I would pay back would be prorated, however I feel it would be better to keep the money in an account in case we decide to leave sooner as the agreement states payment would be due immediately.

Any advice on some smart financial moves and how I can both pay down these loans and still buy a house in the next two years (which when I’ve used mortgage calculators will free up roughly $700-800/month that we’ve been paying towards rent and I feel I could use to pay down other debt) and just get some sleep without needing to take a Xanax to turn my brain off would be massively appreciated.

personalfinance,I just bought a motorcycle two months ago. Now I need to sell &amp; buy a house.,"So here it is, my first Reddit post ever.  I bought a new motorcycle two months ago.  Literally one month later I accepted a promotion within my organization.  So now I have to sell my current house and move into a slightly higher priced market (CA).
  
Here's where it gets tricky (or maybe not, IDK) The house should hit the market in the next couple of months.  My current house should sell for about 60-70k more than I bought for (I'm hoping for 370-380k, crazy right!)  Unfortunately in order to get a comparable house in the new market I will need to be in the 400k range.  Additionally my current mortgage payment is about as much as I feel comfortable paying, even with the pay raise.  Oh, I almost forgot; I will be receiving reimbursement for relocation costs (I'm not exactly sure, but I believe closing costs up to 8% of the home value)      

I have about 60k in inheritance I just received, and the original plan was to pay half the bike (10k) and refinance the other half (for the lower APR).  The rest of the cash was going to go into some upgrades for the house and some sort of high interest savings account (with the idea of keeping it easy to get to in case of emergency).  

So here's the question:  What are the pros of paying the loan off completely vs. having the cash to put toward a new house if needed?  The 20k is the only debt I have besides the mortgage payment.  If I keep the cash what are the implications of having this loan on the new mortgage? (potentially get a lower interest rate if I'm completely debt free?  Is that a thing?)  Really I'm just looking for any advise the brilliant minds of personalfinance can give me.  THANKS!!",finance
CryptoCurrency,Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Client (KYC) Laws and Crypto [Focused Discussion],"Does anyone share my opinion that in order for crypto to reach its full potential that it has to find a way to exist within the structures of anti-AML and KYC laws?  The banks resent crypto because banks need to comply with so much AML/KYC regulation and the feds/OCC/SEC come in to audit and fine them on a yearly basis and yet crypto is largely unregulated.  I worked at a bank specifically responding to government inquiries.  It's amazing to me the amount of scrutiny given to the big banks that crypto does not have to endure.  I know one of the strengths of crypto is that is can be anonymous and that has been a large part of its rise.  However if it is to become adopted and accepted, don't you think a large part of that will be making it compliant with existing anti-AML and KYC laws?  And would that necessarily kill crypto or is it part of its natural evolution?

I ask because I have foresight and I see where this is going.  To me it's only a matter of time before these markets are regulated and brought under the same standards as any other asset.  

I want to ask the community at large and see what people think on this because I think this is a very large part of where this goes.  I think the current US administration is not looking to pass regulations on this market (which is maybe good for the short term)- but in 5-10 years this may be a major concern.

personalfinance,Do I get federal tax withheld back on tax returns?,"I got my first job this year back in march, which I quit 2 months later, got my second job which lasted 6 months, then quit that for my current job.

personalfinance,Advice: Most Efficient Way To Pay Off These Student Loans?,"Hey guys, this is my first time posting here. Hope student loan posts are relevant to this sub.

I’ve had student loans for about 10 years, and just now have a job that will actually allow me to pay them off in a reasonable amount of time, instead of just making minimum payments forever. Currently making $60k a year. Right now, I have about 10k sitting in the bank that I’ve slowly saved up. 

However, I have no idea what the best plan of attack would be to banish these fuckers forever. I am trying to permanently move out of the US as soon as possible, but I feel like these loans are holding me back from enjoying life, and keeping everything on pause. My plan is to fully pay them off by the end of 2018, if all goes well.

Before I list out the details of my loans here, I wanted to pose these questions:

1. If I were to pay off a chunk of my main Private loan in one fell swoop, would my monthly payments instantly be reduced as a result?

2. What should I do with my 10k in savings? Should I just throw them at these loans, or should I invest, or keep it in a savings account? BitCoin? Etc. Really have no idea on this one.

3.Should I use the Avalanche method to pay off these smaller loans as quickly as possible? Or should I just go after the main Private loans? I feel like keeping the smaller government loans with lower payment minimums and interest rates around in the future wouldn’t be too difficult to manage in comparison to the bigger Private one.

There are no trees blocking and the home is ideal for solar.
The panels are black on black. 

Following are the incentives:

* 30% federal tax incentive
* $0.21/kw produced up to 50% cost of the system up to 8 years.
* reduction in energy bills

Solar company also offering 110% guaranteed incentive return if the solar panels doesn't produce the promised 5400 KWH.

Bitcoin,Take care when u gift crypto (/u/JamesF0),"Buying crypto for family members, friends or other parties

This is an important, but often overlooked factor. If your friends or family ask
you to purchase crypto on their behalf you should decline. If purchased from
a legitimate exchange in your name, YOU are liable to pay any capital gains
on said crypto. You are better off sharing a book like this, or training them on
how to acquire for themselves. After many years, if the crypto holdings you
are holding for them have risen in value, they may expect that ‘n’ number of
‘x’ crypto is worth $xxxxx. They won’t want to consider that you have to pay
up to 45% tax on the gains, nor will they care how that may affect your
taxable income, government benefits, child support payments, or any other
factor of your life. Such things could lead to the dissolution of friendships and
unwanted litigation.
Additionally, if gifting a particular crypto for a special occasion, you should
also provide and keep a copy of a transcript of the event and the
transaction hash of the transfer on the blockchain to prove date of said
gifting and you will also be required to declare such an event as a CGT A1
Disposal Event on your own tax return for that financial year.

personalfinance,28 Year Old seeking advice for improvement,"Hello Redditors - 28 M here seeking personal financial advice. I made blunders in 2016/17 which was supposed to be the year of savings for me after being done with my education costs. Long story short, I lost around 19k in trading and dumped 2.6k in FSA out of which all i actually ended up using was .6k. Overall, thankful for my health and my work. But there are days when I look at my circle where folks are married, have kids, purchased house, and are way more mature/organized than I am and can’t help but drown in FOMO. I am really sorry if I am appearing to be complaining or whining. 

I would be super grateful for guidance and suggestions on what I can improve on and what you would have done or did when in the similar situation to accelerate reaching financial goals and beyond.

My realistic goal within next 3 year though is to be a happier human being, travel bit more to connect with friends, be able to afford a 20%downpayment+closing cost, improve my current skill sets to switch job with minimum 30% pay raise target in late 2018/early 2019, and potentially get married. My preference is to settle somewhere in the West Coast however as the only thing certain in this life is uncertainty plus housing prices are getting really crazy here for my plan of getting at least 4 BR house for my parents to move in as well at some point, I am very much open to move.

Today in December 2017 I have $25,000.. meaning I've paid off $4900 in total or around $810 per month..

My income is around $3400 per month that I have in hand after taxes so I've been paying off about 25% of my income towards student loans per month.. is this good? I started off paying the required amount but I didn't like how little it was making so I doubled that amount and so in the end now it's averaging to that percentage.. I hope to continue this rate of about $500 per paycheck which is biweekly

I have multiple federal loans with varying interest rates of 3.4-6.8% and I'm paying off the ones with the largest % first, and the minimum for others..

I've been living at home with my parents this year so I've been saving on rent, utilities, food, etc.. and it's been basically coming out as the following: - 30% checking account for all expenses - 40% for saving - 30% student loans

Come March 2018 I will be moving out so that's going to change, I'd like to continue paying that 30% student loans, hopefully saving around 10-15% and the rest going to living expenses.. My question is, is this a good model to have? I do have in my savings a good amount, around $13k that I would be OK with putting some of that towards my student loans today, to lower my student loan principal and, in effect, get some tax advantage for this ahead of the tax season coming up.. is this effective?

personalfinance,Wife and I want to go RVing full time for a year. Are we crazy?,"**TL:DR Can we afford to take a year off and travel the country?**

Hey all.  So as the title states, we're (32) wanting to pack up some belongings (and our 3 year old) and hit the road across the U.S. for a year or so.  We're both feeling burned out with our current ventures (me:deli manager, her:home daycare provider) and love the thought of full-time traveling.  

The catalyst to this decision was an injury settlement payment that I just received in the amount of $95,000. We figure this is either something we do now before our child is in school, or something we might not get to do until she is out of the house.  

Here is the current rundown of our finances:

**Checking: $95000**

**Savings: $10500**

**401k: $40600**

**HSA: $7000**

**HSA Investment: $300**

We also plan to sell my wife's car which would net about $7000 for us. 


**Home Loan: -$216000**

**Credit Cards: -$3000ish (paid off each month)**

Our plan for the house is to rent it out. We figure we can get at least our mortgage payment if not more per month.  My father-in-law would act as landlord.  This is in the event our plan doesn't pan out and we need something to fall back on.  Also, we'll be using a small section of the basement as storage. **We've also considered selling the house and currently could net about $100k in profit** 

My wife has been doing most of the research and thinks we can make this happen on about $2200 per month (not including an RV payment). I'll be honest, I think that number is low, but even if we hover around $4000 per month, its costing us $48000 for the year, or about half of that settlement.  

As for the RV, we're looking at older used models (2000ish year) with low miles.  We've seen a lot of these around the $20,000 mark.  We plan to make payments, as I'm confident we can secure a fairly low interest rate.  

As for income, we are not counting on a whole lot to work for us.  Secret shopping will be something we will do as often as we can as my wife is signed up with several companies.  Again, she has done most of the research when it comes to that type of thing.  The idea is that income won't be as much of an issue because we can live off this settlement.  

The goal of this experience is (obviously) to travel and see as much of the country as we can, but also to find our perfect spot to live.  We are currently in Colorado but are not really attached to the state as a place for our child to grow up or for us to grow old.  Seeing the rest of the country would offer us the opportunity to find our favorite spot.  

I understand the idea of living off a settlement payment might not sit too well with this subreddit as the usual advice is to max out 401k, open IRA, etc. But I think this opportunity may not present itself for quite some time, if ever again.

My out of pocket cost has been approx. $770 a semester which I easily covered working my part-time job. Here's where I'm at - I really want to do Industrial Design (Product Design).

It is offered at University of Cincinnati (DAAP), and UC gives in-state tuition to Kentucky students, for [ALL MAJORS EXCEPT ONE](https://www.uc.edu/registrar/residency_reciprocity_metro/kentucky_reciprocity.html). You may understand my frustrations. I'm trying my hardest to decide if it's even plausible to attend an out-of-state college and get my degree. To be fair, the degree is pretty valuable and most institutions have very high placement rates following graduation, and starting pay in the field is respectable. My first choice college is either Uni of Illinois (Chicago), or UofI Urbana-Champaign. I know one potential option is working ~30 hours a week outside of class to help establish residency, thus cutting my tuition rates the following few years. If there's ANY advice ANYONE can give, I'd appreciate it. Anything from, ""You're a fool and should stay at EKU"" to private loan recommendations, to obscure bits of information that might make this more affordable for me.

Thank you sincerely to anyone that can help.

In 2017, I paid $800 per month for the most part, except for the last 2 months when I paid $1000, and the first 4 months when I paid $400. I paid around $10k in my student loans this year, with roughly $2.5k paying off interest (mostly interest that accumulated during the 4 years I was in school and not paying on my loans due to little to no income).

I told myself when I graduated that I wanted to be debt free within 5 years of loan payments. So far, I am on track to exceed that goal.

I have been paying for a year, but from now on I will be paying at least $1k per month, with around $125 per $1k going towards interest payments per month. At this rate, my loans will be paid off in a little under 3 years, with this number shrinking if I get a raise/promotion at work, thus being able to contribute more.

All of this being said, I would love to know if anyone has any advice on how they were able to pay off their loans faster. Of course I know the general idea of living more frugally and being able to put more towards my loans, but aside from that, any finance specific pieces of advice are greatly appreciated, since that world is still pretty new to me.

Thanks again and happy new year!",finance
personalfinance,Effects of marriage on taxes/loans,"Hey guys, looking to make sure I have some things straight going into next year.  I’m getting married in May to my partner of almost a decade, and I’m trying not to make things a pain for us.  

She is a prospective PhD with around a 30k stipend, and currently has around 30k in a 529.  I have about 40k in loans (private and federal), and graduate next December with a degree in Computer Science.  She doesn’t want me to have any more loans (my parents not in the picture, am working but doesn’t cover everything) and so wants to pay my tuition from the stipend checks while taking any she might need from the 529 to cover herself.  

Does her plan seem legit (aka not going to get her in trouble)? As we see it the stipend is just a paycheck she can do what she wants with, and expenses pursuing her PhD counts for the 529, but figure it’s worth double checking.  

Tax-wise, do any gifts in 2018 fall under the spouse exemption or just the ones after we get married?  Also do I report I got any or does she just report giving (or not at all).  

Does filing jointly vs individually affect income based repayment?  I see it mentions family size but I’m not really sure how it works.  

Lastly, while we should be ok in terms of income (own car outright, making enough to save a little), is it a good idea to keep our accounts separate until my loans are paid off?  I know they’re always mine, but I didn’t know if they could go after her money if everything collapsed and I defaulted.  Definitely not the plan but I’m trying to look out for her no matter what.",finance
personalfinance,"Student loans are in the PSLF program, on an IBR plan, and payments don't even touch the interest. Also have a loan ineligible for PSLF. What do I do?","Throwaway because my other account has too much identifying info.

Background: I am in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF; after 120 monthly payments, my loans are forgiven) program for my student loans, and I have an Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan. I'm a public school teacher, 27 years old, living in Ohio. My gross pay is $1,750 bi-weekly, and I take home $950 after taxes and deductions. I also just got married this year and I don't think I will even qualify for IBR with my spouse's income if we file jointly (he makes about the same as I do in terms of net pay). I had to re-file my IBR in April of this year, and since I got married in March I had to say I was married filing separately, even though that wasn't technically true since I was single for the 2016 tax year. Anyway, I was looking at my loan information the other day, which admittedly I haven't done as in-depth as I probably should have before, and I think I might be in a bit of a mess.

* Current total balance: $34K
* Unpaid principal: $33K
* Unpaid interest: $1K
* Direct loans: $28K (of that, $800 in interest; rates: 4.25% for subsidized and 6.55% for unsubsidized)
* FFEL loans: $6K (of that, $200 in interest; rates between 5.35% for subsidized and 6.55% for unsubsidized)

Though I thought the only loans I had were direct loans, turns out I have two small FFEL loans that don't qualify for PSLF, and since it is a much lower balance, it doesn't get as much of my payment as calculated under IBR. This year it was $80 a month total, and last year it was $120 a month. Of that $80, $20 goes to the FFEL and the $60 goes to the Direct loans. My payments under IBR are so small they don't even pay down the interest that's accruing. So for the FFEL loan, that leaves me with $6,000 to pay down after having paid basically nothing this whole time. I know it's my fault and I should have been more on top of this, but I need help figuring out what to do.

So my question is: Where do I go from here? Do I try to pay down the interest as much as I can on both loans or just one? Do I try to pay off the FFEL loan as quickly as possible since it can't be forgiven? I'm about 4.5 years into repayment, so if I combined the loans, I would have to start all over again, which I don't think would be beneficial. I can't afford to contribute all that much extra to these with my other expenses and my income level. I feel like there might be more to add regarding my financial picture, but I don't know if it's relevant, so I will add that info if need be. Sorry if this is kind of all over the place, I clearly have no idea where to begin. I'm gutted and I just feel so stupid. Thanks in advance.

TL;DR: I didn't look at my student loans carefully enough and now I'm seeing my payments on an IBR plan don't even cover the interest. Also have an FFEL loan not covered by PSLF and have been paying basically nothing.",finance

personalfinance,I want to ask my parents for a school loan. How do I calculate my proposed repayment plan?,"Hi all,

I'm going to be attending medical school this year at a cost of ~45k/year (tuition) + living expenses. My SO will shoulder the brunt of our day to day living expenses, but I will be paying for the tuition, books, exams, etc.

My parents are retired and are sitting on a hefty nest egg. I would not ask them for a loan if I thought it would in any way impact their quality of retirement, or put them in a potentially risky situation. They recently bought a home for my sibling and are allowing him to pay them back monthly as he wasn't able to qualify for a traditional mortgage, which is where I got this idea.

Grad loans (I believe) range from 6-7% right now depending on the mix you get. They require no repayment until 3(?) years after graduation, but accrue interest the entire time. I was thinking of proposing a 4-5% interest rate to my parents - saves me 1-2% from federal loans, while providing them with a very solid ROI relative to what they're investing in now.

I don't want my parents to think I'm just asking for free money, so I'd like to approach them with a solid plan of what I'm asking for, along with what I'm offering to give back in return. Unfortunately, math is not my strong suit and I'm not sure exactly how to calculate accruing interest being that I'll bet taking out the loans at four different points. Can anyone point me in the right direction on how to do this?

personalfinance,Volunteer Stay or Go?,"Sorry for format typed on mobile 


Hi I've been volunteering at a small accounting firm for a bit and I'm wondering if the experience is worth the work and lack of money. 


When I answered the job posting it was described as a volunteer position with the opportunity for a good reference or to be hired depending on performance after a certain amount of time- like an internship but they seemed to not be using that word for it exactly. I have only had one retail job before and this would have been my only opportunity tangentially related to my BA degree. 


The bosses seem nice enough but we are very understaffed so the work is very heavy. Some concerns of mine and some odd things I've noticed:

- every other employee there is an unpaid intern but I've been told I'm different bc I I'm a volunteer uninvolved with a school (there seemed to be a guy there who was actually earning money that got fired?)

- only me and the two guys that own/ run the place have to work 9-5 Monday to Friday 

- the interns who have been here for some time seem to be doing the same basic tasks as me


- I still haven't gotten a contract of any kind 


The thing is I don't know if I want to be an accountant but I want to develop the skills in that category since it is very loosely related to my education and this place *can* / *might* help with that. Should I tough it out for the next few months here or keep looking for jobs in the meantime and take the next one? 


I don't know if I'll get a reference for my next job if I don't do the full period. Should I talk to the boss about this? What do I say?",finance

personalfinance,Minimizing tax liability using 0% LTCP for those in the 15% tax bracket,"I am very fortunate to have inherited money through a trust this year (along with my sister).

I am a student and don't have an income, I was planning on realizing some capital gains to step up the cost basis. The 0% federal capital gains applies for those in the the 15% tax bracket ($9,325 to $37,950) or lower for 2017

My two questions:

1) Can I also harvest capital losses and will these losses offset the gain so I can realize a greater gain. Ie) instead of harvesting 37k in gains, can I realize 10k in losses and 47k in gains, or would this exempt me from this mechanism?

2) Over the last year, the trust collected income (I believe around 20k). I would assume that income is split between my sister and myself (10k each), or does the trust keep that liability and nothing is passed on to me? The trust is a generation-skipping trust, for the record.

It might be that this issue is too difficult to optimize without professional help. In that case, if I factor in the 1/2 the trust's income as my own, and just ignored the capital loss aspect, I can't see how I expose myself to any additional tax liability.

personalfinance,Receiving more calls from a debt collection agency,"A few years ago I signed up to join the military after high school, I went in through basic and my specialty school.

About a year or so later I started getting these random phone calls, some times someone will answer looking for myself and other times they would hang up. They gave no explanation.

After the 3rd call I decided to call them back. I got ahold of a debt collection firm “Aldous and Associates”. A rude lady told me that she needed my name, and my social security number. I gave her my name, but I didn’t tell her my SSN number because I thought this was a scam.

Anyways, a few days go by after she told me she couldn’t tell me what was going on, I received a letter for debt collection from them. They said I owned $100 in gym membership fees, which immediately came to my head, I forgot to cancel my membership before I shipped off.

I immediately called Crunch fitness, they looped me around for a good 30 minutes and I was transferred to someone who was clearly out of the country. He informed me that I owned $70 for my pass dues and that I could pay it over the phone. He told me he’ll send it off to collections and waive off everything else, I then gave him my debt card number over the phone. He said I will be getting an electronic email sent along with paper in the mail confirming the deductions to my account.

A few hours later I noticed multiple web hosting charges posted to my account, along with the crunch billing charge. I don’t pay for any web hosting accounts or even anything related. I contacted my bank and froze my debt card from being used.

Fast forward a week or so, I have received a few more calls from “Aldous and Associates”, the first time they called I informed them that I’ve settled the debt with the gym and that they'll get a letter sent to them, the dude was very upset that I did this and threatened to expedite the legal process. I hung up.

Another week passes, leaving 2 since this all started. I received another call from them, along with an influx of obvious scammers calling me. I received no further letters in the mail from either “Aldous and Associates” or crunch themselves. I assumed that everything was taken care of.

2 weeks later I get another document from “Aldous and Associates” letter stating that I was going to court over this if I don’t pay at the end of the month.
I’ve never been late or skipped payments before, I’m young and didn’t want to take the risk of my credit score diving, so I gave in and paid the $100 electronically via their website [Aldous and Associates](http://aldouslegal.com/)

I then continued to receive calls from the daily, I kept informing them that I’ve paid the debt off, but to them it wasn’t appearing in my “account”. They again pushed my more information from myself.

I contacted my local crunch fitness and for obvious reasons I couldn’t go to my local gym, the lady told me that my account was clear and that I did not owe, she told me she’ll send a physical letter to my address.

Another few weeks go by, I’m fed up with Aldous and Associates that they keep calling me, I tell them to not call me again, that the debt was paid off and that it was becoming harassment at this point.

They finally stop calling me. I receive no further calls from them, no more letters, still no letters from either Crunch. I received a email with my account number stating I paid the $100, from Aldous and Associates.

Yesterday afternoon I receive another call, this time from [“Johnson Mark LLC”](https://jmlaw.pro/Default.aspx) they where looking for myself once again. I don’t have any credit cards out in my name, only debt cards. I never bought anything using my credit and I’ve always paid off everything, besides my Crunch fitness membership.

I get in contact with one of the collectors, they again asked me for my name and SSN#. I asked him what this was about, and what their law firm does, he ignored my requests and got more angry towards me, I hung up the phone.

My parents did not receive any further letters or people showing up for myself, and right now I’m more concerned that another law firm bought up my debt somehow and I’m looping back through the same process I was just in.

Is there any legal routes I can take regarding this? I’m currently waiting for “Johnson Mark LLC” to call me back.

personalfinance,(CAN) Looking for advice on different interest rate structures with CIBC Savings Accounts,"Hey There,

I NEED to start a savings account for myself. Currently I just have a checking and a line of credit and end up just spending money thats in my checking or putting it on my line of credit, which isn't so bad as it needs paying off, but i do put a monthly amount to my PLC anyways.

Currently, CIBC has a few savings accounts and it got me thinking, which one would accumulate more interest over time, lets assume i put away $500 every pay check to that account and don't spend it. These are the two options:

- 2.30% interest on $5000 or more, its lower if you have under $5000 in the account 

- 0.05% interest on every dollar, no advertised limits but could be something hidden, as banks like to do.

Does anybody have any experience with either of these accounts, or is better at math than me and can calculate which would give you better returns given a certain dollar amount?

I went into my tax software and looked at my Federal form from 2016 and noticed my 1098-T that I attached was not there. I plan on mailing that in, along with a statement of intent and a receipt of payments made to the university if I can get one from their business office. 

The bit that troubles me (besides just receiving this generated letter in December when I filed in February) is this line from my 8863. It reads ""Multiply line 1 by line 6. Caution: If you were under age 24 at the end of the year and meet the conditions described in the instructions, you can't take the refundable American opportunity  credit; skip line 8, enter the amount from line 7 on line 9, and check this box."" 

So does that mean by being 22 at the time of filing I am unable to receive this credit? If so, am I mailing this in for nothing? I need some help here from you finance gurus.

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,"$25k of credit card debt that I can't pay now but may be able to in a year or so. Has not gone to collections yet. Previously had excellent credit. Should I consolidate, transfer to 0% card, keep making minimum payments, or hire someone to settle it?","Hi, so, summer of 2017 I suddenly out of nowhere got laid off from the job that provided about three-quarters of my income. I now have about $25k in credit card debt on cards that average APRs of around 18%. Previous to this I had an ""excellent"" credit score in the 700s, now I am scared to check what my credit score is. I have made a few payments late and that will probably continue to happen because I am struggling to make the *minimum* payments.

I am hoping that I can obtain another high-paying job this year. I am a junior-level web developer. I often see job postings in the $80k-$100k range requiring a skill set that *almost* matches mine perfectly - there are just a couple technologies (mostly javascript frameworks) that I need a couple months to brush up on. So I think a conservative bet would be that I have sufficient income to tackle this debt by latter 2018.

I think these are my options:

1. Consolidate the debt by taking out a personal loan from my bank, at hopefully an interest rate well below 18%.

2. Apply for a 0% APR credit card that has an introductory period of at least a year, and transfer the balances to it. I would have to pay a 3% balance transfer fee. I'm not super optimistic that I would be accepted or given a credit line that is sufficient. But maybe I could try applying for these cards at the same time that I apply for the bank loan? And then see what I get? Or would that be too many ""ding""s to my credit?

3. I see tv commercials for, and receive letters in the mail regarding, some kind of service where you hire someone to ""settle"" your credit card debt for a fraction of what you owe. Has anyone had experience with these services? If I did this, how would it affect my credit?

4. Continue barely making the minimum payments until I get sufficient income. Note that continuing to do this would mean I have basically NO disposable income, am not financially prepared for any kind of emergency, and will not be able to pay my 2016 taxes, which I still owe (totaling $5k).

Please please if anyone can offer kind of advice, I'm all ears!!",finance

personalfinance,"Big errors in paycheck, pay classification, and so on by the university - trouble with IRAs and taxes as a result.","Hi all,

So I'm the recipient of an F32 (NIH NRSA funding) that pays my salary basically. Only I guess it's technically considered a ""stipend"" for tax and other purposes? I'm not too up on what this stuff means for me technically but it turns out that from 12/1/16 to 11/30/17 I was paid incorrectly in several ways. I'm still learning more about this as it's only on 12/20/17-12/21 that I was really made aware of anything being odd and answers and new developments keep trickling in. Just to note, my employment history is like this: 9/1/15 - 11/30/16 - paid as a postdoc and full university employee with retirement benefits, 12/1/16 - 11/30/17 - year 1 of F32 fellowship, was improperly paid in some way? 12/1/17 - 11/30/18 - year 2 of F32 fellowship. 

It turns out I'm not eligible for the university's retirement program since I've been reclassified from a trainee to an employee. I had 5% pre-tax deductions for a retirement account that were employer matched. It looks like - but I'm not sure because remember, this is freshly happening and I've been traveling and unable to fully access my documents - the deductions/matching contributions were put into my retirement account through Fidelity from 9/1/15 - 11/30/16. The ones from 12/1/16 - 11/30/17 are in the process of being removed/refunded or something like that. 

I'm being returned the following in a huge lump sum, or what *seems like the following* because it's too soon/hard for me to verify things on the fly:

* 5% of salary that was pre-tax retirement deductions for the month of Dec 2016 - which I think means that I owe taxes on it for the year of 2016? 

* 5% of salary that was pre-tax deducted for retirement for Jan-Nov 2017, because they stopped doing retirement deductions as of 12/1/17 which is what tipped me off to something going wrong, but I didn't find out about it until I received my 12/1-12/15 paycheck on 12/20. 

* Social security and medicare taxes paid for the period of Jan - Nov 2017 and *maybe* also Dec 2016. 

The total amount comes out to about 6K. My department payroll contacted me today (12/29) to say that the check could be picked up, but I'm out of the state and no one could pick it up for me. The soonest I can get to the check is on 1/2/2018 and the soonest I can deposit (because it's over 5K and can't do mobile deposit) is probably 1/3 or 1/4. This comes into more importance below....

My questions at this time are:

1.) I obviously owe taxes on the pre-tax deductions that are being returned to me, but what about the medicare and social security being returned? Is that no longer taxable income or does it factor into how much federal tax I'll owe?

2.) What do I do about the Dec 2016 pre-tax deductions and/or medicare/social security tax returns? Do I owe back taxes and a penalty even though it's my employer who is at fault when they only discovered it *a year later*? The misclassification is subtle and I have 0 control over payroll, it's literally the change from ""senior fellow"" to ""senior fellow - trainee"", codes I know nothing about, not even the existence of until about 3 days ago. And finding information on what taking on an F32 means *for me personally* seems to ""vary by institution"" and no one seems to know what it will mean at the university or is wililng to answer questions. Is there any legal standing for me to go after my department if I owe back taxes for 2016 due to their mistake?

3.) Retirement wise, what do I do? I was planning on starting an IRA to supplement my retirement *before* I found out about this, as in, I met with my bank on 12/14/17 to get info on IRAs. Since I can't do pre-tax deductions through my payroll to pay into a Roth IRA, is a traditional IRA the better choice? I was planning on putting 3-5K over the period of 2018 into the IRA, but.... now there's a wrench in the works. I'm getting basically ""back pay"" for taxes and retirement funds erroneously withheld throughout 2017 (thanks to the university), that I won't be able to put into an account until *January 2018*. Of the money coming back to me from the university for retirement and SS/medicare, 2.5K is retirement which I want to put into a retirement savings (and if I could put more of the 6K check into that as well, it'd be swell), but it seems like this will reduce how much I can contribute over 2018 since the university only discovered the error and got around to fixing it at the literal last business day of 2017, so it's not like I can get the money, deposit it, and transfer it to some retirement account before 2018.

Thanks for any help! 

I'll try to answer questions that I know the answer to, but I'm in touch with some benefits office, my department payroll, and the nascent postdoc union trying to get information on what the hell is going on with my pay status and benefits. I'm also trying to collect still about 1.5K in owed back pay that's been accumulating since August 2017, so if anyone has advice on that, let me know!",finance
personalfinance,"28 yrs old couple, 2017 budget and finance summary for anyone interested. Thanks pf!","Hi everyone!

This is my first post ever online anywhere in my 28 years of life.  Please go easy on me. 
We got married 2.5 years ago (we're both 28 now) and we started tracking our finance more closely starting last year.  We use Mint to export all our transactions and use Excel to categorize our spending every month together.  Since we started this, we learned a lot about our spending and we thought sharing how we track our finances might be helpful to some people.

I will break this post into three categories: 1.  Break down of my paycheck, 2. our monthly spending and 3. how we're investing our assets

**here's a high level breakdown of where my paycheck went (my wife is finishing her school this year)**

*Total Income: 172k
*Federal, Medicare, Social Security Tax: 38k
*Healthcare: 2.5k
*401k: 10k
*Stock after tax: 44k (I work in IT industry and a portion of my pay comes in stocks) 
*Cash after tax: 78k
This gives us a total of 44k (stocks)  + 78K (cash) to spend after tax: $122k  (of course, I would have to sell these stocks if I wanted to spend it, but the income tax is already paid.)

**our monthly spending**

On average, we spent $5300 per month:
*Mortgage: 1600 (we bought a townhouse but more on this in investing assets section)
*HOA: 300
*Car payment: 300
*Grocery: 700, this includes Costco shopping for toiletries etc.
*Date night: 130
*me shopping: 110
*wife shopping:190
*eating out: 330
*Gas: 170
*Utility: 644^
*Special/Household items: 740^^
^basic utilities cover phone (190 for 3 people), internet (30), Auto insurance (110), electric.  We were initially surprised by the amount of utilities, but soon realized there is no way around it.  non-basic utilities include license renewals, car maintenance, parking, traffic tickets, etc. 
^^special/household items include traveling (on average, 6k per year), gifts for friends/family, special house items such as microwave, vacuum, etc.
In total, this comes out to $5300*12 = $63600 per year (compared to 122k after tax)

**how we are investing our money**

I believe that this section is equally important as the monthly spending section because depending on how you invest your money (and if you're lucky), your asset can grow more quickly than you think.
here are the key places we spent (or invested) our money:
*townhouse
- purchased in 2015 at 280k.  downpaid 30%, borrowed 70% at 15 yrs, 3%.  
- luckily the market went up and the current price is around 410k
* wife's school tuition
- 30k per year.  Tuition loan interest rate is 8%, so we didn't take out the loan and paid it off with her parents help.
* stocks
- my work pays partially in stocks and luckily the stock price went up significantly past 3-4 years.  we plan to keep our stocks for a few more years.
*401k
- we only put 10k this year (instead of max 18k).  This is because I wanted to have some room for cash flow for possibly buying a second house as an investment early next year. 

Disclaimer, we really lucked out.  But tracking where we're spending our money really helped us be mindful of our spending.  Also, diversifying our money into a townhouse and stocks really helped us grow our assets.   Thank you for reading and hope this post is useful for some people.

personalfinance,Opening two HSA accounts,"I would like to know if I would be able to open and maintain a second HSA account.  
I recently started a new job and chose to go with the HSA option under the assumption that I could open a Health Equity account and invest the funds in the account. My employer later informed me that they do not want to deal with that type of account and I should use a local, run of the mill bank instead. I did as requested and opened an HSA account with my local bank that has a .15% interest rate with $1.50/month fee. I get that there are still tax benefits to using the HSA, but that interest rate is seems terrible and is less than just a generic savings account with the same bank (.2% I believe).  
My question is whether I can open a second HSA account with Health Equity or similar and roll it over periodically or if the added fees would make this not worth the effort. Or maybe it's just not allowed period.

personalfinance,Recovering from debt: Credit score from 410 (Jan 2017) to 558 (Dec2017),"23, female, single, no rent to pay— making ~$2000/mo

Hey everyone. I recently discovered reddit (I’m late to the game, I know!) And I’m beyond happy I found this page. I need your advice on my situation. I’ll give you a summary of my current place &amp; finances/debts. Please give me any advice on how to properly manage my debt. 

Specifically, the student loans &amp; how to handle my court order from Capital One! I know the collections I can have paid in about 4 months. Thank you in advance! 

So here’s the quick summary: 2012-2014 I had near perfect credit. 775 to be exact. I had a $300 credit card I used for groceries in college and would pay it right away. Come 2015. I bought a car and the dealership took my SSN and ran about 30 hard inquiries on my report. I also now had two more CC, one for $500 (REI/US bank) &amp; $1000 (capital one). I was working 4 PT jobs to pay rent, my car payment &amp; basic necessities. Had a bad rough patch. Lost main source of income. Never paid cards. Accumulated more Student loan debt as well after taking the TERRIBLE advice from an upperclassman to “take out a larger loan for living expenses. 

So here’s what happened. From 2015-17 my score dropped to 410. 
———————
Here’s what is included in my debts: 
Currently in collections from T-Mobile, USbank, as well as smaller debts: $3000

Capitol One is taking me to court in March for my debt of $1200. (PLEASE PLEASE tell me how to avoid this, I want to just settle and pay it in full!)

Private and federal student loans: $60k &amp; $27k (went to a private school, another terrible choice) 

I was about 10 credits short of graduating &amp; my college wouldn’t let me complete my bachelors because I *refuse* to take out ANOTHER student loan. So add to the tab, $26k I owe in back tuition for last year. 

Finally, my car loan. I owe $10k.


It’s a lot. I’m drowning in it. I couldn’t find employment for over six months and worked any thankless job to pay my monthly bills so I wouldn’t add collections. Doing this, and Selling things on OfferUp allowed me to pay my bills and helped raise it the 100+ points. (Phew)

USAA: $700 breakdown: I was given a bad check for $1000. I put it into savings, but had to spend it for bills. Once it came back a bad check, USAA took the amount of check out and put my accounts on hold. I paid it down to 700 but should also note I need to pay within 40 days and it’s been 12). 

—- in meantime opened a credit union account and all paychecks will be deposited here. 


So here’s my current bills: 

Car payment: $180 (I’ve been paying more when I can)
Phone : $100
Car insurance: $140
Gym: $20 

I’ve stopped eating out. I don’t buy anything unless it’s car maintenance. And I don’t have to pay rent since I moved back in with my parents. I got a retail job that pays $2000 a month give or take until I can find something more serious. 


So please tell me: how do I get a grip on this debt. Everyone jokes about it like “oh we’re all gonna be in car/house/student loan debt forever” and I REFUSE. Goal is to at least pay off my car and all small debts this year. Is it possible? 

Last two questions: 
Can I get the student loans deferred more if I plan to finish up school at a public college if I can qualify for aid? 

Also, I don’t have a credit card. At all. I  wanted to save and get a $5k limit one from USAA (the kind where you make the initial deposit) is this a good idea?

litecoin,"Newbie in sub, oldtimer in LTC.","Hi all. I bought a bunch of BTC and LTC in 2012 and 2013, mostly because the principles of sound money appeal to the libertarian in me. I put them all in armory paper wallets, which I promptly lost in my filing cabinet! 

When I found the BTC wallet in April (stuffed in between old bank statements and utility bills OBVIOUSLY!) I sold most of my BTCs to liberate my family from debt, and was pretty happy with myself until November. Lol. Now I'm a little bit salty! 

Still, I kept all my LTC, and I have to say that as the price booms, it piques the public interest more and more, and the dream of a sound money free from government/central bank interference becomes more and more real. Nearly all of my friends have been in touch this month with ""I remember you carrying on about this Bitcoin thing years ago, and now it's in the news so I want to actually listen to you now"" type conversations.

Anyway, I'd like to say to the people upset with Charlie, most kindly, I understand why you're upset.

Don't worry too much about the price. I truly believe and have always believed that by 2030, BTC and LTC will be so valuable that it won't matter if you bought at $10 or at $10000! Worry more about the development of the technology, and do what you can to support it.

And smile! Average Joe is just cluing on now, and trying to figure out what a wallet is. There's an insane road of growth, failures, new applications, and government crackdowns ahead. It will be beautiful, it will be ugly, but at the end, we'll be free!",cryptocurrency
Ripple,Why Banks Need XRP,"Hi everyone-  I’m still new to crypto world, but my first investment choice was XRP, although I had some impeccable timing with LTC and ETH. XRP is the one token (so far) that I can claim to understand the use case AND believe it to truly have real world applications.

Many of the doubters, haters, FUD puddles out there are reluctant to concede that Ripple has some solid applications. However, if they do, the next argument tends to be that banks will never use XRP because (insert reason here).

Since I work in finance- here’s why I think banks will adopt XRP:

1) The bottom line. Many banks are highly regulated AND publicly traded companies. Regulations make it very hard to be innovative (SWIFT anyone?) and publicly traded companies are beholden to shareholders to create profits— either through dividends or price appreciation.

Ripple has built the framework through xRapid, and they have the token XRP. For a bank to spend millions on trying to develop “their own” would be a colossal waste of time and resources IMO. Time would better be spent in partnering with Ripple to refine the issues that may arise.

2) Bottom line part 2.  If the use of XRP and xRapid speeds up global transactions to less than 5 seconds— and cuts massive costs in doing so— this is huge for bank liquidity and profits. Banks make money by lending... but any bank tied to a Central bank is required to maintain a certain level of reserves. Can you imagine how much easier it would be for banks to maintain this requirement if major financial settlements went from days to just seconds? The global velocity of money would likely see a significant increase.

3) XRP as a standard greases the financial rails on a global scale. Can you imagine how wonky the whole system would be if some banks use XRP, some have proprietary tokens, some avoid crypto altogether, etc?  Having a global standard makes it much, much easier for the system to work as it should. I wouldn’t expect mass adoption w XRP immediately, but it’s the only outcome that makes sense to me (if banks are serious about partnering with Ripple)

4)  A brave new world. No one — repeat no one anticipated that Amazon would become the company we know today. As more technology innovations become usable, banks are going to face competition for customers’ assets. There are trillions of dollars in cash here in the US. This is money not being deployed anywhere— just on the sidelines. As companies like Ripple (and others) innovate and help consumers discover ways to hold their funds and earn interest while maintaining liquidity... things are going to get interesting.  I think this is just the beginning.

That being said, regulators gonna regulate. I don’t care how tough ppl talk on the internet, if the feds knock on your door, it’s game over. I like the fact that Ripple is trying to partner with and improve the systems we have in place. I see them as regulator friendly. This is a big positive for them (and us hodlers)

These are just a few of my thoughts... and I could be wrong. I’ll leave you with this analogy— If you need to go to the moon, are you going to use the rocket fuel created for the rocket, or you gonna fill it up w regular unleaded because it’s your own blend?

Now with giant market caps and everyone's portfolio booming, the greed sets in and people want to see their gains locked in. I can only hypothesize that people are thirsty for regulation to see their large gains locked in, and begin to grow steadily. I can't blame people for wanting the volatility to end, especially when you're sitting on top of a mound of cash, but handing over this industry to the banks will spell it's demise.

If you're of the opinion that the government is reasonable in it's approach to regulation, I can say with certainty you are mistaken. If you are of the opinion financial regulations are written objectively by unbiased federal regulators and not influenced by Goldman Sachs, you are mistaken. If you are of the opinion that cryptocurrencies have a role to fill after being heavily subdued, you are mistaken.

The only way your portfolio grows is if new money enters the arena. Once wall street gets their grubby hands on the power to write legislation to control it, they'll beat it like a rented mule into submission. There's no room for this in their system, and a cost benefit analysis on the back of a napkin is enough to see that they'd prefer to just keep their racket going, not some new ""disruptive"" technology. When the new money looks at where to put their cash, why would they invest in crypto if it's no better than a USD? Why would I risk my hard earned money in such a volatile, still unproven market? If i'm too busy to fuss with keeping up with this, i'd prefer the safer bet. Remember, most people don't even monitor their 401k. Most people are busy living their daily lives and too concerned about a Kardashian getting a boob job. You can't expect people to inform themselves or do homework on this, they just don't have the mental bandwidth or interest in it. Hence, they'll likely choose a safer vehicle for long term investment, not crypto. The market atrophies. 

I just don't see a scenario where regulation is beneficial. The answer to the problems we see with insider trading is simply using another service. However, people are lazy and will always gravitate to the user-friendly service. You have to speak with your dollars. The answer to security/hacks is simply better technology. All of this is in my humble opinion, and I don't have all the answers. What I do know however, is that handing over everything to the government is the end of this industry. They never do things lightly and are firmly under the influence of wallstreet. If you don't believe this, I pray to one day live as blissfully ignorant as thee.",cryptocurrency

I'm absolutely horrible at saving $ and budgeting, so I hope to learn some valuable tips here and become more aware of my money. 2017 was a complete chaos with many unplanned emergencies and just bad decisions overall. I moved to a place that costs more but then decided to get roommates and oh boy, was that a bad decision. Got myself into all kinds of debt and my plans for the upcoming year are to 

* pay off all this debt and clean my name 
* cancel all credit cards 
* move to a cheaper location with SO 
* start seriously planning my grocery shopping/meals.

To be able to achieve this I need to make a few sacrifices such as 

* quit eating out, especially on payday 
* pay the bills and utilities as soon as I get them (instead of waiting for their due date) 
* go to work and uni by bus instead of using the car 
* bring a snack to uni and work every day instead of eating in the cafeteria.

I know it won't be easy but I am determined to accomplish at least #1 goal. I'm fed up with my score being so low and struggling every end of the month w/o money for food. 
If anyone has any tips or advice or just want to wish me good luck, please do. I need to start getting my s* together.


_________

Edit so as to give out some details: 

currently living with my SO and 2 other girls in this apartment. We moved in June so I can only leave in June/18. The reason why I decided to move here even though it would be way more expensive is that I used to live far from my job and would spend tons on gas. We only had one roommate as it was a 2-bedroom apt. We moved to a 3-bedroom apt bc I already had in mind I'd rent the third room.

Rent plus maintenance fees add up to $1512. Power, water, and gas run at about $500 monthly. Plus the internet and cable TV bill (it's cheaper to get them as a combo than to ditch the cable TV which no one ever uses) is $320. All this adds up to $2332, so I'll use $2400 to round it up, since every month the bills are a surprise.
The two roommates give me $550 monthly for their rooms w/ bills included. SO also gives me $550, and I pay the rest, which is usually between $600-$700. I don't want to raise their rent and I'm kinda OK with paying a little extra since SO and I have the master suite and the only room in the house that has A/C. 

I try to go to college by bus and to work by bus or on foot. This year I had a knee injury which made me go back to driving to work, so I spent a bunch on gas (still way less than in the last apartment). SO and I go grocery shopping twice a month, around every 15 days or so. We buy the bulky items and meals and eventually go to the local grocery store to get smaller items throughout the week. I'd say we spend more or less, $400 on food and household items per month. $80 of this he gets from his job as a benefit, so it's great. Same with the bus fares, he gets a card from his job and I use it, so it's kinda free (regardless of whether he uses the benefit or not, they'll still give it to him.) That's all about we spend with ourselves. 

We have 3 cats so we always get them litter which adds up to $100 every month plus their food which is around $150, we buy the big bags that last 45 days or so. SO makes minimum wage, so his salary is around $900. I'm a teacher so I don't have a steady income, but it fluctuates between $1800-$2300 per month.",finance

personalfinance,Lowering interest rate on Capital One card (or other option)?,"I have a Capital One card that I received when I was 18. This was the first credit card that I ever used, so from my super limited understanding, I was told by a banker that I have to leave this terrible card open because my credit score is heavily based on it.

My card only has a limit of $3000, and I owe $2800. For a long time, I could only afford $100 dollar monthly payments. I get slapped with 50-60 dollars interest a month.

I am working on reducing the ""Expenses D"" category and hoping to put some away in savings. Spending is a struggle for me. Any tips for this are welcome. 

I've already switched to the highest tax deduction to avoid the back taxes issue in the future. 

My first question: What's the best way to approach the credit card debt?
Of the 1000/month toward debt, I plan to do 470/month to Debt C, considering it's the highest interest rate (avalanche method). I used unbury.us to figure this out. Alternatively, should I open another credit card with a 0% balance transfer offer? I've already done this twice and paid one off before the 0% offer period ended. At what point is having too many credit cards a liability? Should I look into personal loans like Prosper and Upstart? I generally throw away those mailers because they seem predatory. Should I cash out retirement account A? Probably not, from what I've read on this sub.

My second question: I am obviously living (nearly) paycheck to paycheck. Should I be prioritizing savings over paying off debt, or am I on the right track here?

personalfinance,"Questions about filling taxes. (US, filing an extension and filing without a W-2)","So I realized I am going to be in a difficult situation filing taxes this winter.    

Let's start with a background story.  I worked a summer job for an employer in a different state than my residence.      I recently got an email mentioning how that employer does not provide W2s electronically, and due to distance reasons, it will not be practical to travel solely to pick up a W-2.    The option of mailing the W-2 form exists, but given how long it took for the final paychecks from that job to arrive, it is highly unlikely that they would arrive with enough time to finish filling before the April deadline, assuming they even arrive at all.

Because I never got the final two paychecks (yet) from that job, I do not know exactly how much was withheld in total for state/federal taxes.      I heard that form 4852 (may have the wrong number) can be used for filing without a W-2, but I would prefer to avoid guessing on the amounts.  I will attempt to contact the employer and see if I can obtain exact amounts later.

Another question I have.  I know that people can file extensions to file taxes (I should have withheld way more in state/fed taxes than I will owe).   Do you have to list a reason or have demonstrated extreme circumstances to file for an extension, or is anyone just simply allowed to file for more time?

AGEN is currently on the downtrend and will likely hit its 52 week low soon. But that's because of no news until 1Q of 2018 as the last CC stated. But here is why I am super Bullish on AGEN for 2018:

1. AGEN has a [QS-21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4874334/) adjuvant that's FDA proven. Its is marketed inside GSK's Shingrix vaccine for shingles (a vaccine that was [approved](https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/shingrix-approved-in-the-us-for-prevention-of-shingles-in-adults-aged-50-and-over/) by the CDC as the primary form of action against the disease with a &lt;90% efficacy rate). Shingrix will be going in front of the AUS, JPN, EU, India and China federal boards and will be getting global revenue as well. Agen will get 2% of [potential $1 billion drug](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gsk-shingles/gsk-files-potential-1-billion-shingles-vaccine-for-u-s-approval-idUSKCN12O0I6). QS-21 is also going to have a read out in January with Bill Gates' [malaria vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTS,S) with trials being run by WHO with the best current preliminary results. QS-21 can also be used with other drugs for diseases such as HBV and HIV so future partnerships are likely.

2. AGEN's [CTLA-4, PD-1](http://agenusbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/CTLA-4_AACR_04082016_FINAL_POSTER.pdf) and [OX-40](http://agenusbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/OX40-Poster-AACR17-Gonzalez-4703-MT09_FINAL_UPLOAD.pdf) have shown incredible promise. AGEN's CTLA-4 has higher binding rates than current market leader Yervoy (which is a billion dollar drug). PD-1 will compete with Merck's Keytruda a [monster drug in its own right.](https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-10-30/merck-delays-keytruda-chemo-trial-results-for-good-reason) OX-40 is partnered with Incyte who bought [10 million shares at $6 in February.](https://endpts.com/agenus-pockets-a-fast-80m-in-cash-and-hands-the-rd-keys-over-to-incyte/) Watch out for GITR as well because it [showed complete tumor regression in 60% of the treated animals](https://jitc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40425-017-0266-x)

3. 10 potential readouts of their pipeline in 2018 including CTLA-4, PD-1, OX-40, TIGIT, LAG-3, GITR, Mosquirix etc. 5 of those are partnered by Incyte. Therefore at the very least 10 triggers + future partnership news in 2018.

4. Formation of [AgenTus](http://www.agentustherapeutics.com/platform/), a subsidiary that will focus on CAR-T and TCR drug formation while also giving tax-free dividends to stockholders. Its headed by [Bruno Lucidi](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bruno-lucidi-appointed-chief-executive-officer-of-agentus-therapeutics-the-cell-therapy-subsidiary-of-agenus-300541200.html), formerly of Indenix, whose companies have been acquired by Merck and Gilead for a combined 15 Billion.

5. [Institutional ownership at 45.8%, with average analyst price target at $11](https://www.finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=agen0).

6. Partnered with GSK, Merck and Incyte with milestone payments agreed. Definite chances of future partnerships with others and the same companies in 2018 as stated in the conference call.

Genuinely the only drug I'm iffy on is their Glioblastoma vaccine, Prophage. Glioblastoma is a tough disease and I don't expect great numbers there. But Prophage is partnered with the National Cancer Institute and if that longshot pans out the reward will be immense.

In short, this stock has huge potential. It has an impressive pipeline and revenue streams to boot. My conservative PT for AGEN by this time next year is $9. Which at current prices is almost 3X growth. Of course please do your own DD as well. I believe that the current price will yo-yo between 3.2-3.6 until the news hits which should be 1Q 2018.",finance

Bitcoin,Australian bank cash-reserve requirements buckle under bitcoin trading pressure.,"/DEC 31, 2017/

Australia's ""big 4"" banks, dominating 83% of Australia's banking industry, stepped up their efforts to [block crypto-currency trading](http://www.smh.com.au/business/bitcoin-tensions-rise-as-investors-claim-banks-freezing-their-accounts-20171229-p4yy3z.html) and stem the outflow of customer cash this week, spiking a renewed wave of social-media condemnation.

Banking regulation in Australia requires banks to hold a minimum of 11% cash against loans they write, so as crypto-investors move their savings out of the banking system, those banks loose their ability to legally write new loans, or worse, fall into non-compliance with their reserve obligations.

The big-4 banks pay no interest (0%) to business accounts, while personal accounts earn from 0% to 1% annual interest and attract a range of fees and charges.  Contrast this with cryptocurrencies, where bitcoin earned more than 1400% in 2017, and Ethereum earned above 8600% and it's clear to see why Australians have lost interest in keeping their deposits in their bank account.  In just one year, a decent investment in crypto outstrips even an entire lifetime's investment in Australia's second-top performer: real-estate - a market that itself is seeing lower and lower returns, with widespread acknowledgement that it's also 30% overpriced, and on-path for a major correction in 2018.

APRA, the body responsible for setting the cash reserve limits, increased the reserve limit shortly after the GFC, as Australians fearful for their funds placed heavy pressure on cash withdrawals, forcing the Australian Federal Reserve to print billions in additional cash to prevent widespread customer panic.  APRA added 1% to the cash reserve minimum to help ensure the banks survive the next rush.

Unfortunately, [investigations](https://barnabyisright.com/2011/06/24/our-banking-system-operates-with-zero-reserves/
) reveal that interbank-loans accounts for more than 90% of their cash reserve requirements, and that when all these are taken into account, Australian banks are really only holding 1.22% in actual cash reserves.

To put that into perspective - for every $12,200 invested in bitcoin, the big-4 banks need to deny or call-in $1M worth of loans.  That's money that traditional investors ordinarily need for buying more houses.  Australia's real-estate market is already on thin ice - it's catch-22: because houses are so overpriced, interest rates need to be kept extra low, but because rates are low and houses are overpriced, investors are now turning to alternative and better performing investments, which means less money to write loans, less people to buy houses, less chance of making money (and much higher risk) for real-estate.  Australia's housing market is so overpriced that investments in Crypto are arguable less risky.

So it's time for social media to stop blaming the banks for halting the outflow of cash into crypto: it's not their fault.  Australia allowed banks to profit (and house prices to spike) off the back of ""invented"" money so long as banks hold a little bit back in cash.  Now that Australia's real-estate-ponzi has reached 30% past it's breaking point, it's no wonder investors want their cash out.

Don't expect the majority of Australians to shed any tears: 2017 also marked the turning point in Australia's history where house prices became so unaffordable that more than 50% of the population will never in their lifetime be able to afford one.  2018 will mark an interesting reversal of fortunes in Australia, where ""Safe"" is not ""Houses"" anymore.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,In debt need advice,"A bit about myself:

Recently, I injured myself helping a friend move. I was crushed by a washing machine and bedframe, ended up pinned against the wall at the bottom of a stair case. I broke and dislocated my left shoulder (had full reconstructive surgery), broke a rib, fractured two ribs, fractured my right shoulder, micro-fractured my spine, and sprained my wrist. 

I’m 25, a college graduate, looking for job in my field. Currently, I bartend for a living and make about 45k a year. I currently have $14,000 debt for my education. My medical bills were originally $9,000, but I was able to reduce them to $6,200. I was out of work for three months after my injury. I drained my savings, however, I still paid off some of the medical debt down to $5,600. 

My credit card debt is killing me. Currently I owe them about 7.6k, and the amount I’m paying in interest is ridiculous. I’m going nowhere trying to pay it off. The rate I am paying 22%, but today I found a solution: an expired Barclay credit card. It was rated one of the best credit cards based off a few google searches. So, I decided to give them a call. After discussing my situation and credit score, they gave me a rate of 15% percent interest and offered to buy my 7.6k debt with a 4% transfer fee. Additionally, Barclay will give me until August to pay down the 7.6k debt at an interest rate of 4% per month. Whatever debt is left after August will be transferred onto my barclay card with 15% interest. 

I do have an investment account through Ameritrade. It is mostly managed by my father, the current value of the account is 17k. I’ve talked to my dad about using some of the money to pay off my medical bills and he told me “Don’t fuck with that money, figure it out another way.” Typically I trust my father with financial advice, but he doesn’t know about my credit card debt nor do I want him to. 

I’m weighing the options. At a 4% interest rate with my credit card debt, I can begin to pay it off finally. However, even under ideal circumstances I will still have some debt remaining in August. The remainder will have an interest rate of 15%.

I still haven’t calculated the penalties I’d receive for transferring money out of my investment account, but I think it may be one of my best options to get out of the situation I’m in. 

TLDR: 

Debt: 
14k - student loans 
7.6k - credit card debt (4% interest until August, then 15%) 

Assets: 
17k - Stockmarket investments 

Income: ~2,500/m (this number will increase as I heal and am able to work more hours)

Bills: 
1,500 (Rent, food, utilities, ect.) 

What else can I do to get out of the situation I’m in? Any tips, questions, or ideas are welcome.",finance

I have been living paycheck to paycheck while focusing on school and I feel like this puts me on the brink of homelessness. This could be enough to break me. I have not as of yet gone out of my way to establish credit so I don't know what to expect. I would try and borrow from family but I'm estranged and I don't have any friends who I would consider close enough to ask this of. I should also mention that I applied for fafsa but was denied due to my parents income despite the fact that my parents don't help me financially or in any way. My question is this. Are there any agencies out there that are know to be more reputable than other? Is there a place that has lower interest rates? I was considering a some kind of grant for school but given the time restraint I don't think that it's likely i'll get one in time? Any advice is greatly appreciated. I didn't know this existed until a friend suggested it and I've spent some time scrolling through posts and I see that many have been helped. Thank you for taking the time to read this.,finance

My bank is has been trying to nickel and dime me. Fees for Bill Pay, Fees for ATM, Fees for maintenance...Fees Fees Fees....

Ive searched around this sub and it seems like Ally, and Alliant banks are always the top choice.

I'm not looking for much just a few things like:
* no fees for bill pay
* no maintenance fee
* I travel a lot, so I would like my ATM charge to be as low as possible.
* good and easy to navigate website
* good customer service.
* online banking is fine

This sub consistently recommends Ally or Alliant.  I've also looked into Discover, but I'm kind of wanting to lean towards a credit union.

I'm going to check into my local credit union when they are open after new years, but according to their website, I don't think they waive the ATM fees when you travel to another state.  

Any other recommendations for my needs?

personalfinance,Debating a home equity loan or HELOC,"I have been researching the possibility of a home equity loan or HELOC to pay off high interest debt. I was luck enough nto purchase a forclosed home for $199k back in 2012. The value now is around $310-$320k. Since then i have run into some credit issues and had to purchase 2 vehicles at very high interest rates. Currently I'm paying $432 (on a 10k loan) for on and $320 on a ($8k loan) on the other. One of the vehicles I purchased was a full electric Nissan leaf which I used to commute to a job I no longer have. Since then I paid cash for an older truck that I use almost exclusively. With the home equity loan I would like to pay off both vehicles and sell the Nissan since I have no use for it now and it's just an extra payment and insurance every month. There are a few home maintenance/ repairs I need to do as well.  My thinking is by eliminating the 2 car payments and insurance on the leaf, which I will sell, I can save almost $1000 a month. I have thought about selling the house but since I paid such a low price almost any other home purchase or rental would be more than my current mortgage ($1432).

personalfinance,Advice for dealing with my upside-down car loan,"I am a 22 yr old male with a car that is worth ~$4000 with ~$9500 left on it after 2 years. I had no credit when I bought it and had no choice to buy it at 5.6% (no car at the time with only $1000 to my name). The car runs perfect, just got inspected with 0 issues and is at 110k miles. Currently I have $10,000 in a savings account that I can withdraw at any time, ~$1500 in a Roth 401k and $400 in my checking. My only other bills are my $250/mo. insurance which would drop to $120 with it paid off and some other miscellaneous bills (internet, spotify, gym etc.) My current options are either; 

1. Paying it off with cash right now and leaving myself with $500 in savings and my 401k

2. Utilizing my bank's savings loan option where I'm charged 2% interest instead of the 5.6% where my savings ""freezes"" and I pay it back as I go using my savings as collateral. 

3. Refinancing. In the end I've already paid most of the interest and if I refinance to a 2-3% interest rate i'd only save ~$400 over the last 4 years.

personalfinance,Friend Inherited Some Money,"Hey guys, my friend needs some help. They inherited some money when their grandma died. They were wondering what they had to pay in state taxes on it.

My friend lives in Missouri, and their grandma lived in Kentucky. She passed away a few months ago. She left my friend $48,000. My friend paid off their car and paid for college and now has around $30,000.

Also, they said they didn't have to pay federal taxes because it wasn't enough money to be taxable. Is this true?

Edit: from my comment below

I actually have a couple more questions, if you could help more. 

1) I just got some additional info. Friend said that the lawyer told them ""taxes haven't been paid on the inheritance"" I said that any deductions should've happened before they got the money. Friend said they told the lawyer that, and the lawyer said it ""wouldn't happen until tax time""

2) The lawyer said that friend would need to include the 48K as income on their tax return. After some searching around, it looks to me like this is not true. Can you verify either way?",finance
investing,Equity Vs Real Estate,"Working in investments, it was always surprising to me that there is no strong consensus among professionals on the financial merits of home ownership. I was taught early on that home ownership was a lifestyle choice, and usually a bad financial choice. So buy one if you want to own a house, not because it's a good investment. This made sense to me, since home ownership goes against a lot of the conventional wisdom of investing (active, leveraged, not diversified, negative cash flow, low risk/return profile, etc.).


But I also regularly meet financial analysts, portfolio managers, and CFOs that love home ownership over stocks as an investment. These are generally well educated financial professionals, so I assume they have a reason for thinking this. When I bring up the conventional arguments, they'll counter with points about tax benefits and the leverage being relatively cheap and actually a good thing. That's usually where the conversation ends, because neither of us will have the numbers to back up the economic value of the leverage and tax benefits, so we just end up agreeing that ""it depends"".


So I did a deep dive analysis myself. The St. Louis Fed provides housing price and mortgage data from 1975. On a pure return basis, there's no question that equity dominates housing over that time period. The SP500 total return is 13,114%, or 12.0% annualized. US housing is 675% or 4.5% annualized. However, making some adjustments for leverage and tax, the difference is much smaller. SP500 is 10,923% or 11.5% annualized, and housing is 3,571% or 8.7% annualized. (See Edit 3.)


This is a small enough delta that I can now see how there are plenty of specific personal situations that would push housing above equity as a preferred asset class. On average, stocks are probably better, but for some people, housing might be. ""It depends"" is actually a very accurate answer. As an example, I did the same for California housing specifically, and it came out to 9,131% or 11.1% annualized. Just one change and already housing has almost caught up to stocks on an absolute return basis.


Anyway, thought this might be a question some of you have also been meaning to look into, and just haven't had the time. In addition to sharing, I also wanted to put my calculation out there for critique. I know there are major simplifying assumptions I've made, including a mortgage that fluctuates based on housing value, multiple instances of straight line averaging instead of compounding, mixing historical and current data, heavy use of midpoint averaging, etc. but I'm wondering if any of my assumptions are a big enough distortion to render the analysis grossly inaccurate.


Spreadsheet link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oim4RGz-v8PUogTaQgDdc-rQDmjv-DPYi3i1xdFwvMk/edit?usp=sharing

EDIT: Wow I just realized I missed a major factor. This analysis ignores rent entirely. Maybe I'll take another crack at it tomorrow morning. (Or someone else can using the spreadsheet.)

EDIT 2: Rent might not be as big a deal as I thought. Gross rental yield is maybe around 2.9%, and average property tax is 1.2%. Add on all the other home ownership costs like maintenance and repairs and the net rental yield may actually be much lower than I thought.

EDIT 3: Just woke up. Adding net rental yield is harder than I thought. I'm using 9% gross, from ATTOM's 2017 single family rentals report (much higher than the 2.9% I googled last night). Then I'm using 5% as an estimate for net tax + insurance + maintenance/repairs. This is just based on my personal experience, and I would love to replace this number with a more reliable one from some kind of national report. Adding on an extra 4% per year from rental yield, the adjusted national housing return actually tops out the equity return, 17,654% or 12.8% annualized. Big difference.",finance

tron,Clu could only do what he was programmed to do,"Clu was an unaging copy of Flynn's personality at the time he was created. Flynn was an egotistical (more benignly than most, I guess, but still) guy who wanted to create a perfect system. He was also a programmer. 

Flynn told Clu to create a perfect system. Not a perfect world, a perfect _system_. A computer program can literally only do what you write it to do, nothing else. Even glitches are because of bad code or unforeseen interactions. So Clu was only following the orders he was created with, all the way to the end. 

A perfect _world_ is what Flynn wanted the Grid to be; but he told Clu _system_. A ""world"" can have humanity; a ""system"" needs efficiency. A computer program can only do what you write it to do. So every program needs a purpose and if it doesn't have a purpose, it is technically a waste of space. 

The ISOs were spontaneously created, not built by a programmer, and had no predictability or inherent purpose. They were too human. Humans can exist without programmed meaning (free will) but up until then, programs could not and had no precedent of doing so. Flynn, knowing the real world and being a human himself, saw the humanity in the ISOs. 

Clu, being a program himself and ordered to create the perfect (most efficient) system, saw the ISOs as meaningless bloatware. Unless you were learning to code, or having fun, both of which are _human_ things to do, would you waste time and your computer's memory coding a file that doesn't specifically do anything? Probably not. If you became aware that there were meaningless programs on your computer taking up space and processing power, what would you do? Delete them. I'm sure everyone here has deleted bloatware before. That's what Clu thought the ISOs were, and what he thought he was doing. 

Since Clu could not age (he even jokes about the passage of time not being kind to Flynn, who responds by complimenting Clu for looking as young as Flynn once was), he could not change in any other way. He could never learn to see the humanity of the Grid the way Flynn came to. Since Clu was a computer program, he could only do what he was programmed to do, and nothing else. And since Flynn gave Clu equal administrator privileges, the only way he could stop Clu was to wipe the entire computer.

personalfinance,Credit card companies and fraud? (CAN),"I see a lot of posts here about credit cards. My main question is does anybody know what credit card companies are doing to tackle ID theft and credit card theft? 

I'm a small business owner who recently moved into the online space, I've become proficient in determining orders placed with stolen credit cards. 

Unfortunately all of my attempts to do something about it have led to nowhere, it would seem no one is doing anything about it. First, I called the police in my area, who directed me to call the police in the region an order was placed. I called the police in several regions, I was informed by the police that the people who own the address are probably not the thieves, what the criminals do is order to an address they know no one will be home, and will swipe it off the porch or wait outside. This knowledge led to the next step,  offering the police the ability to capture whoever had stolen the credit card by sending an empty box and sending them the tracking number. The responses were disgruntling, they plainly said it was not worth their time. It would seem 3 police vehicles at one traffic stop are well worth the time; one staking out a location for a guaranteed criminal to show up, not so much. 

This led me to my next option, which was to call the federal investigation unit for fraud in Canada, unfortunately there is nothing for them to do either. 

My last step was to contact the credit card companies to report suspicious activity on the cards. Unfortunately again that road is near impossible to get somewhere. 

It seems there is no one who has the job of capturing people who commit credit card theft. I have information that police and credit card companies can use, I've discovered there is definitely a credit card fraud ring or one really active person in Quebec Canada by google mapping several fraudulent orders in the same area. 

There's nobody I know of to share this information with, it seems nobody cares, credit card companies don't have a division to reach for businesses to report information.",finance

When I graduated high school I was 17 and had to do all of my loans and such myself and had no financial support from anyone, and no grants as my parents made good money, but none of it contributed to my college. I went to an expensive music school which is a super dumb idea but I was 17. Anyways, now I have a bachelors in music and I’ll have a bachelors in computer information systems this spring, as I went back to school and paid out of pocket for my second bachelors of science at a good but cheap school.

I have a child with my ex wife and right now it’s about a 50/50 split in custody and I only pay $30 a month in support. I can’t move more than 100 miles away without custody being changed. 

I also have $150-160k in student loans, which honestly I can’t even estimate within the nearest 5 grand anymore. The interest rates are around 12% and they keep increasing at just an laughable rate. All of it is from rent and tuition for a music school. 

I have a paid internship this summer and the job after will most likely pay $60k a year before taxes and any additional bonuses. 

Clearly by the time I start working at a full time career in the fall my loans will be even higher. So if I paid my loans, even at the minimum each month, I couldn’t even afford low income housing. Much less food and transportation for even myself. 

I understand paying off highest interest rate debts first and living frugally, but at the current rate I’m going to be living in a cave and unable to pay what will most likely be a few hundred in child support. Because I was 17 and wanted to go to music school and had to handle all of the financial stuff myself. 

Honestly the situation is so absurd I can’t even fathom what can be done on my own. 

There are no jobs in my town so I have to move to a city an hour away, which is a gorgeous little city with a good amount of tech jobs, so it’s not bad at all. I will have my daughter about the same time each week but will be making significantly more than her mother who lives at home, which probably means more child support. So I can’t just stay with my parents and not have a rent due.",finance

BlockChain,Is Blockchain a utopian vision or is it holding us back?,"If you believe everything you read, blockchain is the answer to all life's problems: it will even prevent crime and cure cancer! There's not a day goes by where I don't read an article, a tweet, or watch a video where blockchain (specifically) is credited as being the world's saviour to whatever problem the author is presently focused on. Blockchain is apparently the answer to all our security needs, all our privacy and anonymity needs, and our big government and big finance problems the world over.

But is it?

I ask, because blockchains save everything. Figuratively according to the believers, and literally according to the technology--which means the files will to continue to grow and will never shrink. 

That's my first gripe with it. *Nothing can ever be deleted.* Because if it could, that would mean the blockchain has to be refactored, which would mean it needs to be recreated and revalidated. Which means it would be susceptible to compromise, defeating the entire point of it. So content can only be marked as non-visible by a front-end, eg; a blog site using blockchain would only be able to mark contents as non-visible, but the content would still be there. Openly accessible by anyone using the API.

This creates a problem for things such as online abuse and content that has a limited lifespan for legal reasons. In the instance of abuse, say online bullying, doxing, or worse, the content cannot be removed. That can put people's lives at risk. I'm sure if you've spent any time online you'll see that people will take one of three views when they see abuse. They will side with the victim and possibly abuse the abuser, they won't care, or they will side with the abuser, even going so far as threatening the *victim* with death. We are a species of extremes, and the freedom to communicate digitally has really emphasised the best and the worst in humanity.

In the case of doxing, what do you think happens if the content can't be removed? There have been many cases where identities have been mistaken, maliciously or otherwise, and innocent people have received death threats or physical harm. Many people online don't take the time to analyse what they're reading. They respond with their emotions, sharing, commenting, jumping to conclusions, or simply siding with a person they like all too frequently.

This, to put it mildly, can be very problematic.

What about the case of limited lifespan content? We're seeing blockchain being pushed as the solution to various tech problems that don't exist. There are people and organisations selling tech solutions with blockchain because it's the new buzzword. It's become a religion for some folk--for others, a way to exploit others for financial gain.

In a world where disk space and network bandwidth isn't infinite, we simply *can't* keep everything. We don't *want* to keep everything. For example, we rotate logs on our servers because we can't keep everything. We remove full and incremental backups after certain times because not only do they waste valuable space, but they become useless after a while. Even in a major major catastrophe, restoring a backup prior to a month will never happen. The backed up data is just too old and useless. Any company that has to lose a month of data in a catastrophe is going to close their doors anyway because they will no longer be trusted by anyone.

What about financial records for tax purposes? In my country, we have to keep records for 7 years. After that we destroy them. Sure they don't need to be destroyed, but in the paper world, storing folders full of documents took up considerable physical space. In a digital world, as mentioned, it takes up disk space. Sure perhaps not a huge amount, but compare the volumes of a single person to a small business to a large multinational. Their needs are all different. It might be realistic for the lower end of the scale, but probably unrealistic for a large organisation. 

Anyone who thinks disk space is infinitely abundant or cheap has never had to build or fund a storage solution for a large corporation. Having large scale redundant arrays of disks, with at-rest encryption, highly available, duplicated offsite as backup, capable of high speed failover in a disaster recovery situation is really not cheap at all. Again, think about the scale. You at home with your PC vs. a large multi-national who expects to have data delivered and available globally in seconds. I can't imagine how much storage the world's major social networks require, and to have all that data globally distributed so that a person viewing the site in Khazakstan can make a post and have it show up for someone in Mexico seconds later. And someone in the US. And in the UK. And in France. And in Australia. I'm not even going to into network capacity and computer processing power. :)

Back to my point... There are other instances where data has to be destroyed for legal reasons after a certain timeframe too. A blockchain based solution doesn't just make this impractical, it makes this impossible. 

Could a blockchain be created that would allow content to be deleted? I'm sure it can, but the problems then would become about trust. Who do you trust to remove that content? How do they get the authority to delete it? If you require a quorum, what happens when the members disagree about the deletion and it sits at a stalemate? 

If content does get deleted, what happens to the blockchain files? There would have to be some way of refactoring it so that there isn't dead space there. In times of olde, hard drives would frequently need to be defragged--ie; defragmented. This was a time consuming and resource intensive operation that would move data around, say to the end of the disk, then go through it block by block and recreate it in sequential order at the start of the drive. That was designed to improve the speed that data was read at. If the drive head didn't have to jump all over the platter, it would be able to read faster. This is less relevant now with a mix of journalling filesystems and SSD drives which don't have to move a physical spindle and read-head, but the idea that data will be patchy across a blockchain file is relevant to our situation.

Oracle databases are another example of a horrible archaic technology that store data in blocks and require manual refactoring to eliminate the gaps. 

This is not a good idea. It's actually possible to delete *all* the data in a database and still have it take up the same amount of disk space if it's not refactored. Amazing eh? No, it's horrible. It's badly thought out design that was probably fine in the 1980s when they didn't expect data to grow to current sizes, but it's terrible now. Same in a blockchain. Somebody new to the chain would have to download a complete copy before they can begin working. What if they download something tens or hundreds of gigs (or terrabytes!) in size and there are no records? 

What a completely inefficient waste of space, bandwidth, and time.

With the data volumes in the modern world growing exponentially at a high rate, this sort of technology isn't sustainable. Even in the world of databases, we've hit a point where they're ingesting so much data that having a traditional relational database model isn't working any more. Many Big Data organisations are using NoSQL or similar databases, which are effectively just like throwing data at a wall. The requests are done in a much simpler fashion because it's less resource intensive. They're often dealing with millions or billions of rows of data and doing a traditional request limits the number of connections a server can receive, the amount of data it can process per second, and means fewer resources are needed to serve up the same amount of data. In situations such as financial transactions this can result in massive cost savings just from an infrastructure point of view. 

Can we see this now with Bitcoin? It's not living up to the dream of a global, high speed, cheap alternative to fiat currency. Sure, it's global, so we have 1 out of 3. 

We can't say to people, hey, download this wallet app, wait six hours for the blockchain to download over the McDonald's wifi, catch up those nine years of data, and then you can start buying digital money. Oh but first you'll have to wait a few days while the exchanges verify you, and a further few days for those purchases to stick. And when you transfer funds to someone else's wallet, it could take hours. Maybe days. 

That's just not good enough.

And yes, there are projects which aim to solve these problems, but many have simply forked Bitcoin and changed a few parameters. They are still susceptible to growing and slowing down in a similar way. Projects like Bitcore have done a hybrid fork and created a whole new blockchain to keep the size down, but how many years before they catch up in size and we get yet another project fork and spawn a new blockchain promising amazing speeds? It just seems like a very circular problem.

So I honestly believe that *blockchain is not the future of digital currency*. Not if we want those transactions to be lightning fast globally--persistently and permanently. And not if we expect to have billions of transactions per second happening all across the planet.

From the user perspective, it must be as simple as downloading a wallet app on our mobiles, punching in our credit card number, and being able to have digital cash instantly. We need to be able to go into a shop and have the transaction happen as fast or faster than handing over cash or swiping a credit card. Otherwise what's the point? I may as well just use analogue cash. We need to be better, faster, and easier than cash.

If we can't do that, then we've failed.

**OK, so doom and gloom aside, what would I have done if I were smart enough to implement a global digital finance system?**

For decentralisation, I would look to email. Emails, or ""transactions,"" take seconds to span the globe, even if they have attachments. They contain a path in the headers so you know how they arrived at the destination. 

Insecure as hell unless you add public/private key encryption to encrypt the contents. 

At which point you then have to deal with servers being hijacked or DNS being spoofed. DNSSEC aims to help in that regard. Having SSL/TLS certificates with chains of trust (not quite in the same way as blockchains) can prove that the originator and the recipients are who they claim to be.

But what about a server being hit by a DoS attack? That can take them offline for hours or days. Email deals with this by retrying a message for 4 days, after which it gives up and lets the originator know the message couldn't be delivered. 

What if you can't reach your own mail server? Or in the case of digital cash, your local transaction server? Well, just like email, you may have different email addresses and you could choose to send using a different email address. There's no reason a digital wallet couldn't have multiple transaction servers it's registered with that can validate your chain of trust. If one transaction server is down, send it to another. Same for the destination. You could CC the transaction to multiple recipients. The first to register the claim would take ownership. Or perhaps wallet addresses could have multiple routes to get to the same place. Dupe checks would be in place to ensure that multiple transaction servers don't deliver the same transaction more than once to the same wallet, or that the same server doesn't incorrectly deliver twice (like in a disaster recovery situation where a server is rolled back to a previous backup).

Wouldn't it be great to send a transaction to rjcreed@cyber.credits or sales@mylocal.subway.cyber.credits and let the internet figure it out just like email? Or have the shops' point of sale systems come up with a QR code onscreen that would translate to a specific transaction like:

cd08f7d8c16b8b96e07375acfcb3013eafae7418b9d692a5131ea66e789a545e@sales.mylocal.subway.cyber.credits

You could scan it with your digital wallet app, approve the transaction with your key or your eyeball or your fingerprint, and they would receive confirmation immediately on their screen that the transaction has been processed.

The other big factor that many people like is anonymity. In my scenario above, it would be down to the hosting transaction server to allow or disallow an ID that is anonymised or not. Naturally I expect that on the back end, when dealing with any financial institutions or in legal contexts that you would need to supply your correct legal information, but I don't see a need for this to be public information. Your source address doesn't need to be bob.smith@cyber.credits, for example. It could instead be BigDaddy5150@cyber.credits. Of course, when you pay their rent, or receive their wages, you might want something a bit more formal or professional. 

There are some other issues that would need attention which my ""solution"" doesn't cover:

- verification of funds available
- being able to globally freeze accounts of known scammers and thieves - *see [Etherdelta hack](https://news.bitcoin.com/one-week-etherdelta-hack-funds-still-stolen/)*
- being able to refund or reverse transactions from known scammers and thieves
- a global ledger--which would probably either be some kind of distributed blockchain that everyone verifies their transactions on without needing to actually download the blockchain themselves, or it would be a decentralised database that validation queries could be made against

So with all of my hypothesising, I hope I've given you some food for thought. I agree that blockchain is an excellent technical solution that is applicable to some scenarios, but I think it's being given far more credit than it's due.

I strongly believe that we haven't seen the end product for a global distributed financial system. Blockchain is an incredible first step, and it has got many people thinking about trying to come up with a better way or faster transactions, but when it's being used by the masses and the fiat currency has gone the way of the dodo, I don't think digital currency solutions will resemble what we currently have at all.

-- *[Randall J Creed](https://twitter.com/arsecheese), 30 December 2017*

What do you think? Is there something I'm missing? Are there projects in place that are working on new applications instead of using a blockchain based solution?

I'd love to hear about them and your thoughts.

**Unused Vehicles: $1.6 Billion**  — The Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Agriculture, Justice, Interior and other agencies purchased an estimated 64,500 passenger vehicles, with $25,600 as the average cost for one vehicle. A GOA review of three agencies revealed there is no way to confirm if any of the vehicles were used.

**Trolley Expansion: $1.04 Billion** — Last year the Department of Transportation awarded a $1.04 billion grant to extend a trolley line in San Diego, California, by 10.9 miles. The report noted that a billion dollars could pay for hundreds of miles of four-lane highways across the country.

**Lost Military Equipment: $1 Billion** — The Office of Inspector General at the Department of Defense reported that the agency could not account for more than $1 billion in military equipment, including weapons and military vehicles. Congress appropriated the money for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 to supply equipment to security forces in Iraq.

**Chimpanzee Habitat: $52 Million** — Over the past 17 years the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has spent more than $52 million to support the Chimpanzee Biomedical Research Resource, despite the fact that the 139 chimpanzees housed through the program are no longer used for biomedical research.

**Unused Software: $12 Million** — The Internal Revenue Service spent $12 million in 2014 to purchase a two-year subscription to a cloud-based email software to replace its old system. The IG for the Treasury Department said because the software lacked compatibility and other requirements, it was never used.

**Fish Research: $2.6 million** — Since 2003 the National Science Foundation (NSF) has paid $2.6 million to study the stickleback fish in various habitats, including one to determine how it adapted to murky water in Iceland.

**Language Studies: $1,109,792** — NSF awarded grants totaling more than $1.1 million dollars to study languages, including the Seenku language from the West African country of Burkina Faso, the four languages of New Guinea and the languages spoken in Nepal’s Manang district.

**Mexican Plant Study: $210,968** — The NSF funded a five-year study on native plants from Mexico to determine their role in the indigenous plant trade market.

**Higher Ed Aid: $138,000** — The Department of Energy (DOE) helps employees pay for educational courses to improve job skills. DOE paid one engineer $138,000 to take courses unrelated to his job, and he subsequently quit.

**Chinese Culture Tour: $100,000** — In 2016 the National Endowments for the Arts (NEA) awarded $100,000 to pay for Chinese troupes to perform in communities across the United States.

**Shakespeare Adaptation: $30,000** — An NEA grant was awarded to pay for the production of Doggie Hamlet. Included in the cast were humans, sheep, and dogs but no lines from Hamlet were used in the production.

Bitcoincash,Stay Connected With Bitcoin's Golden Triad,"Metcalfe's Law: The value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n^2)

Therefore the more connected and active we as a community are the more valuable the network becomes and the faster we grow. A lot of us have no technical background and might struggle to keep up with technical discussion beyond a certain level. You can still add a lot more value to bitcoin cash by being an active and connected member of the community. We are very lucky to have some of the brightest minds around supporting bitcoin cash either directly or indirectly. Now let's make sure we appreciate every bit of their contributions which will allow us to improve our understanding of the ecosystem as well.

First of all there is Craig Wright and nChain, a leader in blockchain solutions &amp; research. I'm not sure whether Craig founded/owns nChain but [nchain believes bitcoin cash is the true bitcoin] (https://nchain.com/en/blog/bitcoin-cash-development-testing-accord/). This guy is a genius, he is probably the most academically complete figure behind bitcoin today (with expertise in math, cryptography, it security, economics and business). I personally believe he is Satoshi. Blockstream shills call him a fraud and aggressively attack him on social media, ignore them. Just follow the guy on Twitter and follow his youtube videos. Here is a [funny video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiK34QicusI) where Craig destroys a paid Bcore shill trying to discredit him.

Then there is Gavin Andresen. Most of you probably follow him already on [Twitter] (https://twitter.com/gavinandresen?lang=en) and have bookmarked [his blog] (http://gavinandresen.ninja) (if not do it now), but also make sure you are an **active** follower (retweet his stuff and share his articles). Gavin is a Bitcoin God, up there right next to Satoshi. When Blockstream took over, the first thing they did was to kick Gavin Andresen out of the Bitcoin Open Source project because he was an advocate for larger blocks (what bitcoin cash is doing now). Following Gavin will open a new world, he is an engineer and writes like one. Very rational, elegant in his explanation and always backing his arguments with facts. Even when he gets technical you still learn a lot from the 10% part in simple English.

Then there is [we are all satoshi](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8aCt-P8D9mU3CMjeKUWQwg) . I'd love to see this channel hit 1k subscribers ASAP. The latest video was on why bitcoin core's network does not follow Metcalfe's law, because users hodl and are inactive. All they do is check the price once per day and go back to their day job. I like this channel because it provides insights on a lot of topics such privacy, cryptos, monetary policy, and the future of money while also debunking myths contained in the bitcoin legacy narrative. 

These 3 guys are pure academic gold, I call them the golden triad. Every morning when I wake up I check out their twitters and blogs for updates (still haven't figured out how to display gavin's articles in chronological order though lol). Remember, to remain competitive scientific research (Craig, Gavin) as well as an educated customer (Rick) is crucial so let's connect and share their thoughts/vision with everyone we know.",cryptocurrency

My father was fired from his job of 20 years in October due to a personal incident. He currently has an undiagnosed medical condition that I believe to be Dementia or Alzheimer's that was mostly likely the underlying cause of why he was fired. My father’s job was my parents primary source of income. He is working again part time at Wal-Mart and receiving social security. I don’t think he will be able to work much longer and honestly he probably shouldn’t with whatever his condition might be. My mother has not worked in 5+ years, is on social security disability due to some prior health issues, and her working is not an option. I am not sure if my parents age matters but my Dad is 76 and my Mom is 67.

&amp;nbsp;

My parents income each month is the below and these are exact amounts except for the Walmart pay. I estimated the Wal-Mart pay based on prior paychecks, weekly scheduled hours, and taking out taxes. My estimate is already a little on the conservative side. The pension income may not be available through all of 2018 and there is no opportunity to take a loan or cash out against the pension. 

&amp;nbsp;

•	Source: Social Security Dad Amount: $1,788.00 

•	Source: Social Security Mom Amount: $626.00 

•	Source: Pension Amount: $254.52 

•	Source: Walmart Amount: $1,000.00 

•	**Total Monthly Income: $3,668.52**


&amp;nbsp;

My parents current credit card debt is below. They are within $50-200 of their total credit line available for each card. The interest rates range from 13% to 29.99% with most of the cards having an interest rate of 22% or higher. I can provide specifics if needed. 

&amp;nbsp;

•	Credit Card 1: $2,946.47 

•	Credit Card 2:  $4,020.44 

•	Credit Card 3: $7,049.53 

•	Credit Card 4: $604.43 

•	Credit Card 5: $7,815.19 

•	Credit Card 6: $7,841.87 

•	Credit Card 7:  $13,151.12 

•	Credit Card 8:  $1,672.17 

•	Credit Card 9: $5,673.15 

•	Credit Card 10:  $2,494.31 

•	**Total Debt: $53,268.68**

•	**Total Minimum Monthly Payments: $1,520.00**

&amp;nbsp;

Below are the mandatory monthly expenses my parents have each month outside of their credit card debt. 

&amp;nbsp;

•	Mortgage: $1,360.00 

•	Health Insurance Supplemental: $198.60 

•	Car Insurance: $150.00 

•	Phone, TV, Internet: $165.00 

•	Cellphone: $48.00 

•	Electric: $140.00 

•	Groceries: $400.00 

•	**Total: $2,461.60**

&amp;nbsp;

Considering the income, debt, and expenses listed above my parents are between $300-400 dollars short a month on being able to pay all their credit card minimum monthly payments. This also doesn’t account for any unexpected expenses that could occur and doesn’t allow for my Dad to start seeing a doctor about his medical condition. December was the first month that they missed payments on several of the credit card accounts.
Below are my current plans to help put them in a better financial position with what I see as the pros and challenges. 

&amp;nbsp;

• Credit Card Debt Consolidation Loan
&amp;nbsp;

Pro: I think this would reduce the amount they are required to pay each month towards their 53k debt. 

&amp;nbsp;

Challenge: My parents were just denied for a 50k debt consolidation loan due to income versus expense/debt ratio and depending on the terms they may have trouble making a monthly consolidated loan payment.

&amp;nbsp;

• Sell their house and move them to my city where they can rent cheaper housing.

&amp;nbsp;

Pro: If I am able to move my parents to the city that I live in then their monthly housing cost will be $700-800 a month; based on the average rent per month in my area for a 1 bedroom home. 

&amp;nbsp;

Challenge: My parents currently owe what their current home is worth on the market and their home would have to sell as a fixer upper as it needs work. We would also have to figure out a way to pay for some of the moving cost.

&amp;nbsp;

• Bankruptcy

&amp;nbsp;

I still to research this option but, a friend suggested it may be something to explore. 

&amp;nbsp;

The last piece of information to share is that my parents credit score at all three major bureau’s is between 650-710 as of 12/27/17. It will soon decline due to the recent missed payments for their credit cards. 

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, I am not able to help my parents monetarily. My wife and I are financially stable but, expecting a child in April 2018 that will take some of our current disposable income and savings. We also do not have a big enough home to move them into our house which is something we discussed.

&amp;nbsp;

Overall, I am feeling a little overwhelmed with their situation and am having trouble figuring out the best way to assist them. I can’t seem to find a path that will lead them to financial stability. 

&amp;nbsp;

Any advice, ideas, or suggested resources that the r/personalfinance community has would be greatly appreciated. Also please let me know if I missed considering anything or could provide better context. This is my first Reddit post after lurking for a year.

personalfinance,"How am I doing, and what should I change?","Hi r/personalfinance!

I am a college senior, working full time at a job where I make between $2600 and $3400 per month after taxes, depending on overtime. It's usually close to $3000. I have just finished paying all of my education expenses, leaving me with a small emergency fund of $2000. I have no student loans, own a reliable car, and have no credit card debt. I am seriously considering law school in the next few years, but am fairly debt averse, so would likely chose to attend a school where I am able to get a good scholarship. 

My expenses are currently:
Rent: $830 (A roommate skipped on the lease, which ends in August. The lease prohibits subleasing. I do not think there is a way to save more money here.)

Gas/Fuel: $150 (I drive a lot at work, and should be able to get almost all of this reimbursed, but need to motivate myself to fill out the forms.)

Car insurance: $73 (I am 21, so this might be the best rate I can find. I live with my boyfriend who is close to 30, so maybe it would be possible for us to get on a cheaper policy together?)

Oil changes: $15

Health Insurance: $117 (student insurance- employer offered coverage HDHP is $84 per month, and I will likely switch to that after graduating.)

Utilities: $59 

Internet: $50- I had an annual contact at $30/month with xfinity, which went up to $50 when it ended

Phone: $45 (boyfriend and I could get on a shared plan which would cost us about $35 each)

Spotify/Hulu: $6 (student rate)

Pet: $25 (food, litter, occasional toys, saving the excess each month for annual vet visits)

Personal Care/Makeup/Haircuts: $130 (~$100 towards waxing and tipping waxer, $20 per month towards a haircut and tip every 2-3 months, $10 per month for makeup.)

Groceries: my share is usually between $175-$225, I budget for $250

Restaurants: budget is set at $100, but I usually don't spend it- I would be comfortable reducing this to $30-$50 if that would be more reasonable

Coffee: budget is set at $20, but I usually only spend $10 or less

Alcohol: fluctuates from $0-$80, so let's say $80 to be safe- it's probably closer to an average of $30

Clothing: budgeted for $50, but I think this may be higher than necessary. Thoughts?

Home Supplies: I save $100 per month towards purchasing furniture/appliances- I already have the basics and some fun kitchen appliances, but would like to continue budgeting for this- it seems like a small enough price for working towards a more enjoyable living environment.

Amusement: I save $20 per month that I only spend on ""experiences"" like theatre tickets, mini-golf, etc. This is probably unnecessary, but it's important to me. I'd like to increase this at some point. 

Miscellaneous spending fund for myself: $25

Miscellaneous gift fund for SO and holiday spending: $25- I occasionally have trouble sticking to this and should probably change this budget to $50 or change my habits. 

Savings/Emergency Fund: $500-$1000 (my income varies due to overtime, but I have started throwing whatever is left over from my take home pay at the end of each month into my savings account. It is currently only at a little over $2000 because I only recently saved up enough to pay off my school expenses and due to previously poor spending habits.)

My main questions are:

1) How am I doing? What should I change budget wise?

2) If I'm thinking about continuing my education, does it make more sense to keep all of my money in a savings account, or should I start saving for retirement now that I have money to save? (If I should save for retirement now, can someone explain how I would determine if a traditional or a Roth IRA would be the right place?)

3) I've got a tiny amount (~$500) in a 401K from an old job. Since I no longer work for this company, what should I do with this, and how? I've been told I need to ""roll it over"" but don't know where since I do not have a 401K at my new job. 

4) My boyfriend is older and financially worse-off: he has student loans (~20,000 private at ~9.5%, ~$45,000 federal loans at between 3.4 and 6.8%, $2000 credit card debt at 22%, and owes $483 on PayPal credit that isn't accruing interest right now- it will start to in 6 months.) He makes less money than me, has recurring medical expenses, and has only a small amount saved for retirement (~$2000.) He makes payments on all of these debts, but rarely has enough money to make more than the minimum payments. The general advice on this sub seems to be not to pay off debt for boyfriends, girlfriends, or finances, only spouses. Keeping that in mind, what can/should I do to help him get his financial life together?

Thank you for any and all advice!",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay back my personal loan or use the funds to help with college tuition?,"I got super sick this year and and I'm down to pretty much pennies in my account. I have about 7,250 in CC debt with interest rates of 23.99%. They are all maxed out and accumulating lots of interest as we speak. I decided to check into consolidating the debt into a personal loan. My credit isn't great because of the high CC debt, but I was able to get a lower interest rate and payment plan. I should (fingers crossed) be starting back at work in the next week or so. I'll have about $600 at the end of each month after paying all of my bills, eating, the necessities. My plan was to finish my masters degree online this summer while working but the tuition will be close to $7,500. I have a some excess leftover from the personal loan I could use along with the money I will save or I could start paying that back.Once I get my masters,I will be making a substantial amount more than I am now so there's quite a bit of incentive to get this done. I'm worried with my credit score as low as it is, I wouldn't be able to obtain another student loan. I'll have to go through a private lender instead of government since it's over the summer. I'd rather pay back my personal loan and get the lower interest rate student loan but I hate to risk getting denied and not being able to finish school for a year or possibly more. Any advice? 

Edit: Below is my current budget. Misc is medication and cat stuff. My medication changes a lot but it shouldn't ever be over 150 per month. Synchrony is an account in my name being paid by relative.

personalfinance,"I lucked into some money, not sure how to make the best of my situation.","As the title started to say, i went to a professional sporting event and won their 50/50 raffle. My half was around $23,000, and around 17,300 after they took out the standard 25% taxes before payout. I recognize how fortunate this is, i'm not exactly rich.

I'm 25, and haven't the slightest clue how to make the best of this. I have been saving to buy my childhood home (probably around 80K) from my parents when they move into the house they are currently building. Other than that i do not have any immediate financial goals. My only debt is my motorcycle loan which i currently have no trouble paying each month.

The winnings combined with my savings has me at about $25,000 and growing in savings that i will need to be able to use some of within a year to buy the house. I currently have all of that in my state employee credit union's money market account because i didn't know what better to do, but the interest rates are abysmal (.2%). 

Basically i'm wondering if where i have this money is the best option, or if there would be smarter decisions to make the most of this. Thank you for reading through all this. :)

Side question: Is it possible to get back any of the roughly 6k that was taken out this coming tax season?",finance
personalfinance,"34 and credit is bad. not a lot of debt. haven't been able to work consistently for years, filing for disability and need to know how to fix things.","My Throwaway because duh:

Bare with me, I'm just gonna try and give the backstory and take things one point at a time. Might be a bit of a read.

So, for my whole life I've always had bad luck/been injury prone and been pretty impulsive. I've broken over 20 bones and had multiple orthopedic surgeries. Have fractured vertebrae in my back and had degenerative disc disease since I was a kid (it normally starts when people are ~40+) and my L5S1 specifically has been bulging/herniated around 10 times in the past 15 years. I've torn ligaments in both hands and torn my patellar tendon multiple times.  I've torn both hamstrings on multiple occasions and put my right hand through a glass window. I usually average at least 2 x-ray sessions a year and an MRI every year or two. I grew up playing football, hockey, baseball, basketball, skiing, and weight lifting. After I was 25 and done with college, I mostly chilled out and just continued with the hockey and lifting but by this point my back and my body was shot and I would continue to injure myself or suffer a malady of some kind at least once a year.

In addition to physical ailments, I have been seeing psychiatrists my whole life for bipolar II, PTSD, ADHD, Anxiety, Clinical Depression. As anyone who works in this field knows, it can be a lot of trial and error to stabilize someone's mood disorder via medications.

Also, when I was 25 the market crashed and I broke up with my girlfriend who I was supporting along with myself (she was Canadian and studying here and unable to legally work but her parents chipped in a few bucks) and I left my very good job (I'd be making $250K-$500K if I stayed right now) and just sorta went catatonic into a deep depression. 

I was suddenly unable to pay for my rent and bills and burned through all the money I had in the market that I liquidated over the years. I was lucky in that I had parents who could afford to help out with rent and things while I tried to get on my feet.

For the next few years I would do all kinds of side work in the entertainment industry, and ended up building a little sports business that in a few years was starting to make me a livable income. That was in 2012. Then the NHL strike hit and it destroyed my business. At that same time, I woke up one day with leg pain, after another day with unexplained leg pain, I realized it was likely a clot and went to the ER. I was diagnosed with a DVT in my left calf. Luckily it was caught early. I would spend a week in the hospital then had to spend 7 months on blood thinners, which meant no sports. So my business was basically gone, as if I could not play hockey, I could not run hockey games and build my business. It also was depressing to watch people play when I could not.

I started pursuing more work in entertainment and me and my writing partner came close to getting a project produced for a major cable network, but it went to shit.

It should be noted, for this entire time from my breakup in 2009 til about a year ago, 2016 I was a self-destructive mess. Alcohol, weed, coke (never bought it, but would do it when out with friends at parties and shit), etc... I was drinking a fifth a night for a while, it was bad, until I rescued my first dog and started shifting all the time I spent in bars and partying to working with dogs and spending time with my pups.

After the blood thinners I was depressed and my back injury flared up and I was still unable to get myself back on track at all until late 2014/early 2015 when I started getting back into shape and feeling motivated again and started building up a tech consulting business, but sure enough I herniated my disc again while lifting and a couple months later tore my patellar tendon while sitting down on the couch (I know, couches are trying to kill me, thats how I got the clot).

Anyways, that gets better, I get my dogs, I get my shit in order, start being healthier, stop doing shit that could result in injury, start working and being motivated again.

THEN I get a fluke DUI, which, honestly was the best thing that could have happened to me in a lot of ways. I was never much for driving drunk, I was more a problem of just being drunk (while on psych meds) and doing stupid shit and blacking out and usually it would be funny or general stupid stuff, but other times I would wake up handcuffed to a hospital bed with a nurse pulling a catheter out my dick, not knowing how I got there. It was not good. I needed a wake up call. Even though I tried to be responsible and wait before driving home, I didn't wait long enough (AT ALL) and ended up blowing a .09. Thankfully I didn't get in an accident or hurt anyone and I was a completely awful person for doing it.

But this cost me my job at the time (I was a private driver) and now had to pay for all this. I got a public defender and a very favorable plea and stopped drinking like that and stopped going to bars and completely refocused myself to working with and helping dogs and other animals.

I found a job at the beginning of 2017 working with a rescue, but left after a single day since they weren't paying me enough and wanted 6 days and 60+ hours a week for almost nothing.

I started to put on some events for dog rescues in 2017 and things were going good and I was feeling better about the future and everything. Then my dad dies in March. 

He was a doctor and made a nice living so I was very fortunate and had financial support during these years when I had money problems. Which was a blessing and a curse, I was always very thankful for it and appreciated how lucky I was, but having that financial net to catch me when I fell seemingly retarded me in terms of finances. I always had something to catch me and it caused me to make poor financial decisions (along with my impulsivity).

Anyways, here we are on Dec. 31st and I am finally coming out of the fog after my dad died and have new medication that finally is managing my bipolar II and other illnesses and making me feel OK for once.

But now I have to unfuck the damage and figure out how to be more independent.

My credit is fucked. I was unable to pay some credit cards and other things over the years and they just have been killing my credit score. It's not even large amounts, one credit card is like $500 but I just never paid and it got sent to collections because I was such a mental mess at that point. I have a few others with $100 here and there. I doubt the total is more than $2000-$3000 MAX I owe to creditors. 

I can probably scavenge that money together and pay off any debts I have, but my question is, then how do I go ahead and actually fix and increase my credit score?

Additionally I haven't filed a tax return in 10 years or so, though I don't think I made more than $10K income any year in that time, so maybe that isn't a big issue, I think if anything I might be owed money. What do I do about this?

Lastly, I am in the process of filing for disability while I continue managing my conditions and try and get myself back in the swing of life. And I am wondering, what is the difference between SSI and SSDI? How much do you have to make for SSDI? They say I last qualified in 2012. I would likely have to scrounge up my files for the last few years and figure out the income for the years since 2012, but I never made more than $10K during any of those years, is that enough to qualify for SSDI? How much more does SSDI pay?

I'm not looking to stay on disability, but I definitely need the financial floor it provides while I get back on track.

Anyone have any other programs or ideas that help with all this? I can't afford to have assistance from my family anymore as my mom needs 24/7 care and has Parkinson's and I don't want to take any money away from what needs to be set aside from her care.


TL;DR I was a physical/mental mess and ran out of money and credit went to shit and ignored it for years. Haven't filed taxes in 10 years (tho not sure if I needed to). Life is a mess. Need to fix all this damage. Luckily I don't have a lot of debt or kids or anything like that.",finance

Any suggestions?,"As the title suggests, for our new years celebration we have decided to spend our evening completing a game from start to finish. We did this once with bioshock infinite and have since played bioshock 1 and 2.

Any suggestions for this run-through?

personalfinance,"22. Graduating engineering in May, and have a job making $85k. But I goofed up earlier in college and have bad credit eating away at my current income. How do I do this?","Heyo everyone, and happy New Year! Sending each and every one of you the best of vibes for a happy, healthy, and successful year full of joy :)

I'll keep this as brief as possible, but of course, if there are any critical details missing I'll add them in and respond immediately.

+ I'm graduating from university in May (so stoked!!), and was recently hired by a company. My salary will be $85,000. I will also have a signing bonus of $5,500, and am entitled to an annual bonus in addition to my salary. I'm also fortunate to have benefits such as a phone plan and full insurance coverage, so those are other costs I don't have to worry about.

+ Earlier in my college career, I took out two credit cards. Long story short, I missed payments and am now in a situation where both accounts have been closed and I've been in this loop where I'm being charged the minimums, but the balances aren't moving at all because I haven't been able to afford to pay either off in lump sum. 

+ Every month, after rent, I'm bringing in about $800. 

+ But my credit cards bill me for about $2-300 each month.

+ Credit score somewhere in the 500s.

Overall, I've accepted the loss of the credit cards. I was dumb, life came up, and it just needs to be dealt with. I'm confident that between my salary (which I'm fortunate to have, especially fresh out), and a secured credit card (from reading threads around here), I can build my credit up relatively quickly (is that a fair assumption)?

But even so, this debt is eating away at my income now. And I hate that I'm paying money that ultimately isn't doing anything because interest doesn't allow the balances to move... 

Though I'm obviously ineligible, I'd really love to receive a loan that allowed me to pay off debts, and have one consolidated monthly bill that allowed me to have more income now (which would allow me to save for relocating, and have a savings before I start receiving a paycheck), and then pay that loan off in full once I start working which would be very easy.

Ah, and I forgot to mention: Between the cards, my total outstanding balance is just about $5,500.

Any advice for this situation would be sincerely helpful. Because the credit cards bill me, I just end up living nearly paycheck-to-paycheck after I purchase groceries, and I really wish I could be moving effectively for debt rather than throwing money at buying time.

I love you all, and happy new year!! Thank you so much for your time !! :)

Edit: Also, if I were to call the credit card companies, do you think they might be at all sympathetic and would offer a resolution that didn't impact my credit further?

New Year’s Edit: Thank you everyone for the comments so far! One clarification, and one question:
To clarify, I’m currently in college, graduate in May, and start my job in June. Will not receive my first paycheck until mid July (or could be the end of June.. need to clarify pay cycles).
And question: Once I’ve paid these debts off and begin rebuilding my credit, how’s that process work? I understand that the ethos is that I should use the card and religiously pay it off on time or early. But as my credit score slowly climbs, will these past due payments on my record still cause problems? Or is the score the only real thing of importance (I suppose, also taking into consideration my income?)",finance
