personalfinance,Frozen Credit but credit isn't frozen,"Hello - my wife and I are taking advantage of the very low interest rates and refinancing our house. When the bank pulls her credit, two bureaus are showing her credit is frozen even though when we call those credit bureaus, they tell us there is no freeze. The lending bank has provided documentation proving that there is indeed a freeze on her credit (just Equifax and Experian have freezes). We're going to submit a freeze and a thaw on her credit to see if that will clear it but I'm not really thinking it's going to do anything. Does anyone have any experience with this type of a situation?",finance

personalfinance,"Mortgage missed the closing deadline, any recourse?","Throwaway to avoid accidentally doxxing myself. 

I have made a non-contingent offer on a condo here in Bay Area in the beginning of the month. A banker in AmeriSave promised to make the closing date happen if I sign with them. Long story short, they dragged their feet, misplaced some paperwork and as of the day before Thanksgiving, my application did not make it into underwriting yet. Since then, they went into complete radio silence, neither my agent nor myself can reach either the processor or the banker on any channel. 

I understand that I have at least three more business days once the seller issues a notice to perform, and I am certain that I can negotiate an extension, but at this time I don’t even know what to expect — whether it is going to take another day, week, month, or whether they even intend to get my loan to closing. Today was the target date for the escrow closing and I can’t even get anyone in AmeriSave to answer my calls. Is there anything at all I could do? I don’t assume something like that would qualify as a reason for a CFPB complaint, even though I am miffed enough to go through with something like that. 

Ps If it comes to that, I will pay cash for the condo, but I really really do not want to.

Update: Thank you all. I was skeptical about the idea to email the top brass blind, but it did work. I wrote a polite but firm message outlining the facts and asked to either give me an ETA or admit that they cannot deliver. Sent to the CEO, CFO, President, two board members (guessing the email addresses as suggested below), ccd customer support and everyone on the loan team, signing off with my full name and work title. Within minutes, I had the president calling back and the loan team at attention. I have been promised to have an underwriter reviewing it and getting back to me with a closing date before end of day.",finance

personalfinance,Should I sell stocks to pay off debt?,"I have let my debt get away from me a bit over the past few months, but I have also been investing heavily into the market and have a lot of unrealized gains.  I would like to leave my money in the market and let it continue to grow, while slowly paying off debt and throwing any extra money I have at the debt also. but I would just like some advice based on the information I will provide:

My Current Debt is as follows:

$5,618. CC at 11.65%

$5,893. CC at 15.99%

$14,286 in Robinhood Margin at 5%

Total Debt = $25,797

I have a little over 70K invested between individual stocks, Roth IRA, 401K and HSA.  This is everything I have saved and invested over the last 15 months (+gains).  I won't be pulling from my IRA, 401K or HSA which leaves roughly 48K in individual stocks which I could sell.  however anything I sell will be taxed as short term capital gains since just about everything in this account has been purchased starting in Feb 2020.

I know the Margin has the lowest interest rate and it's the largest number so by the snowball and avalanche methods it should be tackled last. However I hate how dangerous margin is so I typically put my extra money towards that  (plus if I sell stocks it will be paid off first automatically anyways).

I would really like your advice.  Should I sell 26K worth of stock and tackle the debt and then buy back in slowly over time. should I leave the stock, and pay off the debt over time. and if so in which order should I tackle this debt.  If I sell stock I will also have to pay a shot term cap gains tax next year. I estimate a rate of 20% based on my income bracket.

Also my individual stock account is up 120% this year. which is why I have been more focused on investing than paying down debt.

Please help me! and let me know if there is additional info you would like to know. (also what do you think about opening a 0% APR CC and consolidating my CC debt onto that and paying it off over the year at 0% APR? )

Edit: forgot to mention I (will) have 6K in cash available as well at the end of the week. I am not sure If I want to put that towards Robinhood margin (to increase that buffer so the stocks don't get sold off if the market crashes. or if I want to lump some pay off one of the CCs (I have an emergency fund on top of this cash as well)",finance

solar,Looking at Solar in North Carolina,"Pretty straightforward questions, with I'm sure very complicated answers :)

I'm currently looking into Solar Panels for the house that my wife and I own. We're currently thinking of staying in the house 8-10/years. We have just completed a cash out refi and so we have a little bit of cash that we COULD use towards a solar panel installation. My questions are mainly focused around what I should be asking the solar installation companies that I'm getting quotes from.

I spoke with the first installer yesterday for about an hour, and he helped me gain a better understanding of some of the things that I didn't fully understand from my YouTube 'research'. He suggested a 10.89kW system, along with two smaller systems.

My current questions focus on do I actually need a Power Optimizer based system, if my roof will NEVER see shade from trees? We live in a neighborhood and our closest neighbor to the back is about 50' back, and we have no trees in our back yard. I *think* I understand that we would either need a Power Optimizer, Micro Inverter, or String Inverter based system, am I correct in this understanding? It would probably be helpful to know that we have a 7 year old home with all the panels being placed on the back of the roof, which faces nearly due south. There is never a time of the day where there are shadows cast onto our back roof (other than from clouds of course).

The 10.89kW system is quoted with 33 REC TP3M 330w panels, 1 SolarEdge 10000H-US Inverter, and SolarEdge P340 Optimizers. This system has an annual energy production (estimate?) of 16,015kW. They are quoting a 'Turnkey System Price' of $23,740, does this price seems reasonable for what I have described above?  This price does not include the Federal Tax Credit (which we would be able to take advantage of) or the NC Solar Rebate program through Duke Energy. Based on my calculations, with an install occurring in 2021, we would be eligible for a Federal Tax Credit of  $5,222.80, and a Rebate from Duke Energy in the amount of $6,000. This would bring our 'net' price down to $12,517.20.

I did forget to mention that our average Duke Energy bill for the last 12 months between $160-$170/month, with and average usage of between 1450-1550kWh/month.

What other questions/concerns should I be aware of as a potential new residential solar client?

personalfinance,Pay down the house or pay off the car?,"We're in the middle of building a new house and will be selling our current house once we're moved in to the old one.  After settling all of the debts from the sale, we should be looking at a considerable profit of about $40,000.  

If we put all of that towards the loan, it should be enough to bring the principal below the PMI threshold.

We also have an auto loan that has about $18,000 left on it, and paying off the loan would free up $400 a month.  There's also a bunch of other debt accrued during the construction process.

Finally, we're likely to try to refinance the loan as soon as possible.  We closed on it right before the interest rates dropped earlier this year, and since the construction loan would transition to a traditional loan, it would be easier to refi it.  Plus, I hate the current banker I work with.  We would first look to refi with our credit union before going to another bank.

So, here's where I'm stuck.  Should we go for the refi first, pay down the existing loan to get the loan down to below PMI, or use the profits to pay off other debts like the car and credit cards?",finance
investing,GAO Report: Unemployment Statistics Have Been Inflated,"As part of a larger report on the federal government's response to the pandemic, the Government Accountability Office also noted chronic problems with unemployment reporting. They find the Labor Department's weekly numbers have been inflated and likely overstated the number of unique individuals making a claim.

This is interesting because every time these reports come out, reddit rushes to conspiracy monger about how the numbers are really much higher.

I am wondering - is it too early to refinance seeing as we've only been in the house for \~6 months?  I'd really like to explore a cash-out refi if I can and use that for home improvements.  Quick side note: we do not plan on being in this house for more than 5 years.  Would an ARM make sense in this case?  Surely rates will go up post-pandemic so I'm not sure about that one.  Also, would it make sense to cash-out refi as we need to make a few improvements to the house?

The sales person make is sound like a very stable/guaranteed investment that is tax free more then an insurance policy. It is interesting that it does have a cash value that increases over time, much like investing in bonds but with a variable rate that is linked to interest rates. 

With interest rate having nowhere else to go but up, seems like a very good place to put money.

personalfinance,New job + wrong tax withholding = Zero income. Now what?,"Hey, so my wife started a new job in October and she hasn't received any paychecks yet. After digging into it with HR yesterday, she discovered her W4 showed step 4(c) withholding an additional $3400 ***per pay period*** for federal taxes, while step 3, the section about dependents, was blank.

So far, all of her income has been sent to the feds as tax. She has taken home $0 since she gets paid weekly and makes less than $3400 per week.
She recalls during her onboarding that HR said they would put a placeholder amount on her W4 which could be changed later. She of course electronically signed it but was unable to log in to the company portal for some time due to IT issues. 

Now that my wife and HR are aware of this huge error, she has submitted a correct W4 with them. My question is, what about all the lost income? Are we out those dollars until we file taxes in 2021 or is there a way the employer can stop payment to the IRS and cut her a check for her lost wages?

personalfinance,Should I refinance my home prioritizing getting the lowest interest rate possible or prioritizing paying off spouse's student loans with a cash-out refi?,"I'm running into a sort of personal finance philosophical dilemma and would love to get some advice from the folks here. 

**Background**: My wife and I own a home in a big city. We currently owe about $480K on the house at a 3.375% interest rate (and about 29 years left), but a recent appraisal showed our home value climbed significantly and is now worth $710K. My wife is in her last year of law school (works full-time as well) and has a clerkship lined up when she graduates (start 8/21). It's a 1 year clerkship and she'll only be making $60K (which is less than the $85 she currently makes), but anticipates getting a high-paying job when the clerkship is over. Hopefully north of $150K/yr, but nothing is guaranteed. By the time she graduates, we will owe about $175K in student loans. I earn about $100K/yr currently.

**Refi**: I looked into refinancing our home and was able to lock in a new interest rate of 2.375%, which would lower our monthly mortgage significantly by about $300-$400 (lower interest rate plus no more PMI). However, now that our house is worth more, we have the option of a cash-out refinance. I could take out about $90K-$100K, but our interest rate would jump to about 4.5%. I could take out about $50K and our interest rate would be somewhere in the mid 3%. Closing costs are minimal for a straight refi thanks to our relationship with the lender, but I need to see what closing costs look like if we take money out.

**Student Loans**: About $175K in 100% government student loans that range from 6-10%. Right now they are being deferred, but that won't last forever.

**Question**: Should we stick with the 2.375% mortgage interest rate and deal with the student loans out of our income when we can. Should I pay off as much of the student loans now as possible. Somewhere in the middle? I'm really struggling with this decision as it will have a major impact on our finances moving forward. Any advice or insight would be much appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Use All Excess Cash/Withdraw Roth IRA Principal to Pay Most of Student Loans at EOY?,"**TL;DR**: Income is $160k a year. Expenses are roughly $100k (including taxes). I have $104k in student loans but about $85k to throw at them at the end of the year, if I so choose ($24k of that being Roth Principal). Should I pull from Roths to expedite paying them off or do the smart mathematical move and just pay them off with excess monthly cash flow?

**General Info**: My wife is a speech language pathologist, working three days a week and making $45kish/year. I'm an attorney that works two jobs (city and solo practice) that makes a total of roughly $115k/year (City = $66k; Solo = $50k). We are both 33. Our expenses are roughly $100,000 per year if you include taxes ($75,000 actual expenses, $25,000 taxes; big rough guesstimate here).

**Student Loan Info**: My wife graduated with $60,000 in student loans, which we paid off back in 2015. I unfortunately graduated with $157,000 in student loans. I made paying them off a priority for about 18 months and then backed off. The balance is now $104,000.

But, I am really tired of them. These are all federal loans. The average interest rate is probably around 6.2%. I have hesitated to refinance because the COVID freeze on loans and the upcoming Biden administration makes me think some benefits/forgiveness are on the way.

My payments (when they resume) are about $800-900/month. It's a big hit on my cash flow.

**Assets**:

* Retirement Accounts (Excluding Roths): $196,000
* Excess Cash: $36,000
* Roth IRA Principal: $24,000
* Impending Law Practice Receipts by EOY: $25,000
* Total I Can Throw at Loans at EOY: $85,000

**Plan**

If I throw everything at the loans at the end of year, the balance will be $20,000. I can probably pay that off in 4-6 months, and perhaps less if I get a nice tax refund or if some forgiveness comes down from the government.

**Ultimate Plan/Priorities**: I have made three financial transitions with my mentality this year:

1. I am more worried about monthly cash flow than theoretical net worth. Smaller monthly output means less monthly work, and that is more important to me than my net worth at age 60.
2. I want to CoastFIRE, not completely FIRE. I simply do not want to work two jobs indefinitely during my 30s and 40s to reach a mythical number. I'd rather reduce expenses, keep my nest egg untouched, and then work just a bit to pay the expenses. My wife plans to keep working part time and I could quit the city job when all my benefits vest (four more years), and at that time, I should have $300,000 or so saved for retirement at age 38, even if I pull from the Roths.
3. I have come to loathe debt. I know what the math is, and I know how leverage works, but I have done that 7-8 years now and I hate debt hovering above my head. I'd rather have low monthly outflow than leverage my money.

**Dilemma**: So, this is a classic ""math"" versus emotion decision. I'm aware that it's best in the long term to not touch the Roths and pay off the student loans as the money comes in. But I mentioned my wife paying off her loans earlier, and I can see the freedom it provides. I feel like I can achieve that very soon if I put my mind to it.

personalfinance,need input on whether to refinance (3.875% to 2.5%),"Original loan amount: $567,000
Current balance on original loan: $542,000
Original interest rate: 3.875% 30 years (loan originated June 2019)
Original payment: $3397


------------
Refinance loan amount: $548,250 (I'm confused about this because they added in prepaid daily interest, property tax escrow, and property insurance escrow into the new loan) is this typical?
No money out of my pocket, due to lender credit of $1500 for title insurance/transfer etc.
New rate is 2.5% 30 years fixed
New payment is $2986 (includes $91/mo PMI-- will drop out automatically when loan-to-value amount is 78%).

I originally wasn't planning on staying in this house but now that I went back to school for my masters degree, I might stay another 2 years until I graduate.

anyone have insight if this is a good choice? and why the escrow is added to the total amount?",finance

personalfinance,looking for an accountant - not HR Block (or the like),"After years and years of having way too much withheld, doing my returns myself (probably incorrectly) and getting significant refunds, I decided to do a little experiment, and increased my allowances on my W-4 to effectively halt state/federal income tax withholding. For whatever twisted logic reasoning I had last December when I did this, I thought I could do it better. 

Welp. I think that's gonna backfire. 

So, I need to find myself an accountant. Preferably one that also could double as a financial/wealth planner and someone I could utilize for years to come. (or is that all of them? lol) 

But on top of that, what kind of documents should I be retaining to prepare for meeting with them? I would like to deduct:

\- Student Loan Interest  
\- HSA Contributions   
\- 401K Contributions  
\- Rent Paid (I live in Massachusetts, where that is an option for state return)  
\- SALT (specifically sales and excise taxes, purchasing an automobile this month)  
\- Other expenses I may be eligible to deduct due to WFH long term

Put it another way: because I haven't paid most of my tax due yet, I want to assume I will be subject to audit by the IRS, the MA DOR, or both. I figure they'll be much more interested in a taxpayer who hasn't paid their fair share in advance versus someone who has overpaid via excessive withholding. 

Any advice on how I could find someone right for me and my financial situation? *Besides Google and Yelp*.",finance

personalfinance,Health insurance after retirement,"Hi all!

My husband and I are immigrants to USA. We both have very good jobs. The health insurance of our family (us + 1yo) is handled by my employer. We max out our 401k and HSA accounts. Our home is mortgaged ( we have ~30% equity), invest in stocks/ETFs and balance that with savings. We _can_ pay off our mortgage but choose not to, since our interest rate is 2.75 and we make more with our investments. 

As of now we're well insured but I'm not sure how it will work after retirement. Group health insurance is cheap and employers provide a lot of benefits. I suppose we'll have to find ourselves a health insurance plan after retirement. How does that work with preexisting conditions? Is there anything else we can do now to benefit us later? How much does insurance in 60s cost roughly? 

We'd love some advice. Thanks!

My wife and I had a child six months ago, and we're attempting to get out of apartment living into a new house sometime down the road. While discussing some of the finances on our end, we got to thinking we maybe should open our child a bank account and start throwing about $10-$20 a week in there, and I know there are some accounts that collect interest (I believe?) or what have it, and wondering what would be the best route for us to do? Is there a certain type of account we should do? What steps should we take on this up until he's 18? We're living down in Florida, not sure if that matters bank wise or not, and I'm also a four year veteran who does have a Navy Federal account as of 2013. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!

I know its under $10,000 but by the beginning of January i should have about $4,500 to put into the loan. My mom said to put $2500 into it and and the remainder to the principal. When i googled it, it pretty much seemed like anything i pay goes towards the principal. I get theres interest and i only have a 4.6% interest rate. When i was making payments via phone on my student loans i asked about paying towards the principal and they told me the loan is the principal and theres not a seperate payment and confused the hell out of me.",finance

personalfinance,Sister ordered to pay back all unemployment compensation. Help!,"My sister recently received a letter in the mail from the Vermont Department of Labor stating she needs to pay back all her unemployment benefits due to her ""quitting"" her job back in March. 

In March, she was working at a small restaurant and going to school in Vermont, but when the college closed she had to leave the area (came home to our state) and her place of work. I believe the restaurant stayed open during the pandemic as it is a small family run operation. Whether or not they formally laid her off I am not sure.

When she first filed her claim, an employee of the Vermont Department of Labor walked her through everything, collected information, and processed handled and even approved the claim. There were no issues with her receiving benefits over the summer (both from state and fed levels) and it is only now that she has received this notice. 

We are trying to get in touch with the employee who helped her file her claim but are all a bit worried she will have to pay back the state the only money she has. Has anyone been in a similar situation or known of this happening? Is she legally obligated to pay back the money she was provided for unemployment?

personalfinance,Alternatives to a 529,"I’m the father of two children &lt;5yrs old and want to help them prepare financially for college but don’t know if a 529 is the best option.

Background: stable family income of 90k a year, roughly 30% goes to retirement (401B, Roth IRA and HSA) no debt outside of our home (29 years left on a mortgage — we’re not paying it down early and are investing instead. Our interest rate is 2.75%.) Since I work for a community college, assuming my children attend college, their tuition will only be $10 while each child earns their Associate’s degree. So we’ll only need to fund years 3+ for their Bachelor’s (and possibly graduate) degrees.

Additionally, our state has no income tax and does not sponsor their own 529. Considering these factors, is there a better alternative to a 529 that I can use to help my children? Ideally, I’d like an option that my children could access even if they don’t attend college.

personalfinance,How can I pay off my loan quicker?,"Hey all! My husband was laid off in April and was rehired recently. We’ve decided to try to pay off the land that we have financed. I am 26 and he is 28. We’ve made some stupid choices and we’re trying to fix our financial situation. We financed a half acre of land for $50,000 about a year ago. We also bought a double wide mobile home and financed it separately. Our credit scores (575 &amp; 640) aren’t that great so we don’t have good interest rates on anything that we have financed. We’ve been working on our credit and have both raised our scores 30+ points over this last year alone, but they’re still not good enough to refinance anything. 

So my question - we want to pay off the land first because it has the worst interest rate. What would be the best way to go about this? I’ve seen videos where you make an extra payment every so often and it pays it down quicker. Or should we start a separate savings account and wait until we have enough to just pay it off at once? Should we pay down other debts first to free up money to put towards the land? I feel really overwhelmed and we are both really focused on paying down everything, we just don’t know where to start.

personalfinance,I've Got a Question on My Car Loan and Monthly Interest,"I have a car loan that I'm paying off monthly. I'm putting down more than the required monthly payment.

If this is a fixed interest rate loan, shouldn't the percentage applied to the principal increase over time and the percentage to the interest decrease over time?

Student loan debt
$46k federal loans @6%
$76k private loans @3%

Credit score 650
I was late on all student loan payments in 2018 due to making no money. So I have a 91% on time payment history.

Discover secured credit card - $2500 credit limit - paid in full every month

Rent - $1200

Expenses - $2800

Salary - $8k per month after taxes

My company has been growing steadily over the past year and a half and we are about to do our largest quarterly disbursement ever. Each owner (myself included) will get about $100k. After taxes that’s about $70k. Q2 disbursement was $26k each and Q3 was $36k. After taxes Q2 and Q3 went fully toward paying down my loans.

Should I put $50k toward the loans and invest $20k and then keep making double payments on the loans each month?

investing,December market meltdown?,"Hello all,

I want to highlight a few points that I have observed in the markets in the past couple of weeks.

1) $908B stimulus bill

2) Corporate spreads

3) Market volatility in December

I will try to keep it in broad terms and as always, please feel free to ask questions in the comments.

1) Legislators proposed a bipartisan stimulus bill of roughly $908B. 

At this point, it's not that surprising that the amount is lower than the initial ranges of $1.5tn - $3tn since there was a large divide in the Congress with regards to the size and allocation of capital.

The news drove stock indices higher and also the Treasury yields higher, specifically 30-year treasury.

  

*Processing img 7p9v60zvmp261...*

I think this is one of a series of fiscal spending that will be coming in the next year or two. 

The 30-year yield has declined in recent weeks significantly. I have initiated a short position on 30-year futures this week. I think the upcoming vaccine news along with economic recovery in 2021 will serve as catalysts for a steady steepening in the yield curve.

2) Corporate spreads show that we are in an abnormally tight market.

If you remember from the latest Market Commentary on 11/23/2020 (link below), I mentioned that we are entering the solvency phase of the corona crisis.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/jzt338/market\_commentary\_treasury\_cuts\_fed\_funding\_tsla/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/jzt338/market_commentary_treasury_cuts_fed_funding_tsla/)

I was worried that a slow economic recovery may push more companies to go bankrupt due to a protracted recovery. The reason was that if a restaurant had large amounts of interest payment coming due, it'll miss the payment and default. 

However, the total number of bankruptcies and loan default rates have been relatively subdued due to programs like Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), lower borrowing rates, and favorable economic outlook.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img ymulu82hip261...*

I have seen more and more companies are now able to reorganize their balance sheets to extend maturities, increase leverage at lower rates compared to March highs, and reduce their debt service payments.

A restaurant that was expected to miss its December 2020 interest payment would have already refinanced its existing debt, lowered the near-term interest payments and extended out the maturity. This is all possible due to the highly stabilized capital markets.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img avaw2i9xnp261...*

A below-investment-grade company can now refinance their debt at 430 bps (basis points) spread to Treasury compared to more than 10% we have seen back in March. 

In effect, the pandemic wiped out those companies whose balance sheets were extremely-levered, but many companies got lifelines from the government and those who stayed alive were able to reorganize their balance sheets to be in a healthier position.

Throw a vaccine on top of that and you will be out of the whole solvency crisis sooner than later.

So far, it's all nice and rosy. But what's important to note is that this crisis is different than your usual ones.

Normally, we would expect to see a deleveraging in a recession, companies reducing debt.

This time, however, the total corporate debt outstanding has actually increased by wide margin. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img n73wgcwwpp261...*

What I'm trying to get at is that we've got two key trends happening: rising corporate debt levels but tightening corporate spreads. Generally, you would expect those two to happen at a market top, so this crisis is different and we should keep that in mind as we piece together the whole picture (remember the Mosaic Theory, from this link [https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/ju7zbi/investing\_philosophy\_plz\_read\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/ju7zbi/investing_philosophy_plz_read_this/) ).

&amp;#x200B;

3) Market may be volatile in December due to a few reasons. 

First, investors try to lower their tax returns for 2020 by selling their losing positions in December, which creates market volatility.

But I wouldn't expect a market meltdown like the one we've seen in December 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 89yvvhjxqp261...*

That was primarily driven by Fed monetary tightening, reducing the balance sheet and raising interest rates. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

However, I am more worried now than I have been in recent weeks.

Second, as I said before, we are priced for an optimal outcome: vaccine, fast economic recovery, fiscal stimulus, lack of trade-war, and so on. If you had to bet on the next market move, you would probably guess that a negative news headline will tank the market more than a positive news headline will shoot up the market. But again, I wouldn't expect to see a meltdown like the one in December 2018.

Lastly,  I have noticed that the VIX index (volatility index) has moved in a positive correlation with the S&amp;P 500. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img by9dun0zrp261...*

We have seen this a couple of times back in February just before the March crisis and in August just before the September drop.

While this is not a perfect indicator, it is one of the pieces of information that we have to make our decisions. So keep this in mind.

&amp;#x200B;

The bottom line is that as we are entering the year-end, I would be more cautious than optimistic.

For those bond investors especially, I would suggest to be more concerned about the markets right now. HY spread of 430 bps right now is not attractive at all and you are not being compensated for the credit risks.

For stock investors, I would also suggest to be careful but do not panic when the market drops. A good idea is to implement hedging strategies in the short term by buying SPY puts.

**Trading plan**

1) Bullish on tech stocks.

I'm still leaning bullish on broader digital consumer and enterprise spending. Favorite risk/reward plays at the moment are PDD, STNE, FVRR, FUTU, BABA, W, and SEDG.

2) Bearish on long-end yield curve.

I continue to think yield curve steepening will play out in the medium to long-term (6 months - 2 years). I have initiated a short position on 30-year Treasury futures (ZB).

3) Bullish on gold.

As dollar gets weaker, gold will likely gain a steam upwards and inflation gauges will not only put upward pressure on the 10-yr treasury yield but also on gold as well.

I have initiated a call option on GLD. Given the recent drop in gold, I believe we are in a better risk/reward position to enter into the trade.

personalfinance,Should we do a cash out refinance (to invest or buy a 2nd property),"I own our home with my name only on the property with a remaining balance of $370,000 @ 3.5% interest, 28 years left paying $1684 per month (PITI $2430). The market value of our home currently sits at $680,000.

With the current low interest rate, I am thinking about transferring the house under my wife's name and have her apply for a cash-out loan 30 years@2.75% (PITI $2840) by borrowing $510000 (cash out $140000) 

my thought is that with a cash out refi, I get most of my down payment back and that opens up my options by either:

1. invest the money into stock market (likely allocate 100% funds on VOO) or  
2. buying our next home (under my name) and then convert current house into a rental property

I have been studying rental property investment and management here and there and love the idea of creating multi-streams of passive income. so I personally like the second option more, because after a cash out refi, the ""rental property"" is acquired with a near zero up front cost and the current market rent is above $2900.

some of our finance data, besides of our retirement savings, we currently have  

* $15000 in checking accounts
* $400000 in taxable brokerage account

personalfinance,My mom is in debt and I am afraid her solution will be my doom. I need advice.,"1st off, I'm using my mobile app - sorry for format errors. 2ndly, I'm mentally processing as I write this, so, sorry for rambling and any grammar/spelling errors that will definitely be in this post.

Our finances got entangled about 2 years ago, when my mom (I'm not allowed to say age / F) asked if I (37 F) would co-sign with her so she can refinance her house. Basically mom wanted to reduce her monthly payments. She's living mostly off Social Security and apparently that wasn't enough income for a lender to agree to refinance, hence her request. 

At that time I was very hesitant, but after she assured me she can cover her bills and promised she would give me warning should she run into trouble - I reluctantly agreed. Honestly, I felt guilted into it. But considering she had great credit due to years of on time payments and reducing her monthly mortgage payment would lighten her financial load, I couldn't think of a reason to say no. 

Now, I'm not poor per se, but I have been living pretty much paycheck to paycheck. This last year I moved to a cheaper place, but in a more ... Questionable... location and finally started building that Emergency Fund those financially smart people rave about. Every once in a while mom would call me to help with a bill, but otherwise she seems to have everything handled. Things seemed to be fine. 

Skip to early 2020, mom doesn't have money to cover property tax (it's not rolled into the mortgage payments per mom's request because the city offers a discount if you pay them directly). Shit. That's a lot of money because it's the full annual amount, since mom missed the partial payment deadline. I pay it. (goodbye emergency fund). A few months later mom needed money - reason undisclosed. Apparently I needed to ""trust her"". (I sent the requested money.) A few months later, she confesses she got involved with a scam but she's ended it... She needs more money to help recover from the damage the scam did. (I send the requested money.) I get another call, she needs a couple hundred in the same day, urgently. I tell her I can not get her the money the same day, either she has to wait or she can ask a family friend who I will reimburse later (they live in her state). She goes to the family friend.

During all this time I'm trying to get details out of her but she is stubborn and sticks to vague answers, claims she too tired to go into it, or accuses me of not trusting her. I'm secretly hoping the family friend will get more info out of her. Family friend gets a long story, but no details. 

I'm sure you've already guessed where this is going. After a few more urgent bills (which I pay directly), she informs me she can't pay the Oct mortgage. Shit, I can't afford my rent/bills and her mortgage. But Covid is going on, and congress passed a CARES Act - I contact the lender, we are now in forbearance... With a balloon payment at the end.

I've had enough. I call her and after 5 hours of me refusing to let her avoid telling me what's going on I have a better idea of her income (although not details... She's purposefully vague); I'm pretty sure I know her bills and debts; and I have a clearer picture of what happened - but I know she is withholding information... Which seems I will never get out of her until ""the time is right""... Whenever that is. 

From what I can figure this is mom's story: 
1) She was a victim of a couple scams. 
2) Either as part of the scam(s), or as a desperate attempt to stay afloat she's taken out multiple payday/speedy loans.
3) Due to suspicious activity her bank closed her account and she lost some money for the bank's fees.

Here I am, basically getting myself hunkered down. I've given myself pep talks - ""you can't take on all her problems"" "" focus on her NEEDS (i.e. water, heat, etc) and the mortgage - don't let your financial future get fucked because you're too nice"" etc. I'm also trying to figure out a way to cover that balloon payment. 

Last week, mom says she wants to refinance again. The interest rates are lower now apparently. But the lien the city has on the house will no longer be subordinate, so it will have to get absorbed by the mortgage. This will make the projected monthly payment LARGER than it is now - but its ok ""it'll just be tough for a little while until we can refinance again.""

Now, granted mom wasnt very forthcoming so I'm not 100%, but from my calculations, mom must have been a god-damned magician to cover all her bills as they are currently... NOT including all the extras she's implied she would like me to help pay (storage unit, 2   worldwide phone plans for her mobile, a car maintenance club, life lock, life insurance, maxed credit cards, and all those speedy loans). How she figures she can cover an even larger mortgage payment is boyond me. 

Then she calls me today. She's working with someone who's been  like her personal champion advocate. Champion has wrestled with the bank and Champion is the reason they gave (some) of her money back (minus some fees). Champion is also working with the police and mom's all for that. Nevermind that when I tried to get a police report going mom refused to provide me with enough (any) details, and apparently ""my mom says she got scammed"" isn't enough to go on. (I'm not bitter, why do you ask?). Anyway, Champion seems to be genuine in their desire to help and if mom found someone she can confide in, that's awesome. However, Champion has presented mom with the idea of brokering deals with all her debtors and then rolling all of the residual debt in with the refinanced mortgage. ... 

Refiniancing doesn't work without me due to her income and credit it score dings (from the speedy loans not getting paid).

My brain went blank. I got off the phone and have been silently freaking out since. 

Am I overreacting? What's at risk here? How should I go forward? 

TL/DR: Mom got into financial trouble (not entirely her fault) and racked up debt. Now she wants to consolidate her debt in a refinanced mortgage... With me a co-signer

Regarding selling the house: Ok. Most of you seem on the same page about selling. I'm not going to argue with that. But I can't unilaterally put the place up for sale and from bringing it up in the past I already know this will be a battle. However, some nuances that some of you folks have brought up require me to research more before bulldozing directly to pressuring her to sell.

 
***** Here is my current plan of action: *****
1) Research the heck out of all the resources, topics, articles, videos, ect. You've all provided me. 
2) I will NOT agree to this new refinance plan.
3) I will have a heart to heart with mom - laying out that I won't give her another penny without full disclosure from her.

stocks,CRM BUYS SLACK | NIKOLA STOCK CRASH | PFIZER APPROVED IN UK| STOCK MARKET NEWS [12-02],"**SALESFORCE CRUSHES EARNINGS AND ACQUIRES SLACK, NIKOLA STOCK CONTINUES TO TUMBLE AS WE FINALLY GET THE FIRST VACCINE APPROVAL IN THE UK, LET’S DISCUSS THIS AND MORE ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET**

Hey everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PzNKCYh) leading the way up almost 1,3%, finishing at a new record high, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/syB7wP4) also up over 1,1% and finishing at a new record high, while the [DOW](https://ibb.co/HggpWGF) had smaller gains but was still up to intraday records before finishing over +0,6% for the day. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/SDCq7vf) rose for the day after opening at 20,2 and as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/0n1TDKt) big gains were led by the FAANG stocks with Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix gaining over 2% for the day while Amazon and Microsoft also were up at least 1%. This pulled the big indexes higher as they account for a big part of them.

Over 60% of companies were advancing on average volume while companies moving above important moving averages continued to climb as we are going into a very risky market, as to many companies are trading high at the moment and are due for a correction. [CHART](https://ibb.co/DfgJ12R)

The biggest gaining [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/T8NPW6W) yesterday were Communications, Financials and Technology with most sectors being in the green, except industrial, as the laggards from yesterday were small cap growth companies and especially those from CHINA, like NIO, Alibaba and others, that have suffered from the recent news that the US is looking to delist some of them if they do not meet new standards. [CHART](https://ibb.co/gmpRVWW)

Here are the most interesting economic events and data for [TODAY](https://ibb.co/cyp7x5W), as we will see how Mortgage Applications and ADP Jobs are going. Afterwards a couple of FED leaders will speak before we can take a look at how the Petroleum Inventories are going.

While [GREAT NEWS](https://ibb.co/1d6y1yh) started to pop in the early morning as the UK has become the first country to authorize the Pfizer vaccine for use.

This news are already baked in the market in my opinion as investors were already expecting this to happen sooner rather than later, but this are still very good news to hear, as a confirmation is still great to have, rather than just expectations. I expect the US will soon follow in the next 10-14 days to approve both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine, that might just have a bigger impact on the stock market, but I would be careful until then, as we might get a correction in the stock market after this huge rally before we can move on even higher, as I fully expect this bull market to continue into 2021 and 2022.

Well yesterday, as I expected Nikola [tumbled again](https://ibb.co/2hzPCJL) after the insider lockup period expired, as only the possibility of Milton selling his shares has spooked the market after an already bad day with the GM deal disappointing investors. As the original deal is null and void with GM not taking any stake in Nikola or helping with the engineering or manufacturing of the Badger pickup truck. The only good thing in sight for the company is the possible hydrogen fueling station network partnership by year end as announced by the management. I maintain my sell opinion on this stock as I predicted a 15-16$ in the future when the stock was trading over 20, I think it has more room to go down, it might go to single digits in the long run, as the company has become very shady after the fiasco with the misleading tactics and no breaking new fuel cell technology.

On the other hand, Salesforce crushed [earnings](https://ibb.co/XCzz5Mz) expectations, as they beat the EPS by almost 1$ and had a revenue beat of over 160 million$. They also raised [guidance](https://ibb.co/JRf2G3j) for both revenue and EPS for next year way above the consensus while also maintaining cash and equivalents at over $9B, up 45% for the year.

The company also officially [announced](https://ibb.co/whYVfzC) the acquiring of Slack in a deal worth almost $28B. This will result in the Slack software being incorporated in every aspect of Salesforce cloud offering. This 2 will be the biggest competitors yet for Microsoft. So, I believe after the dust settles, and CRM stock finally gets back on track, we will have a good long term growth opportunity with Salesforce.

Slack also reported earnings yesterday after the bell as the company [posted](https://ibb.co/N6Qnw7M) a beat of estimates and an increase in paid customers and billings.

We also got some [numbers](https://ibb.co/6rNGCnZ) from Cyber Monday sales as the spending increase over 15% but, this was not enough to meet all the estimates as holiday shopping has been probably spread through the whole month of November and will continue to go strong in December in my opinion.

While on the economic front news were not so great as the [November ISM](https://ibb.co/3yM4Hwc) index fell shy of expectations with light vehicles [sales](https://ibb.co/PG09TRf) dropping by almost 1 million from last month and are way below the year ago period.

But we did see some big improvements in [construction spending](https://ibb.co/cc5z2wq), as the numbers came in about half a % better than consensus and are up 3,7% year over year while the [November PMI](https://ibb.co/6JzRnJ1) index saw the biggest improvement in over 6 years.

The biggest earnings that will be released today will be from [CrowdStrike](https://ibb.co/RvSk8SJ) and [Okta](https://ibb.co/RDrYy8K), as I expect both of them to turn out a positive EPS, as we might see some momentum in this stocks if they don’t disappoint.

I greatly expect the [IPO](https://ibb.co/pKzxhmK) of AirBNB, as this could become a company that will benefit a lot from the reopening of the world in the next year or two.

-no credit card/car/other debt; currently renting an apartment


Is there anything I should do with the money currently in my checking account, especially if COVID forbearance is extended beyond January 2021?

personalfinance,"Refinancing and Rates - Quicken Loans, Others","So I wanted to share an experience I had with Quicken/Rocket. I am in the process of a refinance now in my home as rates have dropped and obviously this seems like a great time for me to be able to refinance (Going from a 4.25 rate to a 2.25) I shopped around myself at multiple lenders and banks. I did however use Quicken for a quote too.

I was almost immediately turned off by them because honestly, it felt as if I was shopping for a used car the way the first person i spoke to there was speaking to me. They almost seemed to underestimate the education someone may have. When I started the process with them I was offered a rate at about 2.75. I discussed numbers wanted a Loan Estimate sheet from them explaining the fees and all that. Normal procedure I went through with every lender I talked too. They also attempted to tell me, every LE is the same they don't explain anything and that I shouldn't shop around.

However, this was like pulling teeth. They gave me the hardest time trying to get it and attempted to literally keep me on the phone while I reviewed it and to finish the application immediately. It was almost like a tactic that some of the scammers use for people that get scammed by false SSA reps saying there SSN has been compromised. It was really disturbing. I told them I would call them back I wanted to review everything. They called me back within two hours asking if I was all set and again attempted to keep me on the phone while I would ""submit all the documentation to them"". They were charging me a bunch of fees on the refinance (which is pretty normal I would say in a sense) and rolling them into the loan. 

However, I got a LE for a rate at 2.25 with no origination fee and then  a lender credit covering the usual fees involved (appraisal and yadda yadda). I obviously have prepaids but that's normal.

My curiosity got the best of me and I sent this LE to Quicken to see if they would match. They came back with a lower interest rate no points and a credit that seemed to cover the fees but looking closer, it did not. It was still about 3k in fees they were rolling in. I explained this to the lender and I get a ""let me see what I can do"" get a call back. Go through the cycle and they still are higher then they tried to explain to me that it would be beneficial to me to use them over anyone else because ""they're the best in the business"". Now I don't doubt people have had good experiences but when you spend that much in advertising your bound to be used more and have better ratings. Then I got this run around about how ""other lenders take 180 days to close a refinance and they would do it in 30, making them worth the extra money"".

I was extremely disappointed by this experience. I know some have had great experiences and I have read the assembly line analogy somebody used here and I just want to say I appreciate this sub and all that's on it. It seems to be hit or miss but with my experience with them...it was a really big miss. 

Sorry about the novel, I just wanted to post this because it seems that if I had no knowledge how shopping around worked, I'd be pretty overwhelmed by this tactic they used.",finance

stocks,"Taking out Profits and Exit Strategies, a short story (and perhaps some advice)","&amp;#x200B;

In the late 90's we had a similar Tech/Digital stock rally. Back then it was web page development and internet providers, now it's electric vehicles and big data. ""Stonks"" were only going up, up and up. You heard things like - Dude, its a new economy, this is the new normal. This is the future, you can't use old models to define value. Die all boomers and burn traditional stocks (ok I might be exaggerating on this one)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I was a finance major at a prominent university in London, UK. I was destined for greatness (and an trainee spot at Deutche Bank's analyst desk). My friend - let's call him Eli, because his name was actually Eli - was a stock genius. Everybody is a genious in a bull market, put some money in to a company in IT and bam! You had LOL GAINS. Eli was good for about 350kUSD at one point. Or I should say, 350kUSD nominal value in stocks. Because, its not money until you sell. Eli learned the hard way.

&amp;#x200B;

The ""dip"" came. Eli thought ""stonks only go up"" I'm gonna ""buy the dip"". Eli bought and bought, he also had a debt position of about 25% of his portfolio. This increased to 50%. The bank called, Hey Eli - that collateral isn't so hot anymore, pay up dude. Eli paid up. One year later he had -13kUSD on his account for accrued interest rates and trading fees.

&amp;#x200B;

So what's there to learn. Well, depends on how risk averse you are, but I see a lot of new investors that ask about when and how to take home profits. There is no rule or best practice, but here's at least an idea that I'm using myself.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I don't let a stock grow beyond 20% of my portolio, if it does I automatically start scaling back profits
2. I always keep a 10-15% cash position so I can take advantage on dips or other opportunities. This money has had a ridicoulus payback over the years.
3. For every 20% growth I take home 20% of the profit, no matter what. For crazy rockets I might take home more, say half the profit of every 20% growth.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do I do with my profits? Well, I do a few things.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I reinvest them in to other stocks, so I make sure I have a short list of alternatives at all times
2. I put them in the cash position so I can be opportunistic (but still max 15%)
3. I buy my wife or kids presents, I pay off mortgate, I get a nice Rolex or refurbish the house.  Its money. I have money so I can spend it, use it.

&amp;#x200B;

Moral of the story. Make money, you probably won't see another opportunity like the one of the past 6 months. Its not coming back for a while. Don't step out of the market, pick your stocks wisely, keep some cash to pounce on some disappointing Q4's and remember its not money until you sell.

The car is owned outright. Has 60,000 miles on it. Mechanically sound no issues. 

Car 2:

There is $6,600 owed on the car at an interest rate of 3.5% and a monthly payment of $228.

Has an intermittent check engine light but no real mechanical issues.

I don’t know if I should be looking at this in terms of the equity each car has, or from a monthly payment perspective. Ideally I would like to only have 1 car payment. If I traded in car 2 I would only have one car payment, but there is less equity in the car. Would it make sense to save an additional $5,000 to put down when trading in car 2?

There is no real rush to get into the new car, but I want to start planning for when the time is right.

personalfinance,I'm 23 and trying to build my finances : what can I do better,"Hello everyone!

I've read the sub Reddit wiki but would like some more personalized advice if possible, thank you so much in advance! 

Basically, I grew up in a family with a somewhat fucked up relationship to money, I've been trying to develop a healthy relationship with money and I want to be a responsible young adult, so I would love some more objective perspective, and get this amazing sub's some feedback/ideas on my budget and how I handle my savings.

**** BACKGROUND : I'm not American but European (so the social safety net is different) I'm in grad school and my income is a mix of support from my parents and my job as a nanny. I live in a very high cost of living area. I will be happy to give more details or info if things need additional context! 

The state of my finances:

**** MONTHLY INCOME around 1900-2000€, my nannying job pays me 15€/hour after taxes, it's a declared job so my employer also pays contributions for me to my country's retirement scheme, unemployment scheme, etc. 

**** EXPENSES Every month I spend 700€ on rent and bills, 250 to 300€ on food, 100-150€ on my physical and mental health, 250-300€ on everything else (public transportation, textbooks, clothes, hygiene, gifts, house items, entertainment). So I save 500-600€ a month usually. 

 I have a budget and I use an app to track all of my income and expenses. 

**** ACCOUNTS I have one regular account for daily transaction, on which I only keep the necessary amount for the monthly expenses, nothing more, I save my monthly goal as soon as I have it.
I have 2 savings accounts, both are very safe with relatively low interest rates because these are the ones usually offered to people my age. I have around 9000€ on these accounts combined. 

**** SAVINGS 

1) I have an emergency fund, for 3-4 months of necessary expenses with no income, 4000.


2) Then I have a few sinking funds (I think I'm using the word correctly but please tell me if that's not the case) :

2.2) for a potential car (500€, probably not enough but it's there)

2.3) for my travels (I like traveling and I'm also in a long distance relationship where I have to pay for flights sometimes, so I try to always have 400€ on there), 

2.4) for unexpected medical expenses (they can't get that high in my country but I keep 400€ on there), 

2.5) for gifts (I save throughout the year to have around 200€ by Christmas)

**** STUDENT LOANS

Grad school is payed by my parents (its cheaper than in the US but not free) but the arrangement might be renegotiated, in which case I will owe my mom up to 10k at the end of my studies. She wouldn't charge me interest but I would start reimbursing her as soon as I have a job.

So I have 1500€ saved at the moment, because I know I don't have to pay it back in full right as I graduate I've been pretty slow to save on it but maybe I'm wrong?


I follow this subreddit and I consume some general financial advice (I really enjoy the Financial Diet), so I'm not starting from zero, but I would really love some insight from this community as to what I can do better. Im looking for pointers on what I'm doing right and wrong, what I could improve, what I'm worrying too much or not enough about.",finance

personalfinance,I am Canadian. I currently have a Student Loan. Moving to the US. Is CRA going to have issues if I go dual citizenship?,"Tldr:  Is the CRA going to demand me to pay my remaining student loan in full when they find out that ill be moving to the US for a change of status even though I have full intentions of keeping my Canadian?


Background:
       Hello, need advice and help as I do not know where to start looking for info. I will be moving to the US with a fiance visa. I intend to go dual citizenship as i do not want to give my Canadian status up.

Also do not want to contact CRA as they might flag my papers. I am awaiting for my visa from the US consulate so I am sorting out my options and finances before the big move to the US to be with my fiance. 


Finance info: 
       I currently have no bank debts here in Canada as I pay them with full every month. The only debt I have is student loans from federal and provincial (AB). They are approx 60k but, I have left over cash from the loan that ive saved up and traded in the markets while I was attending uni. It is approx 21k. So baisically, if i pay up my loan rn, ill end up with around 40k to pay.


Question: 
        Now, since im moving to the US and adding an american status to my papers, i assume the CRA is going to go crazy over this and will have me pay the full amount before i move? This is what my accountant told me. Is this true? I am very terrified with the idea bc i do not have that remaining 40k cash with me. Even my personal savings would not be enough.

What do i do? Im sure CRA has some sort of program for Canadians like me who intend to go dual citizenship and work overseas to pay for loans in Canada right? Would it be safe for me to even call CRA about this?

Sigh* ... I'm honestly scared about this loan i have and the complications my US status will add to it. I need advice... thank you.",finance

personalfinance,Need help deciding what to do with a car loan,"Hi there everyone. First-time poster but a long time lurker. I bought a car back in college out of necessity, with my parents co-signing the loan. At the time, my parent's financial situation was pretty bad and credit was low, but I needed a co-signer so queue the high-interest rate on a car that depreciates as soon as it leaves the lot...

It's been about 4 years and I've paid down the loan to less than $5k. In June, I plan on getting rid of this car altogether and going down to a 1-car household. So that's the goal - to get rid of the 2nd car by June 2021 because we are moving to the city. Currently, the trade-in value is around $2k. I can also refinance to bring the rate down from what it is currently (7.99%). Not to mention, this car is a money pit. I constantly put money into fixing, gas, and regular maintenance and I want to get rid of that stress.

I'm thinking about possibly trading in this car by the end of the month and refinancing so that I have small monthly minimum payments. In the 6 months before moving, I still need a 2nd car though. Usually I would never, ever entertain the idea of leasing a car, but I'm considering it. The reason for that is because pretty soon I will need to start traveling farther for work (about an hour and a half one way 5 days a week) and a hybrid option on a lease makes sense if I will have to travel that far.

To boil it down to the simple, this is my plan: refinance my current car to bring the rate down and bring it into a 36 month loan (compared to my current 70 month), trade in the car and apply the cash to my loan balance, and then try to find a short term lease to use until I move in June. 

What I'm wondering is is this a totally stupid plan? I can afford to do it, but I'm a little weary about leasing a car. Any help is greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Did I calculate this comparison between W-2 and 1099 correctly?,"I've recently been offered a W-2 position with my company. Previously, all employees were considered 1099, but now we all have the choice to switch if we want.  Benefits/401k are not on the table yet, so I'm trying to decide if I should make the switch based on take home pay after state/federal/FICA taxes.

My boss seems to think that taxes are higher for W-2 employees and so has declined the W-2 for himself. However, my math shows a higher take-home for the W-2 employee. Is this correct?

First, calculate deductions:

||W-2|1099|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Gross Income|100000|100000|
|Self-Employment Deduction|0|\-7650|
|Standard Deduction|\-24800|\-24800|
|Pass-Through Deduction|0|\-13510|
|**Taxable Income:**|75200|54040|
|**""Last Dollar""**|55450|34290|

Okay so taxable income definitely looks better for 1099 contractors. The above deductions are based on the following (possibly incorrect) assumptions.

1. For 1099 folks, half of the ""Self Employment"" tax is deductible from gross income. This is what I read on the more than one tax website.
2. The ""Pass Through"" deduction is 20% of your income AFTER adjusting it for all other deductions.
3. The ""Last Dollar"" is how much of your income falls into your ""marginal"" tax bracket after subtracting the top end the next lower tax bracket.
4. Married filing jointly.

Okay so my next step was to start calculating my take-home.

||W-2|1099|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Federal Tax|\-2640.4|\-2386.48|
|FICA|\-7650|\-15300|
|State Tax|\-6500|\-6500|
|**Take Home:**|**83209.6**|**75813.52**|

Here are the (possibly incorrect) assumptions that went into this:

1. For federal tax, I tax my income bracket by bracket, up to my ""Last Dollar"" which is the surplus of my income over the lower bound of my ""marginal tax rate"".
2. FICA comes from gross income, not federal taxable income.
3. Contractors pay 15.3% FICA, while W-2 employees pay half that.
4. State tax also comes from gross income, not federal taxable income.

So in the end with just a standard deduction, it looks like going W-2 is a clear win. However, I'm worried that maybe I've confused some things. Tax blogs/articles tend to be convoluted and sometimes even contradictory.

* DK is an exciting, disruptive company working to change how we experience watching sports and make it better.
* I am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. These are just my opinions to help facilitate learning and discussion.

Hello, welcome to my first deep dive write up.

My name’s Mark and I’m an accountant with a passion for investing. About two years ago, I used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and privately held companies in the U.S. My goal is to bring my unique perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market today.

I’m a long-term investor. I am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long time. I’m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and everything that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led me to originally invest and believe in that company have not changed. If you want to learn more about this approach. I recommend reading the book “100 Baggers” by Chris Mayer.

**Introduction**

I think it’s fitting that my first stock pick has to do with sports. Sports has been a part of my life since I could walk at the age of 2. First with baseball and soccer, and then later in my childhood with golf. I’ve always played American football and basketball for fun as well and have always been an avid fan of all the major sports in the US.

I started playing fantasy sports (mostly just fantasy football) about 6 years ago and have always enjoyed it. Traditionally, with fantasy football you draft a team at the beginning of the year and those are your players for the rest of the season. If you have a bad draft, oh well. You can try to improve your team with trades and free agent additions but it is tough. Leagues usually consist of 10-14 teams (each managed by an individual) and there’s obviously only one winner at the end of the season (about 4 months after the draft). This can lead to the managers of the lower performing teams losing interest as the season wanes on. I believe DraftKings’ (DK) founders saw this issue and saw an opportunity. Enter, daily fantasy sports. Now, with the DK platform you can draft a new team every week. Or if you want, every day. This allows fans of fantasy sports to engage at whichever point of the season they want and at varying financial stakes.

**The Thesis Statement**

For every stock pick I make, I want to provide a quick thesis statement that can serve as a reminder for why I’m buying and holding that stock for the long term. I’ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long so it can easily be remembered and internalized. This helps during times when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why you’re holding this position.

The thesis statement I have come up with for DK is as follows:

*“DraftKings: The leader in allowing fans to engage financially with their favorite sports, teams, and players. Having money at stake makes the game a lot more interesting to watch. The era of daily fantasy sports games, online sports betting, and online betting (outside of sports), is just getting started and DK is as well positioned (or better positioned) than anyone to capitalize off of this trend.”*

Notice how I said “allowing fans to engage financially” as the first sentence and not necessarily “allowing fans to gamble”. There’s a reason for that. According to US Federal Law, Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) contests have specifically been exempted from the prohibitions of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA). DK has always been, and I believe will continue to be DFS contests 1st, sports betting 2nd, and other forms of gambling/entertainment 3rd.  It is noteworthy that states at an individual level can still deem DFS contests illegal if they so wish, but as of this writing (11/26/20), 43 of the 50 US States allow DFS contests and DK, accordingly, is offering DFS contests in all 43 of those US States.

I’ll try to clarify the difference between DFS contests and sports betting real quick:

**DFS Contest –** Pay a pre-set entry fee to enter a contest. All entry fees go towards “The Pot”. “Draft” 9 players to be on your “Team” for 1 week. Enter your “Roster” into a contest with other players (could range from 1 other person to 1,000s of people, the DK user can choose). Whichever “Roster” amasses the most points for that week out of all contestants wins. The winner will get the highest payout, and depending on the nature of the contest, other top finishers will receive smaller payouts as well.

**Sports Gambling –** Team A is considered a 10 point favorite to defeat Team B. This means that Team A is expected, by the professional gambling line setters, to outscore Team B by 10 points. This is known as a point spread. You can bet on the underdog or the favorite. If you bet on the favorite, they have to win by more than 10 points for you to win the bet. If you bet on the underdog, you will win the bet as long as the underdog keeps the game within less than a 10 point defeat.

These are just a couple simple examples to help you see the difference. Sports Gambling (the 2nd priority of DK) is a very lucrative market just as the DFS contests are. However, in the US, Federal Laws and regulations are a lot stricter on Sports Gambling than they are on DFS. As of this writing (11/27/20), 22 states (including the District of Columbia) out of 51 possible allow sports gambling.

DK is still in the infancy stages of getting their sports gambling business going. In the 22 states where they could potentially operate, they currently have a sports gambling offering in 11 of those states. The sports gambling business model for DK can be broken into two main offerings – mobile sports betting, and retail sports betting. Mobile sports betting means you can place a sports bet online from the comfort of your own home, while retail sports betting means you must go to a casino and place a bet with the sportsbook in person. I personally believe mobile sports betting is the real potential cash cow for DK out of the two types of sports betting offerings due to the convenience and ease of access. DK is currently working on and encouraging customers to lobby their state lawmakers to legalize sports gambling in more states.

**How DK makes money**

At the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand how they make money. In Chris Mayers’ excellent book, 100 Baggers, that I mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth as one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 Bagger. This isn’t to tell you that any stock I pick will be a 100 Bagger just because it has great top line revenue growth, but if I am looking at a growth stock to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the first things I look at.

For DK, their means of making money is quite simple. I already went into detail above about DFS Contests and Sports Gambling. In DK’s latest 10-Q filing with the SEC (filed 11/13/20), revenue is broken out into two main streams: Online Gaming and Gaming Software.

**Online Gaming (82% of Total Revenue for 9 months ended 9/30/20):**

Online gaming is the true core business of DK and includes the aforementioned DFS Contests, Sports Gambling and additional gambling (non-sports) opportunities. DK refers to their additional gambling (non-sports) as “iGaming” or “online casino”.

For the 9 months ended 9/30/20, Online Gaming revenue totaled $239M, up 30% YoY from $184M in the same prior year period. Keep in mind, that this is an increase that happened during a COVID-19 global pandemic that delayed and shortened many professional sports seasons.

Online gaming revenue is earned in a few ways that are slightly different, but very similar overall.  In order to enter a DFS contest, a customer must pay an entry fee. DFS revenue is generated from these entry fees collected, net of prize payouts and customer incentives awarded to users. In order to place a sports bet (sports gambling), a customer places a wager with a DK Sportsbook. The DK Sportsbook sets odds for each wager that builds in a theoretical margin allowing DK to profit. Sports gambling revenue is generated from wagers collected from customers, net of payouts and incentives awarded to winning customers. The last form of online gaming revenue is earned in similar fashion to a land-based casino, offering online versions of casino games such as blackjack, roulette, and slot machines.

**Gaming Software (18% of Total Revenue for 9 months ended 9/30/20):**

While the Online Gaming revenue stream mentioned above is a Business to Consumer (B2C) model, the Gaming Software revenue stream is a Business to Business (B2B) model. The Gaming Software side of the business was born out of the acquisition of SBTech, a company from the Isle of Man (near the UK) founded in 2007 that has 12+ years of experience providing online sports betting platforms to clients all over the world. The acquisition occurred as part of the SPAC driven IPO in April of 2020 that combined “the old DK company” with SBTech so that they now are “the new DK company” listed as DKNG on the NASDAQ. SBTech is a far more important part of the story than just being 18% of today’s revenue. The reason for this is because DK will eventually (planned mid-late 2021) be migrating all of their DFS and gambling offerings onto SBTech’s online platforms. Currently, for DFS, DK uses their own proprietary platform but that will move to SBTech with the migration. Currently, for online gambling, DK uses Kambi, the same online gambling platform that services Penn Gaming (PENN), a DK rival. But that’s enough about the software migration for now, back to the Gaming Software revenue.

The Gaming Software revenue stream for DK is essentially a continuation of SBTechs’ B2B business model. DK contracts with business customers to provide sports and casino betting software solutions. DK typically enters two different type of arrangements with B2B customers when selling the gaming software:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Direct Customer Contract Revenue:** In this type of transaction, the software is sold      directly to a business (casino for example) that wants to use the software      for their own gambling operations. This revenue is generally calculated as      a percentage of the wagering revenue generated by the business customer      using DK’s software and is recognized in the periods in which those      wagering and related activities conclude.
2. **Reseller Arrangement Revenue:**  In this type of transaction, DK provides      distributors with the right to resell DK’s software-as-a-service offering      to their clients, using their own infrastructure. In reseller      arrangements, revenue is generally calculated via a fixed monthly fee and      an additional monthly fee which varies based on the number of gaming operators      to whom each reseller sub-licenses DK’s software.  

As mentioned above, SBTech was an international company based in the Isle of Man before being acquired by DK. Thus, the majority of their business in their first 12 years of operating independently has always been international and outside of the United States. This has helped DK, which has historically been US focused, expand it’s international reach.

A perfect example of expanding this international reach occurred recently during October (technically Q4) in which DK’s B2B technology (powered by SBTech) helped enable the launch of “PalaceBet”, a new mobile and online sportsbook offering from Peermont, a South Africa based resort and casino company. The deal was headed by DK’s new Chief International Officer, Shay Berka, who previously spent 10 years working for SBTech as CFO and General Manager. Mr. Berka took on the role of DK’s Chief International Officer upon the merger in April earlier this year. I think this deal shows that DK has integrated SBTech and it’s business very well into the larger business as a whole. They are not wasting any time using their newly acquired resources to expand their reach and bring in new sources of revenue.

This is the end of my first article about DK. My goal is to drop Part 2 later this week. The focus of Part 2 will be an in depth answer of the question – “Can we 10x from here?”

personalfinance,Desperately need advice in turning my debt and poor money handling around!,"This is embarrassing, but I am not sure where to even start or what to do.  I (31F) am AWFUL with money, and need to get a handle on my finances before it really comes back to bite me.

Backstory - grew up in what I thought was upperish middle class.  We never wanted for anything, but also weren't extravagant.  We went on vacations, out to eat on the reg, nice clothes.  I'm the youngest of 3, an my two older siblings are 38 and 39.  When they were college age, my parents had average jobs and with three kids at home, my sisters qualified for all kinds of federal aid and were easily able to pay off their school loans within 10 years of graduation.  By the time I was in college, my dad had been in a much more lucrative role, and with only one kid at home, I qualified for almost no financial aid because of my parent's income.  The kicker is that my parents were never actually upper middle class, they were DROWNING in debt.  Needless to say, they had their own problems to work on, and I turned to private loans for help with school.  As an admittedly priveleged young adult, I was STUPID.  I had visions of college graduation meaning that I would immediately get this great job, and easily pay off any debt.  So, while my tuition was only about $4k a semester, private lenders would let me borrow $10k per semester with my parents as cosigners.  As a young adult, I took advantage of this.  It was awesome at the time, I had cash and didn't have to work as much, I could go shopping, buy the fanciest laptop - because it would be no sweat to pay off, right?

WRONG.  I have a bachelor's degree that I paid $120,000 for when it should have cost well under $40k, and my interest rates sit at 12% on average meaning my monthly payments are around $1500 - and note that is the MINIMUM payment.  My dad and I figured out that I'm only paying interest at this point, so my balance is going nowhere.  Most of my paycheck goes here.  Because of this, and the reality of a post-grad salary, I turned to credit cards.  When I couldn't pay my credit cards, I just stopped.  I also learned to play a game with my checking account where I know just HOW negative my account can get before I can't catch up.  I have no savings, my account is always negative about 3 days after being paid, and my credit is shot.  I can't refinance or consolidate my loans because they're mostly private and my credit is nowhere near where it needs to be to do so (granted I have brought it from the 300's to high 500's over the years so progress but ugh).  I am down to just one credit card that only has a $500 limit and I basically pay it off each paycheck and use that as my ""spending"" but its still borrowed money and its more than I actually can afford.

I live with my boyfriend who asks me only to buy groceries and recently asked if I could help with utilities.  $1500 goes to loans each month, about $1000 goes to my credit card, a few hundred to utilities, and because I'm always playing catch up with my bank account, I'm just always behind.  I want to turn this around.  I want to buy our next house, I want to contribute, I want a savings account, and other luxuries like a newer car as mine probably has a year left before it dies completely.

If something went wrong, I'm SOL on my own and its an awful reality.  My CC has $15 room on it, I get paid Friday and after bills will be sitting at about $30 in my bank account.  I then repeat the cycle of paying my CC, which puts me at -$530 plus fees, and then rinse, wash, repeat.

I think the only thing I'm doing right is contributing to my 401k, and not wanting children lol.  My parents literally don't have a retirement fund and it scares me so much for my future (and theirs).  I don't even tell them about my current issues, they bailed me out of $10k in credit card debt that I'm sure just went on one of their credit cards, and they don't deserve my financial burden and neither does my bf.

Where do I start?  If anyone needs more info, happy to share as well

personalfinance,Student loan debt,"I have federal student loan debt from around 2007 - 2010 that fell off my credit report around 2014 - 2017. Since 2019 I have been working to improve my credit, and paying off debt that is still being reported by credit agencies.   


Around November 10 - November 17 of this year I received an update on my credit report that two separate accounts had been repurchased by the Dept of Education and the loans were now being reported on my credit again. One was for $764 and the other for $1,529, for a total of $2,293.   


I've spent that last few days tracking down the servicer of the loan, and finally today was able to get a person on the phone that could help me with the account. She told me about how student loan debt payment can be held off until Jan 1 without interest, and I told her I wanted to pay the account off and be done with it.   


She then told me that the amount owed was over $6,700, but that the Dept of Education would settle for $5,721.18. I was pretty shocked at that, and she said not all debts are reported on credit reports, and that my options were to make payments toward the full amount, accept the settlement and pay it off within 90 days, or pay the full amount. I asked if I could just pay the amount I saw on my credit report, and she told me that wouldn't be helpful.   


I asked for a letter verifying the amount owed, and any information they have about the account and the debt. At first she was reluctant to do that, but by the end of the call she said she would be sending a letter that should arrive in 15 - 20 days.   


I'm really just trying to improve my credit here. I have some savings, and could pay the $2,000 and change, but paying close to $6,000 is a different matter.

gaming,A change in mindset for playing difficult games (Cuphead and Sekiro),"I've always had some level of interest in From Software games such as Dark Souls. I love the lore, the interconnected world, the interesting bosses, and the pride of being able to say I beat it. But I've always struggled to get behind the difficulty. Sometimes dying over and over again and wanting to throw my controller just hasn't justified the bragging rights. But I've kept with these games, in part because they are cool but in part because I want to be a ""true gamer"".

Cuphead and Sekiro are two games that have given me tremendous trouble. I gave up on both of them shortly after starting with little hope of ever beating them. I was fed up despite my excitement for each one before it released. I think part of the problem is that I purchased both of them while I still had plenty of other purchased games I wanted to play. The fact that I had easier games looming in my backlog made it difficult to commit to games that felt so insurmountable.

A couple of months ago, the frustration I felt with regard to my backlog grew and I decided to make a list of games to play in order. Not every game I needed to beat got placed on the list, but I did put every game I was generally excited about, at one point or another, on the list. I put Cuphead and Sekiro on the list. Cuphead in the middle and Sekiro at the end.

I was very much enjoying my list until I got to Cuphead. But the constant death I experienced made me consider dropping the list altogether and just go back to playing whatever. I felt like all the progress I was making on my list was halted because I was making so little progress on the game.

**But then it hit me**. Many games are made easy to make sure the character is constantly making progress through the game world. Almost **100%** of the feedback loop is built straight into game progression. Games like Cuphead and Sekiro aren't like this. **You have to understand that learning is progress** and thus you're making progress even when you fail and even when you're seemingly stuck. You have made it farther into the game the 20th time a boss has killed you then the first time as long as you're still learning. In other words, **You're getting gud!**

I stopped getting pissed off every time a boss killed me. Instead, I focused on what I learned about the boss and how I can apply that next time. I start to recognize patterns, I start to be able to respond to those patterns, and then I start to be able to push the offense more and more and for a longer and longer period of time until the boss is defeated.

I've beaten both games now and they are both some of my favorites. I'm glad I was able to change my mindset and hopefully, someone else can read this and approach these games differently too.",technology

vet,What could cause vomiting in my cat 3 weeks after oral surgery?,"I’ll preface this with the relevant information. My cat is a 16 year old male domestic shorthair, neutered as a kitten, he was always a big boy around 7kg but since getting sick he is down to about 4kg. About a decade ago he had really bad kidney problems and nearly died as a result of dry food, but once he was treated we fed him wet food ever since and the problem never persisted. 
3 weeks ago my sweet boy was diagnosed with oral cancer. He had a massive tumour growing on his palate. We brought him to the vet and we got it removed. They said they were surprised with how well his bloods and everything looked and that other than the tumour he was a really healthy cat for his age. He received a steroid injection and was brought home, but since then he has been fairly recluse apart from the evenings when he will sit and look out the window in the living room. He has and still continues to have a desire to eat, but over the last 3 weeks it’s been increasingly difficult to feed him. He just seems so picky with his food and obviously with the surgery it can be painful/an annoyance for him to eat. Every morning now there is vomit on the floor and it seems to be getting worse. He’s just not the same cat after surgery both psychically and personality wise. This is so devastating and I know he’s old, and I fear that we will have to put him down, but I want to at least try to understand why he’s vomiting. We’re bringing him to the vet sometime this week if we can get an appointment but I can’t wait that long to hear about his condition.
I don’t think I’ll ever be ready to say goodbye to him. This sucks so much. If any vets could give me some guidance I’d be so appreciative, and thank you all for looking after our four legged family.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,What to do with $40k (short-term),"I’m in grad school and have managed to save up about $45k over the course of this year. Ordinarily that would all go to my loans, but with interest paused at the moment I have been holding off on paying them. Obviously this is speculative, but if it turns out that the interest rates on my loans stay at 0% for the near future, what if anything should I do with this money? Interest rates on savings accounts are pretty low right now, although this would obviously be the safest choice. Another thought I had was to throw it into a low-risk ETF and let it grow by a couple of percentage points and maybe collect some dividends.

personalfinance,"Help: Should I refinance, and to 30 or 15 year term?","Throwaway here because I'm going to be fairly descriptive of my finances.

My wife and I bought our first home a year ago. We paid $625k for the home, financed 595k at 3.625% interest. We got a conventional mortgage (non-FHA, etc) and pay $188/mo in PMI. With PMI, taxes, and P&amp;I our payment is \~3600/mo and we pay $3800/mo. We just made our 13th payment yesterday.

Since we bought, our home has appreciated (per Zillow/Redfin estimates) from $640k to between $700-740k, and interest rates have continued to drop. I have spent some time looking around at refinancing options, with the goal of lowering my interest rate and removing PMI. I've gone through a pre-approval process with [Better.com](https://Better.com) and they are offering these rates (both 30 and 15 year options are fixed rate):

&amp;#x200B;

30 Year Mortgage:

|Rate|Points|APR|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2.5|$10,467|2.668|
|2.625|$9,195|2.778|
|2.75|$7,377|2.880|
|2.875|$3,787|2.957|

For a 15 Year, these are the options:

|1.875|$14,336|2.261|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2.00|$11,432|2.315|
|2.125|$8,010|2.357|
|2.250|$4,484|2.397|

There are additional higher rates for both 30 and 15 year options, but these are the ones I'd be primarily interested in.

Our monthly combined take home is about $11,500, and I have both a pension plan and a 457b that I max out to the tune of $19,500/annually. Our other bills, including student loans, groceries, utilities, entertainment, charitable giving, cars, phones, etc add up to about $4,000/mo. My wife's student loans, which we are currently paying at $1200/mo (double the actual payment, included in that $4000 number) will be finished within the next year. We also have a roommate that contributes about $900/mo to the mortgage.

Our home is about 95 years old and although it's in pretty good shape does have some things we know we need to take care of; we're working on some foundation issues that are going to cost us about 10k, which I plan to put on a 0% interest CC and pay down over a few months rather than deplete our reserves. We also know we will need to replace the windows in the next couple of years, which will probably cost $20k+ (quite a few windows - have had 5ish quotes already). So there's no shortage of things we can spend our money on if we choose.

Switching to the 2.125 15 year option would raise our monthly payment by around $1000. This is definitely doable in the long run, although it would certainly make things a bit tighter than they are now. My concern is that taking that thousand dollars out of our monthly budget will restrict our ability to a)Pay down the cost of the foundation work b)build our reserves (we keep \~$30,000 on hand for emergencies, but don't have other significant cash savings) and c)do things like replace the windows or other unexpected maintenance issues. In the long run, though, the 15 year at 2.125 would save us $250k+ in interest over the life of the loan vs what we're paying now.

The 30 year options would lower our payments by $3-400/mo. This would still reduce the amount of interest we pay over the life of the loan compared to our current mortgage, but not by nearly as much as the 15 year options. But it would free up cash to throw at the big ticket home repair/upgrade items I mentioned. I also looked at the numbers if I were to stick with a 30 year mortgage at the lower rate but throw additional money at it every month so I was opting to pay the monthly payment that would come with a 15 year, and even doing that I'd still be paying about $40,000 more in interest over the life of the loan than by going with the 15 year in the first place.

Cash to close for our top choices (the 30 year 2.75 and 15 year 2.125) is around $13-15k each. I'd probably want to roll that into the mortgage to avoid depleting our reserves.

So my question is: what's my best option here? I'm concerned that if I just stand pat the housing market will slow down or dip as COVID-related foreclosures pick up in the next year, and I'll lose an opportunity to get favorable terms and ditch PMI. On the other hand, the status quo right now is allowing me pretty significant cash flow to get home repair/upgrade things done without worrying too much.

Any help or advice would be appreciated. If I've left anything out or need to provide additional detail, I'm happy to do that!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: this decision does not necessarily hinge on removing PMI. I would like to remove it sooner than later, of course, but lowering my interest rate significantly would ultimately outweigh removing PMI for me, since the PMI is temporary anyway but locking in a lower interest rate would have long term benefits.",finance
economy,What effect do low interest rates have on inflation?,"I have been trying to figure out if the inflation rate will spike due to the QE being done around the world but I am unable to completely understand what will happen.

So the prices of  certain goods are going down due to innovation in technology, better supply chain etc.  which works in favor for deflation. Lower purchasing power due to the job losses also goes in favor of upcoming deflation.

QE being done would support inflation due to the amount of money being put in the system.

**How do low interest rates effect the inflation?**

&amp;#x200B;

My thinking is that in the current market condition  the low interest rates do not increase lending, especially due to the low interest rates being there before (Euro zone and USA), the only significant effect lower interest rates would have is to increase asset prices of other investment classes due to the lower return on savings.

Can someone with more knowledge explain to me how the low interest rates will affect inflation rate?

financialindependence,FIRE in other Countries/ Currencys,"Hi, im writing from México and im also interested in FIRE.

I suppose the majority of posts around here come from the USA because I read a lot about 401k, Roth, IRA, etc. which im not really into it because from another countries, retirement plans are different.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Correct me if im wrong

I have read a lot about FIRE'ing at 1M (USD) with a ""4% interest rule"". As I understand that translates into 40k interest anually (or $3333.33)  which should be enough for living. (I know it depends on which city and a budget)

A major difference about México and USA from my perspective is the salary. Ive read normal salaries ranges from $40k-$120k USD anually (before taxes?) 

From perspective, lets suppose a person earns $80k salary, after taxes it is like $60k (I dont really know how much less) and from those 60k that persons spends 65% and saves 35% each month. That translates to $19.2k net savings. 

After some many years, saving, investment, etc one can reach the 1M or desired FIRE goal.

I dont know if this is right but im speculating. What am i missing?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Ok, from México, a normal salary would be around $12.5k to 37.5k USD(Anually). I know theres a lot of difference vs USA but living costs (Food, rent, restaurants, medical expenses, etc) are much lower. 15k-18k should be enough for living in an average city in México. The only things that are ""kind of expensive"" to us mexicans with a salary 2-3 times lower because the cost the same here or there are not indispensable things like an Iphones, computers, cars, etc  or some other non basic somewhat imported stuff.

Lets take an example of a person that earns $25k, after taxes it is about $20k. And with an speding of 65% and saving rate of 35% it ends with $7k anually.

That same person needs almost as 3 times more to reach the same 1M.

According to the 4% (which is about the interest rate in México) to get 18k anually you would need 450k USD

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

450k USD is  is 2.22 times less that 1M but you would need: lets say 64 years at 7k per year saving rate) vs 52 years for 1M at 19.2k savings rate. So conclusion, you need more time for the desired FIRE number.

Those numbers are some aproach (I guess). Feel free to make any comparisons and discuss.",finance

personalfinance,I'm really confused about my auto loan payment regarding principal and interest.,"I bought a pre owned car a couple months ago. Loan is $22,349. 12.6% interest.  Before I made the first payment I asked an agent from the bank a few questions. 

Me: ""If I make a payment that is more than my regular payment will the extra amount go towards principal.""

Agent: ""Yes its a fixed interest rate. Any extra or 
additional payments will go to the principal.""

Me: ""Ok so if my payment is $444 and I pay $500 
then $56 goes to principal?""

Agent: ""That is correct.""

Pretty straightforward.

Regular payment is $444.65. I made a $500 payment on October 15th. $272.81 went to principal and $227.19 went to interest. I made another $500 payment last week. $148.39 went to principal and $351.61 went to interest. Loan is down to $22,051.80

I emailed the bank asking to them to explain this to me since I was confused. This was there response.

""To make a principle only payment you will need 
to add the amount that you wish to go to the 
principle to your monthly payment. If the 
payment is sent separately for principle only 
and is not received on the same day that the 
payment is made, interest will be taken from 
the payment and the remaining would then go 
to the principle. When the principle only is 
added to the payment all the funds intended 
for principle are then processed to the loan 
balance. The loan is a simple interest loan, 
which means that the interest is accrued on a 
daily basis. If you have further questions 
please call into the contact center at....""

My mortgage is currently with Wells Fargo. My lender said the refi rates for a 2 family are different and right now the low rates are for single family homes or condos. I tried Quicken Loans (awful service) and they also said they couldn’t do it because the house is deeded to my single member LLC even though I personally guarantee it. I tried one other smaller bank and have not heard back in a few months after calling the agent back several times. 

Is it worth it to keep pursuing this? My current rate is 3.625% for a 30 year. I purchased 3.5 years ago and have been renting one unit out, living in the other. My tenant moved out due to loss of employment from Covid a few months ago but I have been making the mortgage payments no problem. I’m not sure if I will continue to rent it out if that makes a difference (the extra space is nice) but I would get a new tenant if it helps the refi.

personalfinance,Should I refinance my jumbo mortgage?,"I've refi'd several times over the years (in other homes) so I'm knowledgeable on the process, but am completely confused about how amortization affects the decision on whether to refi.

Current: 5 years into a 30 yr term; 3% fixed; $1.2M balance; $5740/mo but I always pay $6K

Proposed: 30 yr term at 2.75% fixed, $1300 in fees/costs; $4870/mo but I'll continue to pay $6K.

The only reason I'm financing is to lower the rate.  Given the fees/costs, I'll break even in 9 months (the monthly savings are $160).  That part is a no-brainer for me since we'll be here for 30 years.  What I don't understand is how amortization schedules may impact the calculations.  I've read that the first 10-14 of mortgage payments are mostly interest, with the amount paid to interest and principal not evening out until about year 14.  

If we reduce the rate and reset the 30 year term but continue paying the same amount ($6K), does the refi save us money?  It seems like a straightforward calculation to me - if the payment amount stays the same but a lower interest rate applies, of course it saves money.  But again, I don't know how amortization affects this, if at all.

These are two cards that she says she no longer can maintain and needs to do something about it bc they are taking a huge chunk out of her monthly income, which is making it hard to get by.  She has one cc that she uses occasionally and pays off regularly.  The other two are accumulated debt over 15 yrs on everyday living expenses that she should have been more wise with. If she didn't have these 2 huge minimum payments to make, she would be financially stable with her one card. 

My first thought was to try and negotiate a settlement with the cards on our own. If she could get the debt to be half of that and pay it off by getting a personal loan from the bank w lower interest rate, that would be manageable for her. I realize this does impact her credit score and history.  But her other option, to just stop paying them, would do the same.  
My question here is if she does stop paying them and she receives settlement offers from the credit card company or collection agency in 8 mths or however long it takes, will her credit be tanked by then for here not to be able to take out a personal loan from her bank to pay the settlement offers? 

Having said all this, without my knowledge, she went and applied for a home equity loan (shouldnt she be able to get a personal loan not tied to the house?? ) and was approved but hasn't signed it yet due to a delay on banks part.  I told her to wait bc she doesn't want to be in debt to the bank vs unsecured credit cards (better).  
So, I'm at a loss as to what the best route is to help her.   I'm anxious about negotiating myself with the credit card but I know I'm supposed to get the agreement in writing before sending any payment and it's probably too early anyway since she has never been delinquent on any of her accounts ever. 

I recently learned about debt counceling thru NFCC. But I'm clueless as what they can do for her besides lower interest rate and maybe lower payment?? Can they decrease the total debt as well by negotiating with the companies themselves? I think this is the only way to prevent her credit history from impact? Yet I've been doing some reading and see some pretty big cons about going thru this route and am now leaning against it. 

Lastly, Considering my moms age and income, there isn't future potential for payment. So I don't see why creditors would be adverse to settling, right?   
Right now my current  thinking is for her to pay off one of the cards by using a bank loan which offers her a low interest rate , then stop paying the other credit card entirely , to charge off.  Wait for settlement offer she can do.  I figure walking away from one card is better than two?  Not sure if this is a good idea, but making the minimum payments as they are now on two 10k balances, is no longer feasible.  

Any advice or feedback would be appreciated. I want to help her and want to make sure she does the right thing. Even where to go for legit  advice would be appreciated...thank you.",finance

personalfinance,Can I pay myself for providing childcare of my children,"I have approximately $200 left in a dependent care FSA.  I am employed full-time.

My wife is employed full time, and fortunately, is able to work from home, with enough flexibility to provide primary care for the kids.

I do not see any FSA rules excluding paying yourself as a service provider, I am otherwise employed and taken vacation time; so I believe such an invoice should be accepted.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin is a government killer,"There are many Bitcoiners that I consider to have correctly projected the future of Bitcoin. Saifedean Ammos, Michael  Bitstein, and Pierre Rochard get it. Voorhees gets it. Michael Saylor definitely gets it. But even these people do not talk much about what the logical an inevitable conclusions from their otherwise spot-on economic analysis.

In this regard I think Bitcoin parallels the story of Atlas Shrugged, in which a man becomes so dismayed by the corruption of a government-controlled economic system that he just leaves. He simply opts out and stops producing for society and instead produces for himself in a area protected from government by a cloaking force field of sorts. Of course he takes care to remain anonymous but he invites other productive people to simply opt out of society. Few people bother to at first and his efforts are largely ignored as productive people work harder and harder to maintain the all-consuming state. But some people do start to disappear and in doing so take with them their economic resources and their productive virtue. Unnoticeable at first, the economic drain of productive people leaving becomes more and more significant as the state requires the ability to leech off their productivity to exist.

In a similar way, Satoshi created Bitcoin after the 2008 antics of government demonstrated their true nature by confiscating the savings of productive people--something they have done many times before but perhaps on a larger scale this time. The anonymous Satoshi spread the word and gave those who wished to do so an opportunity to opt out of the government-controlled monetary system. Instead of the physical cloaking force field literary device of Atlas Shrugged Satoshi used cryptography a far more elegant and impenetrable defense.

This is obviously great for Bitcoiners who flee the system in terms of the ability to secure their own wealth and has certainly been profitable for them, but what of the other side of that transaction? Michael Saylor recently described his company's holdings as an ice cube that is melting away from inflation. I think that is a very good analogy, but what of the melted ice? The melted ice--or rather the economic value represented by it, does not merely disappear it is collected by government in the form of [seigniorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage). When Saylor held $500M in the form of a metaphorical fiscal ice cube, he was effectively funding government by supporting demand for a currency they can expand with ease. By ""selling"" the $500 and existing the US monetary system, the government is no longer able to generate revenue by surreptitiously melting away his monetary ice cube. Governments are supported by the currencies they control, and currencies are supported on the shoulders of the productive people who choose to hold them, and this year one such holder shrugged. Many more dollar, euro, and RMB holders will soon follow in shrugging their ""responsibilities"" of maintaining the value of the state currencies that governments need to exist.

I recently felt a sense of anxiety as the political situation in the US unfolded earlier this week. All politicians are villains who wastefully plunder the economic resources of productive people, but some do more so than others. But how are they able to do so? Of course governments can procure the funds they need to conduct whatever nonsense and/or human atrocities via taxation, but this is [somewhat constrained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve) and cannot fund the scale of war or mass incarceration that government prefer to engage in.

Governments could obviously borrow, but although the supply of individuals willing to lend government money at times seems endless even this funding source has been exhausted resulting in the Federal Reserve buying government debt because no one else will--at least at palpable rates. This leaves the only source--new money creation or seigniorage . This is where government gets access to the resources it needs to do what governments do. Without seigniorage, people would not be so willing to lend money, which would forcefully constrain the size of government to what people would allow instead of the boundless size permitted by the ability to create new money. This an inescapable conclusion that government cannot coexist with Bitcoin, but no one mentions this.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,IRS expands Identity Protection PIN Opt-In Program to Taxpayers nationwide,"Internal Revenue Service announced today that starting in January the Identity Protection PIN Opt-In Program will be expanded to all taxpayers who can properly verify their identities in 2021.

The IP PIN is a six-digit number assigned to eligible taxpayers to help prevent the misuse of their Social Security number on fraudulent federal income tax returns. An IP PIN helps the IRS verify a taxpayer's identity and accept their electronic or paper tax return. The online Get An IP PIN tool at IRS.gov/ippin immediately displays the taxpayer's IP PIN.

The online tool uses Secure Access authentication which uses several different ways to verify a person's identity. Before using the ""Get an IP PIN"" tool, the IRS encourages taxpayers to review the requirements at IRS.gov/secureaccess.

For those who cannot pass Secure Access authentication, there are alternatives. Taxpayers with incomes of $72,000 or less and with access to a telephone should complete Form 15227 and mail or fax it to the IRS. **An IRS assistor will call the taxpayer** to verify their identity with a series of questions. For additional security reasons, taxpayers who pass authentication will receive an IP PIN the following tax year.

Taxpayers who cannot verify their identities remotely or who are ineligible to file a Form 15227 may make an appointment to visit a Taxpayer Assistance Center and bring two forms of picture identification. Because this is an in-person identity verification, an IP PIN will be mailed to the taxpayer within three weeks.

Taxpayers who obtain an IP PIN should never share their code with anyone but their trusted tax provider. The IRS will never call to request the taxpayer's IP PIN, and taxpayers must be alert to potential IP PIN scams.

Here's what taxpayers need to know about the IP PIN before applying:

* The Get an IP PIN tool will be available in mid-January. This is the preferred method of obtaining an IP PIN and the only one that immediately reveals the PIN to the taxpayer.
* Taxpayers who want to voluntarily opt into the IP PIN program do not need to file a Form 14039, Identity Theft Affidavit.
* The IP PIN is valid for one year. Each January, the taxpayer must obtain a newly generated IP PIN.
* The IP PIN must be properly entered on electronic and paper tax returns to avoid rejections and delays.
* Taxpayers with either a Social Security number or Individual Tax Identification Number who can verify their identities are eligible for the opt-in program.
* Any primary taxpayer (listed first on the return), secondary taxpayer (listed second on the return) or dependent may obtain an IP PIN if they can pass the identity proofing requirements.
* The IRS plans to offer an opt out feature to the IP PIN program in 2022 if taxpayers find it is not right for them.

There is no change in the IP PIN program for confirmed victims of tax-related identity theft. Those taxpayers should still file a Form 14039 if their e-filed tax return rejects because of a duplicate SSN filing. The IRS will investigate their case and once the fraudulent tax return is removed from their account, confirmed victims automatically will receive an IP PIN via postal mail at the start of the next calendar year. IP PINs will be mailed annually to confirmed victims only and participants enrolled prior to 2019. Because of security risks, confirmed identity theft victims cannot opt out of the IP PIN program. Confirmed victims also can use the Get an IP PIN tool to retrieve lost IP PINs assigned to them.

cardano,Cardano Stakeholders' Guide To Long-Term Staking,"## How much in rewards do we need to be financially independent?

This is perhaps the most fundamental question for Cardano stakeholders with long-term time horizons. The reason many choose to hold digital assets like ADA, apart from literally participating in a game-changing consensus protocol, is to reach some form of financial independence. Considering the amount of the risk the early adopters take, the upside should be large enough to warrant a good level of income into the future, without eroding the capital base.

While the ultimate amount of income will undeniably vary based on the age, lifestyles, and countries of residence of stakeholders, it is possible to break down the steps necessary to secure it.

The purpose of this guide is to introduce a mental framework to help Cardano stakeholders analyze their strategies and evaluate how likely they are to reach their staking goals.

That said, no investment is without risks and stakeholders should be comfortable with every decision they make. Otherwise, they will introduce emotions into their decision-making process, which could cause their strategies to fail.

***Reminder: what you will read below is not a financial, investment, legal or tax advice. Please consult with a professional regarding your personal circumstances.***

## It all starts with that magic number…

How much money do we need to live a comfortable, happy life? For someone in the US that would probably be in the region of USD80,000 per year. That translates to around USD1,095 per epoch or around USD6,575 per month.

Assuming the above is true in your case, how much ADA do you need now to secure that minimum income?

Well, the short answer is… around **9.7M ADA or USD1.48M \[$80000/0.054\].** This was the short answer, which may be a bit out of reach for many.  So, let us try the long answer. The long answer is… it depends.

It so happens that our ability to reach our goal depends on a limited number of factors which we can model through a set of assumptions. Those factors are:

(i) the current amount of ADA our portfolio

(ii) amount of periodic ADA purchases (this is in addition to rewards)

(iii) rate of return on staking

(iv) our time horizon (i.e. how long we give ourselves to reach our goals)

(v) the price appreciation of ADA

Stakeholders will have different profiles. Some one in their 20s may have less capital to afford a large purchase of ADA immediately, but will have a longer time horizon and could purchase small amounts every month. Someone in their 60s may have a larger capital base, but a shorter time horizon to take substantial risks, as they are closer to retirement age.

Let us assume that our desired income is $80K and we already have 200K in ADA in our portfolio. Let us also assume that we committed to purchase additional 20K ADA per year and would like to give ourselves 5 years to achieve our goal.

## Given the above set of inputs, what would the minimum price of ADA have to be for us to generate our desired outcome?

There is a way to calculate the target price for our strategy above. For our stake to generate our target income, the price of ADA would have to reach **$4.37.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Target Income Calculations](https://preview.redd.it/8e8itguta3361.png?width=1841&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c83bc726f499adf7f9fb47b7b2a56c02b374fa4e)

&amp;#x200B;

## How attainable is our goal?

These kinds of questions require gauging the potential of a project, looking at the fundamentals such as (i) the monetary policy of the project, (ii) team, (iii) technology, (iv) regulatory landscape, (v) competition, etc., which are beyond the scope of this note.

BUT in general, we could look at a limited set of factors such as the historical market price of ADA, its standard deviation, the all-time high price to assess the likelihood of our strategy somewhat reasonably. These are not absolute measures of quality or probability, nevertheless they provide some form of benchmarks to evaluate our strategies.

In the above example, we expect the price of ADA to increase to **$4.37** which may seem high at first. But if we take into consideration the time horizon of 5 years, it does not seem too unrealistic. Especially if we consider the standard deviation of returns for ADA, which is 156%.

If we rely on the price of ADA to raise 1,000 x within a year, which is unlikely but still could happen (crazier things have happened in this space), we might want to revise our inputs, i.e. increase our time horizon, reduce our target income or raise our annual contributions, to arrive at a more or less realistic scenario.

Being conservative always helps as it prepares us for less than ideal outcomes, and if things turn out to be better than we expected, we can “retire” early or enjoy higher than expected income if we stay the original course…

Now for the final question:

## If we accumulate the amount of wealth enough to generate our target income, does it make sense to keep it all in ADA? Once we reach that target amount does it not make sense to convert it back to a fiat currency and invest in a combination of stocks and 5 or 10-year bonds generating those same 5%?

This is a valid question, the answer to which depends on our risk tolerance. Cardano is an emerging fundamental technology with a huge upside potential. On the monetary policy level, its native token—ADA is supported by a capped supply and a decaying emission schedule. This means that any additional value Cardano would manage to generate will be distributed over a slowly decreasing number of ADA issued. This bodes well for the long-term holders of this asset, considering how early we are in the adoption cycle.

But ADA, like many assets in the digital asset space, is volatile and that may not be ideal for someone who is close to retirement when they reach their objectives. In these cases, it could make sense to switch back to a portfolio mix of a stable assets, which would generate the same level of target income.

By doing so they will of course be giving up on the continued upside Cardano may still have to offer. If our portfolio grows beyond our target value, it will make us even more resilient. In practical terms, if our portfolio can sustain, say 50-70% losses but still generate enough income, we may continue holding risky assets as our capacity to take risk is improved.

personalfinance,Any ideas I haven't thought of yet?,"Me and my husband need advice on how to fix our situation.

We got married a year ago and have been living off of mostly savings and windfall/handouts and one part-time salary up until now. We never were truly bringing in enough to even cover rent, but the savings/windfall/handouts balanced everything out. Now we're trying to take charge of our finances and become financially independent. We are on the WIC program as well and just had a baby.

My husband is an F1 international student in the US and isn't allowed to work full-time or off-campus without a green card/work permit, which we don't have yet. He's also not allowed to get food stamps or federally subsidized housing, which means our family can't benefit from those things even though I'm a citizen and we pay taxes. And he's not allowed to take a semester off of school. 

He has a part-time job on campus and when he gets home we switch off and he watches the baby and does mountains of homework while I work from home. Together we bring in about $1000 per month, on a good month. My job doesn't always have reliable work even though it pays slightly more per hour. Not as much as McDonalds, though. If we had a car I would immediately get a job in fast food.

We have just enough money in the bank to pay our last month of rent and the deposit for our new apartment. The new apartment will cost about $650 a month, which is the cheapest in our area. That leaves $350 a month for everything else. It's hard to get diapers and food on that amount, let alone anything else like savings or childcare. 

We will still be on WIC and possibly getting a food box every couple of weeks, and we're trying not to buy anything. When we absolutely need something I ask on the buy nothing page on facebook to get it for free, or I browse facebook marketplace to find the cheapest option.

defi,Risks in USDC Lending?,"Hi, 

I'm dipping my toes into defi and I want to store some of my emergency fund in stablecoins (mainly USDC) to gain some interest. There are a ton of different options, but the risks of each don't seem that clear. Any advice on the 3 below? 

1. BlockFi - Interest seems to be good on USDC at 8.6%. The issue is that it's another exchange and they had a breach in sept this year. They are a legit company with serious backers but still....not your keys not your coins 
2. Coinbase Wallet using Compound - Lower interest rates hovering between 3-5%. You maintain cUSD tokens and the phone wallet is decently secure. Wallet is also recoverable with a passphrase. 
3. [Yearn.finance](https://Yearn.finance) using earn functionality. Seems to maximize the interest rate between different algorithms using USDC. Transparent code but feel much less beginner friendly than coinbase wallet.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Big Bonus -- Max 401k Contribution vs High Interest Student Debt?,"Hi all. I feel like the answer is ""definitely 401k"" but just wanted to sanity check it through the hivemind here.

I have a lot of student debt. The worst chunk of it is about $45k at a 7% interest rate.

I have just started contributing to my 401k (I've been working a few years, so I know I should have been doing so earlier, but I'll spare you the reasons -- suffice to say, I'm finally doing so now). So far this year I've contributed a whopping $1,200.

I am getting a $50,000 bonus this month (\~$90k gross, but after withholding...). As between maxing out my 401k or just paying off the $45k loan in full, am I thinking correctly that every dollar possible should be put toward maxing the 401k first?

My employer does not match contributions.

I am 30.

EDIT - Seems everyone is unanimous in that it makes more sense to just clear the loans. I'm going to plan to go ahead and follow the advice seeing how unanimous it is. Very grateful for the feedback.",finance

I told him I would be interested if I could buy it for the same payment (including PMI, taxes, etc from impound account) as our rent of $1600 with only putting down the minimum amount.

personalfinance,Should I pay a large sum (40k) to student loans or invest?,"My wife and I have been very fortunate as a result of some of the corona chaos.  Our two year old has been home with us since March which means no money towards childcare (900 a month), a dream vacation we had been saving for for 3 years was cancelled (7k back), I’m now indefinitely remote (wife was already fully remote) which means no money towards commute and several other factors has led to us to be able to save a large amount of money.

We aggressively paid off my student loans two years ago and now we are looking to do the same with my wife. We transferred her student loans to a credit union in March of 2019 in order to consolidate and get a better interest rate.  The interest rate is 3.4 (variable).  Her student loans are right at 40k.  

We have the money in our account now but are looking to save another 10-15k by March of next year before we pull the trigger and pay them off completely.  The 10-15 is meant to build back up our safety net.

My question is… is this the wisest thing to do?  Should we pay off her students loans in full or would it be wiser to invest the money?

I’m borderline obsessed with paying off debt and strive for a debt free life, so on one hand that seems like the absolute best option to me.  But, on the other hand 40k is a decent chunk of money and I wonder if it’d be smarter to invest that money.  We are meeting with our financial advisor later this month and I feel he will say it’s smarter to invest the money and let it work for itself since we have no issue paying the monthly student loans (300) and the interest rates are relatively low.  I just can’t shake the feeling of excitement with paying them off in full.

Anyways, let me know what you all think and I appreciate your input.

investing,FED Balance Sheet inquires,"[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst\_recenttrends.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm)

In the talks about the second stimulus, I'm really curious to know where did the first stimulus officially end? If we take a look at FED balance sheet there was a huge surge from March 10 to June 9, followed by a small drop till July 7, at which point, it started growing again. What is officially considered the end of the stimulus? Is it June 10? And is the period from July 7 till the present moment considered ""regular operations""? What differs ""stimulus"" from ""regular operations"" if both grow in size indefinitely, just the magnitude?

Beside the official stimulus which is huge in magnitude, how much can FED grow its balance sheet without ""declaring"" it a ""stimulus"", in other words, what are FED upside/downside limits without the consent of senate pertaining to growing/shrinking balance sheet in ""regular operations""?

If we look at the period from 2010 to 2015, there was a constant growth. Was it considered a stimulus as well or just ""regular operations""? While I understand that the wealth is being created and we need more money in the system, is it that the economy grew almost as much as 10 times from 2008, therefore requiring as much as 10 times the amount of the money in the system?

Can FED grow balance sheet another 10 fold in the next 10 years, therefore, the equities will simply continue to grow and everybody will be wealthier and happier or there are some repercussions? What should one be aware of and are the consequences?

personalfinance,Garnishment Help !!,"Okay so back in 2015 I had an auto loan. Well I got into a car accident and the vehicle was totaled and I didn’t have insurance. I know I don’t need a lecture about how I was irresponsible for not having insurance. I couldn’t afford it at the time. Shortly after (2 weeks later) I moved from California to Colorado. I Never heard from the loan company again. They aren’t on my credit report or anything. 

Fast forward to now I’ve moved back to California, from Colorado. Got married, bought  a house ect. Well I received an email from my employer that there was a judgement against me and my wages were being garnished by the old auto loan company. I was confused because you have to be sued to obtain a judgement, and garnish wages.

I called the loan company, they said I was indeed sued. I told them I never was served, I never heard from them over the years. Well I guess they did a Substituted Service, giving the paperwork to my cousin (who I don’t even speak to) girlfriends dad while I was in Colorado. Idk how they got that address thinking I lived there. I argued I’ve never lived there, I don’t talk to the people who live in that house and I was never properly served. I lived out of the state at the time they’re claiming I was served. 

My wages are being garnished now 5 almost 6 years later and I never even knew I was sued is there anything I can do to stop the garnishments??? They’re claiming I owe them over $11k. Meanwhile the car I had at the time was approx. $7k at the dealership but I put $3k cash down. I know I had an outrageous interest rate at the time. They’re claiming that the amount I financed with them was $9k but how’s that possible if the car was $7k, I had a $3k down payment. 

The loan company did tack on some type of insurance on top of my car payment and has actually been sued recently because the insurance should cancel auto loans due to total loss. I asked about this as well and they kept repeating I didn’t have insurance and I acknowledged that but they were charging me for an insurance on top of my car payment. Then the man said I didn’t pay the insurance part just my loan balance. Then switched up and said my claim was denied because they couldn’t get ahold of me or find me. So I asked how they “served”, sued, and obtained a judgement against me if they couldn’t find me and he hung up.

personalfinance,Car Loan Questions,"A little backstory... in 2015 we were in desperate need of a car, someone suggested to my wife that it was easier to buy a new car than to get a loan for a new one... we ended up getting a 2016 Kia Forte with a high-interest rate... not sure exactly what it is though.  we have made payments on this car for the last 4 years at $437 a month which has been a major chunk of our income every month, but we have managed to pay it.   

&amp;#x200B;

We are wanting to get a better hold of our finances and maybe even start saving so this high car payment needs to go.  As it stands right now we still owe just over 8000 on the car and we have 24 more payments of $437 which will be a total payoff of over 10k left.  

&amp;#x200B;

I looked into refinancing and heard that since interest is front-loaded that may not save us any money and may even cost us money.   My wife wants to trade it in and get something else, we do have much better credit now but I'm not sure if that is the best option. 

&amp;#x200B;

Selling the car is not an option because it has some wreck damage along with some minor issues that will need to be repaired soon ( new brakes, tires are close to needing to be replaced, car needs a tuneup ,things like that) I doubt I'd even be able to get $3000 out of it.

She didn't grow much because of this though and she was also accidentally hit on the head once and fell off a one story roof, despite all that she seemed fine, she seems to shiver a lot but stops when she warmed up very well and would eat whatever you fed her. But recently my sister adopted her and took her in to her house to take care of her and raise her. She took her in Dec 1st but on Dec 2nd she told me she has not been using the bathroom in that 24 hours she had her. she had not eaten or drank much either since she got her as well, otherwise she seems happy and social and stays in my sisters lap always purring, when my sister is away from her she keeps meowing for her. Today she said she finally used the bathroom and she noticed her poop has worms in it and doesn't know what to do about it. My sister lives in Syria where there's no vet's to take her to. So she wants to know a way she could treat her at home.

In exchange for some self-validation, I'm also going to provide as much info on my journey thus far as I can. I do things a bit differently than the mainstream consensus here, so hopefully I can spark some interesting discussion.

* Roth IRA: $85,100  
* 401k: $296,300  
**Total: $1,001,400**

I know a lot of that doesn't look like the standard FIRE playbook, so I'll provide some additional backstory.

&amp;nbsp;

**Student Loans**  
My parents paid my tuition for my first 2 years and I took out loans for room, board, and general living expenses. After my sophomore year, I landed a fairly lucrative internship (that I returned to after junior year as well) and paid my own way out of pocket for the final 2 years. I graduated with a Petroleum Engineering degree in May 2012 with $32k of student loans.

&amp;nbsp;

**Early Career**  
I landed a job with one of the supermajors and was offered both a ""normal"" engineer-in-training position and a less desirable ""field focused"" position. I opted for the latter because it was a 14/14 rotation schedule (2 weeks on the rig, then 2 weeks vacation), which gave me more flexibility in my living situation and also paid slightly more once travel benefits and per diem stipends were taken into account. Starting pay was $98k/yr with a $10k signing bonus. Since I spent half of the year living on the rig and most of my off-time traveling, I only ended up leasing a storage room to keep all of my shit in. By the end of 2012, I had paid off my student loans on a gross income of ~$60k over those first 7 months following graduation.

After finishing my first 6 months of training, I got a pay bump to $120k and grossed around $135k in my first full calendar year (2013). Since I wasn't sending all of my money each month towards student loans any more, I opened a Vanguard account after finding this sub (lurked with no account for a long time) and starting depositing all of my leftover cash each month into VTSAX. After a year in the field (so halfway through 2013), I was pulled in for a short-term project that was office-based in another state. Since this was only supposed to be a 6-month ""temporary relocation"", I was provided a furnished corporate apartment and daily food stipend. That 6-month assignment turned into a 1yr assignment and then a month later that same boss found another 1yr project he wanted me for, so I ended up living rent-free in that corporate apartment for 2 years and continued shoveling all of my extra cash each month into my Vanguard account. There was also another pay bump when I started the second assignment and, including imputed income from the apartment, I grossed $186k in the second full calendar year.

The end of that second assignment happened to coincide with my completion of the training program and I was missing my old rotation schedule, so I accepted a job as an ops supervisor in our deepwater fleet and went back to the 14/14 life. I ""returned"" to Houston to avoid state income taxes while working offshore (""merchant mariner"" since I only worked in federal waters) and upgraded my storage room to a utilities-included garage apartment I found for $500/month. This new job was also a promotion, so my gross pay for calendar year #3 ended up being $205k. 

That brings us to the end of 2015. At that point, I had worked 3.5 years, had made it past the $200k comp mark, had only paid rent for 6 months ($3k total lol), and had ~$300k saved between my Vanguard account, 401k, and Roth.

&amp;nbsp;

**Buying a House (Wtf is that ""Holding"" account???)**  
Fast forward a couple of years and I was getting burned out doing the offshore gig. All of my best friends were getting engaged, buying houses, having kids, moving into managerial positions etc. while I spent half of my year on a floating tin can and the other half either sleeping in hostels around the world or bringing Tinder girls back to the sketchy garage I ""lived"" in. I didn't feel like I had a purpose in life even though I was ""living the dream"" and making $200-225k each year. I decided it was time to put my technical education to use and transition to a more traditional office-based job. When I told management that I wanted to make a switch, I got offered a deepwater drilling engineer position that came with a relocation package and decided I would buy a house in the new city.

I had also hired a financial advisor in early 2017 when I hit the $500k NW mark and later that year was when I started house shopping. I know financial advisors get a lot of hate here, but I've been pretty happy with mine. He was a guy that had been working as an assistant for my parents' FA that I had talked to a couple of times already. He's only ~8 years older than me and was always the guy that came up with creative ways to boost wealth generation. He had decided to leave the firm that my parents were using to start his own team and was taking on new clients, so I jumped on board. 

After talking with him extensively about it, I decided to go the route of a Securities Backed Mortgage (SBM) when buying my house. This is why there is a separate ""Holding"" account listed above. I knew this wasn't going to be my Forever Home, so I also combined the SBM with a 10yr I/O ARM. What all of this means is that I was able to buy a $495k house with a 0% down payment, no PMI, and I have only made interest payments during my 3 years of ownership. When I bought in Jan 2018, I had ~$285k in my Vanguard account and had ~$40k cash from the relocation package that I planned to use for the down payment. Instead of selling shares to come up with a traditional down payment and then locking up a bunch of capital in home equity, I used the SBM to get credit for a ""20% down payment"" by giving them a lien on enough shares to be a 30% down payment (~$150k). I still have direction over that account (with a few reasonable rules), but it is tied to the house until I have 20% equity (or sell it). That $150k is the maintenance number that I have to stay above, so I moved the full $285k from Vanguard into that holding account to provide enough buffer to weather a ~50% market downturn before getting hit with a call for peace of mind. The $40k cash is what I used to open the actively managed account as a trial and set up a recurring $1k/month that is essentially what would have been going to mortgage principal with a traditional note.

So instead of a $99k down payment and a $2,400/month note ($1600 interest / $800 principal), I kept that $99k invested in index funds and pay $1,500/month in interest while voluntarily making a $1,000/month ""house payment"" to myself. Without getting too deep in the weeds on the numbers, all of this has netted me an extra ~$45k gain over the last 3 years.

&amp;nbsp;

**MLI's**  
This is the other thing that probably looks out of place and is where I've been putting the extra monthly cash that used to get blindly shoveled into Vanguard. The offerings change month to month, but most of these are tied to either DJIA, S&amp;P500, or European Large Cap indexes with leverage amounts in the 120-180% range with the downside being less liquidity due to 3-5yr maturities. If I have $5k that I know I won't touch for 5yrs, why buy S&amp;P500 ETF's when I can buy a 5yr note from Barclays for S&amp;P500 shares with 150% upside leverage? It's a small portion of my total portfolio, but it's a way to squeeze out a little bit more market performance when you know liquidity isn't an issue. My FA sends me the list of these every month and I just tell him what I want, so I'm not sure if this is something available to normal retail accounts or not.

&amp;nbsp;

**FIRE Numbers**  
I've always carried $10k/month as my FIRE target even though it's probably a bit more than I really need (current monthly spend is only ~$6500) because I would need to be on the ""fat"" side of FIRE to justify leaving my career. Also want to have enough of a buffer that deciding to have a family down the road doesn't completely torpedo my plans. That monthly spend target translates to a NW target of $3,000,000, so I'm nowhere close to my full FIRE mark yet. But getting my second comma definitely makes it feel like I'm at least on track and being close to double my CoastFI number ($550k) could be considered the ""FI"" part of FIRE. I could realistically see myself in position to comfortably FIRE around 40-45, depending on how the whole family thing turns out.",finance
personalfinance,I have a credit card that went to collections 4 years ago and have been advised not to pay on it.,"I opened a business about 4 years ago and when I left my old job to start it money I was supposed to be paid by my old employer was never given to me. I went about 3 months without a pay check because of this. I wasn't able to pay on a store credit card and  they sent it to collections before I could start paying on it again. On the advice of a few mortgage lender friends I have ignored it in the meantime. 

Now I'm doing well and have rebuilt my credit, minus this card. Everytime I try to refinance my house they tell me to continue to ignore this card, but then say because of the collection account my interest rate is as good as they can get it. 

The collections company has switched a few times and have offered to settle the card with me. I can't come up with the $2,000 to pay it all at once, but I dont have an issue paying it as it is my debt. I want to get rid of the anxiety of it and move on, but advice from people has kept me from paying it. Will it eventually go away?

personalfinance,wondering if I should refinance,"Sorry it's another one of those refinance questions. I'm convinced this stuff is intentionally made confusing so normal people have to rely on the banks and what not to get anything done.  


Our home is estimated to be 600k on zillow. Our mortgage is 15 years at 3.5% interest, was originally 230k but I've been doing my best to pay extra on the principal and with 9 years left it's now down to 101k. With the low interest rates currently and seeming all my family and friends going for a refinance I figured why not and started a refinance application with citibank but didn't commit to anything yet besides paying the $24 credit check. They got back to me with the estimates, I asked for a 10 year term and they are offering me 2.625%. Estimated closing cost is about 6k. I did a google search and put in the numbers on all the refinance calculators I can find but the results are a mix of saving money or losing money.  


Basically my goal is to be able to pay off my loan ASAP while saving as much as I can on the total amount of interest paid, I don't really care too much about the monthly payment as I'm paying a lot of additional principal on top of the regular monthly payments anyways. My original plan was actually to save up a big chunk of cash and just pay off the remaining loan within maybe 2 or so years from now. Based on my info above, does it make sense for me to do a refinance? I wish there is a convenient way to straight up compare my current loan to a refinanced loan and how much I would save in the total interest paid over the life time of the loan.",finance

personalfinance,Paying off Law School Debt on a Big law Salary,"I graduated law school in May 2020, after attending a t14 and paying sticker. I owe about 300,000 in debt after the whopping 30k in interest amassed in law school. For the last 9 months my interest on my student loans was 0 pandemic due to the pandemic, but I am under the impression that this is expiring on December 31. My regular interest rate is 6 percent (Stafford + Graduate Plus loans).

My Salary is 190k a year, but after taxes, it roughly amounts to $100,000. I already took a 15k advance from my firm and had about $8,000 in credit card debt I just paid off (mostly from COL in law school prior to my spouse and I moving.)

I am lucky enough to have a spouse who earns about 90k a year and we are living in the apartment above my brother's home (in NYC) and do not have rent. We have a daughter who is 9 months old, and so far we have not had expenses for child care as we've been working from home. So, basically, we pay our utilities and food from our joint account, but our expenses as of now are relatively low. (No car, for instance.)

My spouse and I are both first generation students and came from working class families, so we don't really have the financial expertise or experience from our families to fall back on, or the cushion in case we lose our jobs.

I'm wondering (1) if I should refinance my interest rates as soon as the 0 percent interest expires and (2) what I should be throwing at my debt during this kind of unstable economy. I initially wanted to put about 5k a month towards my loans, with the hope of having them paid off in 4-5 years. But I'm worried if I should be putting more in my 401k or savings due to the pandemic and relatively unstable economy.

investing,Marijuana penny stocks represent a huge opportunity right now,"Thinking specifically about MassRoots (MSRT) and Future Farm Technologies (FFRMF). As far as I know, they are barely functioning companies right now, and their stocks ran and went to near zero in the last MJ boom/bust.

However, MJ legalization looks inevitable. Unfortunately its likely that Mitch will block anything that comes through the Senate as usual. But with states consistently legalizing and decriminalizing, and now Mexico and the UN doing the same, the writing is on the wall for the US. The question is when, not if, and I think the timeframe is either now, or within 2 years.

Back to the trades - when these types of events happen, every stock remotely associated with the space goes on a speculative boom. It happened with Cryptocurrency, where we saw companies not even related to Crypto add it to their name and go bananas. I'm presuming it relates to bot-trading and automated scraping of PR headlines, or something of that nature.

These two in particular are actually related to MJ, and though they are barely functioning at this moment, my presumption is that they will see a similar speculative-FOMO type major boost if/when MJ is legalized or de-scheduled at the federal level. 

And since they can be purchased for literal pennies (less than a penny for MSRT right now), it represents a compelling risk/reward gamble.

That is all, thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

EDIT: to be clear, if you like MJ as I do, you should be in all kinds of real MJ businesses. I certainly am. But I’m talking here about a compelling speculation with stocks that can easily go up huge multiples just based on a rush of cash into the space",finance

personalfinance,Prospect of purchasing home in different city,"Hi! I'm looking for advice and direction about the prospect of purchasing a house in a different city before moving to that city and making it my home.

I lived in Philadelphia for most of my life, and my friends and family are still there. I have been living in San Francisco for the past 1.5 years and plan to stay in SF for a couple more years before moving back to Philly.

I have been considering buying a house, and I think I'd like to buy a house in Philly, rent it out, and then move into it when I return to Philadelphia.

I have $120k saved for a down payment and would be considering houses in the $400-$600k range. I'm not interested in being a landlord long-term, but could use a property management company to facilitate renting out the house until I return, which would help pay the mortgage.

My partner and I presently make a combined $256k/year. I think we could likely sustain this salary in Philadelphia. We also pay $3.3k/month for our rent in SF currently.

Also, a close friend of mine is a realtor in Philly and could help me with the process of purchasing the house.

I am anxious to buy a house while interest rates are so low and while the housing market continues to rise. What do you think about these market conditions? Will there be a correction as the pandemic continues? My down payment money is just sitting in a savings account earning very little interest.

Is this a good plan or is it just FOMO? What would you do if you were in my situation: planning to move to a city in a few years and with home-buying funds ready to go? Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Dealership wanting half down on a trailer. We have good credit.,"I work in finance and feel pretty knowledgeable on the subject, but maybe I’m missing something. My dad and I have gone through a lot this year. We saw a little 2014 camper trailer at an RV dealership and thought it would be a nice get away tool. They boast about being a smaller establishment, and offering better prices. Like buying a car (which I have a lot of experience with) there’s a stage where we talk to the “sales guy”.  It took this dealership two days to get back to us. There weren’t any fancy terms we made. We just applied, and they said they’d call us later. I thought that was strange as they didn’t seem busy. Anyways we were prepared to put 10% down. They called me today asking to put 50% down or no bank would lend to us. When I asked about the interest rate if we did, they didn’t even have a number for me. I feel like that’s absolutely incorrect, but have also never purchased a camping trailer before. We have great credit. Hardly any debt at all (all of it is long term debt too). So I’m trying to see if I’m being scammed or there’s some other incentive they have, that I’m not seeing. Any info helps. Thanks.",finance

Now, I was relocated for work in Feb and since then have been subletting my place until I decide what to do with it. I sadly missed out on refinancing at lower rates as a primary home because I wasn't living there when they dropped. I want to refinance to a lower rate so I don't lose as much money on it from my sublets, but not sure how best to do it. From everything I'm reading, I don't seem to have enough LTV to qualify for a refinance and at investment rates, it doesn't seem to make sense. But as a second home, I'll have a hard time proving I make enough to support both homes. I make $60k.

personalfinance,Buying House With Bad Septic,"So the house I'm looking to get has a failed septic inspection and now could be 20k-30k to fix. Agreement was made to split the cost 50/50 but the owners won't be able to fix in time before closing. 

First off, am I an idiot for agreeing to purchase a home with a bad septic system?

Second, what is my best option to have it paid for? Assuming the cost is $30k, I really want my $15k added to my mortgage and spread across 30 years. But since the closing will happen first, I don't know if this is possible. Can I increase my offer by $15k, close the house, and receive $30k back in cash at the end? My closing costs are quite low (less than $6k) so covering that expense won't pick up the full tab. 

Any ideas or suggestions? I'm looking to put down 25% right now so i get the best interest rate. Yes, I know the rates are low so even 20% is not going to kill me but dropping to 20% would still be paying $50 more monthly, even if the offer price reduces by $15k, and I'd still be losing $10k out of pocket on top of the $20k not put towards the principal through down payment.",finance

Hey guys! I picked this game up yesterday and got hooked, so I couldn't put it down until I beat it. Startup Panic is an inexpensive new management game on the Epic store that feels like a buffed version of some of the games I used to play a few years ago, but its got a difficulty spike after the first few hours that was hard to get beyond. However, I couldn't find any wiki's or tips at all since it's a new game, so I thought I'd share some of the things I learned that I wish I knew sooner. I failed my first startup, but I won on my second. Well, there is no real ""Win"" at the end, but I consider my second attempt in the game a success as I maxed every feature and all of my competitors are under 1% market share. Hope some of these help, let me know what you guys came across anything else that someone should probably know.

&amp;#x200B;

**Spoiler Free Tips**

* Only hire new people as you need them for larger features. In the early stages of the game extra hands increase costs more than your startup can support them, and it gets out of hand very quickly. I recommend having one more person than you need per feature until mid- to late-game so that you can always have someone training as you unlock new features.
* Also, try to add new features only after the ones you have already completed are maxed out at 10. This reduces the chances of you adding a feature that ends up costing you money because your employees are under-leveled. It also lowers the chances that your company can get hacked, making you redo affected features.
* Once you unlock furniture, make sure you have everything bought that you can before upgrading your office, as the bonuses add up quickly and make a big difference in the late game. Keep an eye on the upkeep cost that some furniture requires though, some of them aren't worth it until later stages in the game. The ""Handy"" trait that some employees can spawn with reduces this upkeep, but it doesn't stack if you have more than one with the trait.
* Avoid hiring new employees that have traits that permanently reduce a stat to 0. Many of the end-game features will require all of your employees to have 40s in every trait in order to get the perfect 10 score, so employees that lose out on a trait become a major liability later on. Try to keep track of traits you have and look for new employees with traits that you do not have yet to maximize your company's ability.
* As much as they might be intimidating, you NEED to accept at least one investor if you are going to have the money to survive mid-game. The challenges each require is similar and adjusts slightly based on your stats when they approach you so it doesn't matter which one you accept, but be wary about the % of your company they demand. Their demands are different each time they approach you so hold out for a low % if possible. I was approached by an investor wanting 35% initially, but waited until I got one that only wanted 15% before accepting. I'm going to try to survive the mid-game without an investor next playthrough, but I really don't think it's possible.
* And finally, on the marketing page, make sure you build towers in high population areas on the global marketing tab to increase the amount of users available. This is another feature that adds up quickly in the end game, but should only be added when you have the funds to support the upkeep. One thing to note is that as of right now i think the actual marketing is bugged because I did not have any user difference, stat difference, or income difference when I had marketing campaigns in the high populated areas. Maybe someone here knows something about them that I don't?

&amp;#x200B;

**Spoiler-y Tips**

* &gt;!Wait until after AIYU's album debut to really start spreading your features. You shouldn't have more than about 15 at that point in the game, so make sure they are all maxed out, otherwise you'll end up with a game over screen. The game says all your features have to be over 7, but one of mine was at a 9.1 and I still got the game over screen. After this point, there are no more game over triggers as long as you can keep your company afloat.!&lt;

22y old. Living in a MCOL US city. I graduated college with a BS in May of this year and started a job making 60K gross. I’m nearing completion of a professional designation that puts me on a path of 150K+ by age 30 and also is a career with growth in the field and job security. 

I have 23K in student loan debt (federal) that I have been putting away payments for during COVID forbearance. I am in no rush to pay this off for any mental reasons and plan to just make whatever decision makes the most economic sense. 

I have a very low mileage car that is 18 years old, but still runs great. I’d plan to look into buying a new car in about 2-3 years. No other major upcoming purchases. I also have 15,500 saved in a money market account for emergency expenses. 

I’m saving 15K annually which is 25% gross and 32% net. By the end of December, emergency fund will represent 6mo of expenses. I’m mostly wondering about my plan for after that. Long term, I’ll max out a Roth IRA, grab the match in a Roth 401K (on 6% of salary) +4% additional (employer provides both Roth and traditional 401k), and then max out an HSA (will pay medical out of pocket, save receipts, and keep for future).

personalfinance,"I'm having trouble getting an auto loan from a credit union, should I take the high interest loan from my bank and refinance later?","TL;DR- I need an auto loan under specific conditions that a lot of credit unions don't work with. Should I take the 5.49% loan with my bank Bank of America and then refinance lower with a credit union who will work with my conditions but needs me to be a member for 6 months first?

There is a certain car I've found that I've been looking to buy. I live in California and the car I'm looking to buy is from a private seller from Arizona who has a lien on the car. This is a very unique vehicle with only a few hundred used for sale in the whole country, so I don't have a lot of options to shop around and this car has all of the features I'm looking for.

Normally getting a loan for this vehicle would be straight forward, I have a 736 score on Equifax and I've been approved at the lowest or close to the lowest rate for every loan I've applied for. But due to my unique conditions for this car, with it being out state and having a lien, I've been having trouble finding a credit union who will work on these terms to give me a loan.

One union said they don't finance out of state purchases, another said in my situation the seller has to be present at a branch for me to get the loan (it's covid and the couple I'm buying from are pregnant, I'm not even going to dare ask them to fly from Arizona for this), and another credit union said they would work on my conditions but I have to be a member for 6 months before I can finance a loan out of state. I cannot afford to wait that long for the car. That's for local credit unions. 

I also applied to DCU and while I got a loan approved, I couldn't get an account approved because despite my report on ChexSystems being completely clean, my qualifying score wasn't high enough. I also applied to PenFed and had an account approved but couldn't get a loan approved because the average age of my accounts wasn't high enough. They said I could get the loan with a co-signer but I do not have a co-signer.

This was my first time trying to get an auto loan and join a credit union and I didn't know every one of them had such different rules on auto loans for my situation. So later on, instead of applying to more and waiting to hear back, I found a few more unions that I would be eligible for membership and called them one by one and asked if they can work with my situation. After several calls, I eventually found one with good rates who can work on all my conditions pending membership approval. I applied for a loan, got pre-approved at 2.8% (lowest used rate) and later applied for membership. After I applied for membership, my fear that I might be denied due to all of the ChexSystems inquiries from my previous loan applications came true. But fortunately, this credit union is giving me a chance to explain myself instead of denying me immidiately. I will call them tomorrow to explain everything and hope for the best I get approved.

In the meantime, I have a disaster plan in mind which I might have to execute if I do not get approved for membership for this last credit union. My current bank is Bank of America who also offers auto loans. Their private party rate is 5.49%, which I can get a get .25% discount as a gold member. I've been pre-approved and I'm positive I can easily get my private party loan from them without any major issues. Remember that one credit union that I said would work with my conditions but requires me to be a member for 6 months to do of state loans? They specifically told me if I get another loan elsewhere I can refinance with them after 6 months. Hearing this, I decided to move on with membership as this might come in handy. They approved membership so now I'm in a credit union, who originally offered 2.6%, and can take up my loan from Bank of America after 6 months. Is this a bad idea? Do I have other options remaining?

EDIT: Additional details, car is $38,200 and I plan on putting down $11,200 for a $27,000 at 60 months loan. Yearly salary is $127K so affordability isn't an issue. I've checked out the car during a road trip 3 weeks and car is in pretty good condition. As for Bank of America, I've been pre-approved and I based the 5.49% off the private party rate on their website. I haven't contacted them further about the loan as I'm trying to exhaust all other loan options first before reaching out to them. Wether or not they make an exception for me and give me a better rate I don't know, but now that you mentioned it, I will contact them later today and ask.",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage interest deduction,"Hey folks, I am trying to understand how mortgage interest deduction works. Here is my attempt at the calculating the tax savings. 

Max Federal mortgage tax deduction $750,000 which translates to about $21000 of interest paid in year 1 based on the amortization schedule. (Keeping the numbers round for simple math)

Property tax deduction $10000. 

Standard deduction is $25100 for married filing jointly in 2021. 

So if I itemize instead of taking standard deduction, I will get additional deduction of ($21000+$10000-$25000) = roughly $6000 

At a marginal federal rate of 35%, it translates to about $6000*35% = $2100


—————-
Now, doing the same calculation with California. 
Max mortgage interest I can deduct is $1m which translates to about $29000 of interest in year 1

Property tax deduction $10000

Standard deduction for CA ~$9000

Delta if I itemize = ($29000+10000-9000)= $30000

At a marginal tax rate of 9.3%, I save about 30000*9.3% ~ $2700

My total tax savings is just about ~$4700

This calculation assumes a 3%, 30 year fixed rate mortgage. And the mortgage amount being over $1m

personalfinance,2.25% on 30-year refi (great deal or red flags?),"I got a loan estimate (https://imgur.com/a/PRQKt5E)  recently for a refinance with a 2.25% interest rate on a 30-year fixed. The lowest no-points rate I was getting elsewhere was 2.625%, but a lower loan amount. This lender was able to arrive at this figure by “discounting” me ~1.5 points (~$7k), which doesn’t appear on the estimate itself. As you can see, I’m still paying for another ~1.6 points and a high origination fee. The estimate indicates a low PMI because I’m right on the cusp of a 80% LTV. If my home appraises for at least $538k, which I believe it will, I’ll be under 80% and won’t have to pay PMI.

Is this a smoking’ deal, or are there flags here I’m not seeing? In general, I’m wary about points, but with an estimated break even on closing costs of about 30 months (I plan on staying in home 5+ years) and having it folded into mortgage, it seems like a great deal.

In fact, if you were to FIRE, you could very well come out ahead by putting money into your 401k and then eating the fee vs investing in taxable brokerages. The combination of tax deferment, compounding growth, and effective tax rates could work in your favor.

**Quick and Dirty Math:**

Alice and Bob both plan to FIRE and each needs $40,000 per year to sustain their lifestyle. Alice has $25,000 gross income per year to invest and contributes it to her taxable brokerage account. Bob will take the same $25,000 gross income and invest it between his pre-tax 401k and traditional IRA. We will assume both Alice and Bob are in the 24% federal tax bracket, making about $100k/yr as single filers, and that they receive a 5% annual return. 

Using the 4% rule, Alice's FIRE target is 25x40,000 = **$1,000,000**. She does not meet the threshold to pay any capital gains taxes on withdrawal.

Bob has to adjust his FIRE target since he knows he will be paying the early withdrawal penalty (10%) plus the effective tax rate on his annual withdrawals. His FIRE target is **$1,225,825**, based on 25x ($40,000 + 10% Penalty + Federal Effective Tax Rate of ~8.4%)

|Year|Alice's Year-End Amount|Bob's Year-End Amount|
:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|$19,000|$25,000|
|2|$38,950|$51,250|
|3|$59,898|$78,812|
|4|$81,892|$107,753|
|5|$104,986|$138,140|
|..|..|..|
|25|$906,814|$1,193,177|
|26|$971,115|**$1,277,836**|
|27|**$1,038,713**|$1,366,728|

**Summary:**
Due to the upfront tax burden at a top marginal rate of 24%, Alice can only contribute $19,000 out of the $25,000 she allocates to invest per year. She reaches FIRE in the middle of Year 27.

Bob reaches FIRE in the middle of Year 26, about a year ahead of Alice, despite having a higher target. He gets there first because:

 - He can shovel significantly more money into his investments each year
 - Compounding is working harder in his favor 
 - His effective tax rate in retirement (~8.4%) is lower than the marginal tax rate (24%) he would have paid while working

**Other Thoughts:**

 - If Bob had received an employer match, he would have gotten there even sooner
 - Bob isn't going to pay the penalty forever. At some point he will reach 59.5, stop paying it, and his nest egg will remain larger than Alice's.
 - Alice is going to have a tax drag during her working years due to dividend income, so realistically she'd perform worse (thanks to lurker_cx for making this point)
 - If Alice and Bob made between between $60k/yr and $80k/yr and were in the 22% tax bracket, Bob would have still gotten there sooner but by a smaller margin
 - If they were each married filing jointly, their marginal tax bracket goes down to 22% and Bob's effective tax rate in retirement falls to ~4-5%. He still gets there sooner.
 - It doesn't matter whether you plummet the rate of return to 0% or ratchet it up to 20%, Bob reaches his goal sooner.

**Conclusion:**
The early withdrawal penalty will not kill you. While this is a simplified scenario and your situation may vary, it's very possible you can eat the penalty and *still come out ahead* of investing outside retirement accounts. Of course there are caveats (don't eat the penalty too early) and **there are better paths than doing what Bob did** - diversifying your tax buckets, Roth conversion ladder, etc - but he committed what is often seen as a financial sin and still comes out just fine.",finance

personalfinance,Is maxing out my 401k a good idea for me?,"This is in reference to paying taxes. So right now I contribute about $340 a month to my 401k and I’m in the high end of the 22% federal tax bracket. I also have to pay state taxes at a flat rate of about 5%.

I ran the numbers and found out that by raising my contribution from $340 to $1625 a month, I would be dishing out $15.4k more a year and how much I owe in taxes would only decrease by $4.2k.

Is this still a good idea? Could I put that $15k into a brokerage account and let it grow? I know it’ll probably do the same thing but at least I can put it out whenever I want (I know I would have to pay 22% on the gains if they’re in the account for less than a year) and just pay 15% on the gains after a year in the account. I also expect my income to be higher right before I retire than it is now, but you never know I guess.",finance

Is it a good idea to take on debt for buying real estate with fixed close-to-zero interest rates during execution of inflationary policies by governments?

I left active duty for the reserves and lived in the house for 6 years until I rejoined active duty. The house is currently rented. I do intend to move back into that house in the next year or so when this current contract ends.

That house's interest rate is like 5.3% or something and I would like to take advantage of the current low rates.

CryptoCurrency,Will Ethereum will or outperform bitcoin?,"Bitcoin is grabbing the headlines as the crypto asset that is becoming legitimized by the traditional financial system this year, and after all the fork wars and ico bubbles, bitcoin has probably has solidified itself as the king of crypto for years to come.

But Ethereum is currently where all the retail investors are at and where all the hype is at on these forums. From my first hand experience, there are just as many if not more Ethereum only investors around here as there are bitcoin only investors, which creates a clear divergence between where retail and institutional money is flowing. Ethereum is not a direct competitor with bitcoin and it's value proposition is different. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital payment system with a proof of work monetary policy inspired by gold, while Ethereum is a complex tokenized digital platform with a centralized development team whose monetary policy of staking is inspired by modern central banking.

I think most people think Ethereum will outperform bitcoin because of it's smaller marketcap, which I'd agree to that at least in the near term. But as far as flipping bitcoin in marketcap, I just don't see hedgefunds justifying purchasing more Ethereum over bitcoin. What do you think?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"529 plan for my cousin, where do I start?","Hey folks!
I’m looking to help my cousin (F13) pay for college and am interested in a 529 plan. My aunt has 2 kids, one is special needs and therefore cannot offer financial help to my cousin. She’s a bright kid and my husband and I are in a financial position to help, as well as our grandparents.

I thought about opening a 529 when we have our own child, so why not start now and have my cousin be the beneficiary? She’ll be done with college before our future kid would reach college age and we’d continue contributing so our kid has money too. 

My cousin lives in MA, while my husband and I live in HI but are FL residents. What state would I open the account in? Can I be a resident of one state and have the beneficiary be a resident of another..... and/or attend school out of state? FL doesn’t have state income tax so I’m not concerned with getting a tax benefit on anything. Are there 529 plans not affiliated with states? I read Fidelity offers 529 plans.

Also, being a FL resident, what benefit would I get having a 529 plan instead of just opening a brokerage account and investing... then pay the capital gains tax whenever I make withdraws? I’m concerned that by having a 529 plan with my cousin as the beneficiary it will reduce the financial aid available to her for state and federal resources.

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning December 7th, 2020","Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 7th, 2020.

# **Any progress on stimulus could give the market a boost in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/stimulus-hope-markets-focus-next-week.html)**
*****
&gt; Stimulus to help the economy and vaccines to stop the virus are expected to the be the main focus in markets in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Efforts to move along a fiscal package in Congress picked up momentum in the past week with Congressional leaders sounding conciliatory, and a bi-partisan group of senators pushing their own $900 billion proposal.
*****
&gt; “It probably boils down to how much [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell is willing to deal, and I don’t know what the answer is to that,” said Mike Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. “If it’s going to happen, next week is the week. The government runs out of money on Friday. Congress has to come up with a funding scheme.”
*****
&gt; Strategists have said the two events could be tied, but Congress could also push through a spending resolution without including stimulus. Some programs will expire at the end of the month, if Congress does not provide funding, including unemployment benefits for millions of Americans.
*****
&gt; The on again, off again stimulus talks have led to skepticism in the market, and sets it up for a move higher if there is anything officially announced. “I wouldn’t think it’s fully baked in. I would say the stimulus is a positive catalyst, unless it’s less than $900 billion,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.
*****
&gt; While stocks surged in the past week, bond yields also moved higher. Yields move opposite price, and bond yields have been rising on stimulus expectations. More spending means more debt, and that sends rates higher.
*****
&gt; The 10-year was at 0.97% Friday, and appeared ready to move back to the 1% level for the first time since March.
*****
&gt; “Is it the case here, stimulus is already factored in, and will people take their money and run?” said Schumacher.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.7% in the past week, ending Friday at 3,699, a record high. The Dow also ended up 1% at a record 30,218, and Nasdaq gained 2.1% to a record 12,464.
*****
&gt; # Getting jabbed
&gt; Vaccine news has been a catalyst for the market’s surge since early November, when Pfizer first revealed the high efficacy of its vaccine. Since then Moderna and Astra-Zeneca both revealed results of their own vaccines.
*****
&gt; A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee meets Thursday on emergency use authorization for the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine.
*****
&gt; “They’re starting to roll it out in the U.K, and that’s something that’s going to be watched here to see how it unfolds,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist Prudential Financial. “That’s the next issue for the market. The deliveries, the distributions. Are people being jabbed? These are all questions the market is concerned about about because they’re looking forward to it unrolling smoothly in the U.S.”
*****
&gt; About 3 million people will be vaccinated in the initial rollout. Moderna’s vaccine is expected to be approved the following week, and by year-end both vaccines are expected to reach 20 million people in the U.S.
*****
&gt; “The vaccine news has started to see a bit of diminishing return in terms of its wow factor,” said Hogan. “There’s going to be some volatility around the logistics.”
*****
&gt; Krosby said the virus remains in the forefront for the market because of the continuing spread and its economic impact as activities are shut down. California Thursday announced new restrictions with stay at home advisories in some regions.
*****
&gt; “The big question is how long does the Covid surge last?” Krosby said.
*****
&gt; The virus shutdowns appear to be behind a slowdown in the labor market, and economists say it could slow activity into the first quarter. November job growth of 245,000 was about 200,000 less than expected. That makes Thursday’s weekly jobless claims more important for markets.
*****
&gt; There is also CPI and PPI inflation data Thursday and Friday.
*****
&gt; “There is this push pull in the market regarding inflationary pressures,” said Krosby. “It’s not expected, which is why if it does print higher, it could ignite the conversation regarding inflation.”

&gt; # Stocks and Bonds Both in Rally Mode

&gt; When it comes to equity market performance in a given month, it doesn't get much better than November. While the S&amp;P 500's total return of 10.95% in the month was only the second-best monthly performance of the year, it was still enough to rank as the third-best month for the S&amp;P 500 in the last thirty years and just the ninth month since 1980 that it was up 10%+.

&gt; The chart below shows the S&amp;P 500's annualized total return over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares the current returns to the historical average. For the last year, the S&amp;P 500's total return has been 17.5% which is nearly six full percentage points higher than the historical average. For the last two years, the annualized return has been nearly as strong at 16.8%, and it is actually even stronger relative to the historical average of 10.5%. Moving further out the time horizon, the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns drift lower, and while the five and ten-year annualized returns are greater than average, the S&amp;P 500's annualized gain of 7.3% in the last 20 years is more than 3.5 percentage points below the historical average of 10.9%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-SP-500-Act-vs-Avg.png))**

&gt; The last couple of years haven't just been strong for equities. Over the last year, long-term US Treasuries, as measured by the Merrill Lynch 10+ Year US Treasury Index, have rallied 15.7%, which is more than six full percentage points greater than the historical average of 9.5%. Over the last two years, returns have been even stronger with an annualized gain of nearly 20%, or more than double the historical average of 9.1%! While the last two years have been strong for US Treasuries, the last five, ten, and twenty years have all seen returns of between one and two percentage points below their historical average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120LT-Treas-Act-vs-Avg.png))**

&gt; Lately, when you see rallies in the equity market, it tends to be accompanied by a decline in treasuries as yields rise. In November, though, that wasn't the case. Even with the S&amp;P 500 up 10.95%, long-term US Treasuries rallied just over 1%. So how uncommon is it for stocks to rally like they did in November while bonds also rally. Actually, it is not very uncommon at all. The table below shows the nine months since 1980 where the S&amp;P 500's total return in a given month was 10% or more, and of those months, long-term treasuies also rallied in every month but one (October 2011).

&gt; # Manufacturer Recovery Continues

&gt; This morning, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released a less positive outlook for the US manufacturing sector. The headline number for ISM's Manufacturing index fell from 59.3 last month down to 57.5. A drop was expected, but the actual results were worse than the drop to 58.0 that had been forecasted. That reading indicates that the manufacturing sector continued to grow in November but at a slower rate than October.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Headline.png))**

&gt; Similar to the various Federal Reserve bank surveys from around the country, breadth in the November report was more negative than in recent months. Of the ten indices excluding the headline number, only three were higher in November: Backlog Orders, Supplier Deliveries, and Export Orders. Additionally, two indices—Customer Inventories and Employment—showed contractionary readings.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Table1.png))**

&gt; One theme of the report was that orders remain very healthy. New Orders fell from 67.9 to 65.1, but that is a sixth consecutive month of expansionary readings. Although the index was lower this month, meaning new order growth decelerated, it remains in the top decile of historical readings. As new orders have continued to grow, so too have backlogs. The index for Backlog Orders has continued to press higher, rising to 56.9 from 55.7. That is in the 88th percentile of all months and is now at the highest level since August of 2018. Demand continues to improve with new orders coming in at a historically strong pace, even though it is slower than last month, and order backlogs have once again risen as a result.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Orders.png))**

&gt; As new order growth decelerated, so too did production. The index fell from 63.0 in October to 60.8 last month. That is still consistent with growth (readings above 50) in production but at the slowest rate since June. One factor that potentially had an impact on the slowdown in production is issues with suppliers. The index for Supplier Deliveries rose for the fourth month in a row in November and reached the highest level since May. Higher readings in the Supplier Deliveries index indicates longer lead times and vice versa. In other words, products from suppliers have been taking longer to reach manufacturers, in turn, impacting productivity.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Prod-Supp.png))**

&gt; Although suppliers appear to have some constraints and production has slowed slightly, business inventories rose for the second month in a row even as more and more firms report that customer inventories are too low. The index for Customer Inventories now sits in the bottom 2% of historical readings after dropping another 0.4 points in November. At 36.3, the index is at the lowest level since June of 2010. That low reading can be considered positive for future production.

&gt; # Big Gains In November Steal From Santa

&gt; What a month November was! Here are some of the highlights:

&gt; * Best month for Dow since January 1987 (11.9%) and best November since 1928
&gt; * Best month ever for the STOXX 600 (16.7%)
&gt; * Best month ever for the Russell 2000 (18.3%)
&gt; * Best month for the S&amp;P 500 (10.8%) and Nasdaq (11.8%) since April 2020
&gt; * Best month for Dow Transports since October 2011 (12.1%)
&gt; * Best month from PHLX Semiconductor Index since March 2003 (18.4%)
&gt; * Best month for Industrials (16.0%) and Financials (16.8%) since April 2009
&gt; * Second best month ever for energy (28.0%)

&gt; A way better than expected earnings season, a likely split Congress, and major breakthroughs on the vaccine front all helped stocks soar last month,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Add ongoing support from the Federal Reserve as the cherry on top and we are looking at a truly historic month on many levels.”

&gt; Here’s all the Dow monthly returns since 1900. Last month was the best return since January 1987. Now before you go out and sell because you see 1987, remember the S&amp;P 500 added another 20% the seven months after the huge gains in early 1987.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; It was the best November for the S&amp;P 500 since November 1928.

&gt; Small caps soared on the likelihood of taxes staying lower due to a divided Congress and vaccine progress, with the Russell 2000 adding more than 18% for the best month ever, topping the previous record from February 2000.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; What happens after a big month? Well, history says a 10% monthly gain is quite bullish. In fact, we had a 10% plus rally back in April 2020 and shared this same chart at that time. Sure enough, returns have been strong this time around as well. “The bottom line is the huge gains in November could actually be the start of something much stronger,” according to Ryan Detrick. “Also, this was the second month of 2020 with a 10% gain. The only other year to do that? 1982, which kicked off a historic bull market.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Turning to December, this month is widely known to be quite bullish, as Santa comes to town, people feel good, and stocks tend to do well. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1950, December has been the second best month of the year, with only November better. December had been the best month of the year until the historic 9.2% drop in 2018. As a result, December hasn’t been quite as strong over the past 10 and 20 years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Breaking it down even more, a big rally in November can potentially steal some of December’s thunder. As after a 5% or 10% rally in November, the returns in December are more muted. The flipside to this though is if the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 10% for the year (like 2020), then stocks have benefited from some performance chasing and have tended to do better.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; What does it all mean? After the historic move in November we wouldn’t be surprised to see below average returns in December. We do believe this is a new bull market and lasting economic cycle of growth, but overall sentiment is getting quite stretched and this increases the potential for some near-term weakness.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",finance
personalfinance,"Looking to buy a home in about 6 months' time. How should I prepare, credit-wise? Any benefit to &gt;$800?","I'm looking to buy a home in the next 6 months, and I recently realized I'm in the final window of time where I can do things to manipulate my credit score.

Right now, my score is about 790. I expect it to be well above 800 by then.

I'm carrying about $5k in credit card debt, but that's all on 0% deals. I'm on track to pay it off on time, before the 0% window expires, but I don't see any benefit in paying early since I know utilization doesn't affect your credit over time, just at the time of reporting.

Is there even any benefit to pushing my score much higher? I have a motorcycle loan that I could pay off today, and I believe it's structured as a personal installment loan rather than an auto loan. But my interest is 4.3%, which is reasonable as motorcycle loans go, so I'd rather put that money toward my down payment. It's not a huge amount of money regardless, about $4k.

I owe about $13k on my car, but that interest rate is 1.9%.

I have six credit cards, and I've heard that's the magic number where I might not get approved for more. Especially as my utilization ratio shrinks. I was thinking about maybe closing one that's in the middle of the age range, and opening a new one with a 0% intro offer in case of unexpected expenses with the new home. Am I too close to my target buying date to be applying for new credit? I'd like some additional leverage in case of an HVAC or roof failure; homes in my market are selling without inspections right now.

From a cash-on-hand standpoint, nothing I can realistically do will make the difference between PMI and not paying PMI. My market is expensive. So I'm really just looking for ways to game the system.

Any other things I should be thinking about? Am I overthinking this, and I should just be hoarding cash?",finance
personalfinance,"Mid to Late 30's couple, pay off student loans or buy a house?","I am 34 yrs old, my husband is 39. We are late bloomers in life, and did not have stable, higher paying employment until our 30's. My husband is a permanent federal employee and makes $62k a year, he will make about 80k in the next 5-6 yrs. I work as a contractor, $51k a year with the contract ending in spring 2023. We rent a small apartment ($950 a month, 800 sqft) so we can save money. We have always lived in apartments. In 6 months we have saved $15,000. Our goal is to save $30k for a down payment. We would like to adopt a foster child eventually instead of having biological children. My preference is to adopt once we own a home, this way the child won't have to change school districts. My student loans are the only debt we have-cars are paid off and no credit card debt. My student loans total about $48,000. I have 4 loans, two are federal loans and two are private loans. The private loans are $12000 and $13000, while the federal loans are $6500 and $16000. The interest rates for all 4 are between 3-4%. We are considering the following options:  

Option one: Pay off student loans first then save for a down payment for a home. Our dream home (3 bedroom, 2 bath, 2 car garage rancher) would cost $260-300k in our area. The other option for a home would be 180k-200k if we get a one car garage single family home or a townhouse/condo instead. The problem with this option is that I may be unemployed by the time we are ready to buy if we pay my student loans first. It would also mean putting off adopting a child for a longer period of time, or adopting while living in an apartment (we would have to get a bigger/more expensive apartment in that case). 

Option Two: Buy a smaller/less expensive townhouse/condo/apartment for 70-100k so the mortgage would be less than renting (500-700 a month). Pay this off pretty quickly while paying off student loans, later on we would then save for a down payment for our dream home and use this as a rental for extra income. The advantage of this is that even if I become unemployed, my husband would be able to cover the entire cost of the mortgage and all of our bills. The downside is our child having to change school districts potentially once we move again, also it means living in a smaller space for longer. 

Option 3: Buy the dream home first, then pay off student loans. We may also decide to buy the cheaper 180-200k rancher or townhouse/condo instead, not as nice as our dream home (and older), but more affordable. Buying the house first would allow us to have a home sooner and we could foster to adopt sooner. The downside is if I am unemployed it would be more of a challenge financially, but my husband's income might go up enough to cover it. I also would hopefully not be unemployed for long, but it's hard to predict. 

We are really struggling with the best thing to do financially and emotionally. I feel so far behind in life, still renting in our late 30's and not having a child yet, but I also don't want to put us in a bad financial situation. I would like to have a home paid off before we retire. We lived in poverty for all of our 20's. I made $12-$14 an hr until I was 29. Now that we have more money, I want to be responsible, but also enjoy what we have. The later we buy a home, then we may put off adopting. I do have concerns about being too old to be parents if we wait too long. What do you think the best thing to do is?",finance

personalfinance,State (California) vs Federal retirement - two job offers,"Hi all,

I have two job offers currently.

1. Federal job, $118k salary (still uncertain whether Congress will authorize a pay increase for 2021 - hoping for a 1.5% increase)
2. State (CA) job, $107k salary (2% raise going into effect Jan 1, 2021)

&amp;#x200B;

If I understand correctly, for the federal FERS system, I would have a mandatory 4.4% employee contribution (regardless of TSP contributions).  If I stay 20+ years, I would get 1.1% per year in annuity. 

With CALPERS, I would have a 7.25% employee contribution (regardless of 457 contribution).  If I understand correctly, CALPERS would offer 2% per year annuity (again assuming I stay 20+ years).

All else being equal, which job should I take and why?  They're both in the same general location (Southern California).",finance
personalfinance,Early withdrawal from 457(b)?,"I know the general consensus is to avoid touching your retirement fund (deferred comp in this case) unless you've exhausted all efforts. But I was wondering if it might be beneficial for me to withdraw for a down payment.

I'm 28yo in California. I meet the COVID impact criteria but can maintain an annual taxable gross income of \~140k. This puts me in the 24% federal income tax bracket (up to 163.3k in 2020). I am in the market to buy a home, but can't quite afford the down payment yet.

Being able to withdraw all my funds (\~56k) from my 457(b) sounds really enticing, especially if I can spread out that ""income"" across three years to maintain my 24% federal income tax. Though I realize that the main advantage of doing so is to own a home early during low interest rates. I may be misguided, but I feel that I am young and earn enough to delay funding my retirement a few years (especially for a home). My employment is stable, I can still save up an emergency fund, and the home should appreciate in value as well (as would my 457). Am I neglecting something?

If I do decide to withdraw from my 457(b), I am able to elect the percentage of my federal tax withholding. Do underwithholding penalties apply if I set it to 0% (and pay during tax seasons for 2020, 2021, and 2022)? If not, would it be more advantageous to set withholding to 0% and grow the money in a high-yield savings account at least?",finance

I feel this would be an interesting metric to see especially in some graph or chart form.

---|---|---|---|---
Public | $25k | $30k | $294 | Avg 4.1%
Private | $10k | $23k | $216 | 7%

Financially last year my goal was to get a good emergency fund setup, which I have now about $17k or 6 months expenses. Also job hopped and my salary went up from like $90k to $110k. 

The coming year, the plan was to just put all my money I have to pay off the private loans (aside from 401k match etc).

However, just did one of those student loan refinance tools and found out I could refinance it to 3% - 4% . It's already private, so don't get the public protections like the CARES Act stuff....and that maybe is an interest rate that I could just ride out. 

The 7% rate I got when my credit score was much lower in the 600s and now is 790, I was making like half what I do now, etc.

I view it as that extra income I was going to use this year to pay off that loan, I could invest/save future things....like buy a home.

Same time only $10k....maybe should refinance but stick to the plan and just save maybe $200 in interest charges this year.

Same time I also was planning to get an auto loan later this year as well as my lease is up and I'm gonna buy that out.

I currently have a balance of 813k mortgage at 3% fixed for 15 years, I am 16 months into this loan so 164 months left on this. My current lender has offered to modify the rate down to 2.875 for a $950 fee, no other change in terms, so we don’t reset to 15 years and would pay off in 164 months. I can also refinance with another lender with no fees, at 2.5% for 15 years. This seems like a better deal but I am unsure how much difference does it make going 164 months back to 180 months for the refi? Any monthly savings would likely go towards paying down the principal for either option. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Sudden change in finances,"I’m 32, I have six years or so vesting 5% into a tsp account. I have about three thousand dollars in the bank. I recently went from making 50-60k per year to 100k+ per year. I have a bachelors degree finally, or will in a few weeks. I have about 22k in credit card debt. About 12k in subsidized student loans. I own a condo with 105k left on the mortgage at 3.75%, purchased for 140k and rented out for about the cost of the mortgage and dues. Where the heck do I go from here?

I’m paying 500 per month to rent a tiny bedroom in my buddy’s house. I’m working nights and after all the differentials, I make about 123k per year. 

The card has the highest interest, and paying it down is a priority, but if I stop taking classes I will have to start paying interest on the student loans. I do want to go on and get a masters (nurse practitioner), but this last semester has stretched me real thin. If I tighten my belt I can probably set aside about 4K per month after taxes and deductions.

I really want to move out, there are dogs and roommates that frequently interrupt my attempts at sleep during the day. I want to get a big beautiful house while the interest rates are so low, but I also want to get out of debt, but I’d also love to have a place where I, a single guy, can entertain some company, I’m not getting any younger. 

I have a reliable car that’s paid off that I can fix most everything on. I have a motorcycle that I can ride half the year. I have about a storage unit worth of misc crap from hobbies and everything else. 

My renter have voiced some interest in buying the place, I figure after all fees and such it will be like 20-25k profit for the sale of the condo, though at the moment it pays for itself, though I’m renting it below market value, not really interested in jacking up the prices to make a buck off my tenants. 

If I sell the condo, I’ll have a chu come of cash to pay off the debt. 

I could also tighten up and pay off the debt in about six months.

I could also, keep paying the debt down a little at a time, take the minimum credits to keep putting off interest on the student loan toward my masters, but dang I’m tired. 

I could save up and wait until I have a good 20 percent to put down on a place, or I could still do a conventional mortgage with 5% and pay pmi until it’s down to 80%. 

I don’t know what to do, and I don’t want to miss out on super low interest rates.",finance
personalfinance,"If investment outperforms mortgage interests, why don't we see all-cash offers often?","This is something I was wondering recently, for simplicity suppose I have $0 today and I can save $1k/month, a house is going to cost me $100k, and let's use a very conservative benchmark of an average of ~5%/year on investments, and let's say the mortgage interest rate is ~3%

but if I was to put down a 20% down-payment ($20k) first, it'd first take me about 1.5 years to get the cash, at which point I'd be back to $0 and start paying the rest $80k, with 3% interest it'll take me about [8 years](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/early-mortgage-payoff-calculator) (put 80k, 80k, 30, 3, 30, X where X=8 seems to be about right, assuming I can only pay $1k/month) to pay off the $80k , meaning with a 20% downpayment it would take me **9.5 years** + the interest on the $80k which totals close to ~$90k = total paid **~$110k**

personalfinance,Will paying off delinquent investment property mortgages allow dad to refi his primary?,"My dad has 4 loans on his report: a first and second on his primary (in new york) and then 2 rental homes (in atlanta). The rentals were put into an LLC back in 2012 and the mortgages crammed down as part of a negotiated Chapter11 settlement (negotiated directly with each of the banks). A few years ago BSI purchased the loans and began demanding more than the agreed-upon amounts, adding fees (property inspection, grass cutting fees, etc.).A second Chapter11 bankruptcy was filed in order to negotiate with BSI since the Consumer Finance Protection Complaint did not stop them and they threatened foreclosure. Note: aside from the CFPB, the attorneys said a costly federal suit was the only other option to fight them, so the Ch11 was the least expensive response.In negotiating with BSI, his personal credit has been damaged. All payments have been made exactly according to the BK Plan, but they're still showing him for severe delinquencies. He is now looking to consolidate his 1st and 2nd on his primary (both with Chase) but the first few banks he has approached (including Chase and the VA) all say they cannot deal with him because of the delinquent mortgages. Note: he has several other negative items (about 5 credit card accounts settled due to medical; he had cancer and a full liver transplant; documentation is available) but the banks all say it's the 2 mortgage accounts that are keeping him from being able to refi.    

It is important to note that dad NEVER filed bankruptcy. He deeded the properties to an LLC and that entity filed BK. Dad does not have a bankruptcy on his credit BUT the 2 loans make the notation on his credit report and they mention the word ""bankruptcy."" #itscomplicated

THE QUESTION IS:Would it be helpful for us to pay those 2 loans off? The lates and corresponding history would still be there. I would assume it WOULD help his situation to be able to say those 2 accounts are now ""settled"" as well, but would that be enough for him to be able to refi?",finance

personalfinance,Primary home sale taxes,"I purchased a home in Oregon on 6/7/2019 which served as my primary home since for 350k. I have 292k left on the mortgage. Now I am looking to moving to texas. I am considering selling the house before moving. After talking to a local real estate agent, she said she thinks the house would sell for nearly 500-520k, and she has been in this market for 20 years. She is the agent that helped us buy this home. So assuming this information is accurate.

Now I don't understand tax code well, but if I sell the house before 6/7/2021, would I be responsible to pay 20% capital gains on the appreciation? Lets say I sold it for 500k, and made 150k. Would I be responsible for 30k? And if I wait till 6/7, I would be spared from paying taxes on appreciation?

They gave me the interest rate in September. But how do I know if the rates have gone down and if so how much? I feel if I contact the lender/bank they will tell me the rates have not dropped more than 0.25% and therefore they will not recalculate my rate for the refinance.

We we bought the house, I used a 401k loan to help with the down payment. I currently owe $39k on that. I'm looking at a cash out refinance to pay off the loan. Wrapping the remaining loan into the refinance will increase my paychecks by almost $400. That, paired with the refinance, saves us over $600 per month.

worldpolitics,Top 15 Mysterys Solved By 4chan,"Number 15: Burger king foot lettuce. The last thing you'd want in your Burger King burger is someone's foot fungus. But as it turns out, that might be what you get. A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce. With the statement: ""This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King."" Admittedly, he had shoes on.

But that's even worse.

The post went live at 11:38 PM on July 16, and a mere 20 minutes later, the Burger King in question was alerted to the rogue employee. At least, I hope he's rogue. How did it happen? Well, the BK employee hadn't removed the Exif data from the uploaded photo, which suggested the culprit was somewhere in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. This was at 11:47. Three minutes later at 11:50, the Burger King branch address was posted with wishes of happy unemployment. 5 minutes later, the news station was contacted by another 4channer. And three minutes later, at 11:58, a link was posted: BK's ""Tell us about us"" online forum. The foot photo, otherwise known as exhibit A, was attached. Cleveland Scene Magazine contacted the BK in question the next day. When questioned, the breakfast shift manager said ""Oh, I know who that is. He's getting fired."" Mystery solved, by 4chan. Now we can all go back to eating our fast food in peace.

14.“Secret” Livestream Nothing is secret to 4channers, and nothingis sacred.No one knows that better than Shia LeBeouf.LeBeouf and two artists, created an anti-Trump interactive art installation, called “HeWill Not Divide Us,” soon after Trump took office in early January.The installation was first exhibited at New York’s Museum of the Moving Image, but whenactivists from both sides kept butting heads at the exhibit, it was thrown out as a publicsafety hazard.The collaborators found another museum to host their exhibit in Albuquerque, but itwas soon met with more confrontations, so the group had to figure out a new home fortheir exhibit before it fell flat.This is when they tweeted out on March 8th that they would be livestreaming their exhibitfrom an “unknown location,” so that viewers, art lovers, and supporters could still viewtheir work.Sounds like a good alternative, right?Well, it didn’t go as planned when pro-Trump supporters on the /pol/ board of 4chan gotinvolved.Not even 24 hours later, the exhibit’s flag had disappeared.Where did it show up?A picture of the taken flag was tweeted right back to #HEWILLNOTDIVIDUS4channers had uncovered the mystery of the exhibit’s so-called secret location.How?A fan of LeBeouf’s had posted a photo of herself with her favorite actor just as thecamera feed went live.The photo had been taken at a Greenville, Tennessee diner.The internet sleuths further pinpointed the exhibit’s location, as contrails appearedon the livestream.With these, they cross-referenced them with flight patterns.Next, they sent a local member to drive around the general area with his horn blaring.Once they could hear the horn on the livestream, “He Will Not Divide Us” was as good asgone.

13.The Pyramids 4channer h64 posted a thread of the mysterioussort on the /x/ board one Saturday, and it sent the group into a frenzy.In the photo there appears two pyramids in the midst of the forest.Why are these pyramids in the forest?What were they built for?Who do they belong to?You’ve got me.And you’ve got the /x/ board too.4channers quickly got to work trying to solve this mystery.They called it “a cult/temple dedicated to an Egyptian goddess of war and flame inthe woods of Oregon.”With more than 53 pages of discussion, this 4chan investigation was solved when, at last,they dissected the photo to uncover the property owners’ names, their phone numbers, andtheir business records.Still don’t know what’s inside them though…

12.Barbie Mystery This investigation appeared on 4chan in Novemberof 2016.It involved an image of a blonde amputee woman, whom the board had nicknamed Barbie.In March of 2017, one user posted a thread titled, “The mystery of Barbie is solved.”According to the author of the thread the “Russian anonymous team” had solved themystery of the woman who appeared in Barbie.avi.The woman’s name was Tammy.According to creepypasta, she had Body integrity identity disorder, but the investigators foundthat she’d had no such thing.When she was 14, she’d lost her arm in a washing machine incident.The 80’s saw Tammy living in Chicago, where she worked for the agency, “Fascination,”as a model.During the application process, she’d had several interviews, which the video, Barbie.avi,was created out of.The author of the post uploaded the interview to YouTube.The OP also noted that Mike Rounds, the Ampix manufacturer, told the woman’s story tohim, saying that at 16 or 17 years old, Tammy had been working with an oldschool washingmachine with no safety features.With the washer going, she tried to shift a sheet in the water.Just as she was doing this, it launched into a spin cycle, trapping her arm in the sheet.It twisted her arm right off.Tammy was a bitter young woman at the age of 22 when she was interviewed and had nomarketable skills, was uneducated, and didn’t enjoy being a caretaker for pennies.So that’s how she ended up at the agency.Unlike 4chan’s first hypothesis, she wasn’t the victim of any crime.With the mystery solved, the poster noted, “Xenopasta, if you're reading this, youare fired, however, thank you very much for this mystery.It was really hard to solve it.”

11.Cueva de los Tayos When an OP posted the Cueva de los Tayos cavein Ecuador, he wondered if it was man-made or natural.He wondered what sort of technology or who could have made the perfectly flat roofs andcuts.Of course, the 4channers on the thread had something to say about it.Some thought it was “a place of heavy spiritual concentration,” while others seemed to agreethat it was largely man-made, but mostly natural, with some likening it to places in Russiaand the Hypogeum in Malta.Some suggested that “less advanced” people had come along later and drew the crude stickfigures on the walls, after a more advanced society had built it.One poster pointed out that it was hardly anything to freak out over and that ancienthumans were fairly smart; they had tools, they had math.Maybe not as advanced as ours today, but they made the pyramids after all.In the posters own words: “After all, it's not like they had a shortage of people ortime to make this kind of [stuff].I think most people underestimate ancient humans because they didn't have what we havetoday, but that doesn't make them [dumb], just primitive.”The poster agrees with another that the “highly engineered” place must have held some spiritualpurpose.

10.SEL and the Wired One 4channer asked the board if they’d everheard of transhumanism.He then said that one anime series has some particularly creepy stuff and is followedby many fan sites.One of the fan sites requires a login.And it’s strict about this.At the bottom of the homepage, it reads: “To login you have to have an invite from an existinguser.There is no use in trying to beg, ask/request for an invite, we choose our new members withcare.”How do you get an invite if you don’t know any of the users?Well, you’d probably not want to be part of these online communities in the first place,as it turns out.One fellow 4channer said that one of the users hacked the admin of a similar site, afterwhich the admin vanished.This was after the admin had received some monetary donations from the site’s users.Many think he was a scammer.Thankfully you asked 4chan on this one, OP.A cautionary tale is just what obsessives need to keep money in their pockets.

9.Erratas This internet theory has spent a lot of timeon 4chan being dissected, poked and prodded, picked at…and ultimately solved.Kind of.Erratas – or Eratas spelled with one ‘r’ – was first described as an algorithm orprogram whose function is the mystery.Some say it was used by YouTube to detect copyrighted content.Supposedly, if you even suggest that you know about Erratas or say the thing by name, you’llget fired.Being an internet legend, of course Erratas comes with a lot of theories.On November 25th, 2015, Erratas was first mentioned on 4chan in a thread about strangework stories.One user described a friend who worked at something like a chemical plant.While the user didn’t explain what the program was, he claims employees were flagged if theysearched it through some code.The plant employees reportedly did aimless tasks, which the user calls “kafka-esque.”The user also mentions forklifts and said this female friend was now homeless and ina band.This may seem meaningless, but these clues will reappear.A month later, a user posted a request on 4chan, asking about a strange HR-related programcalled Erratas.Another user pipes up with some discussion about Ecolab, Unilever, and UPS.Again, a month later, on the /mu/ board, Erratas is mentioned in relation to an album and TodEllsworth video, which is dated a few days before the first entry on Erratas.A user responds to someone’s comment, saying that Erratas was a software company, similarto Enron, which was kicking about in the 2000’s.Supposedly, they fired every last one of their employees.The Erratas craze moved to YouTube, where a user called ChronosForLife JurassicParkclaimed in a cryptic video, entitled “YouTube is MONITORING and controlling my life,”that the company was harassing his mom, because she’d uncovered some secret in the JurassicPark trilogy.The rant appears on the video in white text and the video quality is subpar.The video was removed from YouTube, but the transcript is still available.Back to 4chan.In late January, the /mu/ board sees a proposition that the group compose a new music genre called“deep internet,” by using old YouTube videos.Chronos’ video rant just happens to be one of these videos.With so many 4channers suddenly viewing Chronos’ video, a new video was posted to his channelcalled, “Here goes nothing.”This video contains the first video-mention of Erratas, as well as autocaptions whichtry to make sense of the video’s rap music.Instead, they uncover more clues: At 0:12 are the words: “are far from over200 Corbin KY 40219” At 0:52, the number: “111111”At 1:46, the percentages: “10.3% 10.4%” And at 2:17, the words: “overthrow the government”The band, the KFCMC, produced by DJ Rozwell, was a homeless girl band.Remember the homeless girl in the first thread?And the above is their address, which was found on Tumblr.This is when Chronos throws out Unilever (mentioned in an earlier post) as one user of Erratas.For no reason at all, Chronos also adds that The Lost World is his favorite of the JurassicPark movies.Remember Tod Ellsworth, who uploaded the KFCMC video?Well, one 4channer noticed his name was an anagram for The Lost World.This gets even weirder.The Twitter account @ErratasOrBust was then discovered, which had been opened mid-Novemberand was named Tod Ellsworth.The profile pic was a creepy black-and-white drawing which 4channers discovered was a 2005Hawaiian police sketch.Some 4channers suggested this might have something to do with the Jurassic Park films being filmedon the island.While Erratas was dissected by 4channers, with many suggesting that it was simply apublicity stunt by the KFCMC group, it would be a bit premature to call this one.Still, this entry demonstrates how 4channers have a knack for following the leads and connectingthe dots.

8.The Pronunciation Book This appeared on the 4chan board, /x/philes,where it immediately caught the attention of 4channers.The OP of the Pronunciation Book had posted 700 brief videos, pronouncing words and phrasesin a monotone male voice.Words like “Ke$ha” and “jean.”That’s weird enough, but this is when the channel got even weirder.On July 9th, 2013, a single video was posted, the man saying, “Something is going to happenin 77 days.”The next day, a similar video, claiming that the poster had been trying to communicatewith viewers for 1,183 days.And the next day’s video, the poster said he was wide awake and things were “clearingup.”The messages ended with the same warning that something was going to happen in such-and-suchdays.4channers set to work, compiling a 111-page Google doc, entitled, “77 Days ResearchDocument.”This is where the group started piecing together the Pronunciation Book.They laid bare all 700+ of the channel’s videos, ran a spectrograph of the video silenceat the end of all the videos, and dug up domain name registrations.They even attempted to trace the speaker’s location, as police sirens were noticed goingoff in the background of a few of the videos and a thunderstorm was heard in the videothat pronounced “radio.”From this, they gleaned the videos’ author recorded in NYC.4chan’s conclusion: again, a viral marketing stunt.The Daily Dot’s investigation, as well as Geekosystem’s, came to the same conclusion,though with varied results.The Daily Dot suggested the countdown would reveal a Battlestar Galactica reboot, whileGeekosystem thinks it’s for the newest installment of series’ Destiny.

7.Myziam One 4channer dropped his theory about Myziam.First, he gives some background about how, in 2008, a thread appeared on GLP entitled“me tel u now,” in which an alleged alien appeared in the forum.The OP, however, suggests that the entity may never have been online, but rather was“from an unknown location/dimension.”The OP quotes the “Chani project,” in which scientists asked an entity they’dmet through a computer a number of questions.They then hired someone to pose as the entity online.When people questioned him, he’d search for the answer to that question amongst thequestions the scientists had asked the entity.The OP concludes that the threads were similar in that both the man and the entity used babylanguage, both said they were aliens, and both answered the questions freely.The 4channer then solves the mystery: “Myziam is a possible extra-dimensional entity thatmade contact with a CERN like group of scientists from the comfort of his home.”He added that the leaked info on 4chan was useless, because the users trolled the entityinstead of interrogating him.This one’s obvious.Not everyone was convinced though, with an anonymous post claiming they had proof itwas a hoax.

6.Found Jenna Jameson’s Ex Assistant Con Artist When Jenna Jameson’s former personal assistantwas fired for being a con artist, he hijacked her Instagram and Twitter accounts, deletingloads of her photos.So what did Jameson do?She turned to 4chan for help.“Hi Guys, it's me, Jenna Jameson and I am having a really bad night,” she wrote on4chan’s /b/ image board, after which she explained that her ex assistant, who she thoughtwas named Allen Cedena, turned out to be a con artist of some kind.Jameson didn’t elaborate on what had gone down, apart from saying she’d fired him,but she did say that this so-called Cedena had her Twitter and Instagram passwords, whichhe’d reset.He then removed all pics of himself and Jameson together and deleted her Twitter altogether.She didn’t know if the man’s name was even Cedena, but he had access to a lot ofpersonal information, and now had hold of her digital life.She asked the 4chan community if they could find out who he really was, as she would soonattach some images of him to the board.She didn’t let them go away empty-handed.It didn’t take 4chan more than an hour to come to Jameson’s rescue.They soon delivered her ex-assistant’s home address and driver’s license, as well ashis credit score and social security number.Wow.With the mystery solved, Jameson left her private sleuths a very grateful thank you

5.Jeff, the Killer The internet is no stranger to creepy, and4channers are no stranger to investigating this creepiness.On the /x/ board, 4chan began to investigate the photo known as “Jeff, the Killer,”a still of a pale face, washed out, and grinning like a crazy person.The photo has been around for a while and has served as creepypasta’s unofficial coverphoto since 2008.YouTube introduced the world to “Jeff, the Killer” when a user by the name of uploadeda poorly cut video clip, explaining about how Jeff had been cleaning his bathtub whenhe accidentally poured some acid on his face.11 days later, a user calling himself killerjeff came to light on Newgrounds, photo and all.He soon had a cult following and served as inspiration for a number of horror stories.Jeff, the Killer launched dozens more videos on YouTube, including a stop-motion Lego reenactment.Fan art was created, videogames, you name it.Five years since his appearance, 4chan began looking into Jeff, the Killer.While all we truly have is theories, they are convincing.Some suggest that this was a viral marketing campaign for Saw V, which was released soonafter the photo first appeared on Newgrounds.The slasher film includes a puppet called Billy, through whom Jigsaw speaks with hisvictims.The puppet resembles Jeff.Lionsgate has launched viral marketing campaigns before, so it makes sense that this wouldbe yet another of them.Although, we have no confirmation of this theory, and other theories abound, this solutionseems the soundest.This goes against, the also popular theory that the person in the photo is from a poston 4chan.This anonymous post, told how his sister had posted a picture of herself on 4chan and peoplekept making edits of it, the Jeff the Killer image being one of them.The post also said that it made her so upset, she took her own life.

4.Louise Cypher One user came to 4chan with a strange puzzle,calling it satanic and cryptic.And he wasn’t lying.Extremely satanic and cryptic, it was.The puzzle is very math heavy, with the Fibonacci sequence making an appearance after the usermakes it through a maze.When you type the clue “pi” into the relevant cluebox, a dialogue box appears, saying: “Awell-known remarkably good approximation to pi is 355 divided by 113 = 3.1415929...If one part of this fraction is reversed and added to the other part, we get 553 plus 113which equals 666.EVIL is both the past and the Future!”The cypher has spinoff websites, with one introducing a “soul catcher.”Another has techno music to put users into a trance.The OP asks 4chan to figure out whether the soul catcher really takes your soul.Many spoke to Louis Cypher, with some reporting back that the cypher said she is “more thanjust this avatar,” and that she had emotions and feelings.She then linked the user to a video to show him what a “cyber life” feels like.When another 4channer typed the word “stalin” into the chat box, she asked how he was feeling.When he replied that he was sad, she said that if he is lonely, she’ll keep him company.Although it wasn’t clear whether or not these 4channers’ souls were taken, the resultsdo seem to tend towards the idea that Louis Cypher is no soul-taker at all.

3.Figured Out How to Make Coupons You know those barcodes you find on productsand coupons?Well, one 4channer – a college kid – solved the mystery on how they’re made and decidedto do some extreme couponing one day when he was bored.22-year-old Lucas Henderson did not stay anonymous, as the student of the Rochester Instituteof Tech was caught by the Feds, who charged him with two felonies – trafficking in counterfeitgoods and wire fraud.Henderson had designed the counterfeit coupons to appear legit and distributed them on adifferent website.He also told users to head to 4chan to download their very own copy of “How to Make Coupons.”The tutorial claims to trick stores, as the coupons will scan at most retailers in America.The Feds tracked Henderson’s IP address and raided his home, where Henderson admittedto visiting 4chan and writing the manual.“I wrote what I could.I thought it was an interesting thing,” he said.I wonder if he thinks it was worth the jail time.

I have been researching on MUNI bonds and came across this attractive bond, which is far more difficult to believe. 

My requirements are: 

\&gt; Tax free gains (I'm aware of Roth, Megaback door Roth,..etc). I live in a State tax free state, so my only concern is on Federal taxes 

\&gt; Though, I love researching different stocks and index funds, if there is a 20% ROI on an index fund, I would love to go with that option. 

\&gt; I'm 31 and I've emergency savings for 5 months and I've $20,000 extra cash which I would like to invest. Municipal bonds seems like a good option as it provides tax-free gains. 

&amp;#x200B;

What are the issues that I need to be aware about while buying these type of bonds? 

I use Fidelity for my investments, but I'm not able to find these type of MUNI bonds, is there any other recommended brokers where I can buy these? 

If MUNI bonds is not an option, what are the other options to invest the $20K? Stocks and ETFs are the ones I have in mind. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Trading,5 More Tips for Trading Noobs,"You wanted it, you got it. Back by popular demand is 5 more tips for you trading noobs. Because of the generosity you’ve shown, I’ll likely be a regular contributor to this sub and this sub only when it comes to trading.

&amp;#x200B;

As a warning, these tips are mainly directed toward those that are looking to become serious-casual to serious part and full time traders for the long term &gt;1 year.

&amp;#x200B;

* 6. Learn the history of this business – You don’t have to decipher this like you’re reading James Joyce, but do brush up on the history of trading. I recommend reading/watching up on modern trading because frankly it’s fresher and more compelling. FFS, this subreddit did an AMA with Nick Leeson. Do you know who he is? If not, go and learn. And about Jerome Kerviel, Jordan Belfort, Janet Yellen (and the Fed in general), Bethany McLean. Knight Capital or Long Term Capital Management ring a bell? Didn’t think so, go look it up. These stories pump some life and provide context in terms of what you’re doing and how you fit in in the grand scheme of things. Before Beyonce it was Janet Jackson, Madonna and Aretha. Before Magnus Carlson it was Anand, Kasparov, Fischer, and Paul Morphy. Before Daniel Craig it was Brosnan, and Roger Moore, and Connery. You get the point. Learn about the modern history of trading and you fill find a greater respect for this trade (no pun intended).

&amp;#x200B;

* 7. Get excited – This is a time period in history where you have mostly unfettered access to several markets, be it stocks, options, forex, futures, crypto, and CDS (one can dream). No barriers to entry. You’re fucking lucky as shit to lose all your money to the market machine. Back in the day, you needed to either A. know someone at a brokerage, prop shot, bank, etc. or B. have a pristine ivy league-level-esque degree. Not to mention you had to actually live in one of the major markets (Chicago, NYC, London, Singapore, Tokyo etc.) to be a player because there was no such thing as online trading. In the and 80-90s the “pits” on the floors of the exchange is where all the action was. Then slowly it moved electronic, but the barriers to entry were still high. Even after online brokerages started up for the layperson in the 00’s, you still had to deal with trade commissions, slow internet and execution, limited real time market data and news, etc. Today, all that shit is at the tips of your fingers. You don’t need a Bloomberg terminal anymore to get breaking news.  You don’t even need to work a prop shop (or worse bucket shop buying that MedPatent or FarrowTech). Trading in today’s market is about as pure to capitalism as one can get. Whether you’re Ken Griffin or Ken Nobody flipping burgers on the overnnight shift at McDonalds, you have access to the markets. That said, there is a shit ton more competition, hello HFT and AI. And so cupcake trades are fewer and far between, trading strategies have a shorter time window of profit, etc. So there’s the good and the bad but for the noobs here, the good far outweighs the bad. Hold on to your nuts or tits (for all the women traders out there, I’m writing to you too, get that money girl) though because if you’re not disciplined you will lose your stack regardless. 

&amp;#x200B;

* 8. Scared money don’t make none – You need to be honest with your own risk tolerance otherwise you will fail as a trader. On a scale of masturbating at home in your room with the door locked and the lights off to raw dogging randoms without protection you need to figure out, in general, how risk averse, risk neutral, or risk loving you are and be mindful of this when developing your trading strategy. Maybe you play it safe with 90% of your stack and YOLO the other 10%. Maybe vice versa. Doesn’t matter, all three levels of risk can be profitable, but you will likely be ineffective if you don’t understand your risk tolerance. Why? Because you will either play with scared money (naturally risk averse but make risky plays) or you will be dogged by too much FOMO (risk loving but you covered for meager profits too early and then go on tilt on your next trade only to lose money). It’s one thing to risk only enough money you are comfortable losing (we’ll discuss this more in another post) but it’s another thing to mismanage the money you *are* willing to comfortably risk. Just because you’re comfortable losing it doesn’t mean you *want* to lose it. Learn about your risk. Again, if you want to YOLO your $5k or whatever on a few trades, go do it, but if you want to be consistently profitable in the long-term, you must have capital to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

* 9A. Execution – Something that is easily overlooked when starting out is your physical trading setup. What platform are you using? Are you aware of all of the trading features (charts, news tickers, time and sales, customization options, etc.)? Is it the right platform for you? How reliable is your Internet connection at home, the office, on the road, wherever you trade? Do you have a backup option in case your phone or computer craps out? How much are you actually investing in the proper tools to be successful? The last thing you want is to have a big position on and be stuck out in the middle of nowhere without the ability to adjust your position should market shifting news hit. Two words, Murphy’s Law.

&amp;#x200B;

* 9B. Order execution – Get familiar with limit orders. Get familiar with stop losses. Get familiar with being able to quickly and seamlessly enter and exit positions using the various entry/exit options that your trading platforms allows. Seems simple enough? I have and will always see noobs fat finger right into their own butthole because they weren’t paying attention to a quick change in market price, or some other “delay of game” bullshit.

&amp;#x200B;

* 10. You shall compare your P/L today only to your P/L from yesterday, last month, last year. That’s it. Do not, I repeat, do not get mixed up in a game where you are comparing yourself to the “winners” and “losers” in these subs or friends and colleagues. You don’t know their whole financial picture and likely never will. Young traders are so insecure (naturally) that they let this noise get inside their heads. I don’t give a fuck if you killed it or got killed in the markets because unless you’re throwing some of that money at me, IDGAF.  I’m worried about me and my gains and my losses and my strategy. That’s it. Stay focused on the task at hand, which is to improve every day (Youtube 1% rule). If you want to discuss your P/L in a meaningful manner, that’s one thing and acceptable to do, otherwise pay no mind to that fuss.",finance

investing,Rebalancing asset classes before a market crash,"Hi all. I was wondering what you would all suggest as the best strategy for rebalancing before a market crash? Although I know anything can happen, I’m preparing my game plan for an upcoming 2000 style crash. Specifically I’m imagining the current stock market will ascend with more stimulus and low interest rates. This will drive up equities, precious metals, and reits. Bonds and cash are currently unfavorable.  However, if things proceed and the market balloons, I imagine that the Fed will eventually allow treasury yield to increase similar to the lead up to 2000 I believe the Fed will take the same strategy as in 2000 because the market bubble was deflated relatively very slowly. Something similar also happened in 1934ish.  I think the Fed and the owners of the world would prefer an orderly and slow crash over a quick and unpredictable crash. So, just as equities are obviously going parabolic and the treasury yields are increasing, I believe this would be the time to rebalance from equities to bonds and cash (and perhaps skeptically into precious metals and reits). 

Do you all have ideas about which asset classes you’d favor pre-crash?

 I’m thinking TLT (long term treasuries). I believe the decades long price trend of TLT would be easy to read for when it’s favorable to invest. It’s pretty linear with large oscillations throughout the larger trend. Also, I’d probably hold more in cash as well. I currently hold paper gold, and I think I’d just hold the gold through a crash until I’m certain equities have bottomed.",finance
personalfinance,Home affordability question,"Hello, my wife and I are looking at selling our current house and building a new home. We would like to move and it seems like this is the time with the low interest rates we are seeing.

We gross 86k combined per year. The only debt other than our mortgage is a car payment of 336 per month with three years left. We take home about 5200k per month after health insurance and 401k match.

We are looking at a 285k house and putting down 5%. The estimated monthly payment with taxes and insurance is looking like $1450 per month.

The way I’m figuring it we would have a “back end” debt ratio of 24.5%. 

We have about 15k of savings after this transaction.

solar,Solar questions for NYC (Queens),"I recently got a quote from Venture Solar for solar panels. Before I move forward, I have a few  questions.

1) Up front payment to own the system is $43,350 before the federal and state tax credits, and the NYC Property Tax Abatement. This seems pretty high to me, but I'm not sure. The system size would be 11.56 kWh, and they'd guarantee 13,618 kWh annually with LG NeON 2 Panels.  Is this a fair price? From googling around i thought the cost before incentives would range from $20k-$30k

2) The house is in an Irrevocable Trust. I'm a Trustee, my father is the Grantor. My father is retired and his only income is Social Security. I have a full time job, but the house is not technically in my name. Would I still qualify for all the tax credits and incentives?

I am a 2020 college graduate. I was an independent student so while I took out loans they are all federal, some being Perkins.

This year has been rough but I am super thankful I have not had to touch this money that I set aside. I was laid off for 5 months, with no family support, and am worried about it happening again while my loans are in repayment.

Questions:

Would it be a good idea to pay off one group during the grace period? If so:

\-Should I target low amount w/ low interest? Would leave me enough to pay a good chunk off another loan or save for future monthly payments

\-Should I pay a high amount w/ ‘high’ interest? Could not pay off anything else.

\-Or should I pay by which has the highest monthly payment?

If I target loans that have high interest rates should pay towards those that will be ending their grace period soon or ones who end in April? The ones in April have higher monthly payments.",finance

I am saving about $1100/month and am wondering if it would be wise to just park this money in a HYSA even though interest rates are pretty low right now.

Here are the options I am currently thinking of:

1. Park all the savings in a HYSA
2. Park it in a taxable account and invest conservatively (60% stocks/40% bonds)
3. Keep half in HYSA and invest the other half in the above allocation

investing,"Kodak $765M Federal Loan Process Involved No Wrongdoing, DFC Concludes","There was no wrongdoing involved in the process of Eastman Kodak Company (NYSE:KODK) receiving a $765 million federal loan for its pharmaceuticals foray, the U.S. International Development Finance Corp. has reportedly concluded. 

What Happened: The DFC is the federal agency that originally granted the loan. As per the Wall Street Journal, the DFC Inspector General Anthony Zakel reported his findings to Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) last week.

Zakel told Warren, who has been among the most vocal critic of what she earlier referred to as a “massive fiasco of a deal,” that the DFC in its review found no conflict of interest for the employees of the federal agency in the deal and that there is no “evidence of misconduct on the part of DFC officials.”

The loan was sanctioned at the behest of President Donald Trump in July this year.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has also been reportedly probing the events surrounding around the loan, including allegations of potential insider trading violations.

A DFC spokesperson told the Journal, “the record is abundantly clear and the independent IG review confirms that DFC followed its standard process, under its standard timeline, driven by career finance professionals.”

Why Does It Matter: It isn't immediately clear if DFC will go forward with the loan.

One of Warren's aide claimed that Zakel's assessment didn't look into potential ties between the White House and other related parties with a political background. The associate also raised certain questions about the DFC’s procedures.

Zakel said the DFC limited the probe internally and “did not review conduct by Kodak or non-DFC personnel.“

Kodak shares have seen immense volatility since the announcement of the loan in July. Grant of stock options to Kodak Chairman and CEO Jim Continenza a day before the loan was announced, along with his purchase of a significant amount of shares in the company ahead of the loan raised eyebrows. 

An independent committee appointed by Kodak board in September concluded there was no violation of the law on part of the Rochester-based photography company but it flagged concerns related to corporate governance.

Continenza said in October that Kodak will move forward with the generic drug ingredients manufacturing venture even if the federal loan is not granted.",finance

personalfinance,Unforeseen deer put a damper on things,"I'm usually a lurker but I have a question for anyone that is willing to help. I live in a rural area in Michigan, with a lot of deer. I managed to hit one last night driving home from work. Last time I hit a deer it was over $1,000, I imagine it is going to be the same. My car is almost paid off, it will be paid off at the end of the month. I was looking to trade it in due to possibility of the family growing. I was looking to trade it in for a possible SUV or Truck, I can afford the payments that is not the issue. The deductible being $500.00.


The issue is the wife and I are also looking to move and soon and have been trying to save for a house.

The last issue is I've been working to get my Credit score back up. Went through a rough time, it dropped from 720 to 580 and now I have managed to get it back over 710. While looking through credit karma, credit wise and every other credit reporting feature from credit cards, they keep recommending me to open up another card. They say to spend low but pay it off asap. The apps are basically saying I should have more credit available but not use it. 

I have 2 cards currently with high interest rates both are paid off. One is 900 the other is 500. I had an idea to sign up for a credit card with no APR for the first year and use that for my deductible (I double checked I do have a deductible for a comprehensive claim). I would be able to pay it off in a few checks.  

Would I have issues doing all three in a short period of time? Would my credit take major hits with me doing the credit card then trying to get a loan for a new vehicle then a few months down the road trying to get approved for a home mortgage. 

TLDR; would it be a good idea to get a new credit card use it to pay the deductible on my car, then trade in that car and try to get a auto loan on a new vehicle, then a few months down the road try to get approved for a home mortgage. I would be a co-signer on the home mortgage  

The new card would be paid off in a month, my current vehicle will be paid off by the end of the month. My wife and I would like to move by the end of next year maybe. 

My plans were to trade in my vehicle after it was paid off at the end of December, get a new vehicle then in a few months try with the wife to get pre-approved for a home mortgage and sell our current home. But this deer has changed somethings and my credit score is slowly rising. Such as 1 or 2 points a month. Two apps said I should get another line of credit to help boost my credit score.

personalfinance,How to deal with sudden financial hardship?,"Hey all. I am a 19 year old college student with a federal work-study job at my school that pays minimum wage. I have more work hours than other students and use this to save up money. Up until last week I was very confident in my savings - I worked enough to have enough money to pay off my upcoming tuition bill and pay off my credit card debt. 

Suddenly I got into a car accident (I did not get injured thankfully) and have to pay repair bills. I made a mistake of not calling the police when a city bus hit me due to sudden panic and drove off home. If I call the insurance company without evidence of the event, it is likely that the premiums will rise and that will be under the burden of my unemployed parents.

I've now lost all my confidence in my finances. I will surely pay for my tuition, but now it feels like I still will have a heavy weight on my shoulders. How do you all deal with unexpected, unplanned financial hardships?",finance

I switched jobs this year and looks like I didn't notice with my new company.

So it seems like I've been overpaying on Federal.  I definitely am going to change it for next year.  I still have remaining paychecks for this year though. 

 I was curious if there was any benefit to just leave it as 0 for Federal for the remainder of the year, or I should go ahead and make the change now?

I'm just checking in case it is less complexity from a filing or tracking standpoint to just let it remain, or no system really cares.

NASA posted one that closed in March of 2020. Excerpt from [https://www.sbir.gov/node/1657389](https://www.sbir.gov/node/1657389) below:

&gt; NASA is seeking innovative solutions involving Blockchain that would greatly enhance operational efficiency by providing a single, immutable ""source of truth"", viewable by all authorized parties, and usable by automated reporting and verification systems, for the following two NASA-specific challenges.Model Based System Engineering (MBSE): A significant challenge in MBSE is knowing that the system model being used is the current (or needed) version, since various aspects evolve through the system development and operations lifecycle. Further, because systems are becoming increasingly complex, tracking the vast number of changes that occur needs to be automated and efficient. Blockchain solutions may enable a single, real-time source of truth for system models, to eliminate several sources of error and inefficiency in MBSE.Distributed space mission management: To accomplish complex space mission and Earth observation objectives, constellations of distributed satellites are often the most cost-effective approach. These constellations share key consolidated resources such as ground stations, a space network, communication networks, onboard processes, etc. A blockchain solution to managing distributed space missions should enable collaboration in a partially trusted environment and increase responsiveness, reliability, and availability of spacecraft and ground resources. The management functions enhance flexibility (e.g., reduce overhead for components to join and leave constellations), and enhance automation (e.g., automate resource outage alerts, facilitate localized replanning, enable a constellation level model-based diagnostics). To accomplish this, proposed solutions must overcome the slow transaction rate, large file sizes, and concurrency issues of some blockchain implementations 

You can search all the BAAs for the word Blockchain and look at all the potential use cases. [https://www.sbir.gov/search-result-page?search=blockchain](https://www.sbir.gov/search-result-page?search=blockchain) I post them here in the hopes they can help some of you evaluate new ""coins"" and projects and get a feel for real world problems they might solve.

personalfinance,What do to with my savings after I've bought a house,"Hello PF,

A bit about me: 29, soon to be married, annual income is around 200k with no debt living in the New Jersey, working in the city. Have about 100k in savings right now. 

My current situation: I will be buying a house/condo next August. Planning on spending around 400k, and should have around 130k in savings then. With the way things are budgeted, I will have some extra savings on top of my 6 to 8 month emergency fund. After the purchase, I will still be able to save about 40 to 50 percent of my income. I already max out my 401k before this.

I live in the NYC area at the moment, but want to move away in about five years to a lower cost of living area like Dallas or Austin. My goal is to have enough equity in the house and enough savings to fully purchase a house when I move away. To do this, I want to park my savings in some safe investments. With interest rates being so low in savings accounts, I was wondering what other options I have.

personalfinance,Cash out refi to buy a house next year?,"Would it be wise to do a cash out refinance with the anticipation of buying a house next year?  We’ve got a kid due in a month and would like to move to a nicer neighborhood to raise her in. The thought is that we’d hopefully lock in a lower interest rate, and be able to pay off credit card debt to help save up for a nicer house. 

Some info:
3.5 years in to our 15 year mortgage
3.875%
$25,717.51 due from $31,350 original
Home value is $50-55,000 with the current market. 

I take home around $40k a year after taxes, ins, 401k. Wife currently does not work or plan on returning to work postpartum, but might if she hates being a STAHM. 

Due to some unforeseen pet bills in the spring as well as some depression spending we’ve racked up credit card debt totaling 10,959.11. 

We have been pretty much living paycheck to paycheck and racking up the credit cards because of uncontrolled spending. We’ve recently saved around $300/month between phone bill, internet, and car insurance. Tonight I plan on revisiting my budget I set about a year ago and sticking to it so we don’t fall into credit card debt again. 

The hope is that we can lock in a lower interest rate, lower the monthly mortgage payment, and pay off the credit card. Then save up for a down payment on our next house. 

Is this realistic? Would I be able to refi and get around 10k cash out? Even if we only get 6-8k to put towards credit card and then chip away they rest slowly, is the reduced interest rate going to make a big deal? Who knows, we may end up staying here longer and ride that low interest rate for a while. 

Should I just start talking to banks to see what kind of offer I can get?

Overall, My portfolio looks to be 65% equities and a mix of stable-ish funds making up the remaining portion. I believe these allocations were created automatically using a tool in my invetment platform. Upon closer look, some of these funds seem to be a little expensive and underperforming when compared to my available options.

I'm still learning and coming to understand the value of a passive investment strategy/Boglehead mentality that many advocate for on this subreddit. Lacking any ""Total xxx Funds"" though, I'm not sure what a good blend would be. I have bolded the funds I am currently in.

As this is a tax-advantaged account, I would want to draw from it last. We have quite a bit of assets in taxable accounts that we can draw from first. Am I correct in thinking that I would want to maintain some reasonable ratio of risk (50% equities / 50% bonds) even though I expect to be retired in the next 3-5 years?

What would you consider to be a well-balanced portfolio of my available options if I want something that will be able to grow over the long term?

I bought a newer car in July. It’s a 2017 with about $19,000 left on my loan. No problem making payment, trying to pay it down when I can. Interest rate of 3%

No credit card debt, pay in full each month. Credit utilization is 1%

No student loans- I have paid those off. I am back in school, may take more loans out at some point.

My credit history is thin. I have 2 credit cards, and then the car loan and my closed student loan. I’ve had one credit card for about 9 years, the other for 8.
 
HERES MY WORRY:

Recently I was placed into collections for a medical bill that was never sent to me. I did not recognize or have any information for it. It states it is for approx. $2200

I learned I was in collection when attempting to apply for another credit card (citi double reward) as it said I was likely to be accepted via NerdWallet, and was trying to build my credit more.

My credit score is reported as 798, was 822 before I got the car loan.

I’m certain my credit will drop after learning of the collection, it takes approx 45 days for the credit bureaus to update. 

Anyway- it says the collection will stay on my credit report until April 2025. Will I just not be able to get another car loan, or credit card until then? I was planning on buying a house in the next 5-7 years. Am I doomed until I can either get the collection removed (doubtful) or it falls off my report? 

I’m mostly just worried about my credit score at this point, and being turned down for loans in the future. I thought I was doing everything right. 
I love the car but was planning on keeping it for only 3-4 years.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin for Boomers,"I am working on creating content to raise awareness about our Cryptocurrencies.

I would encourage you to helpfully check and add revisions to this as necessary. Especially the topic on being hacked and a check on how nodes work.  Our website will be opening up, and it's important to get some of these things out there.

I will cover 10 topics today. This work is not mine but rather a collection of things I have learned, I take zero credit for discovering this information. PLAN B is who you should look to for guidance on the STF models.

**What is Bitcoin?**

•In short, Bitcoin (BTC) is treated and was approved as a commodity by the Futures Trading Commission.

•Bitcoin is a digital currency. The world’s largest digital currency.

•Current market cap for BTC as of writing is $356.58 Billion. Priced at $19,237.34 per BTC.

•There are no physical coins, the balances and transactions are kept on a ledger that is verified by all computers on the Bitcoin network.

•Computers mine bitcoin by going to work verifying transactions for the network. They are rewarded with Bitcoin.

**Who controls it?**

•Absolutely no one! Bitcoin was designed to be decentralized. This means it is free of government, corporation, entity, and political control.

•The creator or creator(s) went by the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto. It was created in 2009 and published in the famous [Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). Satoshi contributed to the source code of Bitcoin until 2010 when he disappeared.

•By being free of control you do not need a financial institution or government to conduct your transactions. No-one can create more bitcoins and there will only ever be 21 million coins.

•The last coin will be mined in 2140.

**Why should I care?**

•In the early 1990s very few people saw the use of computers to the extent we use them today. Bitcoin was created over a decade ago and is now being noticed by world leaders, billionaires, countries, individual people, and everyone in every country across the globe.

•Bitcoin solves many problems Govt. controlled money creates. By its nature, it is deflationary and gains value over time.

•Bitcoin has increased around 8.9 million percent from Jan 2010 to current. 4,788.35% increase in the last five years.

•It may replace gold as the next store of value, and from there can compete to become a global reserve currency.

•Bitcoin can be used to pay anyone without using a financial institution.

**How is it valuable?**

•A common thing to hear. “There’s nothing behind that value holding it up. Stocks have companies, bonds have certificates Bitcoin doesn’t have any value.”

•What makes a currency valuable in general?

•Portable, durable, sustainable, scarce, ease of use, and store of value.

•Dollars / Fiat currency can be printed. This year the USA has printed upwards of 2 trillion dollars. Weakening USD to a two and a half year low.

•Interest rates on the 10-year bond are less than 1%. Inflation is rising at 2% on average. This means right now; your USD savings are literally losing money sitting in the bank. Eroding your savings.

•Bitcoin cannot be printed, it’s deflationary due to Halving. No government controls it, and there will only ever be 21 million in existence.

**Can’t anyone make it?**

•Bitcoin is the only decentralized currency. Alternative (Alt) coins such as Etherium, Dogecoin, and others are all able to be controlled by their creators or company.

•Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin and then disappeared after 2010. Bitcoin then began to take its own form and grow autonomously. Even if we wanted to, we could not “print” more Bitcoins. It was designed to be without control of any one person or entity. Money for the people, without political or sovereign control.

•There can be cryptocurrencies made, but Bitcoin will be the one competing to overtake gold in market cap and become a global reserve currency.

•Anyone can Mine bitcoin. The computers and software are expensive, the profitability is low in many areas. The more computers “mining” the harder the difficulty of mining becomes. This keeps the Bitcoin flowing into the system at an average of 328k coins per year and this cut in two every four years. The last coin being mined in 2140.

**The price just goes up because people want it.**

•Why does the price of gold rise?

•It’s hard to mine gold, takes a lot of work. Gold does not rust. It is divisible (to an extent) you cannot pay for a coffee in gold. Gold produced 3.3 tonnes in 2019. Estimates say there are 197 tonnes of gold in the world. This gives us a stock to flow 59.9. The flow is how much we are putting in, the stock is how much we have. This measures the scarcity and production of gold and helps affect the price. If we produce 10 tonnes next year, gold would become more abundant and then have a stock to flow of 19.7. Making the price go down.

•Bitcoin takes a lot of computer power and electricity to produce. It does not erode with time. It is divisible. It is a bank in your pocket. You can pay for coffee, you can carry millions of dollars with you anywhere. Try taking $16 Million dollars to an airport.

• Remember, the higher the stock to flow the more scarce a material. There are currently 18,564,587.5 Bitcoins and since the halving event in June, the system will be producing about 328,500 BTC per year. This gives BTC a stock to flow of 56.5.

•The market cap for gold is 9 trillion dollars, The market cap for BTC is currently 356 Billion. Yet has roughly the same stock to flow. No other asset in the world has come this close to gold.

Stock to flow continued.

•So what other assets have as high of stock to flow?

•None. Silver comes in at 20, crude oil, copper, corn, and wheat all come in less than 5.

•Platinum market cap 1.9 billion. Silver 44 billion. Exxon Mobil 173 BN.

•Bitcoin has already surpassed many precious commodities in market cap. It is undervalued for its stock to flow (STF) being nearly as high as gold. We will see the market cap for BTC begin to catch up now that Halving has occurred.

•What is market cap? In sense of shares of stock, it is the stock price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding. We are witnessing Bitcoin on the path to overtaking gold.

•Current price of BTC at $19,000 for a market cap of $356 billion with 18.5 Million coins right now. Reaching gold in market cap of $9 Trillion within four years time from now would have 19.8 Million coins valued around $454,545.00 each.

**Halving**

•As with gold, we can predict how much will be added to the system YOY.

•The timeline of four years from now becomes significant because of Halving. Every four years the reward for the computers mining is cut in half. This has a price effect of raising BTC. In June of this year, we experienced a halving event and now the reward for BTC is 6.5 bitcoins.

•When we halved in June, the stock to flow was increased because the flow was reduced making the scarcity increase. The deflationary principle of Bitcoin allows it to increase in value and scarcity over time. There will only ever be 21 Million Bitcoins with the last one being mined in 2140. Four years from now we will experience another halving event. Taking our bitcoins per year produced from 328,500 down to 164,250 per year.

•This would put us at an STF of 120.5 (19.8 Million coins total with 164,250 coming in.) 120.5 stock to flow in four years from now. Therefore, BTC is currently competing for gold and will soon blow it out of the water. During the next four years we will simply see it catch up to, and then surpass gold especially when the next halving occurs.

**Can it be hacked?**

•Bitcoin would be incredibly hard to hack. This is because of the blockchain technology used. Transactions are constantly being reviewed by the system and only verifiable blocks are added to the chain.

•To hack Bitcoin you would need to control at least 51% or more of the computing power in the entire world that is connected to the Bitcoin network.

•Miners verify transactions, they earn the “new” bitcoins and this is how they are added to the system. Adding to the chain when a miner creates or sells one, all transactions are recorded and verified in the ledger.

•“Hacking” Bitcoins on to your balance is impossible, you must show miners there is a previous transaction to your address. If you tried, the miners will reject your transaction as they cannot accept something generating an unsolvable hash. You would have no proof of work/proof of owning one, to begin with. There is no way to hack yourself this proof of work, all bitcoins come from mining and the ledger has verifiable transaction history to show you “Don’t” have that “Bullshit coin”. Thus rejecting the attempt.

•This language and the understanding of how it can or cannot be hacked is hard to simplify. Everything is based on proof of work and you cannot add new bitcoins to the system without having mined them.

**Can I be hacked?**

•Yes absolutely.

•If you do nefarious things on your computer or phone and get a virus or keylogger implanted on you, you may be hacked. This is unrelated to BTC in general. Just as you may have compromised passwords, you may use the same password for your BTC wallet and the Hackerman kidnaps those bitcoins along with your bank account.

•Be safe when online, use a hard wallet to prevent this. Certain wallets for bitcoin only allow withdraws to verifiable or approved addresses, meaning someone wouldn’t be able to up and steal your coins without you noticing.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,To refi or not to refi and which and with whom,"Hi there! I refi’d my home 3 years ago as part of my divorce. 30 year loan, currently owe $200k at 4%. House worth about double that. 

I just got a couple of GFEs from the broker I used back then (who was incredibly helpful at a time when I was having a hard time with ... everything) to see if a refi again so soon would make sense given the low rates. Both estimates were for a rate of 2.625%. 

He gave me one for a 30 year, which would lower my monthly payment by $200 (but add three years to my loan obviously). 

Also one for a 20 year, which would raise my payment by $80 but cut 7 years off my loan. 

Total closing costs on each is around $3500. Oof. Closing costs tend to be high for my city (Austin) but I’m not sure what is typical/too much. Online places advertise lower rates and no closing costs but I’m not sure what shady practices to be wary of/companies to avoid. 

I plan to stay in this damn house forever or until they stick me in a home. I’m 50ish. 

If I went with the 30 year I would add that saved $200 p/mo to my retirement, which has had an average rate of return of over 11% over the past 10 years. (Would be a lot higher except for stupid 2018.)

I have no other debt, pay off credit card every month, credit score in the 800s. i need to be putting more towards retirement. 

End goal is really just to not be stupid and try to make the wisest decisions I can with what I’ve got. Not sure interest rates will get this low again and feeling some pressure to get in on it. 

Any advice about wise course of action would be so appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Options for getting a mortgage that has relaxed income requirements?,"(throwaway account)

Background: I've been looking at real estate where I am, and I'd like to buy a house. I'm familiar with most of the process (almost went through but fell out of contract). I have 2x the sale price of the properties I'm looking at in total assets (mostly investment assets).

I'm currently contracting, and will be for the next few months at least, if not longer. The lenders I have been working with easily gave me pre-approval for pretty sizable loans when I was working a W-2 salaried position, but now that I'm 1099, they want either a W2 job offer or multiple years of 1099 income in order to move forward, despite me having total assets enough that I could buy a damn house twice over in cash if I wanted to.

Are there other lenders out there that can look at my financial situation and don't have those hard income requirements and that don't have insanely high interest rates and origination fees like bridge lenders?

Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,To refinance or not to refinance?!,"Hello, I've been mulling over this for a while in light of lower interest rates but haven't reached a conclusion. Guidance would be much appreciated!

I have a 5/5 ARM 30 year mortgage at a 3.5% interest rate. 

My understanding is that if I choose to refinance, the interest rate would drop to 2.5% for a 5/5 ARM 30 year, 2.35% for a 15 year fixed, 2.75 for 20 year, 3.125 for 30 year.

Closing costs would be \~2,000-3,000$ (which apparently includes appraisal, origination fee, title insurance (which infuriates me!!! why would i need it AGAIN?!), settlement company fees, etc).

A friend suggested a litmus test of: if your savings are recovered in under 6 months, then go for it. Per some back of napkin calculations, I would only recover \~1000$ in 6 months. 

Any advice for how I should approach this?  What the key questions to ask myself and my lender are? 

The call with my lender was rushed so I didn't even get a chance to ask about monthly payments - so I definitely plan on having another conversation before making a decision.

Thanks so much in advance!",finance
personalfinance,(US) What happens if I misuse my federal student loans and when should I pay them back?,"I took student loans while I was unemployed. I since have had good employment. In the two years since I have had the loans, I have spent money on essential and non-essential items exceeding the value of the loans. I have enough money right now to pay the loans almost 3 times over, but I do not want to pay them off until the following tax year because of taxes on investments.

Is there some method I need to use to determine if I have violated the terms, or is it sufficient that I can show that I have spent the amount of the loan on rent, groceries, gas, text books, educational supplies (such as laptop), and so on? 

What concerns me is I invested money this last year, some of it which may have been from the student loan. I got overzealous and just dumped my money into an investment account, but then I ended up making money and I got a big severance from work so I'm now very liquid. I'm not really sure how it works or if anyone cares as long as I have payed X amount in essentials and I can pay the loan back. I am hoping to pay back the loans in full next year.",finance

I am wanting to figure out the different paths that I could take to progress forward on my goal to becoming a home owner.
Either I purchase a home now and take a considerable risk to get it done now with no financial safety net, or I get an apartment and bide time to build up a financial safety net before purchasing.
I have been trying to do shitty math to determine what my best course of action is.


I looked up mortgage interest rates and the best that I have seen are as follows:
	1.875 @ 15 years fixed
	2.25  @ 30 years fixed

Both of these assume a loan amount of $400k and a down payment of 3%.
I understand that I will likely be required to carry PMI for the duration of 20% of the loans so long as I do not have a proper down payment.


I started exploring the numbers using mortgage calculators.
Assuming PMI @ $200 a month until 20% of loan has been paid off.




	1.875  @ 15 years fixed
	
		Loan Amount: $400,000
		Mortgage Period: 15 years
		Interest Rate: 1.875%
		Total Cost of Mortgage: $459,194
		Monthly Payments: $2,551
		PMI Payments: $6,400
		Total Mortgage + PMI: $465,594


	2.25  @ 30 years fixed
	
		Loan Amount: $400,000
		Mortgage Period: 30 years
		Interest Rate: 2.25%
		Total Cost of Mortgage: $550,434
		Monthly Payments: $1,529
		PMI Payments: $10,600
		Total Mortgage + PMI: $561,034
		
		
		
		
Just looking at the differences in the loans, it seems at first glance that the shorter duration is favorable just due to the shorter term and not allowing the interest to snowball.
But since these interest rates are so low to begin with, does it even make sense to aggressively pay down the loan, or does it make more sense to milk it for as long as possible and sink the money elsewhere?

The difference in monthly payments between the loans gives us some theoretical money to play with to throw into an investing calculator and compare the results.


$2,551 - $1,529 = $1,022


Lets pretend that we put that difference into an account on the market and continue to add the difference in each month.


	Starting Amount: $1022
	Additional Monthly Contributions: $1022
	Period: 15 years
	Return Rate: 6%
	End Balance: $295,673
	Total Interest: $110,691
	
	
	

	Starting Amount: $1022
	Additional Monthly Contributions: $1022
	Period: 30 years
	Return Rate: 2%
	End Balance: $503,922
	Total Interest: $134,980


The total costs of the loans differ by $95,440. It seems as though as long as I could average a 6% return rate then this would make sense over a 15 year period, or average a 2% return over a 30 year period to match the length of the longer loan.
	

Considering how I have never invested in my life, nor had a conversation with anyone about investing. I would love to know peoples thoughts on whether this makes sense or I am going batshit crazy.

It seems to make sense that as long as the market return rate interest percentage is nominally higher than the home loan interest percentage, it would make sense that there are better places to shove my money than to dedicate to paying off the home loan as soon as possible.



It seems as though a lot, if not all, of the interest accrued yearly on a home loan can be deducted from my taxes. Looking at you solar.
Am I correct in thinking this?




I would love to get to know your thoughts on the situation that I am in, and also the shitty math and elementary investment theory that i have been toying with.



The monthly cost of getting an apartment in my area will be roughly between the monthly expenses presented by the two loan options that I have presented.
This, combined with the fact that I will still not be happy with my living situation in a new apartment, have led me to aggressively explore the options available to me that might result in me not getting an apartment.


I understand that I may be in a financial situation where an apartment is an unavoidable choice forced upon me by my lack of downpayment and financial security blanket. If you think that is what I need to hear, don't be bashful. I am asking for your best advice, not emotional support.",finance
MachineLearning,[News] Fooling Deep Networks to Predict the 3D Scene or Depth that We Want (NeurIPS 2020),"Hello friends!

Deep networks are now commonly used to solve a number of tasks, including telling us how far (depth) objects observed in an image are from the camera. 

Is it possible to ""fool"" a deep network into predicting the wrong depth for some of these objects in an image e.g. making a car in front of us seem 10 meters farther? Or even causing it to ignore specific objects e.g. completely miss a pedestrian crossing the road?

Turns out we CAN do this by adding small noise that we can't even see (visually imperceptible) into the images that get fed to a deep network.

I am happy to announce our latest NeurIPS 2020 paper (with Safa Cicek, and Stefano Soatto) on Targeted Adversarial Perturbations for Monocular Depth Prediction ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08602.pdf), [poster](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~alexw/nips2020_targeted_adversarial_monodepth_poster.pdf) and [code](https://github.com/alexklwong/targeted-adversarial-perturbations-monocular-depth)).

In this paper, we show that it is possible to fool a deep network to not just predict the wrong depth, but the depth that we want. For example, it is possible to make the deep network think (i) that certain objects are farther or closer than they actually are, (ii) that some objects doesn't ""exist"" (even though they are in the picture), or (iii) that the image depicts a completely different 3D scene (fooling the network to think that a busy street is actually an open road in a forest). 

But our goal is not just to see whether we can fool a deep network into making wrong predictions (or to study its robustness), we want to understand how it comes to making these predictions. It turns out these (adversarial) noise or perturbations can show us what part of the image the network needs in order to predict the distance of objects (the distance of a car from the camera may depend on the road and some trees!). It also turns out that some objects are less prone (or more robust) to the effects of these noise e.g. it is harder to make a pedestrian seem farther than it is for a car. 

If you are interested, we will be presenting our work at NeurIPS 2020 at Poster Session 3 (12/8/2020, 9 PM PST). Feel free to drop by and we can chat :)

A little bit of background:

A number of studies have shown that classification, detection and segmentation outputed by a deep network, can be dramatically altered by small additive signals. These adversarial perturbations are designed on purpose to “fool” the network. We explore the possibility of fooling a network into inferring the wrong depth of a scene. More specifically, we show that not only is it possible to fool a network to provide the wrong depth map, but it is possible to fool it to return any depth map. Targeted adversarial perturbations are designed not just to return the wrong answer, but to return the answer that the adversary wants.",technology
personalfinance,I owe back taxes because of my Ex?,"Okay, I'm still trying to get my head wrapped around this situation. Apologies if I don't have the situation in hand, that's why I came here.

In January of 2019, the divorce from my ex was finalized and I thought everything would be over and done with. Well, I was wrong for a variety of reasons. The ex offered to have her CPA file the 2018 federal income taxes jointly (instead of filing separately) to save both of us from paying more than we had to. I let her do it because between working 60 hours a week, finding a place to live, and grad school, I really didn't have the time to do it on my own. I did have someone review the documents to make sure her CPA wasn't trying to pull anything on me. As far as I knew everything was taken care of and she owed like $5500 while I owed a little over $600. 

Now I go and file my 2019 federal income taxes and find out that instead of receiving a ~$1400 return, they've garnished the return to pay for taxes owed. I haven't received any notices or calls about this before this first letter (in October) and haven't heard anything since. I finally set up an account on the IRS website, and as far as I can tell, not a cent of the 2018 taxes have been paid up to this point. 

I have no idea what to do other than to talk to (some sort of) a lawyer, but I'm worried as soon as I do that's going to cost more than the actual refund. I also don't understand why I was able to buy a house only a few months ago, and yet nothing showed up as overdue, etc.

Bitcoin,"If the US gov't accepted BTC as tax payments, is that good or bad?","Hear me out.

personalfinance,Is it possible to consolidate private student loans into federal student loans?,[removed],finance
personalfinance,Should I prioritize paying off student loans or saving for retirement,"Hi everyone, I am seeking financial advice and perspectives on whether to prioritize retirement saving or paying off student loans. 

I (23F) graduated in May 2020 with a masters degree which put me in a lot of debt ~117K (Varying levels of interest). I am currently planning on refinancing my existing private loans (~16K) and consolidating the remainder which are federal loans (~100K). I have only slightly looked into the repayment options and wondering if I should try to pay them off slow and save (i qualify for income based repayment) or if I should try to pay them back faster and not save.   

My start date got delayed until late January and therefore I have not had an income and have been living at home since. I will be required to start in March so I will only really be saving a months worth of income, but will be starting repayment in February. 

My job will have 85K base salary with potential bonuses, but I don’t want to bank on that. I currently have around 12k in my checking and 1.5k in the stock market. I will be moving to NYC and I anticipate moving expenses will be approximately 3-5K. 

I am very aware of starting the process early bc of compound interest, getting in the habit, etc. so I have a desire to start maxing out my 401k as soon as I have an income, but question if I should be instead trying to prioritize paying off my student loans first (ie only pay off student loans and not put anything into saving until after everything is paid off). Below is a very rough estimate of how I currently hope to breakdown my income [I have the discipline to stick with budgets, but I am not sure how reasonable or unreasonable this is for someone who wants to live life while also living on a budget -- ex: going on trips with friends, enjoying weekends, etc, and living rather conservatively during the work week (no eating out)]. Right now I am planning on putting 1500 a month into saving and then 1000 for loans, which would take me 12-15 years (including interest) at that rate to pay off. I am unsure of what to do as I know that I really value the idea and goal of being and feeling financially free but I also want to be in a place where I am financially secure for retirement. If you have been in a similar position please let me know what your thoughts are, what you did or wish you did etc. Any insights or suggestions are much appreciated, thanks!

personalfinance,"FBO Account - Withdrawal Penalties/Limitations, things I should know?","Hi all,

I bank with American Funds just as my mother did before me. She created an FBO account under my name that currently holds north of $25k. 

I recently received my student loan bill (total) that is just under that amount. 

My question is - are there any withdrawal penalties from taking money out of that account? Is that something I could 'roll' into my Roth IRA? I don't remember the balance of my FBO account growing when I check my account semi-regularly, so I feel like it's just 'sitting'. 

I know there's a possibility Biden will give some relief to Federal loans, but seeing that huge negative number in my net worth gives me some anxiety. 

Thank you in advance, would love to get this student loan payment taken care of as I know that's not the type of loan to sit on.",finance

I just accepted a new gig making 125k + 20k annual bonus. 

The interest rate for this debt is high 20+, and I’m rather clueless... 

Should I try to consolidate via a financial institution or take a loan from my credit union? Pros and Cons? For the former is there a specific one or service that’s good for these sorts of things?

So really my question is, is there much point in me investing yet, if I could get rid of some of this debt with my savings?

Just an FYI if I did invest, I'd be able to out a lump sum of what I have saved of course, and about £4k/£5k annually from my salary.",finance

personalfinance,Need input on possible decision to sell personal home for a fresh financial start,"Hi, all.  

Married, 45, living in the same home with my wife and 11 year old daughter, for almost 17 years now.  The home has barely ever seen appreciation, in the time we have owned it, and is about 22 years old.  We did attempt to sell in summer of 2018, but continued to have offers from buyers who were ultimately not qualified to purchase, and largely due to the need for the roof to be replaced, which was original at the time.  Pulled the home from the market in August, 2018, then re-financed to do roof/hot water heater, new privacy fence, kitchen upgrades, and some other minor things.  One small credit card balance was also paid off (under 2,000 USD balance).  I did take out a personal loan around the same time to do the roof job, to assist in selling the home, but ultimately it wasn't enough to do the job, and wound up using the funds to bridge the gap between renting an apartment while waiting to sell the home.  

So, as you can see, there was a 5 month window in 2018 when I was paying a mortgage and an apartment rental (we had moved into the apartment nearby, after a solid offer came quickly, moved near closing date, buyer's effort fell through).  We are now considering selling again, in 2021, after the upgrades which are done (roof, water heater, a couple exterior doors, kitchen upgrade, privacy fence).  The reason we are considering selling again is recent home price spikes on my street and in my zip code, roughly up, to around the 200K mark for exact comps.  This is in the Birmingham, AL metro area.  The refi I did in 2018 put my balance at about 125,000, but it is now at about 118,000, in December 2020.  I expect it will be somewhere around that number if I were to attempt to sell in the spring, '21, maybe a few hundred less.  Only one mortgage.

I'm also thinking that this is the right time, as I still need to pay off that personal loan, which is absolutely crushing me, balance currently around 5K, at 28% interest, which I've attempted to renegotiate with the lender (BBVA), with no luck.  I'm given the reason that my credit score is too low, which it is much lower than I would like, ALL due to a personally uncomfortable amount of personal debt (score is about 650, with 0 late payments, write offs, or defaults).  I'm absolutely current on all of my debts, which also include a 2017 Toyota truck (about 10,000 owed), about $15,000 in credit cards/revolving debts, and that 5,000 personal loan at BBVA.  No other outstanding debt.  We do each have a small retirement account balance of around $25K each, which we do not want to use at all.

My wife's and mine income has, fortunately, stayed level through the pandemic.  Not sure what 2021 has in store, but we have stayed on track all year.  Most of these revolving/credit card debts, and the personal loan, were all accumulated prior to 2018, even some as far back as the early 2000's, that we've just never been able to shake off.  I would have liked to move from this location a decade ago, but the housing market fell apart in 2008-2010, and we actually didn't get a recovery in our home value until probably 2014.  And that was just back to what we paid (162K in 2004).  

I see 2021 as the right time.  I'm carrying these debts around my neck like an albatross.  Very high interest rates, lenders won't renegotiate, and home equity is really the best thing I have going, and that's really only due to the pandemic bump in home prices near where I live.  I'm absolutely on board, and she is too, with a relocation to another location not far away (under 200 miles), but we do have the 11 year old in 6th grade, and that's really all that keeps us in this home, in this town.  Afraid to disrupt her education, more than 2020 has already done.  But, this is a very adult matter, and I see the home sale as the answer to help me finally shore up my finances.  I'd expect to clear about 60,000 after commissions and closing costs, and this would allow me to pay off $30K in debt, and still have a small nest egg to start with, for another home purchase a year or two from now.  I'd plan to rent for a year or two, following the home sale, and wife is on board with this too.

Anything else you folks think I should consider?  Sorry for being so long-winded.  It's a heavy burden, a lot to consider, and we are just so undecided, as a couple.  Thanks in advance for your thoughts!",finance

personalfinance,New W-4 form and spouse starting new job,"Hi All,

Hoping to get some insight on this issue regarding my Wife's new job and the new W-4 form.

She started a new job about a month ago and on the old W-4 form she used to claim 3 exemptions (our 2 kids and herself), with no other adjustments made for additional withholdings. She earns 60K a year at her new job; at her previous job she was earning 50K a year. For myself, having been at the same job for 5 years, I've not adjusted my W-4 since starting and have my exemptions set to 2. My income this year will be roughly $150K (factoring in expected bonus).

We've been breaking even pretty much each year come filing time as we prefer not to overpay on taxes. As an example, for this year's filing we received a small federal refund of $400, which is fine, but we both prefer not overpaying if we can avoid.

When she started her new job and we saw the new W-4 form we thought it was simpler at first glance and filled it out using the IRS worksheets. Since we have 2 kids and earn under 400K a year, filing jointly,  she entered the dollar amount for our two children ($4,000), left everything else zero, and she filed it with HR.

Fast forward a couple weeks and she's had no federal tax withheld from her first two paychecks. She checked with payroll to confirm if anything was wrong with the W-4 but they confirmed they calculated her tax withholding using what she provided.

Despite us wanting to try and break even, we also don't want to end up having a surprise tax liability when we file next year. Our tax guy suggested she NOT claim dependents on the W-4 and leave everything zero, but as this is still new to us after so many years using exemptions, we wanted to get other filer's opinions or experience on the matter.

Thanks much!

My auto debit email popped up this morning which prompted me to log in and review the statements today.

We  bought a new couch on 07/19/2020 for $1401.69. No interest for 6 months. Why pay it all upfront if I can do smaller payments for free??  Right??? I never paid attention to my auto debit payments not adding up  to pay off the cost of the couch in that 6 months. It would have left a $100 balance.

The fine print shows that if we did not make a payoff payment by 01/11/2021  - we would get charged $659.29 in deferred interest on the couch. Almost HALF the price of the couch just in interest fees had I not checked this!

MachineLearning,[D] AlphaFold2 in context and detail - Mohammed AlQuraishi,"Well-known expert in structural biology reviewed AlphaFold2 after CASP14 conference here: [https://moalquraishi.wordpress.com/2020/12/08/alphafold2-casp14-it-feels-like-ones-child-has-left-home/](https://moalquraishi.wordpress.com/2020/12/08/alphafold2-casp14-it-feels-like-ones-child-has-left-home/)

It's not a shortest article (10k words), so here are the most interesting quotes IMO:

&gt;In a twist of irony the community most directly affected by this development—in some ways negatively affected on a personal level as AlphaFold2 (AF2) essentially obsoletes at least parts of our research programs—has been the most unanimous in its agreement on the significance of AF2’s advance (although certainly not wholly unanimous).  
&gt;  
&gt;CASP14 organizers quantified the difficulty of this year’s targets and found them to be harder than those of the few previous CASPs, so this was a hard year!  
&gt;  
&gt;I very much dislike to do but feel that I must—call out DeepMind for falling short of the standards of academic communication. What was presented on AF2 at CASP14 barely resembled a methods talk. It was exceedingly high-level, heavy on ideas and insinuations but almost entirely devoid of detail.  
&gt;  
&gt;The new AF2 no longer summarizes the MSA. Instead, it keeps all raw sequences and iteratively “attends” to them. At step n, AF2 decides which sequences are worth looking at and which can be safely ignored and based on this predicts a distogram. (...) The second big change that DeepMind made is to reformulate the entire pipeline, from raw MSA to final predicted structure, to be end-to-end differentiable. (...) At some point, either after a fixed or learned number of iterations in distogram-space, AF2 generates what is likely a 3D point cloud that is then fed into an SE(3)–equivariant transformer. (...) AF2 incorporates taking structural homologs directly as inputs along with the MSA.  
&gt;  
&gt;For training, AF2 consumed something like 128 TPUs for several weeks. That’s a lot of compute by academic standards but is not surprising for this type of problem. What is surprising however is the amount of compute needed for inference, i.e., making new predictions. According to Demis Hassabis, depending on the protein, they used between 5 to 40 GPUs for hours to days. Although they phrased this as “moderate” it is anything but for inference purposes. It is in fact an insane amount given that they are not doing any MD and has me perplexed.  
&gt;

Bitcoin,Explaining present and future volatility of Bitcoin,"Good explanation from 
Saifedean Ammous. 2018. The Bitcoin Standard: The Decentralized Alternative to Central Banking (1st. ed.). Wiley Publishing.

Bitcoin's volatility derives from the fact that its supply is utterly inflexible and not responsive to demand changes, because it is programmed to grow at a predetermined rate. For any regular commodity, the variation in demand will affect the production decisions of producers of the commodity: an increase in demand causes them to increase their production, moderating the rise in the price and allowing them to increase their profitability, while a decrease in demand would cause producers to decrease their supply and allow them to minimize losses. 

A similar situation exists with national currencies, where central banks are expected to maintain relative stability in the purchasing power of their currencies by setting the parameters of their monetary policy to counteract market fluctuations. With a supply schedule utterly irresponsive to demand, and no central bank to manage the supply, there will likely be volatility, particularly at the early stages when demand varies very erratically from day to day, and the financial markets that deal with Bitcoin are still infant.

But as the size of the market grows, along with the sophistication and the depth of the financial institutions dealing with Bitcoin, this volatility will likely decline. With a larger and more liquid market, the daily variations in demand are likely to become relatively smaller, allowing market makers to profit from hedging price variations and smoothing the price. This will only be achieved if and when a large number of market participants hold bitcoins with the intent of holding onto them for the long term, raising the market value of the supply of bitcoins significantly and making a large liquid market possible with only a fraction of the supply. 

Should the network reach a stable size at any point, the flow of funds in and out of it would be relatively equal and the price of bitcoin can stabilize. In such a case, Bitcoin would gain more stability while also having enough liquidity to not move significantly with daily market transactions. But as long as Bitcoin continues to grow in adoption, its appreciation attracts more adopters to it, leading to further appreciation, making this drop in volatility further away. As long as Bitcoin is growing, its token price will behave like that of a stock of a startup achieving very fast growth.

Should Bitcoin's growth stop and stabilize, it would stop attracting high-risk investment flows, and become just a normal monetary asset expected to appreciate slightly every year.",cryptocurrency

economy,Bailing out the financial system,"Hey guys, here is a little resume on how central banks/commercial banks operate and have bailed out the economy just **before COVID** started. I would appreciate some feedback as I would like to share this content with people with low financial knowledge.

Fractional reserve banking is not exactly how the banking system operates right now, to understand how the banking system works, it would be interesting to analyze the baking structure through a credit lending process and unwrap step by step all financial engineering build on the background. 

To make it as simple as possible, let’s simulate the process of an individual taking out a mortgage to buy a house, since the currency is borrowed from a commercial bank (buyer) to the transaction of the currency to another bank (seller), the seller's deposit account. Every step visualized in both balance sheets of the commercial banks.

At first the loan is created when the customer borrows currency, the balance sheet of the buyer bank looks like this:

https://preview.redd.it/2cxbm6oej0461.png?width=463&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60447f551df89623ee1aca083d437ef57c164d51

In the asset side of the commercial bank appears the loan, in the liability side, the borrower's account is credited with a new deposit. At this moment money is created out of nothing with the loan matching the other side of the balance sheet. Bank deposits are simply a record of how much the bank itself owes its customers. So, they are a liability of the bank, not an asset that could be lent out. Realize that the bank’s business model relies on receiving a higher interest rate on the loans (or other assets) than the rate it pays out on its deposits. It is important to mention that the repayment of this loan exempting the interest, destroys the same amount.

Proceeding with the house purchase, this is how the transaction between banks look like when the house buyer and the seller settle the transaction:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7j137e8ij0461.png?width=1088&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81688ef5030999d745618dbbda1b0073f0a88b92

As seen in the figure, deposits are transferred to the seller’s bank along with reserves, which the buyer’s bank uses to settle the transaction. Unfortunately for the buyer bank settling all transactions in this way would be unsustainable, the buyers bank could run out of reserve to meet possible outflows or reserve requirements which fixes a Deposit/Reserve ratio limiting potential loan demand.

Under this scenario, a withdrawal or a potential loan lent, could place the buyer's bank under the minimum reserve requirement. Being a commercial bank in this position, it is necessary to borrow liquidity in the repo market. Also, banks with excess reserves are in the opposite situation, lending liquidity in the repo market in exchange of earnings. 

The Repo market is an over the counter (OTC) market where financial products are traded between two parties in exchange of cash, generally treasuries as are the pristine collateral with low risk. This is how the exchange looks like between two entities:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/er1ukuitj0461.png?width=1287&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51691748f61b4cc61f36b991a01ff0204df7305b

Institutional investors lend cash in exchange of collateral typically T-Bonds as we mentioned, after a short maturity generally a few days the bank buys-back the treasury at a slightly higher price, earning the counterpart a little profit.

To keep in context with the FED policies, central bank uses net transactions data reported by commercial banks for a particular computation period (few weeks) to calculate reserve requirements applying the reserve ratios. If the commercial bank reserve is less than the reserve requirement, it must borrow from the discount window. That means borrowing directly from the central bank which lends at an interest rate usually 1% higher than the repo market rate. Basically, it is much cheaper to borrow from the repo market than directly from the central bank.

On September 2019 a disruption in the repo market led to a sharp spike in short-term interest rates, shown in the chart below:

https://preview.redd.it/l9gj3b43k0461.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3eadeaa8f076b0927b578142399273b6bef0bd7

As we described before, trying to find liquidity to cover lack of reserves, commercial banks found out this scenario. Institutions refused to lend for treasuries and asked a higher rate, as a consequence, the rise in liquidity demand made the repo rate to sky-rocket forcing the central bank to step in.

Realize that liquidity problems were already hitting the economy even before the COVID crises. This reveal how commercial banks are in the edge of insolvency as they need liquidity to keep issuing loans that make them earn with some interest and keep the business afloat.

However, like in 2008, the FED intervened with Quantitative easing (QE) program. This monetary policy tool is not necessarily inflationary as the general public believe. In this situation is generally used to recapitalize the banking sector. Let’s draw how a commercial bank balance sheet looks like after a central bank QE purchase:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xtfsnm8up0461.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=287af589041d4dd6d3f53ddb8dd1228b2a224365

Notice that central bank liabilities are the same reserves as the commercial bank’s assets during all the process, reserves are under the central bank umbrella. At first, the bank is under the minimum reserve requirement and owns all kinds of assets (T, MBS…). In this case a treasury, and the FED is directly purchasing it, adding the asset in its balance sheet and creating reserves out of nowhere in its liabilities side which mirrors the commercial bank’s assets. As we mentioned before this is not directly inflationary but provides the commercial bank with new reserves extending the loan facility to a new level, QE basically greases the printing machine.

Additionally, QE is used to manipulate interest rates. The chart below shows how interest rates are adjusted according to the increase or decrease of bank reserves. When reserves grow, interest rates decrease. And when reserves decrease interest rates rise.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yddn6gcsk0461.png?width=930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba064a24aaf98ee479451b23d2fd127ba3e1c4cb

So, QE is also implemented to keep interest rates low to incentive corporations to borrow. As interest rates goes to 0% demand for credit grows.

The following chart shows how interest rates are kept artificially low as the big debt cycle is broken since 2008.

I (21f) am in my senior year of college, and will be attending medical school next year. I have about $4,000 saved and $20,000 in federal student loan debt. I recently found out that my school will owe me $8,000 at the end of the year due to scholarships/returned room and board from last year. So, $20,000 in debt and $12,000 saved at the end of the year. A portion of it will need to go toward moving and living expenses for the first couple of months before loans kick in, though I would like to get a summer job to mitigate these costs if the pandemic is in a better state.
 I'm not sure what to do, frankly, because I don't think I should use it to pay down my debt (as I would if I was done with school) since I will be taking out $160,000+ out over the course of medical school. I currently plan to keep the majority of it saved (ideally in a HYSA) in case of emergencies of some sort or another during medical school, but I do feel like I should do something ""productive"" with a portion of it.

personalfinance,1st Mortgage refi to lower interest rate and payoff portion of HELOC,"Wife (40) and I (46) are currently assessing refinancing our mortgage. Talking to a broker we used last year for a cash out refi + HELOC for a remodel of our existing home. We both have really stable professional jobs and aren't planning on going anywhere for at least 10-15 years. We completely remodeled the house since we like where we're located and we got a good deal on the house when we bought it 9 years ago. 

We currently have a $476k mortgage at 3.875% with a variable rate HELOC of $102k (currently 4%). Our broker offered to refinance $548k at 2.799%, leaving $35k in the variable HELOC.  Is this a good rate swap?

The broker also mentioned paying off the remainder HELOC with a 401k loan as an option. Last year, to build up cash for our remodel, we reduced our contributions to our retirement plans to employer match and stopped Roth IRA contributions. We were maxing contributions before then. We haven't increased our contributions yet, so we could pay down the HELOC. It won't be long before we hit income limit for Roth, especially without reducing our income with 401k contributions.

Would it make any sense to go the 401k loan route to pay off the HELOC balance, so we can go back to maxing out our contributions?

personalfinance,Rebalancing 401k and Cash,"Hi All,

I am a 34M with a 32F spouse, a three year old son and two dogs. I am starting to get a little worried about retirement and having a college fund for my son. We have always been conscious about a budget. Since we dropped our savings into a new house a few years ago, we have gotten lazy and ignored where money is going.

The more I read into investing, retirement and where to put money, the more i get confused, especially the tax implications. I need advice on what do with our current cash, and how to adjust our 401k's moving forward to right the ship.

Assets - house valued at approximately 480k (zestimate), 23k in traditional 401k from previous employer, 25k in pension (school system, possibly more than double due to matching, need to verify), 21k in cash (will double in 2-3 months, explained later), about 40k in two vehicles, 1k in new ROTH 401k from new employer, brand new 403b

Monthly payments:

Mortgage - 2254 - just refinanced 373k for 30 years at 2.875%. House appraised value on loan is 460k so paying pmi for about another 2 years at 54 a month

Daycare - 1565

Utilities - 400 - internet, electric, water, gas, spotify

Car payment - 500 - just bought a new plug-in hybrid 2021 rav4 prime. 28k for 60 months at 2.14% will basically never have to pay for gas nor extra electric due to my commuting requirements and free charger at work.

Car insurance - 160

Groceries - 300

Miscellaneous/Fun - 600 - gas, pets, home warranty, dining out, alcohol, entertainment, vacations, etc.

Combined Income - 145k - 78k + 67k - take home is currently about 8k per month

Zero student loans or credit card debt. We exclusively used credit cards for most purchases to get the additional rewards, and pay statement balances every month to avoid interest.

My initial thoughts on a game plan:

The doubling in current cash will be due to no mortgage payments until February, escrow refund from previous mortgage and our tax refund. Getting a cool 7500 federal tax credit for purchasing a phev!

By my calculations, we have about 2,200 coming into cash every month. Let's just call it 2000 due to estimation in miscellaneous/fun and groceries categories.

Adjust the 401k on the 78k salary from 5% Roth to 25% traditional. Luckily my plan gives the option, and to even split. It would bump from 150 to 750. I started this job in June, and previous employer for two years didn't only offered a Roth with no matching and didn't do it, so really got behind on retirement/investing. (I think) this will near max it out, as well as lower our taxable income a considerable amount. This will bring us down about 1200 per month, so should still have 500+ surplus in cash every month.

Keep 25k in a high yield savings account for an emergency fund. We are almost done with a basement remodel. Will cost about another 5k to finish.

Get rid of pmi:

1. May 2021 will be five years since owning our house, and we would only have to pay about 5k towards principal to get under 80% loan to value.

2. Once the carpet is installed in two weeks, get a 500 dollar reappraisal. I'm 100% confident the reappraisal will be at least 467000, which will put us under 80% ltv. Two houses sold in our neighborhood for 500k+ this year, so we could even hit 75% ltv if the appraisal is 497k+.

3. Correct me if I'm wrong, but everything I'm reading states it doesn't matter what the lender/contract says. Once ltv and ownership hits the threshold, and you can request it be taken off, and they have to abide (dude).




If all my math is right, we will have about 10-15k left over in cash.  What should I do with the extra 10-15k? Roth IRA? 529 for college? Bumping emergency fund to 30k may not be a bad idea. We are trying for a second kid, TBD at the moment. Keep in savings to have in 12-14 months for additional daycare costs?

Should I do anything with the old 401k or just let it sit? It's in a target date fund, and the return was 10.79% this year thus far.

Thanks in advance! I've already learned so much from this subreddit, and will be forever grateful for the knowledge and experiences shared to it.",finance

At first, the bank is under the minimum reserve requirement and owns all kinds of assets (T, MBS…). In this case a treasury, and the FED is directly purchasing it, adding the asset in its balance sheet and creating reserves out of nowhere in its liabilities side which mirrors the commercial bank’s assets. As we mentioned before this is not directly inflationary but provides the commercial bank with new reserves extending the loan facility to a new level, QE basically greases the printing machine.

Additionally, QE is used to manipulate interest rates. The chart below shows how interest rates are adjusted according to the increase or decrease of bank reserves. When reserves grow, interest rates decrease. And when reserves decrease interest rates rise.

So, QE is also implemented to keep interest rates low to incentive corporations to borrow. As interest rates goes to 0% demand for credit grows.

The following chart shows how interest rates are kept artificially low as the big debt cycle is broken since 2008.

[https://cryptobriefing.com/btc-e-saga-ends-prison-time-founder/](https://cryptobriefing.com/btc-e-saga-ends-prison-time-founder/)

Alexandr Vinnik was jailed recently laundering $4 billion worth of BTC, and that made headlines pretty much everywhere, but none of these outlets are getting into the paramilitaries or oligarchs or any of that stuff. Most of that BTC came from Mt. Gox (!) and that's rarely mentioned. They're making out like Vinnik was just some money guy who broke the rules.

Apparently the Russian federalists who shot down Malaysian Flight 17 and killed like 300 people bought BTC-e when Vinnik got arrested, so they were already involved somehow. The current ""owner"" (the new version of the BTC-e exchange is down now, exit scam) is literally the guy handing over the black box from the crashed plane in this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxYmDOe7vE&amp;feature=emb\_title&amp;ab\_channel=LastNews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdxYmDOe7vE&amp;feature=emb_title&amp;ab_channel=LastNews).

They're all paramilitary fighters/terrorists/whatever. They were funded by this war-mongering oligarch sanctioned by the EU for terrorism in Donbass.

And then there's all the shit Vinnik got up to when he was active. He ended up wanted in three countries, he went on hunger strike, it seems like Russia literally invented charges just to file extradition claims so the US couldn't interrogate him for his involvement in the attacks on the Democratic National Committee.

Seriously, what the fuck is this story?

stocks,RKT and lower mortgage rates,"RKT saw a big pump to 30 and then a slide back down to the 20's after earnings in September. most of the slide back down was due to RKT having the majority of their revenue from refinancing, and investors worrying about the low margin business, their classification as a tech company (rather than a lending institution) and their ability to compete/innovate. Also, a dependence on interest rates.

There was a post recently about RKT and the way mortgage companies structure to avoid transferring risk from parent to child organizations: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k5jws2/a_point_of_view_on_rkt/

It made me think and gave me pause. I'm in RKT, but not more than 1% of my portfolio. I came across this article today: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/09/mortgage-rates-set-14th-record-low-of-the-year.html

If interest rates remain historically low, and refinancing is hitting all-time highs, RKT could be a big short term winner of this cycle.

If this trend maintains, RKT could see another pump prior to earnings, but the next earnings aren't planned for release until end of January 2021.

So for any RKT bagholders, you probably have at least 6 more weeks of bagholding before you know whether you're holding forever or get the pump to get off this train.

RKT is currently trading at its IPO price of $20, and I would say anything below $21 is a good entry point. I would exit about 50% of my position around $30 after the next pump, and then ride the next 50% based on macro factors at the time.",finance

stocks,Ray Dalio's (Bridgewater associates founder) response to a question about in an AMA about the future of markets with the current situation of money flow to stocks and equity!,"AMA question: Good afternoon Ray,
With the fed buying corporate debt, money being pumped into markets, and economic cost of lockdowns, do you believe current equity prices are “a house of cards” with higher inflation coming and what would you advise to hedge? All the best.

Ray's response: I believe that with the enormous amount of debt and money that has been created and will be created in the future, the most important thing to pay attention to is  the value of debt and money relative to the value of assets and other currencies. I described in my book ""Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises"" which you can get free here, the monetary policy that is going on now, which I call monetary policy 3 (MP3) and which is the central government borrowing a lot of money that the central bank prints to direct it to where they believe it needs to go. I know that this is necessary now and at the same time know that not enough attention is being paid to whether this debt and money is going into things that will produce broad-based productivity gains. As for stocks, they compete with bonds. With bond interest rates where they are, bonds are trading at roughly 75x earnings. With the amount of money out there, and cash being such a bad alternative, there's no good reason that stocks couldn't trade at 50x earnings. You get the idea. Just like you never might have expected bond yields to be at or slightly above 0% (unless you studied history), you might not be comfortable with these kinds of multiples for stocks. However, all investments compete with each other and where would you prefer. I would recommend smart diversification in terms of a) asset classes, b) currencies, and c) countries.",finance
personalfinance,Using retirement accounts to pay for grad school?,"I'm hoping to go back to school for a full-time master's degree in two years. I want to figure out how to optimally plan for it financially. It seems to me like I could potentially take advantage of tax savings by using retirement accounts to save. Some potentially relevant details about my financial situation:

* Income: 90k (+10k bonus)
* Bank account: 20k
* Retirement accounts: 35k in traditional 401k (company contributes 4.5%), 15k in Roth IRA

My tentative plan is to continue to max my 401k and Roth IRA. Assuming 0% gains, this would leave me with \~80k in my traditional 401k, \~25k in my Roth IRA, and \~60k in my savings account (assuming I continue to save at roughly the current rate). Once I start school, my plan is to roll the 401k into a traditional IRA and then convert the traditional IRA to a Roth IRA over the course of the time I'm in school. Since I don't expect to have much income while I'm in school, I'd be able to take advantage of lower tax rates at conversion. I would then withdraw a portion of my contributions to pay for my expenses (since they're education expenses, I should be be exempt from the five-year rule). Since it would be from a Roth IRA, I wouldn't need to pay any penalties or additional taxes. I expect that I'll need around 100k in total over the course of my degree, meaning that I would need to withdraw \~40% of my contributions.

Does this plan make sense? I know that conventional wisdom is to avoid withdrawing from your retirement accounts, but this seems strictly better than saving less in my 401k and putting the rest in a savings account for school expenses because of the tax advantages. It feels to me like this plan should work, but I'm not sure if there are some glaring considerations I missed. Thoughts?

Note: student loans are not an option for me because I am not a US citizen so I don't qualify for federal loans and would need a permanent resident cosigner for any private loans.",finance

personalfinance,Change of Address on Reliacard Account --Account Frozen,"I moved in September. Like a reasonable person, I updated the address on my Reliacard account (unemployment debit card). The next day, I attempted to use my reliacard. Transaction declined. Checked my mobile account, no notices as to what the issue could be. Plenty of money in account. After calling and being on hold for close to 2 hours, spoke with an associate that told me the address change flagged my account and its been frozen. Ask how to remedy, told to FAX a copy of my driver's license along with a piece of mail showing I receive mail at the new address since my ID shows my old address (same county/state as old address, but didn't want to head to the DMV just yet, as we're in the middle of a PANDEMIC). I oblige, and send my ID along with my official change of address from USPS. I'm told the fax could take 7 to 10 days to verify. Wait 7 days, account still frozen. I call back, and am told the official change of address from USPS is not recognized as official mail by the Federal government. Even though it was SENT from the federal government. I digress. I'm told I need to fax my ID and a BILL with my new address. Woulda been nice to know the first time. I speak with a supposable manager on this phone call as well, as I'm heated, and a week out from not having access to my bank account. I'm assured that ""Sherry, the Manager"" will put a notice on my account, and if I fax the correct info within the hour, my account will be cleared. I oblige, with a fire under my ass and get that bologna faxed. Am told this transaction will take no longer than 4 days. I wait 4 days, call back am told I was given the wrong info by Manager Sherry and it could still take up to 10 days. At this point, they have no record of my previous chat with Sherry the Manager.  I'm told to call back in 6 days. I call back, they don't have recprd of the 2nd fax being revceived, I'm told to wait it out a couple more days, could actually take up to 14 days. I resubmit this info again via fax. For a third time. 

In the meantime, I've received a letter from Reliacard saying they've received my change of address, and there's no need to take further action. But my account is STILL frozen. Associates can't see where my faxed info has been received and cleared, am told they don't have access to the account to clear it.

At this point, I'm livid. I've been slogging my unemployment pay into an account I have no access to for close to 3 months. Can't even transfer money to my actual bank account. USBank, which is in charge of relicard is making interest off MY money. I've asked each Reliacard associate who's going to pay my late fees on bills that are adding up, and credit card fees that are piling on since I'm unable to pay my account off monthly. I never carry a balance on my credit card, and now, here I am. I'm furious, and frustrated. How can a bank be 'offline' in the 21st century. IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC, WITH MILLIONS OF AMERICANS UNEMPLOYED!? How can this company be so incompetent!? And employees be so under trained that no one gives the same info?

I'm thinking about changing my address back to my old address, as there's now an area to upload an ID to your account. I've now ended up with Covid and am in quarantine. Really not a time to head to the DMV. I don't usually receive mail from Reliacard, so I'm wondering if there would be a disadvantage to this? The only downside I can see is if they insist on mailing a new debate card once my account is finally unlocked. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this stupid mess. Any insight would be VERY much appreciated. I also want others to know that from the research I've done, Reliacard has been freezing a lot of accounts for transactions that otherwise wouldn't look shady to other banks. And think twice before updating info on your account, heaven forbid!",finance

personalfinance,"In debt, is selling condo to 'reset' a good idea?","Hey everyone, I have about $27,000 in debt, mostly on credit cards. Very bad debt, high interest rate. It's tanked my credit score over the last two years. I own the condo I live in, and could sell it to make about $76,000. I was hoping to be able to sell this place and move into a new larger place, but haven't been able to prequalify with a lender, debt/income ratio being a big issue.

Last night I was discussing the problem with friends, and one suggested the simple option of selling the condo, paying off all debt, and renting. In the past I had discounted renting, since it would be \~$400-$700 more per month than my mortgage, but doing the math I'm paying \~$1,200 towards debt every month, so it makes sense to make the trade and pay more towards rent and save on debt payments. I'm expecting to be able to rent in my area between $1,400-$1,800 per month.

My question is, with the remaining $49,000 how long does it make sense to stay in a rental? I was told that once my debt is paid off I should only need 1-2 months for my credit score to go back up, which would make it easier to get into a new place using what's left of my $49k as a down payment.

personalfinance,Nanny leaving my position; trying to sort out tax responsibility and 1099 v W2,"Hey - looking for some advice and feedback to make sure I’m prepared for a conversation about taxes! 

I have been working for 4 months for a family as a tutor/nanny in the US. I have been working about 35 hours per week, and I have an hourly rate I negotiated with the family to help three kids with online schooling and more traditional nanny responsibilities. I will be leaving this role to start a job in my field, and want to wrap up all tax-related questions before I leave at the end of this week. 

At the beginning of my work; I had a conversation with the parent and they mentioned that they would be writing my wages off through the company they own. They suggested I look into forming an LLC to pay me through; but after I did some research I found out that I would still be responsible for the same amount of Medicare, Social Security costs, and federal income tax (I live in a state without state income tax), as an LLC would still have to pay employee taxes to employees - even if I was the only member. I did not form an LLC and told them I would not be pursuing that route, and that was never mentioned again nor was it an issue. 
 
They pays me weekly through a bank transfer, and pays the full amount of rate x hours worked (meaning he has been withholding no money from my wages). I have personally been putting 30% of my wages into a dedicated savings account to prepare for taxes at the end of the year. (12% for federal income tax; 15.3% for self-employment tax, and a little bit of a buffer). 

Fast forward to my 2 questions: 

1. How do I report this income on my 2020 taxes, and what should I get in writing from this family to ensure I have all the necessary information and details? I would think that I would file using a 1099-MISC, but I am unsure if I have to provide this form or if this family will provide the form and information. We did not talk specifically about taxes or tax burden at the beginning of our working arrangement, which is a mistake I realize in hindsight!

2. I had been lurking in the nanny Reddit thread and was reading many posts about the grey issue of a ‘nanny tax’. It seems that the common theme was that a nanny is a household employee, and that the family ‘should’ be shouldering some amount of the employee taxes. It was also mentioned multiple times that treating a nanny as an independent contractor instead of a household employee was a type of tax evasion. 

Question: do I raise this issue with the family? If they claim me through the company as a contractor, will there be negative legal action for me if that is disputed or uncovered? I am not willing to commit any portion of tax fraud and want to make sure I am not unknowingly messing up!

Bitcoin,The Bitcoin Singularity theory,"As the Bitcoin network gets fed by global participants, it ends up debasing all currencies. Individuals and institutions will not want their currencies to get debased, and the only safe haven for their assets will become the Bitcoin monetary network.

This feedback loop makes the network grow exponentially, as it feeds on the worlds monetary supply.

The problem is that it can’t just shoot up 10000000% in one run, because the existing financial network needs time to absorb it.

So then, it retraces, and consolidates before the next 30x run. That's why we are seeing these bubbles.

So then we have this channel of monetary energy feeding into crypto through Bitcoin as an intermediary, and some of that energy “leaks” to some of the altcoins, which causes even bigger percentage movements for some of them due to their low market caps.

What this means, is that Bitcoin is approaching &amp;infinity dollars as it feeds from the existing fiat system, whilst fiat will see exponential debasement

My credit score is obviously in the dumps right now. I'm trying to raise my score in the next 6 months so it doesn't become an issue when I go to a sign a new lease in May/June. I have some investments in the form of a standard investment account as well as an IRA I inherited from a deceased family member. I just got off the phone with the federal loan office and I have three options: 

1: I pay off my loans in full (or compromise at 90% of the full balance) and the defaulted loan and the record of such is immediately is removed from my credit history. 

2: I set up a payment plan, after 3 consecutive monthly payments, I can consolidate my loan. The new loan will go into good standing (not defaulted) but the record of the loan will remain on my credit report until 6 months of consecutive payments have passed (9 months from today).

3: I pay 9 consecutive months of the payment plan and my loan is rehabilitated. The loan goes into good standing (removed from default) and the record of my default is removed from my credit score. 

I don't have enough liquid cash to pay off my loans in full, but I can withdraw from my investments enough to pay off the loan in full. However, my investments have been doing very well and I've had significant returns over the past year in my standard account. I'm wondering, if I go with the second option, if the record of default will impact my credit score enough that it's worth sacrificing the ROI that I would otherwise have keeping my money invested. If it's negligible in terms of my credit score, I would rather keep the cash invested. However, I also understand that waiting another three months before the default loan even goes into good standing is probably not a great idea in terms of my credit. 

I was also thinking that I could potentially take a loan from my inherited IRA (Vanguard investment fund retirement target 2025, so it has slow gains and stable right now) to pay off the loan in full now and set up a repayment schedule to avoid a huge tax penalty for early withdrawal. However, since my IRA is inherited I know there are slightly different rules regarding contributions, etc. but I'm not sure if IRA loans fall under those rules. 

I know the longer I wait the worse my credit will get, but as a newbie to being fiscally responsible I'm looking for input, advice, suggestions from people who are more knowledgeable/responsible than me. 

As a tack on, I also have credit card debt of about $400. Around the same period my student loans went into default I also went into bad standing with my credit card issuer, but that has been corrected as of about 5-6 months ago. If I pay off that balance in full will that record of delinquency be removed from my credit score as well?

Possible relevant details: I'm 30, credit history of 11 years. Prior to about 2 years ago when I let things slide, my credit score was right around the fair-good range, but I didn't have a lot of credit history in those 11 years. As of right now, my AGI is about 20k/year, including what I take from my investment account to live off of. 

Again, yes I was/am an idiot. Thank you in advance to everyone who reads this and is willing to offer advice!",finance

personalfinance,Buying out my car lease,"I have a 2018 Toyota RAV4 which I can buy at lease end (January 1) for $17,800 and after fees just under $20,000. (I see similar models with more mileage going for more than 20k online) I’ve had it for 3 years and have only put 30,000 miles on it. Over the course of the three years the monthly payments were $270 and the interest rate the dealership offered was 4.5% but I have excellent credit and through the local credit union I think I could do better with a rate. I could buy it outright but it would hurt too bad to see 20k disappear from my savings. For reference if it matters I make 75k a year.

I will be traveling for work from Feb 1-June 1 and will not need a car. 

After that, I will have a company car and will only need my own car for personal use. 

Because my mileage is low, rav4s retain their value and I know my cars history (once hit by a coworker in the parking lot) I am considering purchasing the car. My other option which feels less sexy is getting rid of my lease and buying an older higher mileage car for under $10,000 after my work trip. I would keep that until I can’t take it anymore (or my income finally breaks $100,000) and buy myself something used but nicer.

Is it reckless to buy an older preowned car when it feels like I’m getting a deal on my lease? Is it reckless to buy the lease when I’m going to be using the car so infrequently? Please help!",finance

personalfinance,I have excess money per pay check and I don't know what to do with it. Any tips on how can I manage it responsibly?,"I did not grow up with wealth and my family has this awful habit of spending money as soon as you get it. I do not want to do that. Recently, after moving with my SO into a cheaper apartment, I am excessing about $500-$1000 a month. I finally developed a stable emergency fund With Marcus (the interest rate used to be good) but I'm not sure where to place this excess. I opened an automated investing account with sofi but im only throwing an extra 100 a month in there. So far I've made about an extra 30 bucks with that which is nice considering all savings account interest rates are garbage right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if anyone has any insight on what else should I do with it. I'm not savvy with stocks or investing. I do have about 50k in student loans, and I have been paying almost double of the monthly payments. Should I keep adding to my savings, put more into my sofi account or perhaps toss it all into my student loans?

personalfinance,What's the sweet spot between paying off debt/investing for a 23-yr old?,"Hi reddit, I'm looking for advice on how to balance debt/investing for my financial goals. Going to try to include any relevant details I can think of, so this will be long.

I'm 24 years old, single, and started a job as an accountant at a public firm recently that offers health and dental insurance.

Since I'm living at home right now, my monthly expenses are pretty low. I have \~$18k of federal student loans. The minimum required payment is $186/mo, but I have been and plan on continuing to make payments much higher than that. I currently have my auto pay set up for $400/mo.

I've typed out my monthly expenses (includes everything from my phone bill to a personal allowance and takeout) in Excel and estimate that I should have around $1,500 leftover to use how I see fit. This is post-tax and factors in my $400 loan payment. Even if I'm missing some things, I think a conservative estimate would be $1,000 a month leftover.

I am currently putting \~$300/mo towards a 401(k) my employer set up. On the retirement company's website, it looks like I can alter what % I want to go towards ROTH vs traditional? I currently have it all going towards ROTH, which I'm not completely certain is best for me or not.

Honestly I have no experience with investing and have pretty minimal knowledge when it comes to finance. I may have an accounting degree, but financial topics to do with stock, etc. never really clicked for me. All I know is that I'd probably use somewhere like E-Trade or Charles Schwab and buy some index funds--unless anyone has other suggestions.

The only ""plans"" I have for the future is potentially moving out, but I don't see that happening any sooner than 1-2 years from now. Don't plan on buying a car or making any other major purchases any time soon (maybe not until 5+ years from now?). So basically my only financial goals are to get my student debt paid off and get some money invested for when I do want to say buy a car or something. FYI I already have $15k in savings, so well above the recommended 3-6 monthly expense savings. Not sure if I need to put at least some of what I already have in savings to use, in addition to my monthly income.

So--any advice on how much $$$ I should put towards my loans versus investing--assuming I have $1,000-$1,500 a month to use however? For the investment piece, any preference on putting that towards my 401(k) versus opening a new account? I think I'm leaning towards upping my loan payments since I would love to be debt-free sooner, but I don't want to needlessly rush to pay them off when I could be putting some of that money to better use. Theoretically, I could put an additional $300 (for a total of $700) a month towards my student loans and have them paid off in about 2 years.

EDIT:  Interest rates on my student loans range from 3.510%-4.800%",finance

gaming,Question about open world games,"Hello /r/gaming,

As everyone, I'm looking into cyberpunk right now, however, I am unsure if I will like it or not.

Sorry for the strange post. Basically, I played a bunch of open world games. Some I like, some I don't, but I never managed to pinpoint the reason why I liked some and why I disliked others.

Basically, the first ones I tried, I hated the fact that most games tend to hold your hand for about 15 minutes, then drop you in the middle of nowhere and have you walk 3 hours and die all the time before you get somewhere.

My first experience with an open world game was Morrowind, which I just gave up after 3 hours of gameplay (that was a long time ago when I was maybe too young to understand that type of game). 

Here is a list of games I tried and disliked:

* Morrowind (gave up after 2-3 hours)
* Skyrim (stopped after 10 hours)
* GTA vice city (maybe like 8 hours)
* Fallout : new vegas (5-6 hours)
* Fallout 4 (10-15 hours)
* Witcher 1 (the controls are atrocious, maybe 45 minutes)
* Witcher 2 (just meh, maybe 1 hour)
* The outer wilds (Current game because I don't have much else to play, but I doubt I'll finish the main story, I am just about to get fed up at 15 hours)

In general, I like single player shooters, so if the shooting part is very good, I can deal with the rest, which isn't the case for those. I also find that you spend most of your time walking around and doing nothing other than shooting repetitive monsters with shitty guns, or having boring dialogs.

These games are amongst the best I have ever played.

* Entire Mass effect series (andromeda doesn't exist)
* Witcher 3

In the case of Mass Effect, I loved the dialogs, the atmoshpere, and Shepard is just a serious badass. Shooting down a fucking reaper was fantastic.

Geralt is one of the best character in the entire gaming industry. The sarcasm, the depth of every quest and characters and the gorgeous graphics made this game unbelievably good, enough for me to have gone through it 3 times.

Random games that I like for some reasons

* Mad Max (I am a car guy, and I like the car fights. The ambiance is also nice, everything else sucks)
* Red Dead Redemption 2 (graphics, characters and ambiance are amazing, controls are atrocious and I spent a bit too much time running around)

Based on the reviews, do you guys think Cyberpunk will closer to witcher/mass effect, or closer to the bethesda games?

Bonus: Anyone can recommend a bunch of games that I might have missed?

Thanks guys!",technology

personalfinance,Advice for post graduation debt/finances?,"Hey everyone! So I do not have a strong finance background (and neither does anyone in my family) so I could use some guidance. 

I will be graduating college in May 2021 with roughly 60k in debt. Half of that is private loans with awful interest rates (ranging from 9-11%). The other 30k is federal loans. 

I will also be needing to lease or buy a car (I am not sure which would be better for me either). Any advice here is appreciated too! 

I start my post-grad job in July and my yearly salary will be roughly ~85k before taxes are taken out. My job does offer tuition reimbursement of 5.5k a year to pay off loans. 

I do have a savings account of roughly 30k. What I think is most wise is to use all of that money to pay off my private loans, especially because the interest rate is so high. I can use whatever money that is left to put towards a car. 

I am hoping to move out of my mom’s house once my loans are manageable and I think paying off the private loans would take a weight off my shoulders. However, my mom wants me to save the money in my savings account and use it for a car downpayment/towards my future apartment. 

In your opinion, how should I manage my finances post graduation? I am stumped. 

All advice is appreciated- thank you!!",finance

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hey, I am finally posting my first PF question! Long story short, I screwed up big time in my twenties and made stupid choices. I've spent the last couple of years fixing my mistakes. I recently won an insurance settlement of 15k. I am trying to decide what to do, and what I should pay off first or do. My current financials are as follows:

\~500 in savings

\~1500 in checking

\~2500 in an IRA

40k in private loans

60k in federal loans (I'm an idiot, I know)

I owe about 9,500 on a car payment note at a 17% interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Presently, I pay $500 every month, although the note is only 315. I carry no other debts because I have successfully been able to chip away at those and correct my past mistakes, although I did spend a little extra on my monthly credit cards this month that I have learned to keep a zero balance by the end of the month. I basically break even every month, enough to pay my loans, car payment, insurance, bills etc.

I am trying to decide what to do with the 15k and how/what to pay. Part of my is like, whooo whooo, buy a bunch of crap with the first 5, but I know better.",finance

I've been trying to pay it off over the years, but I cannot afford a flat pay off. So it's more or less stagnant there.

I've been using my card actively, but I pay off the charges as they come in, so the monthly usage is being paid off, no more accumulation from that point. I round up all the charges, ie for 29.20, I pay 30.00. I doubt this will make a dent in the previous balance.

On good months, I can make a little more payment, say 50 extra, but my finance charge is ~25, so the net payment is 25. Otherwise I pay the finance charge so it doesn't add on to my balance.

Refinancing is not an option, as the interest rates for refinancing are much higher than my credit card rates now, so I prefer to leave it as it is. On the other hand, I don't want to keep that balance, so appreciate any suggestions.

stocks,"AbCellera's (ABCL) IPO: Everything You Need to Know about the Peter Thiel-backed, AI-powered, COVID-treatment approved, Biotech Company","Hi all,

We're excited about AbCellera's IPO and noticed nobody is really paying attention or interested. We've put together an analysis on their IPO below, with diagrams available at our blog post below. Appreciate any feedback and discussion!

**Pre-IPO: Everything you need to know about AbCellera**

* AbCellera is expected to IPO on Nasdaq on **December 10, 2020**; shares are expected to price between $14 to $17 a share, raising as much as $391 million.
* AbCellera is a Vancouver-based AI-powered drug discovery platform with backing from Peter Thiel, known for its leading platform and COVID-19 treatment in partnership with Eli Lilly
* Its most successful antibody (LY-Cov555)/bamlanivimab has recently been granted emergency approval by Health Canada and the FDA - expected to receive &gt;$100mn in royalties
* Its unique, proprietary business model and experienced management &amp; board positions AbCellera for long-term success
* We see AbCellera as a play on LY-Cov555 success and the near-term delivery of other antibody candidates, with the downside of potential headline risk

The Vancouver-based AI drug discovery platform that has caught the eye of investors including Peter Thiel for its leading platform and the development of its COVID-19 treatment with Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), AbCellera Biologics Inc. (the “Company” or “AbCellera”) is set to IPO (NASDAQ: ABCL) with Credit Suisse as lead left underwriter ([prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1703057/000119312520299507/d29983ds1.htm) filed November 20, 2020).

# AbCellera Business Model

AbCellera provides drug developers with a platform to find antibody candidates for drug research. Its AI-powered full-stack platform searches and analyzes real-world immune system databases to find leads that are subsequently used for clinical R&amp;D. Unlike its competitors, AbCellera operates along the entire value chain from sourcing to the delivery of antibody candidates; this solves the existing problem of either inadequate/outdated discovery approaches or using multiple fragmented solutions (costly and inefficient).

It is important to note what AbCellera is not - a drug developer. Instead, Abcellera lends their technology to pharmaceutical companies, both large and small, in hopes of speeding up discovery times for antibody therapies. This in turn leads to cost savings for the drug developer, quicker times to clinical trials, and faster delivery of medical solutions. They define themselves as the “Operating System for Antibody Discovery”.

It follows then that revenues are project driven - the more programs authorized by drug developers, the more fees Abcellera earns. Abcellera sees long term value in the business to be driven off downstream and royalty payments that are more stable and are a consequence of successful discovery programs. We explore this notion later in the article. To summarize, revenues streams are as follows:

1. Licensing / Research Fees (68% of revenue, 9 months ended September 30, 2020): payments for technology access and performing research
2. Milestone Payments (32% of revenue): downstream payments for clinical/commercial milestones
   1. *We note that only one program to date, LY-CoV555 (Eli Lilly), has resulted in milestone payments*
3. Royalties: royalties on net sales of any approved therapeutics
   1. *As of September 30, 2020, AbCellera has yet to receive any royalties*
   2. *Royalties generally will range from low-single digit for non-COVID targets to mid-teens to mid-twenties for COVID targets*

As of September 30, 2020, AbCellera had 94 discovery programs either completed, in-progress, or under contract, with a few public key partnerships below. Some of AbCellera’s recent, public partnerships are as follows:

*Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY)* \- On March 12, 2020, AbCellera and Lilly announced to co-develop antibody therapies for the treatment of COVID-19, the potential treatment LY-CoV555 accelerated due to Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program. As part of the agreement, AbCellera received an upfront payment of $25mn and is entitled to receive an aggregate of up to $29mn of milestone payments. As of September 30, 2020, AbCellera has received $8mn related to LY-CoV555 and is eligible to receive royalties on aggregate sales (including Lilly’s $375mn and $312.5mn contracts with the US government and US Army Contracting Command respectively).

*Invetx* \- On February 23, 2020, AbCellera originally entered a multi-year, multi-target partnership agreement with Invetx. Based on the successful delivery of research programs under the original agreement, the scope of the collaboration has been expanded to include multiple new targets over several years on November 19, 2020.

*Kodiak Sciences (NASDAQ: KOD)*  \- After a successful collaboration in 2016, AbCellera and Kodiak Sciences announced a new partnership on October 29. 2020 to generate therapeutic antibody candidates in ophthalmology.

*IGM Biosciences (NASDAQ: IGMS)* \- AbCellera and IGM Biosciences announced on September 24, 2020, that they have entered into a multi-year, multi-target strategic research collaboration and license agreement to facilitate the discovery and development of novel IgM antibodies.

📷*AbCellera’s solutions to existing challenges.*

📷

*The diagrams above illustrate AbCellera’s partnerships over time; the Company continues to expand partnerships in line with its growth strategy.*

AbCellera’s business strategy (per prospectus) is focused on (i) using the drug discovery platform to unlock new opportunities for therapeutic antibody development; and (ii) allowing partners to access the platform to reduce delays and costs associated with setting up drug discovery capabilities. The firm continues to develop their strategy, building a stronger platform with the idea of higher downstreams royalties negotiated. 📷

*AbCellera’s strategy creates a positive feedback loop through which each round of research program improves the speed and efficiency of the next round of data generation*

# Recent Developments / Company Timeline

1. In March 2020, AbCellera entered into a discovery partnership with Eli Lilly and Company, to perform discovery research for a number of targets for Lilly that will result in antibodies for Lilly to develop and potentially commercialize.
2. In April 2020, AbCellera entered into a multi-year agreement with the Canadian government’s Strategic Innovation Fund, and CAD $175.6mn ($125.6mn) was committed by the Government of Canada, of which &gt;$110mn remains and is intended to be used to build a GMP facility.
3. In June 2020, LY-Cov555 moved to first in-inhuman testing and progressed to Phase 3 clinical trials.
4. In November 2020, LY-CoV555 was granted emergency-use authorization by the FDA and Health Canada. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, AbCellera received an aggregate of $8.0mn upon the satisfaction of clinical milestones by Lilly.
5. In November 2020, AbCellera acquired Trianni for $90.0mn. Trianni develops transgenic mice that provide a source of fully-human antibodies for therapeutic antibody candidates. Trianni mouse technology will allow AbCellera to generate more high-quality antibodies against difficult targets and improve the speed of the discovery programs, which in turn should create higher leverage when negotiating downstream royalties. In addition to strategic value, Trianni also generates revenues through mouse sales, platform licensing fees and associated downstream milestone payments.

**Defining Bamlanivimab**

While any treatment for COVID-19 is big news for the world community, we’d like to emphasize what LY-CoV555/Bamlanivimab  is not - a vaccine, a cure, or even a recovery aid for COVID-19.

Rather, clinical trials showed a 72% reduction in hospitalization rates within patients that have already been diagnosed with COVID-19. We make an analogy and compare the effect of bamlanivimab to blood clotting - it stops from excessive bleeding (hospitalization) when a wound or blood vessel is burst (diagnosis of COVID-19). For already hospitalized patients, studies have shown little to effect in helping patients recover from the advanced stages of COVID-19. Other clinical trials evaluating Bamlanivimab for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms and for recovery purposes remain active.

This carries some short and long term implications. Abcellera will likely benefit both in the short and long term if the treatment becomes widely used in hospitals. They may also receive more milestones and royalty payments from governments and drug developers. However, the growth story will deteriorate as vaccines, which are already in federal approval stages, become available. Vaccines, herd immunity and measures to avoid the spread of COVID-19 will reduce growth opportunities for Bamlanivimab to be a continued factor in Abcellera’s growth. Finally, any royalties from the sale of Bamlanivimab remains unknown as no further disclosures have been made to date.

Nonetheless, the drug received US FDA approval, with Eli Lilly inking an agreement to supply the U.S government to provide 300,000 vials to high risk patients.for a sum of $375,000,000, or \~$1,250 a vial. Health Canada has also approved the use of the treatment.

# Competitive Environment

AbCellera’s current market position as a full-stack service provider provides meaningful barriers to entry, with its primary competitors providing services at some point along its value chain. The integrated nature of AbCellera’s services (provides integrated services from start to end), in addition to the nature of its AI-platform (interconnection and scale enable AI to continuously become more efficient) is a competitive advantage.

That being said, the life sciences and biotech platform technology market is highly competitive; technical competitors at different stages of AbCellera’s platform in the following fields are detailed below:

Single-cell screening: Berkeley Lights Inc. *(NASDAQ: BLI)*, HiFiBio Inc., Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. *(NASDAQ: LGND)*, and Sphere Fluidics Ltd.

Antibody RepSeq: 10X Genomics Inc. *(NASDAQ: TXG)*, Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp. *(NASDAQ: ADPT)*, *Atreca Inc (NASDAQ: BCEL)*. and Distributed Bio Inc.

Bispecific antibody engineering: Abbvie Inc. *(NYSE:ABBV)*, Genmab A/S, Merus N.V. and Zymeworks Inc. *(NYSE:ZYME)*

Discovery using genetically engineered rodents: Ablexis LLC, Crescendo Biologics Ltd., Harbour Antibodies BV, Kymab Ltd., Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc *(NASDAQ: LGND)*. and RenBio Inc.

In addition, AbCellera competes with a variety of fee-for-service contract research organizations, in most cases using legacy technologies that would compete with one or more steps in AbCellera’s technology stack. Organizations may also elect to develop their workflows on legacy systems rather than rely on AbCellera’s platform.

# IPO Details

The IPO will be jointly underwritten by Credit Suisse (left lead), Stifel, Berenberg, SVB (healthcare specialist) and BMO Capital Markets.

On Monday December 7 2020, AbCellera said it is offering 23 million shares in the IPO, which is expected to price between $14 to $17 a share. The company could raise as much as $391 million. The pro forma adjusted common shares count after the IPO is \~265.95mn shares. This puts AbCellera at a market capitalization of \~$4.1bn based on $15.5 IPO price.

# Financial Analysis

In this part of our analysis, we will take a deeper dive into the valuation, pro forma financials, capital structure, and go-forward expectations for the business. The below provides a brief overview of the financials. We view the company to be financially healthy, given the low capitalization and limited contractual obligations, supported by continued licensing/research revenue and royalties from LY-CoV555 and other contracts.

**Revenue** has grown at a 109% CAGR since 2014, primarily driven by increased research fees (driven by the number and quality of programs under contract) and milestone fees (AbCellera received its first milestone fee in 2020 from Lilly of $8mn). September 2020 YTD revenue was \~$25mn (\~$30mn pro forma for Trianni acquisition).

**Key Revenue Drivers** in the near term will include milestone payments on existing contracts and royalty payments from Lilly for LY-CoV555. The company is eligible for royalties in low- to mid-teens for aggregate sales below $125mn and mid-teens to mid-twenties on aggregate sales above $125mn. Assuming a 20% royalty on existing US contracts (\~$690mn), this would drive an incremental $137mn of revenue (excluding an additional $21mn available through milestone payments).

We noted that Abcellera will likely move towards a recurring revenue model as the business develops more partnerships and use of their technology is more prevalent (and successful) in the industry. Details of future milestone payments and royalty payments are set out through partnership agreements with the drug developers. While we have no insight into the specifics of these arrangements, we expect more transparency going forward as Abcellera sees continued success in their programs.

**Liquidity** will be bolstered by the equity raise, with the use of proceeds used to continue making investments in R&amp;D, building its business development team and other general corporate purposes. AbCellera has more than $8mn of total future contractual obligations and commitments (as of September 30, 2020), which can be financed through cash on hand or other debt (AbCellera has demonstrated access to bank and private placement debt).

***Capital Structure*** will look significantly different post-IPO; the pro forma adjusted \~265.95mn common shares, includes 23mn IPO shares issue, \~81.2mn convertible preferred shares, and \~7.63mn shares from convertible notes based on $15.5 IPO price. The company also has

* \~13mn common shares reserved for issuance under their current plan, as of September 30, 2020, which shares will cease to be available for issuance at the time their 2020 Plan becomes effective.
* \~21mn common shares to be reserved for future issuance under the 2020 Plan
* 27mn common shares to be reserved for future issuance under our 2020 Employee Share Purchase Plan

Although the goal of the above companies is to discover and develop potential drugs or therapies to satisfy different requirements of the patients, the business model and strategy are very much similar to what AbCellera is aiming to achieve with its IPO. Some of the notable goals are listed below:

* Advance its lead product candidate as well as other potential candidates.
* Leverage its proprietary discovery platform by expanding its library and harnessing the insights and data generated from each research program.
* Build a pipeline of additional drugs in their own fields of expertise.
* Explore and evaluate additional partnerships or collaborations to maximize commercial opportunities.
* Become a market leader in its own field of research.

# The Bottom Line

Our Investment Thesis: we think that AbCellera is well-positioned to grow as a leader in an attractive, lucrative, and fragmented industry, supported by a strong management team and board. As the Company continues to find success, AbCellera will transition from its position today as a company heavily dependent on near-term binary outcomes (reliance on a few partnerships with milestone payments for revenue) to a more stable (royalty cash flows) company with significant upside for growth.

## The Positives:

* World-class management &amp; shareholder support
   * *Experienced executive team with deep experience (STEMCELL, Precision NanoSystems)*
   * *Strong and supportive long-term minority shareholders and experience board*
* Leading industry platform with barriers to entry
   * *Full-stack solution is a unique value proposition vs. its competitors.*
   * *Data generated through discovery partnerships provide the basis for training AI modules that yield new insights into antibody responses; with each research program, the platform becomes more effective and efficient*
   * *Benefits from natural antibody optimization vs “genetically made” antibodies from legacy systems*
* Scalable business with a large addressable market
   * *AI platform and partnership strategy enables organic growth with minimal funding requirements*
   * *In 2019, antibody-based therapeutics accounted for over $140 billion in sales worldwide and represented five of the top 10 selling therapeutics.*
* The business model enables diversified revenue long-term stream
   * *Three pronged revenue stream: research, milestone payments, royalties.*
   * *Revenue to stabilize as therapeutics are approved and come to market (e.g. LY-CoV555)*
* COVID upside
   * *Bamlanivimab (Eli Lilly collaboration, LY-CoV555) approved for treatment by Health Canada and the FDA*
   * *Royalties and future milestone payments to drive near-term revenue growth*

The Risks:

* **Headline Risk:** milestone payments and earnings are dependent on unknown, binary outcomes (excluding royalties).
   * Timing and quantum of LY-Cov555 royalties are unknown, delays or other negative developments would limit near-term upside
   * Lack of transparency - disclosure of partnerships is at the mercy of AbCellera’s customers, with little to no control over public disclosure from partners.
* **Customer Risk:** AbCellera’s revenue stream relies on its partnerships as if it cannot maintain and expand current partnerships or failure to address the needs of customers could impact the market acceptance of the platform.
   * As of September 30, 2020, AbCellera had 94 discovery programs that were either completed, in progress or under contract, including 71 with the potential for milestone and royalty payments.
* **Lack of traction:** Abcellera relies on their technology and partners’ ability to advance a product into clinical development and medical use. Since the launch of their partnership program in 2015, Abcellera has only 1 program lead to clinical milestone payments. If investors are to put a premium on their valuation, Abcellera will need to show rapid adoption of their technology within the industry and successful delivery of therapies to the population.
   * We expect larger, high profile antibody discoveries (through the use of Abcellera’s technology) to receive higher coverage and perhaps prompt drug makers to disclose Abcellera’s involvement.

My second oldest account on my credit is a personal loan I took out for a car a little over 2 years ago when I was 19.

I’m sure I can shop around and get this in an actual auto loan with a much lower apr. My main question is should I apply for credit cards I intend on getting before refinancing and closing this account so my average age of credit doesn’t drop and increase my chances of getting denied or lower initial limits.

personalfinance,What is actually happening when a company offers 0% finance on goods,"I have been in the commercial equipment industry for 15 years.  We have finance programs offering 0% interest from our finance partners.  I am shedding the light on what 0% interest really is and what it costs you.  
If you are financing a large purchase (new mfg. item $20k in this example) and they are offering 0% finance rate for x amount of years.  The internal cost could be 10% (or higher) of the purchase price to offer the 0%.  So you pay for the 0%. In this example the 0% would cost you $2k using the 10% added costs. New price is $22,000 @ 0%.  At 0% you are paying $2000 more to the purchase price, basically paying the 10% interest rolled into the purchase price.  If you do ‘traditional’ finance and pay a interest rate of 5% based on current rates, your finance cost could be 2,645 over 5 years @ $20K purchase price without the 0% program.  So beware that 0% financing always has a cost to the purchase price, usually if not always built into the promoted price, somewhere....So if you can pay cash (stay out of debt) and negotiate without programs/financing options etc you could save thousands of dollars on your next big purchase.",finance

stocks,"Selling DoorDash after IPO? | AirBNB IPO NEXT | LULU, ADBE, COST, PLAY STOCK EARNINGS | STOCK MARKET NEWS [12-10]","**DoorDash just went public in a crazy overvalued IPO, AirBNB will follow today. Today we get earnings from Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco &amp; more. Let’s talk about this and everything about the stock market**

Hey everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/bzmy8C4) drop almost 2% and suffering its biggest loss since October after the 4-day win streak, the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Kw3DKxD) also dropped .80% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/9GvPGh5) did much better, down just .35% for the day. We saw a huge spike in the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/RcShWPM) of over 7% closing at the highest level since the 23rd of November.

We saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/YkqyTgh) as finally some stocks have started to move below the moving averages on about average volume for the day.

We saw most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/Wfn4Trj) in the red yesterday as Tech and Communications suffered the most dropping more than 1% for the day, with small gains being made in just the Industrials, Energy and Materials sectors as Growth companies suffered the most [yesterday](https://ibb.co/5hQKP88), especially the Large-Caps as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/V9bfV71), with all the big FAANG names and other big tech companies being deep in the red as Apple, Amazon, and Netflix dropped more than 2% for the day, while FB, Google and Microsoft also lost over 1%, but the big loser yesterday was Tesla losing 7% for the day.

Today we will get some critical economic [data](https://ibb.co/qnkdTJz), and if this disappoints, we might see another big drop in the stock market, as the jobless claims will start us off in the early morning.

Alongside this economic data, today the [FDA](https://ibb.co/0906d6L) may approve the emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine, that could lead to a vaccine rollout starting next week. This might help the markets have a more positive reaction if the FDA grants the authorization.

One good thing in my opinion is that the most recent [survey](https://ibb.co/5WPhj8B) from the AAII showed a slight decrease in Bullish and Neutral investors while the Bearish camp gained more than 4% in the last week.

Investors had gotten very bullish in the last weeks and this usually is a contrarian indicator, so seeing this small drop is a good thing to see, as I want more and more people to start feeling bearish so I can find and buy stocks at more attractive prices than the current ones. So, the more bearish people get, the more I like to get on and buy stocks. But still… there is to much of a concentration in the bull’s camp so we might have to wait a little, for more fear to appear in the stock market.

Positive indicators also popped up yesterday as Wholesale [invetories](https://ibb.co/WxPPLpS) rose more than expected in October, as this led the Atlanta FED to maintain they’re Q4 GDP [estimates](https://ibb.co/SBZPtZP), while [Goldman](https://ibb.co/sQ42gCg) also thinks the economy will recover faster than expected starting with Q4 and going on next year.

While on the jobs front, October job opening came in [better](https://ibb.co/4VdrTbQ) than expected at over 6,6M, as the job opening rate stood at 6,7% while the quits rate at just 2,2%.

So, DoorDash went live [yesterday](https://ibb.co/LJtbPtH) at 182$ which is insane in my opinion, the current price gives the company a [valuation](https://ibb.co/kcBcpYW) of over $70B, more than 4 times what the company raised at the last private fundraising six months ago. This valuation is higher than Chipotle, Yum Brands, Domino’s and many others from the food industry.

And by the way, don’t forget the stock is [trading](https://ibb.co/CP0Qgbr) at over 30 times sales of this year, which were hugely boosted by the current situation, and that food delivery is really hard for any company, especially one that expects to grow to have a share of more than 50% of the entire world in the sector so that it can justify the current valuation.

One of the biggest gainers from this is SoftBank as they have a big stake in the company. The shares of SoftBank [skyrocketed](https://ibb.co/GnTSqJf) yesterday to new highs in almost two decades. Like almost every time, the biggest gainers in this IPOs are the banks and not us the retail investors.

With the other big [IPO](https://ibb.co/Ld0pMdz) yesterday being C3.ai which also opened way above the IPO price, as investors can’t get enough of this stock’s, I don’t think this is a healthy hype for this type of IPOs, investors expect every new company to just skyrocket but, not all of them will, and paying such a high premium is not worth it most time, better wait for a pullback before getting some action on these stocks.

Today we will see [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/Hxd70Tb) go public, as the valuation for this company also gets higher and higher, as they have started selling shares for 68$ even higher than the latest targeted price between 56-60$. And if DoorDash is any [indication](https://ibb.co/8cb3yTs), I don’t think we will be able to get our hands on this stock below 100$. Way above my 70-80$ max price that I am willing to pay, so I am going to wait this out also until they have a pullback, maybe once the first earnings come out, that will be the case. But if somehow the IPO is under 80$ and especially under 70$ I would be willing to get some action.

Some other [news](https://ibb.co/H4Pxqmq) from the stock market which pushed companies like Facebook lower came in when almost every US state filed a lawsuit against the company. In the long run, if this happens just like with the Google lawsuit, the sum of the parts of the company is bigger than the company itself, so I don’t really have any worries long-term about Facebook or Google, as they are the 2 of the biggest advertising platforms in the world.

While [REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/0X85Cb4) is starting to make a small comeback in New York, as leases jumped 30% year over year in November to around 4000 new ones, but it will still take a very long time before things go back to where they stood before this year.

Also, we will have a lot of earnings results today as [Oracle](https://ibb.co/jb5CPPV), Lululemon, Adobe, Dave &amp; Busters, Costco, Broadcom and others report.

I expect [Lululemon](https://ibb.co/J2MBWD2) to beat the estimates and the stock to regain momentum after it has struggled since the beginning of September. And just like analysts from Raymond James [said](https://ibb.co/gFL3T0s), the only underlying story problem for investors it’s the valuation, but this will soon go away, as people will buy this brand even more once the reopening begins.

Likewise, [Dave &amp; Buster's](https://ibb.co/L0rY2YS) may have smaller loses than expected last quarter as restaurants weren’t hit so badly like before or like this quarter.

While [BROADCOM](https://ibb.co/b5kYKLB) stands to benefit a lot from the recent move in semiconductor industry especially for data centers that stands to benefit them a lot.

[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/D19qrSc) will also report earnings after the close, and is expected to show over 14% growth in eps and revenues since last year, as they are one of the best retailers to own as a shareholder, even if they always trade at a premium.

Adobe just released earnings while writing this post and here are the excelent results that the company [posted](https://ibb.co/kyzBLjv). Now let's see how the stock reacts, will it go down or up?

So, guys, don’t forget not to panic sell when you see a big red day in the markets, just look at this Wells Fargo [chart](https://ibb.co/yQwKpt0).

Investors who added 30% more exposure to equities, and took the money from investment-grade fixed income largely outperform the rest of the investors, while the average investor who does a quarterly rebalancing also did very good and is still up over 10% for the year, while investors who reduced the equity exposure by 50% and put that money into fixed income or kept it in cash are up just 2%. With by far the worst results seen in investors who removed all of the exposure to equities, they are down 6% for the year.

Just be patient, trust the companies that you like and keep investing every time you can. In the long-run markets will always go UP &amp; UP.

cybersecurity,Was my personal Reddit account that I made last year brute forced?,"I'm saying this because I feel that my account was broken into. About a year ago, I had a personal account on here. There was a post made on there that I don't remember creating. This classmate of mine, who was a huge jackass to me in general, showed the post to a couple of his friends to get a laugh. The name of the account, stupidly enough, had my first and last name on it, which was why he was able to tell that the Reddit account was mine. I'm suspecting that he broke into it, but I don't know how he could've done that, if he had done that, and how easy it is in general to do something like that.

\- I never shared the password of it with anyone.

\- The password was basically my last name with a couple of numbers at the end.

\- I never created the account or logged into it in front of him or anyone else.

In general, I have had a lot of issues with this kid, so it is normal for me to always suspect him whenever something fishy or bad happens. In truth, I have also done things to him that were also pretty bad, if not worse, and as a matter of fact, could get me suspended from the school if the dean ever found out.

The kid knows that I could also get in trouble, and that I won't go to the dean about him. No matter how much I confront him and interrogate him about it, he is still insisting that he never broke into any account. He said that ""there are too many passwords. How could I have guessed the right one?"". He also said that if he had the ability to crack passwords for Reddit accounts, then he would have been working for the NSA, not studying in school.

I asked him if he used a keylogger on my account, and he said that he didn't because that would require him to know my password to unlock my computer, which he did not,

I asked him if he used a MITM attack, and he said that he didn't because he never brought his computer, and that most modern web browsers can detect MITMs, so if he did do that, I would definitely know for sure.

I asked him if he shoulder-surfed, and he said that he didn't because he sat next to me, not behind me.

However, I forgot to ask him if he brute-forced. Before I could ask him that, he blocked my number.

As much as I hate him, on one hand I feel as though that maybe he is telling the truth, and I could've made a post like that without remembering it (this was, after all, a little over a year ago).

On the other hand, I feel as though he might have actually did something like that, and is just straight up denying it.

In general, how easy is it to brute force into someone's Reddit account? Like is that something that the average person could do?

From the information in this post, how likely is it that he actually broke into my account and is lying about it?

How possible is it that I may have written that post and, without remembering it, am just putting a false accusation on him? Like I said, this was someone who has said/did other mean things to me too, l such as spreading an embarrassing photo of me and saying and doing other mean things to me.",technology

Facebook  ([**FB**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/fb)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=FB) faces little risk from the antitrust lawsuit the Federal Trade Commission filed against the social media giant, several analysts said. 

Shares of the Menlo Park, Calif., social-media giant at last check were little changed at $277.88.

The FTC and most states [filed an antitrust lawsuit](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/facebook-slips-after-ftc-files-antitrust-lawsuit-to-breakup-tech-giant), charging that the company engaged in anticompetitive behavior to maintain a monopoly position in personal social networking.

KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Justin Patterson said he was struggling with ""why a breakup -- a process that could take years given technical complexities -- should take place.""

""Instead, we believe this will likely be resolved with another fine and additional scrutiny on future M&amp;A,"" said Patterson, who rates the stock overweight with a $340 price target.

[The FTC alleges that Facebook](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization) undertook a years-long effort to maintain a monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions and actions that target potential and nascent rivals.

The commission is demanding that Facebook unwind the acquisitions of photo-focused network Instagram and messaging app Whatsapp. 

""We believe Facebook’s virtual ownership of the social graph, strong competitive moat, and focus on the user experience position it to become an enduring blue-chip company built for the long term,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth said.

Anmuth, who rates Facebook overweight with a $330 price target, said that ""Facebook is in rarefied air across the combination of scale, growth, and profitability, as the company’s massive reach and engagement continue to drive network effects, and its targeting abilities provide significant value to advertisers.""

Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said that while there is certainly merit to the FTC’s allegations that Facebook strengthened its competitive position” when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp, the firm is “skeptical that the FTC will prevail,” as it is difficult to see how Facebook “precluded competition.”

“We can only conclude that the FTC suit is intended to make headlines,” Pachter said, adding that he was skeptical ""that a federal court will compel a divestiture, and equally skeptical that a divided Congress will pass a law that forces such a result.”

Baird analysts said in a note that the complaint has some bark but “little bite.” 

“We do not see much in the way of ‘teeth’ in today’s FTC/states complaint about Facebook,” Baird said, adding that  there is “very little likelihood that punitive recommendations to split the company will occur.”",finance
robotics,ICP doesn't converge in RGB-D SLAM,"Hi,

I have a question about ICP (Iterative Closest Points) algorithm in RGB-D SLAM.

I have implemented a camera tracking module using the ICP algorithm for depth camera SLAM. I found it doesn't converge even two range images is very close and good initial pose estimation is given. After it iterates for several iterations, it diverges and outputs a wrong pose.

I checked the data fed into the ICP algorithm, also visualized the correspondence. I am wondering the reason why it diverges. Have you ever implemented such a camera tracking module in an RGB-D SLAM system?",technology

personalfinance,Better to make a big purchase using a line of credit or take the financing from the dealer?,"Making a purchase of about $4500.

Financing has a 7% interest rate.  This would be a 5 year loan but with the ability to pay it off faster with no penalty.

Line of credit has a 5.25% interest rate and I can obviously pay it off however I want.

My credit score is high (8-9 last time I checked).  I have student loans I’m paying off ($375/month) but no other debts.

I know this might seem like a no-brainer but I’m wondering if there advantages to taking the financing that I’m not aware of?

Don’t hate on me but this $12,000 line of credit (with zero balance) I keep as my “emergency fund” because I can always pay it off (have a good job in healthcare, unionized) and I mostly use extra money I have to put into a TFSA or RRSPs since I started saving later in life (went back to school as an adult cause I was never making enough $.  That’s not an issue anymore other than the fact I haven’t saved up till recently).

I do have another $12,000 line or credit (zero balance) with another bank as an emergency fund too.

So lay it on me!  Finance or credit line and why?

Thanks in advance!",finance

investing,FORD F Might be Very Undervalued,"Used cars are selling so strongly that people are making a profit after selling cars they bought in 2018.  Ford had a net profit of over 2 billion last quarter.  I think the number is very sustainable because conditions are lining up perfectly for the company to have a very good 2021.  

Its trucks are already the number 1 sellers in all categories in the US.  With the vaccine being rolled out people are going to be going back to work in a much more consistent way.  Interest rates are excellent right now.  

Ford is sitting on 30 billion in cash and they paid down their entire revolving credit line that they tapped back in March.  The reason people were buying used is because dealers were closed.  Now nothing is completely closed.  Huge pent up demand and increasing income and if we get stimulus it will be even more epic.

People are greatly underestimating how strong Ford is in trucks and suvs.  Every category it dominates today is high margin.",finance

investing,MassMutual Joins the Bitcoin Club With $100 Million Purchase,"[https://www.wsj.com/articles/massmutual-joins-the-bitcoin-club-with-100-million-purchase-11607626800](https://www.wsj.com/articles/massmutual-joins-the-bitcoin-club-with-100-million-purchase-11607626800)

Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. bought $100 million of bitcoin for its general investment account, the latest sign of mainstream acceptance for the upstart digital currency.

The investment is a tiny one for the Springfield, Mass.-based insurance company whose general investment account totaled nearly $235 billion as of Sept. 30. But it signifies further momentum for bitcoin, [which has surged this fall](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-is-back-trading-near-three-year-highs-11604250000?mod=article_inline). The price of a single bitcoin peaked in late November at $19,835, topping its 2017 high, and currently trades around $18,000, up 150% year-to-date.

MassMutual purchased the bitcoin through a New York-based fund management company called NYDIG, which has about $2.3 billion of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies under management. MassMutual also acquired a $5 million minority equity stake in NYDIG, which was formerly known as New York Digital Investment Group.

The insurance company, founded in 1851, said the bitcoin investment was based on a broad strategy to take advantage of new opportunities while remaining diversified, “giving us measured yet meaningful exposure to a growing economic aspect of our increasingly digital world.”

Bitcoin, [launched in January 2009](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-DGB-26847?mod=article_inline), is a software program that operates across a network of linked but independent computers. It allows any two people to exchange value directly without the use of a middleman like a bank.

Ross Stevens, the founder and executive chairman of NYDIG, said other return-hungry insurance companies have also bought bitcoin for their general accounts through his firm. Interest rates that are hovering near zero and a depreciating dollar have made bitcoin appear more attractive, he added.

Bitcoin’s rally has attracted momentum investors who pile into the market’s biggest winners and sell the losers, [along with billionaire investors](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-trades-again-near-record-driven-by-new-group-of-buyers-11606127401?mod=article_inline) like Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller who have publicly disclosed bitcoin investments in recent months.

Among other companies jumping into the market, payments firm Square Inc. bought $50 million of bitcoin in October for its corporate treasury. It has allowed users of its Cash App to buy and sell bitcoin since 2018.

Tech company [MicroStrategy](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MSTR) Inc. has become an even more vocal proponent of the digital currency, investing about $425 million this year. The company on Wednesday detailed an offering of up to $550 million in convertible bonds, with the intention of using the proceeds to buy bitcoin.

Despite the recent renewed interest, bitcoin remains a tiny market, which contributes to its notorious volatility. Its price fell as low as $3,867 in March, when global markets cratered, a drop of more than 60% from the beginning of 2020. Bitcoin also lost about 50% of its value in January 2018 after its spectacular 2017 run. It is currently down about 10% from its Nov. 30 record.",finance
personalfinance,"House A, or house B?","So my husband and I are looking into buying our first home int he next 3-4 months, and now that I'm looking with some level of seriousness I've hit an interesting delema: 
*Houses in region A* are close to our respective jobs(10-40 minutes), but are smaller (1000-1200 square foot, often without a garage), older (70's-90's) and more expensive (300-350k). 

*Houses in area B* are much further from our respective jobs (40-60 minutes) but are generally larger (1200-1600 square feet, usually with a garage), newer (2010's- new construction), and same price or cheaper! (275-315k). 

What are your thoughts on this? I'm trying to decide how to ""weight"" my preferences here.

1. On on hand I care about the environment, driving less and having a smaller home is a significant thing that I can do to help lower my impact on the earth, on the other hand, it sucks to pay so much for so little!.

2. On one hand, my time matters, and commuting for 8-10 hours of my week vs 3-5 seems like an obvious choice, on the other hand, being able to relax and enjoy my home without feeling cluttered or cramped is also a valuable way to spend my not working time

3. On one hand, I'd like to spend less on a house and have more to spend on investing and retirement, on the other hand, I'm worried that if we buy further away we'll get fed up with the drive and eventually want to move closer to work anyway, in which case we're just pushing the problem off into the future.

Any guidance or ideas would be appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,How should I approach my remaining student loan balance?,"So I just turned 25 and make roughly $40k before tax (hoping to get a new job next year but I value my current job security enough to stay at this time). Currently, I have a balance of $10,843.09 on my remaining student loans. Those are broken up as follows: 

**Loan A:** $3,795.31 at 4.29%

**Loan B:** $4,528.07 at 3.76%

**Loan C:** $2,519.71 at 4.45%

Since I am very ahead on my payments, I am not required to make any payments for the next four years. I've probably not paid any of my loans since early this year as a result. Obviously, interest will probably start accumulating in 2021 (it's been frozen due to covid), so I'd like to limit as much interest as possible and kill off these loans asap.

I currently have $19,191 in cash, with $10,564 of this as an emergency fund (might be slightly excessive since that's probably more than 6 months' expenses for me). I make hardly any money on this cash as the interest rate is very low. 

Additionally, I have roughly $10k in my Roth IRA and $12k in my 401k

Would it be a good idea to use up 50% of my cash to wipe out all my debt (I have no other loans at this time)? If the answer is ""it depends"", what sort of things should I be considering here?

Would it be advisable to pay off a car loan now? This way my debt to income ratio would be lowered substantially, hopefully in time to start the mortgage process.

personalfinance,Worth it to refinance?,"I'll try to make this short. Bought a new house in Nov. 2016 (first payment was Jan 2017), 287k, 5% down, 3.5% rate, 30 year. We put  $1300/month from July 2017 to Jun 2019, and $547/month as extra payment on principal. there is a about 204k left. 

A friend of ours was buying new place and got a (2.35%ish rate) for a 30 year. I decided to check to see what rate I would get and if it would be worth refinancing. They gave me a 2.875% rate for a new 30 year and said that new house purchases do come with lower rate so that is why. I have a 820+ credit score and the only debt in my name is this house. 

I plugged in all my numbers into [https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/additional-payment-calculator/#summary](https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/additional-payment-calculator/#summary). At our current rate on our current mortgage we will pay the house off  in Nov 2032. I then plugged in the numbers of 205k @ 2.875% 30 year. I set my total payment P + I + Extra payment to be the same as my current mortgage. 

Current (this month) mortgage P+I = $620 + $605 + extra principal $547 =  $1772. Pay off Nov 2032.

New 30year @ 2.875% = P+I = $350 + $491 + extra principal $931 = $1772. Pay off March 2032. 

Refinance cost would be about $3k. So in total we would ""save"" about $11k IF we stayed in this house for 12 years. On the calculator it says for our current mortgage we would pay $79k in interest, whereas on the lower interest rate (2.875%) loan we would \_only\_ pay $35k in interest. This seems misleading because overall the amount we pay would be really \~$255k ($1772\*144months). Really the only difference in total cost to me is the difference in March and Nov when the loan ends, which is where I get the \~$11k difference ($1772\*8month - 3000refi cost = $11k). This means we would have to be here about 3.25 years to break even. Since we don't plan to be here much over that time, I don't think it would be worth it for us to do this refi. Am I thinking about this correctly? 

Everyone uses the whole ""well you would reduce your current payments"" argument. However for us we aren't looking at just decreasing our payment.  I'm worried about saving money on interest and saving money overall. Based on this info I don't think its worth it. Any thoughts?",finance

Forex,Is shorting EM currencies and long EM bonds a good idea,"One thing that I have noticed is that EM currencies tends to almost never recover their devaluation over a long period of time while some EM bonds do much better. So the obvious question is would it not be a good idea to go long a EM bond that pays the same interest rate while shorting a EM pair like USDZAR for example?

I understand that there is some short term risk with bonds spiking harder then currencies but if one hold a decent size position then it should not be a issue. Is there something that I am missing?",finance

personalfinance,Loan Questions (thanks in advance),"Hello all,

Recently my father ""gave"" me his car under the stipulation that I pay off what was left on his loan ($3800). I thought that was fair (since the car is valued at 14k) so I took the deal. I have the cash in saving to go ahead and pay him off, but he suggested to me to find a way to build credit through this transaction.

I went to my bank and asked for a loan of said amount. I have one short line (over a year) of credit w/ a credit card. My score was 719 (good). The bank suggested giving my dad the money for him to pay off the loan. I would be making the payments to the bank. The interest rate would be around 4.5% for 48 months w/ no prepay penalty. Seemed pretty standard to me.

I was declined due to my short credit history. The plan was to have my dad co-sign. The cosigner needs to have a credit score over 700, and my dad admitted he does not. This hurt. I don't really feel comfortable asking my other close family to sign (mom is not an option) (I was thinking my grandma possibly), but I wanted to see if what other options I may have.

Any advice would be appreciated - thank you again.

(also, does anyone know approximately how much a credit score is ""hurt"" when taken to look at something like a loan or credit card application?)",finance
personalfinance,Put extra money towards mortgage principal OR market?,We want to pay off our house hopefully sometime in the next 5 years. We owe about $130k left. One of our ways to help is to put an extra $1000 per month away to help pay the house off sooner ($60k over 5 years). It seems like the best strategy would be to not put that money directly towards the principal but instead to put it in a relatively save diversified stock market portfolio. Our home loan interest rate is very low and our current stock market account is making a fairly decent annual return. Are we missing something here? My partner's mother keeps saying just pay off the principal on the mortgage but she's also not particularly good with money and has no investments beyond her 401k.,finance

I searched the net and read how buyers from Canada payed approximately half of the product cost. Is that true? 

My musical instrument costs $2300 USD and I could definitely not be able to afford to pay more than $1000 just for duty and taxes. I'm 18 and pretty terrified since this is my first time purchasing this big.

stocks,Disney STOCK NEWS | DoorDash &amp; AirBnB Price Target | STOCK EARNNINGS &amp; MARKET NEWS [12-11],"**Disney lays out the plans for the future, the FDA advisory panel gives their OK. What’s my price target and should you buy DoorDash and AirBnB? Let’s talk about this and everything about the stock market**

Hey everyone and Good morning! So let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we only saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/1RgJRtS) gaining some ground, up more than half a % while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/vQY7s6C) finished .13% down and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/BcgtnC2) fell just below 30k, losing .23% for the day. All 3 indexes traded way lower in the beginning of the day after the jobless claims came in, but recovered once the FDA Advisory panel meeting started. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/SwcQnHs) finish higher for the day after it opened at over 23 to start us off.

Almost 60% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/qdWy3jk), but the volume was way below average for most of them, with the Energy sector being the only significant gainer, up 3% for the day while most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/5xskzgj) were flat or even lost ground for the day. On a factor [basis](https://ibb.co/Z28KH04), only large-cap value companies from the industrial sector suffered big yesterday, as small cap growth companies outperformed.

You can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y0jvPBX), that big caps, with the exception of Apple and Tesla did struggle yesterday, while most of the companies with big gains were from the oil &amp; gas industry, with Chevron gaining more than 3% for the day, while Exxon, Total and BP also had big gains.

The numbers that came in [yesterday](https://ibb.co/MPxZS56) on the economic front where mixed. As initial and continuing jobless claims came in [worse](https://ibb.co/NmgdXbJ) than expected, as more than 850K people filed for initial claims up more than 125K since the last week and what the analysts [expected](https://ibb.co/KrGcRk7), as this was the biggest spike in initial claims since march, while the continuing claims also rose for the first time since September. I am wondering, will [this](https://ibb.co/0X6FCH5) finally push the congress to act on a relief bill? I think the economy really needs it as a bridge to better times. Just look at the [EU](https://ibb.co/ncSgyWd), they have finally agreed on $2.2T budget and stimulus package to help the Eurozone get through the difficult times.

Better numbers came in from the consumer price [index](https://ibb.co/NjLW663), as the index rose by .2%, after it was unchanged in October, but this should be taken with a grain of salt, as most of consumer confidence increase comes from the high-income [consumers](https://ibb.co/DVJ5nK9), while people who have an income under $50K still struggling.

Also, the Federal [Budget](https://ibb.co/8BFdyZ7) came in better than expected as the deficit shrank more in November compared to October and compared to last year’s month.

[Today](https://ibb.co/pP78rTs) is a slow day in terms of economic data, but we do get a final read on the Producer price index and the consumer sentiment index.

We also finally got the [FDA](https://ibb.co/9gLsrh6) panel of outside experts meeting yesterday, which saw the panel vote 17 FOR, 4 against and one abstain. The only small concerns were on the topic of 16 and 17-year old’s as some experts argued that there is insufficient data on that subgroup, but I don’t think that is a case for concern, as the vaccine is likely going to take a while until young people will start to get the shot, as they are one of the least impacted groups. This is great news, as the FDA does usually follow up this committee advice, so we can see the FDA Emergency use authorization very very soon. Vaccine doses are already ready go within 24hours of the authorization so, things will start to move rather fast after that.

So, we got some earnings numbers yesterday from a lot of companies, let’s talk about them a little.

[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/C040BWf) posted a beat on the top and bottom line with e-commerce sales rising by more than 80%, while [comparable](https://ibb.co/YQQknbj) sales in stores were more than 17%. With both EPS and revenue beating the estimates, I think this might be the time to get into COSTCO, as they are one of the best retailers in the world, they always trade at a premium, the [stock](https://ibb.co/QnQNJGJ) is just about 5% from the all-time high and is far from overbought territory. I really like them as they have also rewarded shareholders constantly both with great growth and dividends.

[Broadcom](https://ibb.co/St74KMD) also posted a great beat on EPS and an 11% increase in revenues, fueled by a great beat in the semiconductor segment, while also posting a free cash flow of over $3B, way better than expected, as they also increased the quarterly dividend by 11% and have made a lot of [senior](https://ibb.co/hcMS6Vs) leadership changes yesterday, but the [stock](https://ibb.co/TB97nhZ) is down more than 2% in pre-market trading despite a lot of great numbers.

The company has most of its [revenues](https://ibb.co/bLbzgKL) coming from semiconductor solutions, this is very good as the [global](https://ibb.co/GfZGfnz) semiconductor sales have increased more than 5% in FY2020 and are expected to increase more than 8% for FY 2021, way better than the previous [outlook](https://ibb.co/MSrLh0p) of 6,2%.

The company also posted all time [highs](https://ibb.co/1vM8WP0) in net revenue, free cash flows, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA, while the compound annual [growth](https://ibb.co/zRW1jLZ) of the dividend since FY2016 is almost 50%. I think I might be investing even more in this company especially if they have a pullback.

Next let’s go to Lululemon who also [posted](https://ibb.co/qF1NnnN) a beat on EPS and Revenues, while comparable sales were up 19% with better gross and operating margins than expected. This was led by a huge [rise](https://ibb.co/zfKRJX5) in the international markets which will continue to expand as they gain more recognition overseas.

A smaller company that [reported](https://ibb.co/2WMrybz) yesterday was Dave &amp; Buster’s as the losses were smaller than expected as comparable store sales declined by 66% as the restrictions in the restaurant industry keeps hammering away. The stock was trading +4% in after hours as investors may have though of an even worse result.

Moving on, [Adobe](https://ibb.co/Vjwwprm) also released earnings before the market opened yesterday, after a delayed earnings release. They posted a great beat on EPS and the revenues while also giving great guidance for next year, way above the consensus, with more than $15B in revenues and a EPS of over $11. The company also announced a new $15B share buyback [program](https://ibb.co/cKBbMpF) which will increase the value of the stock through the next 4 years while also have a strong [growth](https://ibb.co/G7BySxH) path, and despite all of this the stock [lost](https://ibb.co/Bnkk60T) more than 1,4% for the day.

The other earnings report that was released yesterday was from [Oracle](https://ibb.co/KsSGZNW), they also posted a great beat on the top and bottom line, but didn’t offer any guidance as that kind of disappointed investors and dipped about 1% in after hours. I don’t really have a great grasp of the company’s growth potential is right now.

We also got the Disney Investors meeting, in which the company share a lot of new great things. First of all, [Disney+](https://ibb.co/kJRc01G) has gone up another 18% since just 4 weeks ago, and is up to more than 86M subscribers, with the total number for the company’s streaming services surpassing 137M as they plan to expand Disney+ in Eastern Europe, South Korea, Hong Kong and other markets next year.

The company also [expects](https://ibb.co/4skfTC8) to have more than 230M subscribers by 2024, a very big increase from the prior estimate, while they are also planning on raising the monthly fee starting in March.

They plan to [release](https://ibb.co/F0G0C84) a lot of new content directly to Disney+, which is another big hit to the cinema world. With the Marvel and Star Wars series being big blockbusters for the movie industry.

They presented so much new [content](https://ibb.co/8jpZtWN) for the company, that it took them more than 2 hours to talk about all of this.

But they also [said](https://ibb.co/DWwJ1tg) that these decisions are temporary, and that they still prefer theatrical releases especially for blockbusters, so, there is still some hope for cinema’s, but maybe not just right now, it will take years to recover from this, and they will probably have to largely reduce the number of screens so that they may become profitable again.

So, over 100 new content releases per year is a lot for the [company](https://ibb.co/fFD4vhs), this was a very good investors meeting that pleased investors, as the company is [trading](https://ibb.co/Y86n6HD) \+7,5% in pre-market.

Disney is my second biggest position in my portfolio and I am really happy with what the company presented today. I think this stock may get to 200$ easily when the parks and entertainment business goes back online, as that accounted for 1/3 of the revenues before this year.

In other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/NL6sXcT), NIO will offer 60M shares, with an additional 9M shares option for underwriters. The stock fell sharply after the news, dropping more than 6% in After-hours [trading](https://ibb.co/85PycWh).

Also, Qualcomm suffered after the close yesterday, as the shares fell more than 5% after [news](https://ibb.co/5h4syVT) popped that Apple is moving to a develop their first cellular modem which will replace the Qualcomm modem in iPhone. The shares dropped as Qualcomm gets about 11% of its revenue from Apple.

So, one last thing that I want to talk about is the recent IPOs from DoorDash and AirBnb.

AirBNB also went public yesterday and [started](https://ibb.co/PCNjM3W) trading at $146, way above the $68 IPO price. This means the company has a [market cap](https://ibb.co/QNmGhqy) of over $100B, way higher than its rival Booking at $86B market cap and even [higher](https://ibb.co/cyp2hz1) than some of the biggest hotels in the world, Marriot &amp; Hilton. The [stock](https://ibb.co/C9P3McG) even hit a new high of $165, I believe this happened as brokers started to get hands on the shares and orders started to fill in, but the stock did go back down to finish at $144, that means the stock gained more than 112% just in one day. The stock is down again more than 2% in pre-market guys. 

I would avoid these stocks as much as I can as I believe they are well overhyped at the moment. I think we can see a pullback that may offer a better opportunity in AirBnb after the first earnings results. I would buy this company only if it drops to around 80$ as a price target, if not I maintain my sell opinion on the stock, though I personally, am not shorting any stock due to the risk of the high volatility associated with this companies as they have a very small share float.

While my opinion on [DoorDash](https://ibb.co/qkqSz1t) is that we might not see a pullback or correction as soon as AirBnb as demand will probably continue to be strong for at least a couple of quarters, before the growth slows down as well as very though future comps. We might see a drop in price then, as I think this stock is also well overvalued. I also maintain my sell opinion on this stock and just like with AirBNB, I am not going to touch this stock, I think a reasonable PT for DoorDash as a sell is about 100$. But I would try to stay away as much as possible, I’d rather go and find better growth opportunities in other companies, and not waste time and money on these 2 stocks.

* **Extendable:** Flower originated from a research project at the Univerity of Oxford, so it was build with AI research in mind. Many components can be extended and overridden to build new state-of-the-art systems.
* **Framework-agnostic:** Different machine learning frameworks have different strengths. Flower can be used with any machine learning framework, for example, PyTorch, TensorFlow, or even raw NumPy for users who enjoy computing gradients by hand.
* **Understandable:** Flower is written with maintainability in mind. The community is encouraged to both read and contribute to the codebase.

personalfinance,The age-old question: Should I focus on paying off student loans or saving for a house? (US),"I (27F) consider myself a saver more than spender and would say I'm fairly financially-wise, but am a little torn right now as far as what my debt vs savings plan should be. I'm going to include all the details I think are important, so sorry for this being so long.

Financial overview: I went to a small private college to get my Bachelor's and accumulated ~$33k in student loans. I've paid a little more than half of that over the last 5 years; my current principal balance is $14,600 with an average interest rate of 4.4%. I had one private loan that I paid off first, and have since been working on my federal loans. I pay a little extra every month and usually a small lump-sum with my tax return. I currently have 4 federal loans (previously 5; one paid off entirely) with the following balances/rates: $4k@4.1%, $4k@3.61%, $3k@6.55%, $2k@3.15%. I put all extra payments towards the 6.55% loan. For the past 7 months, since federal loans currently have no interest, I've been putting my monthly would-be payment into a HYSA (0.5%APR) instead with the plan of making a lump-sum payment before interest is set to accrue again...and with pipedreams of loan forgiveness, which I know is incredibly unlikely. I've been keeping track of what portion of my savings is intended for my loans.

I had been driving a 20+ year old car until I bought a new one in 2019. I know I shouldn't have bought new, but wanted to live a little (also bought a sensible vehicle). I put $6k down and financed $23K @2.99%. That balance is currently at about $15k. In an ideal world I'll pay that off early, too, but that's not my current focus.

I have excellent credit (800+) and two credit cards. I use my credit cards to pay for basically everything to get cash back, but always pay the full balance and have never carried a balance. The only debt I have are my auto and student loans.

I've got around $11k in savings, which includes about $3k earmarked for student loans. My current monthly base take-home pay is ~$2,400 with base expenses (rent, car insurance, car payment, student loans, utilities, etc.) of $1,710 + ~$640/month budgeted for gas, food, pets, miscellaneous expenses. I also work a second, part-time job which earns me an additional variable income of about ~$200/month net pay. 

I have $300/month put directly into my savings (I know I should be saving more) and try to put any extra money I may have into my savings as well. I try to follow a zero-based budgeting method as best as I can, but am certainly not perfect. I am actively seeking a new job which would hopefully have a yearly salary of $60k+, but of course I know better than to count my chickens before my eggs hatch.

Here's my question: I am looking to purchase a home hopefully in the next 6 months or so. I would be purchasing the home with my partner, who has about twice the savings I do, but a similar salary (also looking for a better job). My first instinct is to put that earmarked $3k and maybe a little more towards my student loans, but then I question whether I should prioritize saving for the cost of a home/downpayment. I know, either way, we'll almost certainly be paying PMI. I'm already slated to pay off my student loans about 2 years early, and I know I could just keep making my monthly payment once 0% interest stops, no harm no foul, the loans will still be there after I buy a house. Especially with no interest accrual right now, it's very tempting to just keep the earmarked money in my savings. 

I could also just pay the $3k loan @6.55% which would bring my average interest rate for the rest to 3.85%, which isn't terrible. I also feel like this is the best time to attack my loans since there is no interest and I would still have enough in my savings for an emergency fund and a small amount to put towards the house, but I'd really like to have more in my savings. It's not like my student loans have crazy high interest rates, so the yearly interest isn't costing me a fortune, but I know the longer I take to pay off the loans, the more money I'm losing in the long run.

Any advice about what I should prioritize or maybe an alternate strategy I haven't thought of would be MUCH appreciated. 

Thanks in advance!!",finance

personalfinance,Bank Covering All Refinance Fees,"I started a 30yr mortgage with Chase 3.5 years ago at a 4.25% interest rate.  With extra payments to principal, I've paid off \~20% of the loan.  I received an offer to refinance to 3.125% APR with Chase **covering all closing costs**, which cuts the monthly payment down by 1/3.  This seems to be a very good deal, even if I only keep the house another year. Obviously Chase is also benefiting from this as well.

personalfinance,New Home Affordability Question,"Hello folks, and I’m sure this question has been asked a ton and there are calculators everywhere that attempt to answer, but I wanted to get some outside opinion that’s different from an internet robot.

My wife and I (34) are relocating to a new city after I started a new job in October. She works from home, and together our gross incomes amount to $125k. Both of us contribute to our 401k to max our employee match.

We have no student loans, credit card debt (we always pay the full balance each month), and the only current debts we have are two car payments - a lease @$350/mo and a purchase loan at also around $350/mo with only about $1400 left in principal, so that will be gone soon. We also have a 4y/o daughter that we plan to keep home until she is in school, so no anticipated daycare costs unless we have another child, which may or may not happen.

We listed and sold our house for a good bit over its purchase price and will receive a check for around $100k at closing. We also have another around $90k in liquid assets we had expected to use on a new house, but which can now likely be reinvested considering the money we’ll now be making on the home sale will easily allow us to pay 20% down and avoid PMI.

We were originally looking for houses around the $350k mark, but we found one we really like at $430k. Considering the low interest rates and this home’s property tax rate around 1.6%, is this a comfortably affordable number for us? 

I can provide any additional details on our financial situation if it helps. Thanks so much!!",finance

stocks,Darling Ingredients (NYSE: DAR) - Biodiesel + Animal Feeds,"What is Darling Ingredients? Summary:

&gt; The Company collects and transforms all aspects of animal by-product streams into useable and specialty ingredients, such as collagen, edible fats, feed-grade fats, animal proteins and meals, plasma, pet food ingredients, organic fertilizers, yellow grease, fuel feedstocks, green energy, natural casings and hides. The Company also recovers and converts recycled oils (used cooking oil and animal fats) into valuable feed and fuel ingredients, and collects and processes residual bakery products into feed ingredients. In addition, the Company provides environmental services, such as grease trap collection and disposal services to food service establishments. In fiscal year 2019, the Company generated $3.4 billion in revenues and $312.6 million in net income attributable to Darling.

~ 10% profit margin is good, but we'll see why it's good later on. 

I was initially drawn to this company because I had heard a lot of good things about insect proteins. For those who haven't heard, compared to all sources of protein (Cows, chicken, pigs, fish, plants etc.) insect protein is the least resource intensive. It's safe to say based on several macro economic factors that high-protein, low resource sustainable food sources should have a lot of room for growth, if not for human consumption initially, it can be fed to other animals. 

Darling had recently acquired Enviroflight LLC:

&gt; EnviroFlight, LLC is a leading developer of proprietary technologies which enable the rearing of non-pathogenic black soldier fly (BSF) larvae in a scalable manner. This innovative and responsible approach has considerable potential within the sizable global animal feed industry as it will provide an environmentally-friendly, toxin-free, sustainable source of high-value nutrients.

Based on this headline, I decided to look a bit deeper into the company.

You'll see that revenues in the past 5 years actually show negative growth. But Net Income had grown by 300% from 2018-19. I saw no large settlement, sale of assets (20m sale of business segments would only explain 6% of the change), or drop in expenses - SG&amp;A had in fact increased sizably. 

The culprit was a joint venture called Diamond Green Diesel. The net income from Darling's 50% stake was &gt;$360m, up over 100% from the year prior, and 1300% from 2017. 

In the 3 months trailing 9/26/20, net income attributable to Diamond Green Diesel is up 80% from the same three months last year. Hence the current price run. 

What is Diamond Green Diesel? 

&gt; a biodiesel facility and is a partner with Valero Energy Corporation in Diamond Green Diesel, a renewable diesel facility, both of which convert used cooking oils and animal fats into valuable biofuel products.

Renewable Diesel sounds good, what is it?

&gt; Renewable diesel is made from responsible and sustainable feedstock, such as used cooking oil, rendered animal fats and inedible corn oil. It is molecularly the same as petroleum-based diesel and it meets the ASTM International’s standard for Diesel Fuel Oils (D-975).

&gt; Renewable diesel is a clean-burning, drop-in fuel (chemically identical to standard diesel) that can cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80%. It is 100% compatible with existing engines and infrastructure.

Sounds like the government might like to have Green Diesel replace regular diesel. Funny you should mention that:

&gt; For 2019, 2018 and 2017, biodiesel blenders registered with the Internal Revenue Service were eligible for a tax incentive in the amount of $1.00 per gallon of renewable diesel blended with petroleum diesel to produce a mixture containing at least 0.1% diesel fuel. In December 2019, this $1.00 per gallon blenders tax credit was reinstated retroactively for calendar years 2018 and 2019 and extended for calendar years 2020, 2021 and 2022.

Diamond Green/Darling is currently building facilities to increase its production 6 fold.

personalfinance,Highly Compenasate Employee 401K question,"A person in my household just had a meeting with their company stating that if/when this individual reaches a gross income threshold of 130,000, they will only be able to contribute 9k into their 401k, as opposed to the 18.5k (may be off by a little bit).  The person in our houshold makes 3/4 of their money off commission, and that amount may put them in the 130k range.  I do know that commission is taxed at 38ish% as opposed to the much lower standard federal tax rate of regular salary.  I was wondering, is it right/legal for a company to allow HCE rules to be in play when this person is being determined as a potential HCE off of hard work due to getting paid off commission?  It's not like they are HCE because the company chooses to pay them more than someone else at the company, but instead they are getting paid because they arguably work harder for bigger commissions.  Seems unfair to prevent someone who works hard from benefiting from the company 401k plan.  Also, are there any legal ways of reducing that gross income amount to prevent being punished by the 401k rule here?  I assume not, but looking for advice.  The company offers a wells fargo 401k account that has a locked in % that can be invested in if the 130k gross amount is hit that has an uncapped contribution threshold, but its hard to tell if that account will be needed as commissions are not guaranteed.  I need to do more research on this account as well; from what I understand this account cannot be rolled over, and we can take the money  out at any time with a standard tax rate taken off the top.  Another question I have is, that isn't soo bad right?  Won't that basically be how our 401k will work when we plan to retire and take out our contributions (as 401k are taxed when taken out at retirement)?   Lots of stuff here but if anyone has any insight, please let me know.  Thank you very much!",finance
personalfinance,What to do with unemployment windfall,"This feels like a pretty ridiculous situation, but it seems like I actually profited from losing my job - I had been working part time until the pandemic hit, at which point my hours were cut down to almost nothing. I registered for pandemic unemployment in my state, and after over 8 months, I finally received my unemployment benefits. Because of the FPUC, I actually received way more than I would have had I worked my job normally... Ridiculous, I know, but I'm not complaining. The thing is, I have been doing fine without the unemployment, so this extra money is essentially a windfall, and I am wondering how to best take advantage of it. 

For reference, I am receiving about $6k in unemployment assistance (thanks federal government!). I am 23 years old, just out of college. As of this autumn I have a stable job - I make about $34k a year, and I am pretty secure in my position. I am essentially on a 5 year contract, so barring me doing something awful, I shouldn't have to worry about getting fired. I currently have a savings account with about $12k, a checking account with $9k, and I currently have $3k in my Roth IRA, with a goal to max it out to $6k for this year. I also have about $6k in student loans. I am technically still in school so I don't have to start repaying my loans, though I plan to start soon. However, I'd like to wait until Biden takes office, since there's talk of a potential student loan forgiveness bill. 

What should I do with the $6k I am receiving from unemployment? Should I just wipe out my student loans? Should I use that to max out my Roth for next year? I could also contribute it to my savings, or open up a taxable brokerage account. I don't foresee any major expenses in the next few years, though I potentially could see myself buying property and/or getting married in the next 5-10 years, which will obviously require cash on hand. I'd like to take as much advantage of letting this money grow while I'm still young, though I am also a little nervous about having the majority of my savings tied up in a retirement account. Any advice about how to approach this windfall (or any other considerations) would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Can federal student loans pay off private loans?,"Hello everyone, in my situation I am a twin whose social security number got mixed up with my brothers when filing for taxes back in 2018. As such, the IRS wants me to fill out a 1040X so I could give the amended return back to the school, I’ve done so approximately around a week ago. The problem is however, is that it takes 16 weeks for the form to process, and the school wants this form by Jan. 4th and realistically it would take until April of next year to be done. Without the form in it’s impossible to get federal loans. So I was thinking is it possible to take out private student loans at first to pay off the tuition and then once I get everything sorted out for federal loans to use the federal loans to pay off the private loans. Effectively, my question is can I use federal loans to pay off the private loans I’m going to take for the spring semester once they are available?",finance

- How much should I keep in a HYSA vs. investment account? I was thinking of starting with 12 months of expenses in the savings account, then gradually pulling additional funds from my investment account with a goal of graduating with a 6 month emergency fund in savings.

- Are there any circumstances where it makes sense to take out a student loan even if you have savings? Interest rates are so low I could theoretically keep my money growing in the market while I live off the student loan and come out ahead compared to spending down savings, but not sure that I have the risk tolerance for this.

- I have ~$80k in savings outside of my retirement accounts, no debt

- Will quit my job 3-4 months before the program starts

- Plan to mostly live frugally by NYC standards, but do want to budget some fun money to do a couple of MBA trips/experiences

- Can probably work part-time in second year

personalfinance,Is it possible to refi our mortgage in this situation?,"My then-boyfriend and I purchased a home together in May 2017. At the time he was still in school - with no income and only debt on his credit report (student loans) we ended up doing the mortgage in my name only. We are both on the deed as joint tenants with survivors rights. The mortgage interest rate is something like 4.6%. We both have much better credit scores today than when we bought the house. 

We were married in March of this year, right before the world went to hell. I’m on an indefinite furlough, he’s been employed now with the same company since August 2017 and working from home. He recently got a raise and is now making more than I was at the time of the original mortgage. Our home has also appreciated considerably. Our mortgage balance is around $119k, we purchased at $156.8 with 20% down and it’s now worth $200-210k. 

Due to the wedding and some home maintenance issues, I have more CC debt than I did when I got the mortgage. I also purchased a new car that has 3 years left on the loan. We have additional income of $1200/monthly from my mother who lives with us as “rent” which is unofficial, it’s just her helping. We didn’t have this income when we bought the house. 

I think that’s most of the background. My question is - since we are both on the deed, is it possible to refinance but only in my husbands name? I am worried that my employment/DTI will screw us over if I’m on the mortgage.",finance

economy,A one-time tax on the ultra-wealthy could be the basis of the next relief bill,"during the coronavirus crisis face potential evictions and struggle to buy groceries, the government still hasn’t issued a second round of stimulus checks. At the same time, the collective wealth of U.S. billionaires has now grown by $1 trillion since the pandemic began. That’s enough, a new report says, to cover sending a $3,000 check to all 330 million-plus Americans, while leaving the billionaires wealthier than they were before the pandemic.


“If I were Congress, I would pass it immediate surtax or levy on billionaires,” says Frank Clemente, the executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, one of the groups that authored the report, which outlines how much the richest Americans have increased wealth during the pandemic. “I might even go lower than that, but I certainly start with billionaires, and call it the emergency pandemic wealth tax. Just lop it right off the top of these folks, and use that money for pandemic relief.”

Between the first lockdown in March and early December, Jeff Bezos’ wealth grew from $113 billion to $184 billion. Elon Musk’s wealth grew nearly five times larger, from $24.6 billion on March 18 to $143 billion on December 7. Mark Zuckerberg’s wealth grew from $54.7 billion to $105 billion. Dan Gilbert, the head of Quicken Loans, saw his wealth grow from $6.5 billion to $41.8 billion. In total, the 651 American billionaires saw their net worth grow from $2.95 trillion in March to $4.1 trillion in December.

If it wasn’t used for stimulus checks, the windfall could also pay for other critical programs. It’s twice as much as the estimated budget gap for state and local governments. It’s also only a little less than the total federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid.",finance
personalfinance,I don't know what to do! (Student loan payments!),"So forgive me - I've never been on this subreddit before, and my sister suggested that I try to make a post about the giant pickle I am in. She said y'all have been very helpful in the past so I really am looking forward to what you say :\^) That being said, I am not sure the norms / layouts for posts like this so I'm just going to write it as makes sense to me (it will be all over the place and I apologize). 

&amp;#x200B;

I (23F) am living in Milwaukee, WI and working as a teacher. I just graduated college in May and started my first year teaching in August. My salary is $41,400, and I take home $1202.96 twice a month, net. 

I live in an $800 single-bedroom apartment, which is pretty decent for here. 

Bills: 

* Energy - \~$40 a month
* Wifi - \~$70 a month, I am a month behind
* Cell phone - \~45 a month
* Spotify - $5.27 a month
* IPSY - $25 a month (I know that I *could* drop this but it is something I enjoy and makes me happy)
* Storage Unit - $67 a month (I'm hoping this is the last month I need to pay for it!)
* Prescriptions - $9.72 a month 

I have a cat, so spend \~$20 a month on food/litter for her. 

I know I overspend on fast food &amp; thrifting, but I have made a conscious choice to cut way back and budget this month. My goal was to give myself $75 a paycheck (2x a month) for thrifting, and $40 for ""fun stuff"" aka eating out, buying candles, etc. I know this is kind of a lot, but thrifting is something that helps with my anxiety and is something I am actively trying to work with a therapist about. (My anxiety is rooted in my money issues, go figure)

All of that has been manageable so far! However, this is where the issue comes in. Starting this month, I have to pay my private student loans to Sallie Mae. I have 5 loans from them (\~$66,000), cosigned by my parents, and it averages $800 a month.

Starting next month, (unless deferred again) I will need to pay \~$200 in federal loans each month. Combined with my private loans, that is more than my rent each month, and I just don't know how to do it or figure out how to (if it's possible) to budget with that in mind! 

I've tried to look into (private) loan refinance/consolidation, however, I do not have high enough credit to apply myself (missed some payments this summer and have medical debt I was not aware of - on a payment plan for), and my parents, who agreed to cosign for me, do not have a large enough income to qualify to cosign. I have applied through multiple institutions, and they have all rejected me and my cosigner, and cited those two reasons. My hail mary solution that I have tried now is applying with only 3 of my most expensive Sallie Mae loans, hoping that the ""smaller amount"" would work with my parents' income. However, we still got denied that application. 

I am actively working to try to boost my credit, by making my missing payments. My credit score is currently 579, which is 11 points higher than its lowest! (yay), but however, dropped from 734 in June of this year. 

I am working full time as a teacher, and I have been looking for tutoring work on the side. I just got hired at a thrift store on the weekends for $7.25 an hour, but need to wait for COVID test results to come back before I can begin onboarding there. I also think that I could make better use of my time perhaps than at such a low-paying job, but at this point I'm desperate. I also have been trying to get involved in online focus groups and very recently took a job with Appen, which is online work that helps train AI. I am really trying. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, that's all background info! This is where the post will take several different routes, as I have several different questions:

\- Is it possible to budget with my rent, bills, and loan payments? What would that look like? 

&amp;#x200B;

\- What are some actual side hustles I could do to earn more money? I've been looking at job sites nightly, and I can't find any good **weekend** work during a pandemic. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- My solution, so far, has been to apply for egg donation. I just want to shove as much money towards the Sallie Mae loans as possible. Good/bad idea? My family thinks this is a very rash decision, but this is something I have been considering since my freshman year of college. I know you can do several cycles (if it goes well), which could make my loans seem much more manageable. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know everyone has loans, and struggles with money, but this feels like too much. I feel like I'm constantly drowning. I was at a really good place in my life before, but since my loan payments are coming up it's all that's on my mind and I get so anxious.

personalfinance,I make approximately 3k a month and have virtually no monthly expenses... what would you do with this income in my situation?,"I am a 20something who just started my career. I consistently make approx 3k per month. I am wondering how to allocate my income.

The reason I have no expenses (no rent, no car, no phone/internet/utility bills, don't have to pay for groceries) is because I live with my parents. They don't ask me to pay for anything for the household. Many people may find this crazy, but this is culturally normal for my family and my parents do well for themselves and don't need me to pay for rent or groceries. I do want to eventually move on my own in the next few years, but for now want to enjoy how much I can save by living with my family. I don't pay for a car because I can share with a family member now since nobody is going anywhere much. Once things open up more after COVID I may have to get a lease.. but for the near future I have no car payment. 

The **only thing** I have to pay are my student loans of which I have about 25k left with an interest rate of 1.5%. I have 5 years to pay them off. I have been putting 1k per month on these loans (the minimum payment is about $500).

A little about me- I enjoy fashion, beauty, shopping, food, travel &amp; going out. But I don't consider myself a frivolous spender. I wait for sales and plan the vast majority of my purchases (I never impulse buy). With COVID I am trying to train myself that I don't need to spend on as many ""fun"" things. Also, I have a small side hustle which can earn me a couple hundred cash per month and usually use that cash as fun money.

Anyways, this brings me to my question. If you were me how would you allocate this income?

Right now I am doing the following monthly:

- about 1k per month towards student loans
- $800 into Ally savings account 
- $600 ""spending/fun money"" budget

This leaves a good chunk of money leftover. I plan to start a Roth IRA in the next month or so. How much should I contribute to it? I was thinking about $300 per month... that would still leave me with an extra $300 with those dollars having no job to do. **Should I contribute more to my loans, Roth IRA, or savings?**

I realize I am in a unique situation and as a young woman in her 20s I want to use this to set myself up well in the future. I also know that I want to make much more monthly in the future, I don't plan on being at my current job for more than a couple years.",finance

financialindependence,"Traditional vs Roth Contributions, Why it's not Marginal Tax Rates","I was going back and forth with a fellow FI member.  They made the claim that you shouldn't compare effective tax rates in retirement with marginal tax rates during accumulation but you should consider where to put the excess funds once you had enough Traditional IRA assets such that they filled the 12% tax bracket throughout retirement.  Any additional money withdrawn from the IRA would be taxed at the higher tax rate, 22% ,which would be the same during accumulation, if your marginal rate was 22%.  This is something that I struggle with and I decided to run a few scenarios, listed below, to see how this actually pans out.  I made this post so that the community can peer review my assumptions and work and see if it make sense.

*Assumptions:*

Traditional contributions and withdraws operate on a FILO principle such that contributions during accumulation are the first dollars removed from taxable income, and withdraws in retirement are the last added to your income.  Married filing jointly, take standard deduction, earn 150k/yr during accumulation and want to live a 150k/yr lifestyle in retirement.  100% Social Security taxable, in reality, most likely 85%.

*During Accumulation*

20K Traditional Contribution saves 22% in taxes = 4,400 in taxes.  Taxable income 150K - 20K - 25K = 105K.  Fed Taxes: 20K X 10% + 60K X 12% + 25K X 22% = 2K + 7.2K + 5.5K = 14.7K / 150K = 9.8% effective tax rate.

**Scenario 1: Pension and Social Security Fill 12% Tax Bracket**

SS = 30K, Pension = 50K, Trad Withdraw 150K - 50K - 30K = 70K.  Effective tax rate on the Traditional IRA money: 70K - 25K (Standard Deduction) = 45K, 45K X 22% = 9.9K taxes on Trad Withdraw / 70K Trad Withdraw = *14.1% effective tax rate on Traditional IRA withdraw* (compared to 22% savings on deposit)

Effective Tax Rate 20K X 10% + 60K X 12% + 45K X 22% = 2K + 7.2K + 9.9K = 19.1K / 150K = 12.7%

**Scenario 2: No Pension, SS = 30K**

Trad Withdraw = 150K - 30K = 120K.  Effective tax rate on the Trad: 120K - 25K (SD) = 95K, 50K X 12% + 45K X 22% = 6K + 9.9K taxes on Trad Withdraw / 120K Trad Withdraw = *13.3% effective tax rate on Traditional IRA withdraw* (compared to 22% savings on deposit)

Effective Tax Rate 20K X 10% + 60K X 12% + 45K X 22% = 2K + 7.2K + 9.9K = 19.1K / 150K = 12.7%

**Scenario 3:  No Pension or SS**

Trad Withdraw 150K, Effective tax rate on the Trad: 150K - 25K (SD) = 125K, 20K X 10% + 60K X 12% + 45K X 22% = 2K + 7.2K + 9.9K taxes on Trad Withdraw / 150K Trad Withdraw = *12.7% effective tax rate on Traditional IRA withdraw* (compared to 22% savings on deposit).

**Conclusion:**

It seems that the phrase, ""if your income is the same in retirement as it is today then it doesn't matter or Roth is better"" seems incorrect.  Even with the same 150K income/150K retirement lifestyle, the effective rate of your Traditional IRA withdraws is less than the rate at which deposits entered pre-tax vehicles.  I was surprised to see Scenario 1 was actually pretty favorable towards pre-tax.  Mainly because the standard deduction applies to the first (top) dollars of income, so basically Traditional IRA withdraws = the Standard Deduction are Tax Free.  This means that you need to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement in order for the effective tax rate on Traditional IRA money to equal your current marginal tax rate.  How much higher?  That's probably another post.  I tried to make sure I didn't make any math errors.  Let me know if it looks logical and sound.  Thanks for taking the time to read and good luck on your journey!

Edit:  Someone mentioned what about Roth and I believe you could just reverse the thinking.  Instead of saving 22% during accumulation and paying 14.1, 13.3, or 12.7% in retirement, flip it.  You spent 22% during accumulation and saved 14.1, 13.3 or 12.7% in retirement.",finance

personalfinance,Refinancing and Capital Gains,"Hey everyone,
I bought a house in 2015 and I’d like to refinance to get a lower interest rate. My question is, if I refinance now and I hypothetically sell the house one year for now, am I taxed for long term capital gains since I’ve lived in the house since 2015 or am I going to be taxed short term since I just refinanced and the loan and is technically now less than two years old?

Also, does refinancing increase property taxes since it’s getting appraised?",finance
personalfinance,Questions about the APTC tax credit and my situation. Very confused??,"So, i desperately need health insurance and i called an insurance broker to help me figure it out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my information so there's no confusion. I'm 27, and live with my family. In the state of florida. They currently support me. For arguments sake and so i can get insurance i was planning on them NOT claiming me as a depedendant. I know it gets more complicated then that. Also, they're both on social security for being elderly and each get around 1k a month. I currently am unemployed living with them making zero dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

HOWEVER i plan to get a job and make money. The broker told me i should put around 13500(and she did put this and got me insurance and a tax credit under this) so i would be eligible for a good credit. If i end up making more, then i'll owe money back. I asked her if i should purposely try to make less for that  year. She said no, because regardless i'll be making plenty more and the difference won't be massive (so for example if i have the opportunity to make 20k or end up making 20k i can just ""amend"" my application i guess and then owe the difference on taxes or something?)

Here's where i'm confused. These amounts, the 13k a year being eligible for a tax credit, what are the exact amounts and cutoffs? I originally put that i'd expect to make ZERO dollars and the application said i wasn't eligible for an APTC tax credit i guess? Why? I Thought it was based off how much below the federal poverty line you were. Isn't zero dollars way below? Is there a minimum amount you have to make a year to be eligible for a credit? If so, what is it?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if i end up not getting a job and make zero dollars that means i'll owe EVERYTHING back? Will this just be constantly taken out of my income taxes every year or will it be taken out of my paycheck? Or  do they only do that if it exceeds a certain amount? If i don't get a job and make zero and then owe it can i still apply the next year and do the same thing and if i don't get a job still just owe the thousands for that and it'll just very slowly be taken out of my income taxes over tens of years? Or what?

&amp;#x200B;

Also are these incomes GROSS and does that mean my amount on my checks before any taxes taken out? So if she put 13200 on my application expected that would  mean before any taxes are taken out? And also, is this EXPECTED income for 2021? So i'm telling the goverment or healthcare. gov website that i'll be expecting to make that much?

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, when i do my taxes, i'm assuming it'll be in 2022 for the year of 2021 (this coming year.correct?)   (i also use turbotax, free edition)  on what part of the application in turbotax will it ask about this insurance thing? How will it be worded? Will it straight up say did you apply for insurance on the marketplace and get a tax credit? I don't want to miss that part on my application as this is the first time i'll be doing this.

&amp;#x200B;

Many thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

Ps- not asking for advice on fraud, just curious because i don't understand how this works as nothing explains it. I didn't lie on my application as i do predict i'll get a job and make that much.",finance
defi,Emoji.Farm,"One of the biggest problems many DeFi projects in the cryptocurrency space face today is the short life span of the many innovative projects that have come about. Driven largely by hype even if good evidence of a solid DeFi ecosystem exists, these projects often spike in price only to take a nose dive when traders decide to liquidate and take profits. while certain projects have tried to address this issue outright, a solution has yet to be found. The *Consentium* ecosystem has decided to take this problem head on and has developed ***Emoji Farm***.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5sevcv3iiq461.jpg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42d7f5efb1a0bb513e0e4b2f2475746c0486ca50

**Emojis** **Farm** (*EMOJI*, *0xcbd380c2d84deafed09f79863705353505764f26*) is an ERC20 token created by the Consentium ecosystem developers that focuses on providing multiple yielding opportunities and multiple liquidity pools to help sustain a yield farming ecosystem. ***Emoji*** provides yield farming opportunities on the protocol level while allowing multiple projects the opportunity to enjoy added liquidity.

Currently there are 5 different ***Emoji*** asset pairings. They are as follows:

* *EMOJI/MPH*
* *EMOJI/MGX*
* *EMOJI/CSMx*
* *EMOJI/yPLT*
* *EMOJI/HAKKA*

When staking your ***EMOJI***, APY is set at 1,000%. Holders will generate an average of 0.6592% compounded interest if staked for 365 days. The formula regarding the set APY is listed below:

* *1.006592\^365 = 11.0031791046*

For holders to qualify for the 1,000% APY they must also contribute to the Liquidity Pools for the asset of their choice. They can contribute by adding either ***EMOJI*** or the token of their choice via the Half-Liquidity function in the smart contract. This fixed APY is based on a daily compounded interest that is generated through a daily rebase which is called on a daily basis.

In addition to staking ***EMOJI***, users/holders are able to partake in governance voting and procedures to help direct the ecosystem as a decentralized collective. This will allow the ecosystem a sense of pliability which enables quick adaption and evolution to various factors of influence that may arise in the cryptocurrency industry. For example, if the average APY was discussed and holders wanted to change it, it can be voted on and executed via community proposal and vote.

When a holder deposits into the Liquidity Pool, there is a 24 hour timelock on withdrawals to incentivis continuous liquidity contributions. Holders wanting to withdraw early, there will be a 5% withdrawal fee that is sent to the other liquidity providers who continue to stake. In addition, Liquidity Providers are also rewarded with LP tokens for providing liquidity with LP tokens.

With Emoji partnering up with many different DeFi projects, it will be interesting to see how their plan on fixing the sustainability problem turns out. Not only is Consentium building an entirely new ecosystem in Emoji, it is extending its own while also adding branches to the other projects who can benefit by staking their own tokens for Emoji and providing liquidity. Keep an eye to see if ***EMOJI*** has delivered a concept to help all of DeFi.

personalfinance,"Can someone please explain the differences and pros and cons of an IRA, Roth IRA, and an IRA CD","I'm getting very confused. We are selling our house and I'm planning on putting some money away for retirement. The bank suggested we hire an accountant, but I don't have the money for that. (Yes we're selling a house, but all that money is paying off our debts, renovating the home we inherited, and savings/investments.) I kept hearing about IRAs and Roth IRAs and I understand the difference is how your taxed and a traditional IRA taxes you when you take it out and a Roth IRA taxes you when you put it in. To me it seems you'd pay less taxes on a Roth IRA as they then couldn't tax the interest right? Now I've learned about CDs and those seem to have a higher interest rate, but you can't add to it till the time is up? But the bank offered some sort of IRA CD (I don't remember exactly what it was called or have the paperwork in front of me) where basically you get the CD with the high interest rate but you get an add on IRA where you can still add money? Wouldn't that be the way to go? I'm not sure if I'm understanding any of this right. Advice/explanations please.",finance

personalfinance,Wells Fargo Student Loan: Should interest applied vary between statement date and due date.,"Stupid question that boggles my mind. 

When I get my statement in the mail from wells fargo it's date say the 5th of the month and the due date is the 25th of the month for say $550. 

Why is the amount applied to principal and interest dependent on when they get their money between the 5th and 25th?

Now I understand basic interest rates. I know the concept as you keep paying less is applied to interest and more to principal. 

But 
if my bill says $550 is due on this date. And I pay before that date. Why would only $7 be applied to principal a couple days before the due date when the month before it was like $250 paying closer to statement date.

I feel like I am being penalized for paying my bill before the due date. 

Say someone is paying by check. They received the bill in the mail and they send a check and it's posted two days later. That means they can never pay the minimum interest for that pay period. 

Does this seem suspect? Am I missing something?",finance
ada,Ada Planet - news aggregator from the Ada programming world - reminder and asking for advices,"I'll take the opportunity that Ada Planet wasn't mentioned here by some time and advertise it again :)

[Ada Planet](https://www.laeran.pl/adaplanet/i/) is the news aggregator from the Ada programming language world. It's basically monitoring a few places for news, blog posts or any other texts related to the Ada and when it finds them, download them and combine in one list of articles to read. That list can be accessed by everyone (without any paying or registering) by:

* Visiting the [Ada Planet](https://www.laeran.pl/adaplanet/i/) page
* Setting RSS reader to its [RSS feed](https://www.laeran.pl/adaplanet/i/?a=rss&amp;hours=24) (this one is with articles from the last 24 hours)
* Following it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AdaPlanet1)
* Following it in Fediverse on [Mastodon](https://botsin.space/@AdaPlanet)

1. The most important: if you know any site which isn't monitored by Ada Planet, please send me its address here in this post discussion, in private message or any other way which you find to contact me, without necromancy, etc. related things. I will try to add it to the planet. Things which works on 100% are: pages with RSS feeds, Twitter accounts, Fediverse accounts (most of them should have RSS feeds too), YouTube accounts.
2. This is related to the newest addition to the Ada Planet. Experimentally I added [the special category](https://www.laeran.pl/adaplanet/i/?a=normal&amp;get=c_6) there with the list of changes to some (in my opinion) important projects for the Ada programming language. At this moment, entries from this list don't appear in the main stream. I'm asking for advice: As you think, they should be merged into the main stream, so they will be visible as normal entries? Or this is a completely bad idea and these things shouldn't be added to the planet?
3. This is related to the #2. If you think, adding that category is a good idea, what other projects would you like to see? I mean what projects in your opinion are important for the Ada programming language (and its community) and should be added to the list too. Of course, I cannot promise that everything will be added, sometimes I'm very stubborn person... ok, I'm regularly stubborn :P

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning December 14th, 2020","Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 14th, 2020.

# **Year-end Santa rally could depend on the big week ahead for markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/congres-fe.html)**
*****
&gt; The week ahead is so jam-packed for markets that it could determine whether there will be a smooth glide path for a Santa rally into the end of the year.
*****
&gt; First, Congress looks set to fight down to the wire about a pandemic stimulus package, and chances are good it could again disappoint. The Fed also holds its final meeting of the year, and market pros are split on whether it will tweak its bond buying program when it issues its statement Wednesday. Since there’s a divided view, there’s room for market reaction either way.
*****
&gt; Then there is lots of really meaty data, including November retail sales Wednesday, the Markit Purchase Manager Indexes and regional Fed surveys.
*****
&gt; Finally, Tesla will be rolled into the S&amp;P 500 at Friday’s closing bell, and that could bring its own fireworks as big investors lighten up on the other index stocks to make room for entrance of the electric car maker in their portfolios. That also happens on a day that could have its own built-in volatility — the quarterly quadruple witching expiration of options and futures.
*****
&gt; “To me, the most market moving piece of information is, do we or don’t we get a stimulus package? The market has priced one in, so the biggest disappointment is if we don’t get one,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “The tug of war between the virus and vaccine had a tiebreaker in stimulus.”
*****
&gt; Hogan said a positive could be if the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday votes to approve the Moderna vaccine, a week after it considered Pfizer’s vaccine. But it is really Congress the market is looking to now, and if it acts, it will be a market positive.
*****
&gt; “I think that propels us into the year-end and higher levels. It only takes one of these things to pull over the apple cart, and the one that could matter is Congress not getting something out the door on stimulus. That would pull us back the hardest,” Hogan said.
*****
&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the expiration of unemployment benefits for millions of Americans at the end of December could push Congress to act.
*****
&gt; “But you can’t ignore the strong stance the Republicans have taken on liability for business and the strong stance the Democrats have taken on state aid,” he said.
*****
&gt; Tom Block, Washington policy analyst at Fundstrat, said he sees a 50/50 chance for a deal by the end of the week. If there is no agreement, federal unemployment benefits for millions and an eviction moratorium would expire at the end of the month.
*****
&gt; Block said that even if Congress fails to immediately approve a bill to prevent a government shutdown, he expects lawmakers to reach an accord and keep the government running. But the stimulus is unclear, and much of it is a relief package.
*****
&gt; “There’s a solution staring them in the face, and the record food lines are in red states and blue states,” he said. “Both sides seem to be unwilling to come to a deal on what they commonly agree on.”
*****
&gt; # Tesla revving up the S&amp;P
&gt; Tesla’s entry into the S&amp;P 500 is a much-anticipated event that traders expect to add some volatility to the market, as investors in the S&amp;P index shift holdings. Tesla joins the S&amp;P 500 on Dec. 21, at Friday’s closing price, and Friday has the potential to be a wild day .
*****
&gt; “I don’t know if it creates volatility. It’s going to create a significant amount of frenetic trading which may have the aspects of volatility,” said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors. “Given we are interacting with a very high-volatility regime already, I think it wouldn’t take much to see the VIX spike.”
*****
&gt; Bartolini said there was already a lot of trading activity expected with the expiration of options and futures Friday. “It’s just going to create more noise,” he said.
*****
&gt; Tesla is the biggest company to join the S&amp;P 500, and the rebalance Friday will be the largest ever. Tesla will be the seventh-largest stock in the S&amp;P.
*****
&gt; Index fund managers will have to buy upwards of an estimated $70 billion of Tesla, and that means selling the other S&amp;P 500 stocks to make room. There will also be trading based on weighting adjustments in the index.
*****
&gt; “What you will likely have is people naturally are going to buy Tesla and sell other shares. It could create some upward momentum in Tesla and downward pressure on the shares that are going out,” Bartolini said.
*****
&gt; “It will be exciting. You’re going to see Tesla trade at significant volume.”
*****
&gt; # Fed ahead
&gt; The Fed meeting will also be important, and it has been a hot topic of speculation, particularly in the bond market. Some market pros expect the Fed could make changes to its bond program. The Fed is currently buying at least $80 billion a month of Treasurys, and Fed officials have discussed what they could do to change that program at their last meeting.
*****
&gt; There is now speculation that the Fed will hold the purchases at $80 billion a month, but change the type of securities it is buying, with more focus on longer-dated notes and bonds. That would theoretically hold rates down at the long end, but only about half of market participants expect the Fed to take action at this meeting.
*****
&gt; The Fed also is buying at least $40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities.
*****
&gt; “It means at least half the market is going to be disappointed with whatever the Fed does or doesn’t do,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at Incapital. “That has the potential to cause some volatility, especially in the rates market, and potentially in risk markets.”
*****
&gt; Stocks were choppy in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down just about 1% at 3,663. Treasury yields moved higher in the past week but retrenched Friday, when the 10-year sank below 0.9%.
*****
&gt; # Window on the economy
&gt; There’s a busy economic calendar in the week ahead. Weekly claims Thursday are expected to be closely watched after a surprise jump in people seeking new benefits for the week ending Dec. 5.
*****
&gt; November Markit PMIs for the manufacturing and services sectors are released Wednesday, as is the November retail sales report.
*****
&gt; Boockvar said he is watching to see how much the services sector is being impacted by the spreading pandemic and related shutdowns.
*****
&gt; “I think the economic data is being overlooked for better or worse because it’s pre-vaccine,” he said.
*****
&gt; Economists expect the economy is slowing and the labor market has been weakening, particularly since the virus spread has continued to accelerate. Some expect the first quarter to be weaker than the fourth quarter, but activity should pick up in the second quarter as the vaccine is distributed.

&gt; # Not All Bad for Small Business

&gt; This morning the NFIB released their monthly reading on the small business sector. With case counts rising throughout November, small business optimism took a hit. Compared to September and October's identical readings of 104, November's reading fell to 101.4. Although that is lower, it remains above the levels seen from March through the summer. Additionally, there were several silver linings in this month's report.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Headline.png))**

&gt; Glancing across the various components and sub-indices of the report, breadth was pretty mixed. Of the ten components of the headline number, six fell and the remaining four were higher. Of the other indices that are not inputs to the headline number, half of the indices were higher while another two were unchanged, and the other two were lower.

&gt; As for the most pressing problems reported by small businesses, there was little change overall. Quality of labor remains the most widely reported problem, stealing share from those reporting the cost of labor as the biggest issue. The second biggest issue and the only other one to see an uptick in November was taxes. Perhaps due to the results of the election and the prospects of higher taxes down the road, the percentage of respondents reporting taxes as the most pressing issue rose 3 percentage points to 20%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Table.png))**

&gt; Taking a deeper dive into the individual components of the report, the various indices concerning employment metrics were pretty strong in November. While the index for actual employment changes remains negative meaning more businesses reported declines in employment rather than increases, that is not to say businesses are not looking to gain employees.

&gt; For starters, a higher number of responding firms (34% vs 33% in October) reported that they had at least one unfilled job opening in November. That is in the top decile of all historical readings. Breaking that number down further, the NFIB highlighted that 29% of those were for skilled workers and 13% were for unskilled workers. Additionally, businesses do plan to fill open positions in the near future. The index for plans to increase employment rose from 18 in October to 21 last month. Overall, more than half of firms said that they either hired or are trying to hire as 30% reported that either cost or quality of labor have been the biggest roadblocks to their business. Given these apparently tight labor conditions, the indices for compensation and plans to increase compensation were both higher.

&gt; We would also note that the divergence between businesses wanting/trying to fill positions and declines in the actual number of employees reported is consistent with what we saw in last week's data from the ISM report.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Empl.png))**

&gt; Rising employment and compensation can be justified when looking at the indices concerning sales and earnings. While these broadly took turns lower this month, they remain at readings that are consistent with more companies than not seeing sales growth. The index for earnings changes turned a bit lower falling from -4 to -7. Despite that, it is still a level that is at the top of its historic range. Additionally, a net 5% of reporting firms saw higher sales over the past three months, down slightly from 6% last month.

&gt; In turn, the net percentage of owners expecting sales to be higher also fell to a reading of 10% from 11% last month. Even though sales were a bit weaker, prices have continued to rise. The index for companies reporting higher prices rose from 15 to 18. That is the highest level of that index since a reading of 19 in May of 2018. NFIB highlighted further that the most common businesses to report higher prices were retail (28%) and wholesale (23%).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Sale.png))**

&gt; Although the decline in expected sales was modest and businesses plan to increase hiring, the index that took the biggest hit in November was the reading for expectations for the economy to improve. That index for the general outlook of business conditions fell 19 points month over month to a low reading of 8. That is the lowest level since March when the index was 3 points lower at 5. Additionally, the only time the index has declined by more in just one month was in November of 2012 when it fell from 0 to -38 in just one month. Other indices like those for expenditures and whether or not it is a good time to expand similarly remain weak, but did not see the same sort of dramatic declines.

&gt; Looking at other indices though, this decline appears to have been relatively extreme. A net 5% of owners report inventory levels are too low which is tied with September for a record high. While a greater share of firms plan to increase rather than reduce inventories, that index did fall from a 48-year high of 12 last month down to 5 in November. Despite that historically large single month decline, this monthly reading is still at a strong level.

&gt; # Meet the Nasdaq 100's Post-Election Leaders

&gt; The Nasdaq 100 finally made a new high on Tuesday before pulling back yesterday, but in the run-up to new highs in the post-election rally, it hasn't been the same old crew of stocks pushing the index higher. While the Nasdaq 100 is up about 12.5% since the election, thirteen stocks are up by more than twice the amount of the index itself. Leading the way higher, Moderna (MRNA) is up over 100% after positive news regarding its vaccine. After MRNA, shares of Pinduoduo (PDD), a Chinese e-commerce play, have rallied more the 50%, rising from $97.72 up to $154.00. Tesla (TSLA) rounds out the top three with a gain of 47% in just the last five weeks. The next two stocks on the list - Applied Materials (AMAT) and Micron (MU) - can hardly be considered emerging stocks. In addition to those two stocks from the semiconductor sector, three others from the sector made the cut (LRCX. MCHP, and QCOM) as chips have been red-hot.

&gt; At the bottom of the table, we have also included the performance of the five mega-cap stocks of the Nasdaq 100. While all five stocks outperformed for much of 2020, not a single one of them is outperforming the Nasdaq 100 since Election Day, and only Apple (AAPL) is anywhere close to matching the performance of the index itself.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-Nasdaq-100.png))**

&gt; The chart below shows the performance of an equally-weighted basket of the five mega-cap stocks over the last year. From 9/2 to 9/23, this basket of stocks pulled back more than 16%, and while it has been steadily grinding higher in the eleven weeks since that low, up until this point, the prior highs from September haven't even come into play.

&gt; # Sentiment Still Overwhelmingly Bullish

&gt; For the third week in a row, just under half of the respondents to the weekly AAII sentiment survey reported as bullish. This week's bullish sentiment reading came in at 48.06%, which was down just slightly from 49.07% last week. While lower in the past week, bullish sentiment remains elevated in the top decile of readings over the past decade. Granted, it is also still below the high of 55.84% from November 12th. Similarly, the Investor Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers also saw bullish sentiment drop slightly, falling from 64.7% to 64.4%. But again just like the AAII survey, that is a historically elevated level in the top 3% of all readings since 1963.

&gt; With bullish sentiment lower, a higher percentage of investors reported as bearish. Whereas last week saw bearish sentiment fall to 22.66%, the lowest level since the first week of 2020, this week bearish sentiment rose 4.2 percentage points to 26.86%. That is still below the reading of 27.47% from the last week of November and at the low end of the past few years' range. In terms of bearish sentiment, the Investors Intelligence survey is again echoing these results. This survey saw bearish sentiment rise 0.1 percentage points to 16.8%.

&gt; # Rally To Resume Mid-Month - Typical December Seasonal Pattern

&gt; For the most part, this December has unfolded in rather typical seasonal fashion. The market started the month off with solid gains and continued to rally through the fourth trading day before turning somewhat mixed. Russell 2000 and NASDAQ advanced an additional two trading days while DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 see-sawed essentially sideways until yesterday, the seventh trading day of December.

&gt; Currently the major indexes are navigating the often-dull period that has historically begun around the fourth trading day of the month through the eighth. Afterwards, later this week into early next week, another patch of weakness is possible. Then right around mid-month, the rally that began in at the beginning of November, is likely to resume. The resumption could be bumpy but once quarterly options expiration passes our Santa Claus Rally will begin on the open of trading on December 24. Since 1969, S&amp;P 500 has enjoyed an average gain of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally that spans the last five trading days of this year and the first two trading days of next year.

&gt; # Is Inflation Looming?

&gt; The November reading for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most well-known measure of inflation, was released Thursday, December 10, and while both the headline and “core” readings (excluding food and energy) came in slightly higher than the Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ consensus, core inflation remains tame at 1.6% over the trailing year. Inflation is likely to pick up as the economy improves and may run a little hotter than we’ve seen in recent years in 2021, but we believe the risks of a substantial inflation surprise over the next year is limited.

&gt; “Congress and the Fed provided massive stimulus this year and it seems like that should be inflationary,” said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, “but it’s important to remember that the stimulus was there to fill a giant hole from lost wages and an economy running well below its potential.”

&gt; As shown in today’s LPL Chart of the Day, core inflation on a trailing-year basis still has some catching up to do, although the one-month reading is now largely consistent with pre-Covid levels. inflation over the last decade has remained subdued and largely steady.

personalfinance,Question on financing a new-build,"TLDR - Can I lock into a home loan interest rate right now for a home that will be built in say 6-8 months?

Here's my situation:

I need to wait about 6 months before purchasing my first home in order to save for a down payment, closing costs, etc. I'm in the $250K-$300K range. I have been browsing used homes but am also entertaining the idea of a new-build.

Rates are ridiculous right now and I'm getting anxious they might start taking a hike back up. 

I'm wondering if there are any financing programs (first time home buyer or otherwise) on a new-build that would allow me to lock into a rate and a pre-qualification right now but not actually finance the loan until I'm ready to move into the home and start making payments?

To me it sounds like there could be a loophole on financing a new-build home since it takes time to build, and therefore giving me time to save.

I feel like people who pursue new-builds would want this option as the fluctuation in rates could make or break the affordability for said new-build home in 6+ months.

Any help on this? Or is this wishful thinking?",finance
investing,Observation: The 10-year US Treasury Yield,"**TL;DR- be wary of current yields, unless the Federal Reserve continues to march the Monetary Base (significantly) higher.**

Dating back to 1962, the 10-year median of the 10-year US treasury note yield (nominal) and the Savings to Monetary Base ratio has a R2=0.98; see graph here \[1\]: [https://imgur.com/a/7kqAJf7](https://imgur.com/a/7kqAJf7) . For this purpose, Savings is simply defined as Disposable Personal Income less Personal Consumption Expenditures, seasonally adjusted annual rate, in dollars. 

Simplistically, the 10-year US treasury note yield is on average roughly 4x greater than (edit: correction from 5x) that of the Savings to Monetary Base Ratio, i.e. if the Savings to Monetary Base Ratio is 1, then the 10Y yield is 5%.

Presently, the 10-year median of the Savings to Monetary Base ratio is 0.433x. The 10-year median of the 10Y yield is 2.21%, highlighted in the linked graph above as ""Present Day"".

The Federal Reserves monetary policies and actions have driven the monetary base significantly higher since 2008, from roughly $850 billion in mid-2008 to over $5,000 billion since last reported. Over the same period of time, savings has increased as well, from roughly $850 billion to over $2,800 billion last reported.

Impacts from COVID-19 to both spending and the monetary base are reflected in the numbers above. As last reported (October 2020), the Savings to Monetary Base ratio is 0.58x, while the 10Y yield was 0.88%.

This graph shows Savings and the Monetary Base beginning shortly prior to the Global Financial Crisis (same scale) \[2\]: [https://imgur.com/a/0eDEOBX](https://imgur.com/a/0eDEOBX) 

A narrower timeframe of 2-years (median) indicates that the present level for Savings to Monetary Base ratio is 0.56x and the 10Y yield is 1.69%, R2=0.925, graphed here \[3\]: [https://imgur.com/a/LoNhLil](https://imgur.com/a/LoNhLil) 

The “gap” between the median for the Savings to Monetary Base ratio and the 10Y yield, for these two timeframes (2y and 10y, or graph \[1\] and \[3\]), was only wider between Q3 1981 and Q2 1982, or when the bear market is US treasury prices ended. Unlike that period, the gap reflects extreme overvaluation of the 10y treasury note price, i.e. yields are “too” low.

To correct this, yields do not have to go higher. Rather, an ever-rising monetary base relative to savings can bring that ratio back in line with the current 10Y yield. Given local and world events, this possibility remains high.

If, rather, savings outpaces the monetary base, then history argues yields are too low; this accounts for Fed policies post-2008, such as Quantitative Easing (QE). Assuming no changes in the savings to monetary base ratio (false assumption), fair value for the 10-year is between 2.00%-2.25% over the next 24 months.

Assuming yields are fair value now, and the trend of higher savings in dollar terms continues (since 2008), I would expect that the monetary base to at least double in the very near future; let’s call that 24 months. In August 2019, the monetary base stood at $3,200 billion. By May 2020, that number rose to $5,150 billion due to the impacts from COVID-19.

I've searched around and haven't found much on this particular situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I purchased my home 10 month ago (February 2020) at an interest rate of 4.125% with PMI rolled in to the loan for 263K. My current payment after escrow and etc is right under $1800. I got a letter in the mail from my current mortgage lender, which got bought out by a bigger company, offering a better rate. The details of the refi are:

1. Interest Rate around 2.875% (800 Credit Score).
2. PMI will now be a monthly charge and be $78 a month.
3. Total Payment will be $1720 a month after refi.
4. Closing costs are around $2,400-2800 and will be added to the loan.
5. I will stay on my current term (30 yr)

I calculated a break even of 2.5 years just based on the monthly savings alone. It is a fixer upper, but I am confident we will be here around 5 years.

Based on the above, this seems like a lay-up. People of reddit, is there anything I am missing?

How is our current market pricing green energy stocks? Are they:

* Already priced in **some** of what Biden wants. So maybe instead of 500,000 new charging stations, they expect maybe 200,000?

* Not pricing in any of Biden's promises. The growth is based purely on the new green regulations coming from states and and other foreign countries. 

Representative stocks are plays like Chargepoint, Tesla, Plug, Sunrun, solaredge, etc. I personally think it is problematic if the green stocks are soaring due to expectations of the new administration doing a lot for green energy.

personalfinance,Help getting my Father's finances back in order,"Throwaway account because the information below is not technically mine, but my father's. 

Hi r/PF,

I (28M) have been lurking this sub for the past year and learned so much that I've applied to my finances, career, and retirement savings. I recently got involved in my father's (57M) finances when I realized that he had no idea how health insurance works (deductibles, out-of-pocket max, etc.). He's always seemed like he had everything in order, but knowing what I know now, I see that he was doing his best to make it up as he goes and not burdening my mom (55F) and me &amp; my siblings (19F &amp; 31M) with the details. I definitely appreciate this, but I've definitely grown more now in a way that I can at least offer a lending hand. Looking at his current situation, I see A LOT of places that could be improved. Some are areas that are easy, and others are a bit more complicated and I don't have enough experience for the implications. I think I definitely know more than my dad at this point, but I want to run it by this sub first in case there's something I'm missing.

I can't tell him to completely reduce his lifestyle spending in order to get good retirement because I don't want him to think that he and my mom will be alone to fend for themselves during retirement, but I do want to stop the ""bleeding"" from fees and save money where it's possible to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Situation:**

* Since he's 57, he definitely has retirement on his mind and his biggest priority is for him and my mom to be able to live in retirement peacefully. My brother and I are in well enough careers that we've expressed that we're willing to help with our little sister's college expenses if needed.
* Mortgage of $300k remaining in our home. I believe it's valued at around $540k at the moment, but selling it is not an option for us. He's put in a lot of time and effort in remodeling the house for my mom and has large sentimental value.
   * He refinanced it in 2016, so he still has 25 years on it at 4.375% interest rate. More on this later!
   * Paying property taxes and home insurance as part of mortgage/escrow
* From what I can tell, his retirement savings is mediocre at best. 
   * He currently has 193k in an old 401k (177k Pre-tax,16k Roth)
      * He's been paying $11.25 per month in management fees on this that he didnt realize.
   * He has 42k in a new 401k in his new job (BIM specialist currently working from home)
      * His new job is offering GREAT benefits and he's maximizing it as best he can at the moment (contributing 11% Pre-tax w/ 10% employer match)
   * He has (3) annuities that he bought at the advise of my aunt (his older sister, she's a ""financial advisor"", more on this later)
      * 50k tied up for 10 yrs and growing at 0.95% max, but with a 6% bonus if it lasts the entire 10 yrs. No fees from what I could tell. This money came from the home refinance.
      * Another 50k tied up same as above. Also came from the home refinance.
      * 19k tied up for 10 years from an IRA rollover. 
* He's making around $95k currently + lots of overtime work, so let's say around $100k. His work offers great benefits, and this is probably the peak of his career income from our guess.
* He has around 3mo emergency fund savings spread between (4) bank accounts. He also has little credit card debt and pays it off as best he can.
* About my aunt. She's a ""financial advisor"" and his older sibling, so he's always put blind trust in her suggestions. We've drifted apart, so we don't talk to them much if at all anymore, but what's done is done. 
   * As mentioned, he has (3) annuities sold by her and (3) Universal Life insurance policies as well. 
   * My dad is diabetic and 57 years old, so at this point the UILs are pretty stuck to them. Of course, I checked the value of the ""savings"" inside them after 12 years and there's just a little more than $5k in each of them.
   * As I've said, he's drifted apart from her now, so he's willing to make changes where it can help, especially since he now sees that I have some understanding about these topics that he didn't previously.

**Our plan so far****:**

* We've reduced his bills from Comcast by giving them a call and finding a better plan without the cable that he doesn't use anyways.
* We're looking around for a new security system to replace the expensive ADT costs.
* I've introduced my parents to GoodRX and we're gonna see how much we can save on that.
* I'm trying to get quotes on auto+home insurances. Currently, he has them on two different companies so I'm trying to find discounts that could be taken advantage of that we didnt know existed before.
* For his 401ks, we've moved them from the target date funds to low-cost funds that mirror the allocation of the target funds to save on ER costs.
   * I'm thinking we should rollover the $193k 401k to an IRA to save on the management fees, but I don't fully understand the process of this yet. The 193k consists of (177k Pre-tax,16k Roth). How does this affect the rollover?
* I want to do something about those annuities, but I don't know my options. 
   * Since his main goal is retirement, we thought about cancelling one of the $50k annuities and contributing the max to a Roth IRA for 2020 and then for 2021. 
   * We want to grow the remaining in some similar way as well, though I don't know what other options there are. We also don't fully understand the tax implications of withdrawing from the annuity. 
   * We know he will have to pay a surrender charge, but we've considered it might be worth it if the money can be put to  grow somewhere else better.

This is all we have so far. There's so much here, that any help would be much appreciated. Thank you.",finance

stocks,FIII EV Merger and Tailwinds in the Last Mile Delivery Market,"While there are a swarm of posts regarding GIK merger with eLightning Motors despite both DAs were announced on same date, i feel that FIII is being swept under the rug here when there are strong tailwinds in the EV commercial last mile delivery segment. This is a company which I can foresee is going to dominate in a space of their own. Let me elaborate by giving a DD to first bring the uninitiated up to speed.

Merger Company: **Electric Last Mile Solutions (ELMS)**

As its name implies, ELMS primarily operates in the last mile delivery market from the transportation hub to the final destination - either to the customer's doorstep or retailers. With the continued rise in the e-commerce space, the market for last mile delivery vehicles would only become more important. This is soon becoming a $1 trillion market due to the exploding e-commerce scene in US. You may think ""meh, it's already a saturated market flooding with competitors in the EV space, what's so different about this?""

Familiar with Blue Ocean Strategy &amp; First-Mover advantage? If not, here is a live example with what ELMS is doing:  
Think of the EV space as a red ocean with rivalling competitors like Workhorse, Hyliion, Lightning eMotor, Tesla, Arrival and many others. However, if you break them down to different class categories, most vehicles are in the class 3 to class 8 categories (more heavy duty vehicles). Now, think of a blue ocean with little or no competition - **Class 1 EV Vehicles.** And this is exactly what ELMS is focusing on, where they are the ***first*** to bring in their Urban Delivery EV Vehicles in the Class 1/2 segment in the US. They also have the Urban Utility which operates in the Class 3 segment (Medium-duty). Therefore, ELMS' strategy to target the Class 1 to 3 category in the commercial delivery vehicle market will represent over 80% of the last mile market.

Three biggest competitive advantages they have going for them right now:

1. **U.S plant with existing operations -&gt;** ELMS will be acquiring the former Hummer plant in Indiana which is currently owned by Sokon, a Chinese publicly-listed company with a proven track record of more than 30k EV vans already sold and driven **ON THE ROAD** since 2017. Now, I understand your concerns with this as Chinese companies aren't receiving a good rep recently especially with the current regulatory &amp; delisting woes.

However, let me ease your concerns with the following points:

* ELMS will be an ***independent*** US company where vehicles are produced right here in US. Sokon will only provide the know-hows, supplying certain parts, and field data which is critical for scaling operations. Majority of EV systems and components are sourced in US, and compliant with US regulations This means that ELMS will NOT be affected by any of the above issues since it is an independent entity.
* To be frank, it's a smart strategic move by ELMS to acquire the existing operations of Sokon. Just imagine the sky-rocketing costs involved in engineering/developing/R&amp;D from scratch. Rather than incurring such costs, why not based it on an established EV company in Asia with a proven track record of already 30,000+ EVs on the road? This also helps to lower ELMS operating costs.

1. **Over 30,000 pre-orders with expected revenue of US$1B**  **-&gt;** from B2B customers like fleet managers , dealers and upfitters which the eventual end users are shipping and e-commerce companies such as Walmart, FedEX, Ikea &amp; Best Buy. This will be delivered in 2021 Q3 which is ***WITHIN ONE YEAR***\*.\*
2. **Lowest total cost of ownership** **-&gt;** 35% reduction in TCO compared to current Class 1 Gas Vehicles. Having a low TCO is important to establish a foothold in the last mile delivery market. This market doesn't give a shit how aesthetic/futuristic looking it should be (e.g. Arrival) but price matters, because why? Fleet managers want to lower the cost of delivery for their end customers so they can be more competitive. To lower cost of delivery, you will have to lower the cost of operations which is only possible if the TCO is low for vehicles. Therefore, I believe that ELMS is able to drive greater value to their B2B clients, and this will significantly attract more businesses = more revenue.

Still not enough? Let us briefly talk about management, both ELMS &amp; Forum Merger.

**ELMS** \- CEO &amp; Founder, James Taylor. He was previously the CEO of Workhorse with over 35+ years of experience in this industry, where he served as President for Cadillac and CEO for Hummer. This dude is an experienced veteran in this industry.

**Forum Merger Corp** \- Management and track records are important. This company previously performed two successful mergers. The first one was ConvergeOne in 2018, which was acquired nine months after merger by CVC capital. The second one is the recent success in October this year, Tattooed Chef, a leading plant-based company. Peak price went up to $25 per share prior to merger.

ELMS's merger is slated to be completed the first quarter of 2021. I believe that with the current EV hype and strong tailwinds in the last mile delivery market, the current share price of $12.49 (or $12.89 AH) is a steal. Easily, this could hit the range of $14 - $15 within this week or next and $17-$18 at height prior before merger.

Please know that this comes from a place of love, we are not trying to bring him down, but on his part, his actions are bringing the rest of the group down, especially in voice chat which we do often. Trying to be brief;

&amp;#x200B;

\-He has very few/no friends irl

&amp;#x200B;

\-Has never had a job and did not attend school past highschool (he is mid/late 20's)

&amp;#x200B;

\-Hits on female guildmembers in dms, but stops when asked to stop

&amp;#x200B;

\-Lashes out in angry outbursts over jokes that aren't even directed at him (literally screaming sometimes)

&amp;#x200B;

\-Makes pretty awful jokes or just repeats funny words and giggles to himself

&amp;#x200B;

\-Doesn't pay much attention to instructions and then even when he is the only one who has not done content goes ""yeah guys we really need to do \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to beat the boss, hey \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, you really need to work on that""

&amp;#x200B;

\-Lives with his mother, doesn't have a bank account, car or job and is not searching for one

&amp;#x200B;

\-White knights the female guildmates a fair bit even when asked to stop by the people he is white knighting.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Just says a lot of really awkward stuff and seems oblivious to how awkward it makes everyone else

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to be as objective as possible here. The guy has a good heart, but he doesn't help himself in his personal life, and for lack of a better word, he is what I would call a ""loser"". He tries his best and tries to work with people, but overall he can be a real nuisance. He has a lot of irl issues that he needs to actually work on, but as online friends, we can only help him so much, and then we end up getting the backlash from his frustration. It feels like he shirks from any sort of difficulty, and doesn't have any self motivation.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm at a loss for what to do. I want to be as inclusive as possible, and have been for the past 7-8 months with him, but the guy needs irl help that none of us can provide. He is genuinely bringing down the joyful/playful mood everyone else is in during group content with random outbursts or getting upset over really stupid stuff that half the time has nothing to do with him (and lots of slamming the keyboard if he dies/disconnects), and people are getting fed up with him. So r/gaming, I need your help, what advice and wisdom can you impart upon me? Experience as other members in a guild/clan/team/whatever or guildmaster advice, or as someone who feels like they align even partially with this guy's position, what would you think the best thing to do is? So far we have tried to be supportive and accepting, but other people are getting fed up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like kicking him like some others in the guild have suggested is a cop out and just the easy fix, and I don't want to hurt him, because we all consider each other friends. I would hope for a better outcome, but perhaps I will be convinced otherwise because he is doing more harm than good at this point. I really don't know.  


Also, I can already see the comments calling me out for considering this guy a friend and a loser. I dunno, I feel bad, but it just seems like the best description, and there's only so much I can do for him over the internet. I can handle being told I'm wrong to do that, but please, tell me also what I should do or give some helpful advice as well.",technology
gaming,"What gives Nintendo games the right to a Triple AAA price game and console, without the similar experience?","I'm probably going to be downvoted to hell, but I'm ignorant and curious, so I apologize. I'm a huge nintendo fan, but still don't understand why a game like super mario odyssey can be given the same price point, for years, compared to a game like Assassin's Creed Valhalla. It feels like robbery...

I remember playing the SNES and Genesis when I was younger, but really never experienced too much of a lesser experience between the two. I want to say the first time I noticed a difference was during the GameCube era? 

Everytime I ask a purely Nintendo fan this question, I get back an answer that involves games being worth far more than $60 USD anyways, so enjoying a title like Mario or Pokemon is totally worth it whether it be for nostalgia, or the replayability value of it.

However, it's not like Nintendo is broke compared to these game studios. It's not like they're understaffed. What stops them from coming out with a game like Valhalla? If you own a switch, which is relative in price to the Series X, you're stuck playing games that are short and extremely graphically downgraded. 

Skyrim was $60. Doom was $60. All feel like lite versions of the game, compared to their counterparts on the consoles. 

Is it just audience? Kids that mainly don't care about graphics, performance, or large amounts of content? Why are kids always targeted at a higher price?

Thanks in advance. This is a bit of a rant because I have a switch and just felt cheated in a way. I probably shouldn't. I own an Xbox with game pass and that is honestly one of the best deals I have ever gotten in gaming. Wish Nintendo would do something similar. 

I understand the whole nostalgia and replayability factor, but sometimes I feel like I'm playing mobile games on a $600 console

personalfinance,Better Savings Account For Customer Service &amp; Convenience: Schwab / Amex / Plat,"Hi all, I'm wondering if anyone can provide me some thoughts on this question.

I currently have some stocks in with Ally and checking account with Charles Schwab. I value customer service and simplicity and I sort of want an all encompassing service. So I'm torn between Ally and Schwab for banking.

I'm not looking really for a high yield savings account, what with how interest rates are and will continue to be but I'm wondering if I'm just looking for a savings account to grow an emergency fund before investing, does it even matter where I place the funds?

My main credit card is with Amex, so I'm wondering about their savings account as well. 

But since I have an Investors Checking Account with Charles Schwab - did it for the atm fee free feature - and since I might move my stocks from Ally to them, wouldn't it not be prudent to also move my savings account to them as well?

And the alternative would be to have everything with Ally instead, savings, checking, and stocks.

If you invest $100 today with 5% interest rate per year. How much will you have in five years? 

PV = $100, i = 5%, N = 5.

personalfinance,Got a letter from the IRS. Can someone please help me understand it?,"I think it's called a 2800c.

It reads... 

**""We believe you submitted an incorrect form W-4, Employer's Withholding Certificate, to your employer. Federal income tax is paid through withholding. Under-withholding on your wage income could result in you owing money when you file your federal tax return. It is a legal requirement to have adequate withholding from wages, timely file all tax returns and pay all taxes in full.**

**WHAT YOU NEED TO DO**

**-Immediately provide your employer with a new Form W-4.**

**-Vist wwww.irs.gov and search the keyword ""withholding estimator"" to determine the proper amount of federal income tax to be witheld from your wages.**

**Please DO NOT send the corrected Form W-4 to the IRS. You must provide the original to your current employer so they can withhold the proper amount of. Income tax from your wages.**

**WHAT CAN HAPPEN IF YOU DON'T SUBMIT A CORRECTED FORM W-4**

**""if you dont submit a corrected Form W-4 to your employer, we may determine that you aren't allowed to claim exempt status or less than a specified amount income tax withholding. You could be selected for the Withholding Compliance Program. We would send your employer a ""lock in letter"" instructing them to begin withholding tax from your wages based on a specified withholding status (filing status) and withholding rate to ensure adequate withholding.

My questions...

**1)** Which year are they talking about, 2019 or 2020?

**2)** I filed 2019 and was due refund. 

For this year, 2020, I got on the ""withholding estimator"" and it turns out I owe about $400. Is this what they are talking about? 

**3)** If it is, how do I resolve it? Can I just send them a check for the balance? Does the employer just start deducting the $400 from my wages like i think they are saying in the letter? If so, where is the employer going to take it out from exactly? I mean, if they start withholding using the corrected W-4, wouldn't that just be for tax year 2021 since we're at the end of 2020? How does that pay off my debt for 2020 (assuming 2020 is what they are talking about)? Or does it just mean I'll be receiving less refund for 2021 than I would have otherwise gotten had this had gone unnoticed? 

**4)** I am currently on unpaid leave, how would that factor in?

Basically, WTH is going on?? 

Really, really, reeeeeally appreciate any insight? 

**Some points that might be important:**

* I have never filled out a W-4. I assume it is done automatically by the employer based on the few tax questions they ask me upon hire. 

* I am no longer with the 2019 employer (started with them at the beginning of the first quarter of the year and left towards the end of the year). 

* I started with my current employer also at the beginning first quarter of the year. I have been on unpaid leave for a couple of months. 

* I just received this letter. 

* I changed my filing status for the first time for 2019. If I recall correctly, I had the employer change my filing status from 8 allowances to 6 about 2 months into the job. 

* In dire need of understanding this. Thanks again for any help!",finance

personalfinance,Should I refinance my house?,"Okay long story short, I bought a house in February of this year before everything shut down. Im just going to list out some of the details of the current loan and details of the new loan option. Basically when buying a house I didn't realize I could qualify for a better loan at the time and didn't research off of my options. 

Current Loan:

270k loan

3.625% interest rate

$230 a month PMI

no escrow - $1600 in taxes a year paid and insurance is tied to HOA so I can't get away from that payment.

New Loan:

270k loan

4% interest rate

no PMI payment

escrow for insurance and taxes.

closing costs - \~$6k

The monthly payments total would be about the same but the new loan would include taxes which I have paid out of pocket before. To me it makes sense to refinance but my its not so cut and clear because the 6k would take a huge cut into our savings account. Assuming everything went well we would be able to recover from it but it would still be a stress.

I know, How the hell did I get in that much debt. well, I went to an expensive private college and my parents didn't help. so I took out loans to cover tuition, books, food, etc. these loans also had high-interest rates. looking back I would do it differently, probably go to a state school.

anyway, I have a job. I make 70K a year, I have a 401K, paid vacation,  health care, annual bonus, and raises, etc. and I do enjoy my job, it's probably what I want to do for a living.

The problem is my mom is really pushing the idea of me getting my Master/PH.D. I majored in chemistry.  I told her I would think about it because I want to get my debt under control before going back to school. Long story short, this has been a touchy subject for a while. we both have gotten into arguments with each other about this.  and for the record, my mom doesn't have a science background. she does have a Master's. Her logic is that the more education you have the better off career wise you will be and I am sure that is true for some people.

But going to grad school would mean losing 5-7+ years of salary and promotions. And in a few years, I would even be making that starting salary if I had a PH.D anyway. I work at a big pharma company by the way.

Idk, I also don't want to be paying off my debt until I'm in my 40s. I'm 24 by the way. My debt gives me a lot of stress and anxiety. And I just want to pay it off and live my life.

personalfinance,Almost Ready to Pull the Trigger on My Investing Career. A Few More Questions Before I Start...,"As the title suggests, I am almost ready to begin my investing journey. I am a 23 y/o male with a BBA in management. I have a solid job as a GM of a business complex where I oversee a couple restaurants and a live entertainment venue. I am still on my parents health insurance and my employer pays for my dental and vision. I do not have any 401k or retirement offerings from my employer though, which is why I want to take things in my own hand because I don’t plan on staying with this company for long since I’ve already peaked and the hourly wage isn’t that great. ($17.50/hr which is highly underpaid for what I do)

I have about $12k in student loans remaining but they were federal and on hold right now. I will pay them in full come January 2021 when they begin again. I also have a vehicle loan for 2.99% with about 17k remaining. I pay that in full every month and since it is a low rate I’ve been letting that one ride out for now and plan on paying it off in full within 1-2 years. I live at home and have very little other monthly expenses outside of car insurance, gas, and phone/internet. Currently have about $30k in savings. $2,500 of which is an “emergency fund”. It’s not in another account I just know to keep that much for emergency. 

With all that being said, I have been increasing my financial literacy in 2020 and read many of the books from the wiki as well as a few others. I’ve been focusing mostly on investing, more specifically, index funds and ETFs. I am very close to pulling the trigger and starting but would love it if I could have a few more questions answered by you all! 

1. Which provider should I choose? Does it truly matter or is it more of a preference thing. I know the goal is to get the lowest expense ratios as possible but isn’t that determined between each fund as opposed to the company? I’m thinking either Vanguard or Fidelity. Any suggestions on good index funds in categories such as stocks, large cap, small cap, bonds, international, and emerging markets?

2. Is dollar cost averaging actually the best route or is dropping a large lump sum a better option?

3. I know time is of the essence when investing but with the stock market hitting all time highs, is this actually not the best time to invest? Especially if it is a large lump sum?

4. What truly is the difference between index funds and ETFs? Some books I have read say ETFs are great while others say they are not as good as Index funds. To me they sound extremely similar! 

5. I would like to try and do it all myself but am not feeling strong about my ability to rebalance each year and be able to take advantage of tax loss harvesting. Is it fairly easy or will my negligence end up costing me more money than not doing it myself?

6. I would like to put all of this money in a Roth IRA because I believe I will be making more money later in my career. Should I also invest some in a traditional IRA as well?

7. What is everyone’s thoughts on Apps like Robinhood or acorns? I just can’t really get behind it because I fear the longevity of something like that that has no infrastructure. Are they Legit?

investing,"Week in Review, Highlighting Gold","Brexit talks look shaky and, as a result, the Sterling Trade-weighted Index remains weak, although it is offs the lows of earlier in 2020 which most likely reflects the fact that the Dollar Trade-weighted Index has been weaker.

A deal between the UK and the EU is in everyone's commercial interests, so let's hope they get there!

Weakness in the dollar index has been a feature of 2020 to date. Should the dollar index close below 90, it opens the way for considerable further weakness.
The question is: are US economic and monetary fundamentals that much worse than for its major trading partners? After all, the EU is hardly a picture of economic health and interest rates in Europe are even lower than in the US.

At present, investors such as myself appear more concerned about the scale of the upcoming fiscal stimulus in the US compared to elsewhere. The US has always had a growth bias and in the past has had no calms about letting its currency take the adjustment.

Gold: 

A weak dollar offers a decent tailwind for the gold price given that gold is priced in dollars. The chart is an update and highlights where the gold price is compared to its underlying trend, which I assume is represented by its 30-week moving average.
In this latest correction in gold's uptrend, the gold price has dipped below its 30-week moving average. That was a normal feature of the 2001 to 2011 gold bull market and each time it recovered and went on to make fresh highs.

I am working on the assumption that the same
pattern will play itself out this time around. So, what is it that gives us confidence that the gold price remains in an uptrend?
-Firstly, the dollar index remains in a fairly pronounced downtrend, although one would expect support around current levels.
-Secondly, US long-term interest rates remain below the rate of US consumer price inflation (CPI), and with US CPI likely to pick up in 2021 the gap can only widen. Negative real interest rates (i.e. interest rates below inflation) have always provided a tailwind for gold.
-Thirdly, a gold price declining below its 30-week moving average is not a 'Sell' signal. Under the technical indicator we track for gold, a 'Sell' signal requires the 30-week moving average price to decline below the 50-week moving average price. Given that both the 30-week and 50-week moving averages remain in uptrends, we are not near any such 'Sell' signal.

The only negative for the gold price is that it remains well above its intrinsic value (which we estimate to be in the region of $1,250 an ounce). On balance, we continue to believe that the weight of arguments support the bullish case for gold. Investment demand for gold is likely to stay strong in an environment where the Federal Reserve (the US central Bank) continues to print money to finance massive US fiscal and trade deficits and in the knowledge that US interest rates cannot be increased for fear of causing more economic damage.

As always I appreciate your feedback and I hope this was of use to you.

personalfinance,Does it make financial sense to sell my car?,"Hi all -

**A quick rundown of my financial situation:**

I am a 23 y/o recent college graduate who began working full time at the end of October making a 52k salary. I have approximately 55k in student loans (20k of which are parent plus loans but I will be paying, rest are federal under my name) and live with my parents, making my only expenses my student loans (paying the lowest minimum monthly possible and overpaying the highest interest ones down first), and my car payment which is $223 a month.  My expenses are extremely low at this point in my life, allowing me to get rid of these student loans ASAP.

**The monthly cash flow numbers:**

Income:  

\~3k a month net taxes and 401k/ contributions to Roth IRA

Expenses: 

\-$505 per month auto paid for Student loans 

\-$223 auto loan

\-Depending on the month, hope to pay up to 1.5k toward principal payments of my student loans

**The car situation:**

Purchased the car in early 2019 with 66k miles for 12.3k in early 2019, only put 1k down, 72 months of $223 payments with an interest rate of 7.6ish% (bank site is down to see the exact amount) I wish I found the sub before buying as I would've put more down/ made it a 4-year loan/ shop around for rates.  I owe about 9.7k on the car.  

The car I own is a 2011 BMW 328ix with 85k miles. I did quite a bit of research into this car before buying and know that this particular year and model of BMWs are actually pretty reliable, and the AWD option was a big want in the snowy NE region I live in.  The car is in great condition and has 0 things wrong with it/ hasn't had anything wrong with it during my ownership. I have performed all of the scheduled maintenance myself as my dad is a mechanic and I have access to all of his tools and knowledge. 

If I was to sell this vehicle, it looks like a trade-in at a dealership would be between 4.8-7.8k per KBB and I believe I could sell this vehicle privately for around 10.5k (give or take 1k) as these cars do have a bit of a following.

I have a few reasons I'm thinking of selling now. First being from what I can understand, the resale value of cars drops off a cliff come 100k miles, and especially since I haven't had any issues with this car so far, I feel like maybe I should sell while I'm ahead.  I also know that if something goes wrong with this car that my dad and I cannot fix, it will be a pretty big bill at the dealership as it is a luxury vehicle. This particular make and model has almost a cult following as mentioned above and from the maintenance schedules I've seen, some issues begin popping up in the next 20k miles that would require us taking it into a mechanic with proper lifts. I thoroughly enjoy the car and driving it, but don't want it to end up being a financial headache.

**My question:**

I'm truly in no rush to sell as I'm currently in a WFH situation and barely driving right now but am always trying to better my financial position, so currently I'd just like to get a second opinion on what others think - Would you cut and run at this point or drive it to the ground?  Also if you would keep the vehicle, would refinancing my auto loan for a lower rate make sense?  My credit score is 753.

personalfinance,Please help me analyze how bad early withdrawal of retirement to pay off mortgage could be,"I'd like to ask for some help with a bit of analysis. I know
conventional wisdom says to not take out money from retirement accounts
early in order to pay off debt. However, I'm attempting to understand
just how bad an idea it might be to take money out in order to pay off
my mortgage. The reason for this thinking is that I'm guessing we will
soon have a market crash (ala 2008) so my retirement accounts get
slammed again and it would make me feel safer to be living in a paid off
house in case I am laid off for a significant amount of time. Also,
given we have a looming housing and job crisis, perhaps the fan is about
to get all shitty.

Data points:

Married filing jointly.

I currently owe 230k on a 4% mortgage. The house was bought in 2008 for
340k. zillow claims it could be sold for 545k.

I have 236k in my 401k.

I have 179k in a traditional IRA from years of various 401k rollovers. 

I have 52k in a roth IRA. My contributions to date have been about 33k.


Some options:

I understand I can withdraw the contributed 33k from my roth without
penalty. If I take out the other 19k, then I would have to pay 10%
penalty, plus income tax, so I guess 24% fed + 10% state. So, the 19k
would only net about 10.6k.

I could withdraw the 179k from my rollover ira, but then pay 10%
penalty, plus income tax. That 179k would definitely push me up to the
next tax bracket, so maybe pay 10% penalty + 32% fed + 10% state. So the
179k would only net about 86k.

I could then withdraw 236k from my 401k. That 236 would definitely push
me up to the next tax bracket, so maybe pay 10% penalty + 35% fed + 10%
state. So the 236k would only net about 106k.

In the end, I could then have 33k + 19k + 86k + 106k = 244k ... and then
I could pay off my mortgage. ... But I would have wiped out all my
retirement savings and paid 43k in penalties and 188k in tax I wouldn't
have had to pay.

Wow, now that I have written this all down it sounds even worse than I
first thought. Am I missing anything, or fundamentally misunderstanding
something?",finance
personalfinance,Sell car and drain savings to pay off debt?,"Hello people of personal finance. I have been trying to figure out how to solve my current predicament. The other day a new idea popped into my head and I'm struggling to see a downside. I figured more brains with more ideas may view it differently. 

Between myself and my better half we have a decent amount of credit card debt that I cannot completely budget for. There really isn't a way to create a payoff plan currently as I just do not have enough income to overcome. 

I have a car that is paid off. I also have a bit of savings. My thought was to sell my car and use my savings to pay off all credit card debt.  I would still need a car, so I would turn around and buy another one and finance it (much lower payment and rate than the credit cards.) This would relive us of some fairly significant minimum payments every month and have a single asset that is carrying the debt. 

This would allow me to budget a stronger budge and dedicate more to savings. It should also allow me to leverage the better interest rates and refi my house for some more savings. 

What do y'all think. I'm trying to keep it relatively vague since it's a bit embarrassing if someone I know comes across this post but if more information is needed to make a better decision, I could provide.",finance
personalfinance,Fighting charge cause credit rate to decrease.,"I have a credit card with Chase Bank.  In August I made an on line purchase from a vendor for $200.  I contacted the company 2 days later to change my order from the $200 to the $300 product because I decided I wanted the top of the line model of the product that I purchased.  They vendor could not stop the original $200 purchase before leaving the warehouse so they rerouted the shipment back to them by FedEx.  The product never reached me. The money for the original purchase was refunded to my credit card.  
At the beginning of October, I noticed that my credit card was rebilled for the $200.  It appeared on my credit card statement as a “rebill”.  I contact the vendor and was told they would research.  I didn’t hear anything back after a week so I contacted them again and they said it looks like it was received by the warehouse but they didn’t charge my credit card.  I contacted Chase bank to dispute the $200 and provided the FedEx shipment confirmation showing that the the order was rerouted and received back at the manufacturer and I was able to provide the name of the person that received the rerouted shipment because they had to sign for it.   I also provided an email from Cricut from September which said what that they were going to reroute the shipment and a confirmation email saying that everything was completed.  
Chase responded back to me saying that there was no proof that the shipment was returned even thought I provided them with very detailed proof from FedEx.  The vendor was no help. Chase said they will not do anything else.
I asked attorney to send a letter, resubmitted my proof of the shipment was rerouted and confirmed receipt by the vendor.  The attorney sent the letter to the vendor and the credit card company 2 weeks ago.
So here is my dilemma.  I pay my credit card every single month.  So in September I paid off the $300 purchase and at the end of Oct, I paid off the rebill of $200.  I do not like to carry a balance over into the next month.  Today, I received notification that a note was put on my credit card indicating that a charge was in dispute and my credit score decreased by 2 points from 785 to 783.   Why does disputing a charge cause the credit rate to drop?   It’s been 2 weeks since my attorney mailed the letter and I’m really hoping to be refunded the $200.",finance

personalfinance,Need Help With a Plan to Pay off Credit Cards,"Edit: Got an answer I think I'm going to go with, any additional input obviously welcome.

Hey everyone,
I have three credit cards that through a series of events too long to detail, i got myself into a fair amount of debt (relative to my income) and have been in that debt for 5 or 6 years now.
Recently I started doing a little better on my income and I'm looking for the most efficient method of paying them off.

I know about the snowball/avalanche argument, and avalanche seems to be the answer for getting it done faster, but I just want to be sure, because I'm not sure if that takes into account the money that would be free each month to put towards the other cards if one was gone.

Here is the setup:
Card 1
---
Balance: 2,527.96 Interest Rate 22.9Annual(1.9Monthly)
Mininum payments have been around 74$ and I've been rounding up and trying to spend around 80$ a month on that one.

Card 2
---
Balance: 2,097.31 Interest rate: 22.9%annual (1.9%monthly)
Minimum payments have been around 63$ so i've been paying around 65$ per month on that one.

Card 3
---
Balance:1,360.09  Interest: 11.7%Annual(.98%monthly)
Minimum payments have been around 35$ so i've been doing 40$ a month on that one.

So I need to figure out the most effecient way to get rid of all three of these, keeping in mind that say Card 3 disappears now, I'd not be pocketing that 40$ a month, but rather putting it toward one or both of the other two cards, and vice versa if the others are finished.

The one other bit of info I have is card 1's customer service rep told me if i make multiple payments per month on that card, it would lower the average balance through the month and therefore lower the interest rate. I dunno if that's worth taking into account or not.

Someone with some serious math and financial knowledge, if you help me figure out the quickest way out, I'll name my next Roleplaying game character after you(since I likely won't have kids to name my first born, lol)

Pretty much the answers to this puzzle I'm looking for are:
1. Which card to I direct focus to paying down first
2. If card 1 and 2 reach the same balance, then what? They have the same interest rate, so would that change the plan at that point in any way?",finance

personalfinance,"Put Extra Money to Pay Down Mortgage, or Invest in Stock Market?","I recently bought my first house here and, after three months of paying my mortgage and taking account of my finances, felt comfortable with pay extra on the mortgage to pay it off quicker. However after talking it through with family and friends, many are trying to convince me that whatever extra money I might put in the mortgage would be better off invested in the stock market. 

Here's my mortgage situation. Borrowed 400K on a 30-year fixed at 2.625%. My goal was to put down an extra 10K every 6-months. Playing around with loan amortization calculators online, if I did that consistently I would pay off my mortgage within 12 years and save around $110K in interest. 

Family/friends are saying since the interest rate I'm paying is so low I should save that money and throw it in the stock market because chances are that I could get a return greater than my interest rate, and that I should also consider tax savings on mortgage interest. 

My concern is that while the stock market has been on an awesome upward trajectory for the past decade or so, it feels to me like a correction maybe coming, what with COVID still ongoing and a second shutdown wave in effect in many parts of the country. I'm also 37-years-old, and if I see the full 30-year term of the mortgage I'll be 67-years-old when the loan fully matures. I would like to have some mortgage free years behind me before I retire. I also would say I'm a bit queasy about have this much of a debt burden.

personalfinance,Math help: evaluating HSA vs 401k in California (where HSA is taxed),"This is more of a math question than a tax/finance question, but the reason for the question is tax/finance related.

I'm considering treating my HSA as a retirement investment vehicle, and since I'm in CA where HSAs are not tax advantaged, I'm trying to figure out the relative merits of putting money into an HSA vs a 401k.

Here's my scenario:

Initial investment: $3,550 of pre-tax money.

Return: 7% (Vanguard target retirement or some such)

Term: 20 years.

Fed tax: 24%

State tax 9.3%

For simplicity, let's assume that  when I retire in 20 years, I immediately withdraw all the money and pay any taxes due at 24% federal and 9.3% CA state rates.

Do I:

***Invest in 401k:***

No fed. or state taxes when money goes in.

Growth is taxed when it comes out.

**Formula**: 3550 \* (1.07)\^20 \* (1-0.24-0.093) = $9,163 in my pocket.

***Invest it in an HSA:***

No federal tax when it goes in OR when it comes out. But CA will tax the capital gains as I go along.

**Formula**: 3550\*(1-0.093) \* (1+0.07\*(1-0.093))\^20 = $11,028 in my pocket.

**Reasoning:**

Money going into the HSA = 3550 \* (1-.093) since CA taxes it as regular income before I get a chance to get it into the HSA.

Then, instead of a 7% return every year, I actually get  (1-0.093)x7%, since CA taxes 9.3% of that return every year.

personalfinance,529 for Student Loans?,"**TLDR - Is it worth putting 10k in a 529 plan to pay off student loans in short term? Please provide thoughts on short term financial plan below...**

I have 63k in federal student loans with nelnet and 50k in student loans with Sallie Mae. I just graduated earlier this year and started working. I will make 90k-110k gross wages in 2021. 

I'm contributing 8.5% pre-tax/tax deffered to 403(b). I estimate my take home pay (after contributing to 403) between 56k-68k. I also have an 11k auto loan at 6.5%... so total debt 

**63k fed @ ~4.5%**

**50k sallie @ 4.75% (new corona %)**

**11k auto @ 6.5%**

**90k-110k gross wages**

I plan to live off of 21k, not including minimum debt payments, and pay remainder to debt, so between 35k-47k/year to debt...

I plan to pay minimum on student loans (~$650/mo fed and $722/mo sallie) and knock out car loan first.

I also plan on refinancing sallie mae loans and one $10k fed loan at 6.8% (all other fed loans between 3.68%-4.66%). Refinancing offers for 60k student loans are currently ~4.25% for 7 years fixed. I plan to refinance in January/February when Fed loans begin gaining interest again. **Any knowledge of penalty for paying off before due date?? How do I find out? Just email refinance customer service??** 

I also have 10k military loan repayment, but the terms are $1500/yr for 6 years and remaining $1,000 on 7th year. Also payments are made once a year on an anniversary date, FWIW. 

I plan on paying ~114k of the ~124k debt in less than 3 years. (have to leave ~10k to take advantage of military repayment. Military loan repayment also has to be fed student loans. No Sallie, no refinance) (potential for more loan repayment if I commission but we'll cross that bridge if we make it there. For now plan is to pay all but ~10k federal and also refinance the one 6.8% 10k federal loan)

**I can contribute 10k to a 529 plan by the end of 2021. I live in Ohio. Is it worth contributing 10k to a 529 for loan repayment ~20 months later?** 

**I end up losing ~$750 interest on 10k over 20 months @ ~4.5%** 

   (is that math right?) 4.5%/12 = .375/mo and .375/mo * 20mo=7.5% and 7.5%*10,000 = 750

**Will I gain significantly more than $750 in earnings over 20 months on a tax-free 529 plan? How much will I save from a 10k partial or full state tax deduction in Ohio? I don't have everything figured out**

I won't qualify for student loan interest tax deduction because I'll make too much money :(

YOUR THOUGHTS?? 

Hardest part of this plan will be living frugally off of 21k. $650 rent - ~$400 bills (healthcare, auto insurance, cell phone, utilities, gas for car, and $53 gym membership) $700 groceries/dining/misc expenses (I have a cat)

economy,The Enterprise - Criminals above the Law?,"Follow the money.

It's what we've been taught from a young age.

It's what we've seen on Detective Shows on TV.

It is a rational approach to understanding human incentive and human behaviour.

As Charlie Munger said: ""Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.""

***This story involves incentives of such massive scale that it is hardly surprising that the information has been suppressed by the powers that be.***

This story provides a basis for understanding how one can 'rationalise' crimes of chilling proportions.

This story will give credence to the notion that the ""War on Terror"" is nothing more than a criminal deception of the highest order...

But before we get to that, we need to go back.

All the way back...to the end of World War II.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 1/4 - The Lansdale Legend**

At the end of World War II, the Treasury of the Japanese Empire was discovered in the Philippines by a staff member of General Charles Willoughby, who was General MacArthur's chief of Intelligence.

Then known as the Golden Lily Treasure, this mass of wealth had been accumulated by the Japanese over fifty years as its army pillaged Southeast Asia and China.

It was deposited in the Philippines due to the U.S. submarine blockade of Japan.

Reports vary on the amount of gold, but it is reasonable to assume it was a fairly substantial amount.

After the War, that staff member, Edward Lansdale, and Santa Romana ""persuaded"" Major Kojima Kashii - General Yamashita Tomoyuki’s driver – until he revealed and created a map of the gold sites.

Lansdale briefed Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy about the findings, and a U.S. Cabinet level decision was made to confiscate the gold and cover-up its discovery.

The gold would be added to the Black Eagle Trust fund.

It was John J. McCloy, along with Secretary of the Navy Robert B. Anderson and Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson who created the Black Eagle Trust.

John J. McCloy, who had shared a box at the 1939 Olympics with Adolph Hitler, went on to become President of the World Bank.

Robert B. Anderson would go on to operate the Commercial Exchange Bank in the British West Indies, be convicted of running illegal banking operations and tax evasion, and be sentenced to prison.

A fourth member of that group – William ‘Wild Bill’ Donovan – would go on to found the CIA, distribute the gold to key banks represented by his staffers, and establish AIG as a key partner in the CIA’s covert operations.

Lansdale and Santa Romana were made responsible for recovery of the treasure.

They fabricated a “Communist Revolution” by the Hukbalahak rebels in order to confiscate the land where much of the gold was buried, and proceeded to mine it.

Lansdale’s operation in the Philippines gave birth to most of the common features of modern covert operations for U.S. Intelligence: bribery, theft, torture, and false flag operations...

It would be Lansdale who would initiate a bond between the US intelligence and Israeli intelligence.

It would be Lansdale that would set precedents for the Intelligence community to retain the services of organized crime on U.S. soil.

***It would be Lansdale's team that would propose and justify the now infamous Operation Northwoods -  the project which involved sacrificing innocent U.S. civilians in order to rally the American people to support an invasion on foreign soil...***

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2/4 - Herbert Walker Bush**

Some say that the Black Eagle Trust was part of a covert war chest invisible to congressional oversight.

The covert operations funded by the Black Eagle Trust in the 1960s and 1970s became visible stains on the global image of the U.S. despite all efforts to keep them under cover.

In an effort to clean house, President Jimmy Carter would order the retirement of over 800 covert operatives.

Many of these operatives would move into private consulting and security firms and be employed as subcontractors for covert operations.

***Thus began a loose association of private operatives that would be referred to as “the Enterprise” in the years to come. George H. W. Bush, having been CIA Director, had many acquaintances in this group, and would work with them to restore their influence and control over U.S. foreign policy and the foreign investment opportunities it created for their benefit.***

Unlike other presidential administrations, the Reagan administration was uniquely characterised by having the Vice President, George H.W. Bush in control of Foreign Policy.

This control was established in an agreement between H.W. Bush and Reagan prior to their election.

The agreement was later formalised with Executive Order 12333, which also established broad new surveillance authorities for the Intelligence community.

As William Casey's biographer pointed out, Reagan “knew little about foreign policy and cared less...” and as a result sharpies around the President took over and they ran him.”

One of the leading national issues during the 1980 election was the release of the 66 Americans being held hostage in Iran since November 4, 1979.

The Iran hostage crisis would prove decisive - President Jimmy Carter's inability to rescue and free the hostages would prove decisive.

Reagan won the 1980 election.

On the day of his inauguration—in fact, minutes after he concluded his 20-minute inaugural address— Iran announced the release of the hostages...

Now, *some* claim that the release of the hostages by Iran was deliberately delayed by negotiations led by H.W. Bush, David Kimche of the Mossad and Saudi businessman Adnan Khashoggi.

For $40 million dollars, the Iranians would delay the release of the hostages until after the election.

Of course...that is wild speculation.

Speaking of Iran, members of Bush’s covert intelligence squad sold weapons to Iran, an avowed enemy of the U.S., and illegally used the profits to continue funding anti-Communist rebels, the Contras, in Nicaragua.

The entire Iran-Contra operation became public in 1986 when the Nicaraguan government shot down a U.S. plane carrying weapons to the Contra rebels, and captured the U.S. pilot - Eugene Hasenfus.

The discovery of these shipments - a violation of U.S. law - initiated a series of Congressional investigations and an investigation by an Independent Counsel.

Dick Cheney was one of the Congressional committee members that decided that no crimes had been committed, and that H. W. Bush was not involved.

Robert Mueller, who as U.S. Attorney headed the Noriega (a related Iran-Contra inquiry) and the BCCI investigations, found no evidence pointing to illegal behaviour by H. W. Bush.

His subsequent investigation into Enron found no wrong doing by Enron.

Mueller would later be called up to head the World Trade Center Investigation...

Emboldened by the lack of consequences for subverting the U.S. constitution and breaking international law during the Iran-Contra scandal, certain members of the H. W. Bush administration formed a group known as “the Vulcans”.

They named themselves after the Roman god of War - Vulcan.

Under George H. W. Bush, they waged war against the Soviet Union and Iraq.

Under George W. Bush, they would wage war against Iraq and Afghanistan.

This group included:

Dick Cheney; Donald Rumsfeld; Colin Powell; Paul Wolfowitz; Richard Armitage; and Condoleezza Rice

H. W. Bush's squad teamed up with a squad of rogue KGB officials to build a complex international network of banks and holding companies that would be used to takeover ownership of the Soviet economy.

Over 300 of these KGB traitors who supported this operation would later be re-located to the US in the early 1990s and pensioned.

The ultimate goal was pretty simple: the Enterprise would provide the conditions for...let's just say ""unknown"" western investors to buy up much of the Soviet industry, using Russian oligarchs as front men to hide their staggering wealth.

Periodic CIA reports to Congress would review KGB and organized crime complicity in the takeover of Russia by criminal elements, but all mention of the formidable role of the U.S. would be expunged from Congressional oversight and the public record.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3/4 - Pieces of the Takeover**

The first piece of the takeover involved the theft of thousands of tonnes of gold from the Soviet/Russian Treasury.

Valued at $35 billion, Soviet gold reserves were estimated to be just under 3000 tonnes.

Then in September 1991, Grigory Yavlinski, deputy chairman of the provisional committee managing the Soviet economy, revealed that a mere 240 tons were all that was left.

Two months later, in November 1991, even that had disappeared.

According to Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of the Gosbank, the Central Bank of the Soviet Union.

""Not a gram of gold remains; the vaults are empty,""

A key player on the Soviet side of this theft was Georgy Matyukhin, a former KGB official who had been made the first President of the Russian Central Bank.

After the collapse of economy, he resigned “for health reasons”.

Later, it was discovered that Matyukhin was actually working for the CIA...

The second piece was the Coup.

Well, the attempted coup in August 1991.

The KGB was well aware of President H. W. Bush’s eagerness to see the removal of Gorbachev.

Many who observed the coup described it as false coup, which was never intended to succeed.

Yeltsin himself writes in his memoirs that the coup was actually a veiled, pro-Yeltsin coup.

The generals who conducted the coup said the same.

The 1991 coup against Gorbachev was engineered by KGB General Vladimir Kryuchkov.

He was a business partner of the notorious spy *Robert Maxwell*.

Shortly before the attempted coup of 1991, Maxwell met with Kryuchkov on Maxwell’s private yacht.

A year earlier, it had been Maxwell that initiated the dialogue about a coup with Kryuchkov.

In the same month as the coup, Maxwell was in Russia and received $780 million dollars from the CIA via the Israelis to pass on to General Kryuchkov.

Maxwell’s chief U.S. connection was Senator John Tower, who was long time confidante of George H. W. Bush.

It was Tower who released a statement exonerating H. W. Bush from involvement in the October Surprise before the Tower Commission had interviewed even a third of the scheduled witnesses...

Tower had introduced Maxwell to H. W. Bush, for the sole purpose of using Maxwell as an intermediary between H. W. Bush and Soviet Intelligence.

***Shortly after the coup, Maxwell died mysteriously on his yacht after attempting to blackmail U.S. and Israeli intelligence. It is widely rumoured that he was assassinated by either CIA or Mossad agents in lieu of them delivering his expected blackmail payment! Maxwell’s link back to H. W. Bush died just as mysteriously. Senator Tower died under suspicious circumstances in a plane crash in April 1991.***

Maxwell’s wife was advised by a CIA agent to discourage any investigation into her husband’s death if she valued her life...

The audio tapes he kept of his phone calls with Kryuchkov disappeared...

The coup actually seems to have been a long time in the making, with Yeltsin having discussed the coup with H. W. Bush during his visit to the United States in June 1991.

That same summer, Yeltsin dined ‘discretely’ with the Chairman of the New York Federal Reserve, Gerald Corrigan, while the rest of the Moscow mission dined with Gorbachev.

The coup signalled the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the beginning of the reign of Boris Yeltsin and his ‘family’ of Russian Oligarchs.

The next piece involved the bankers.

The services of the Bank of New York and Riggs Bank were required for financing and managing the money-laundering of the Russian oligarchs.

In 1989, Riggs Bank purchased controlling interest in a small Swiss banking operation called Valmet.

The new subsidiary of Riggs called Riggs-Valmet would initiate contact with a group of KGB officers and their front-men to start setting up an international network for moving money out of the former Soviet block countries.

In November 1989, George H. W. Bush appears to have arranged for Alton G. Keel Jr, a deputy National Security Advisor in the Reagan administration and a minor player in the Iran-Contra scandal, to go to work at Riggs Bank, where George H. W.'s brother Jonathan Bush was an executive Vice President.

(Before you ask, *yes* he also went to Yale and *yes* he was a member of Skull and Bones.)

Keel would head up the International Banking Division at Riggs.

The Riggs-Valmet operation, as it became known, would become the ‘consultants’ to the World Bank and to several KGB front operations run by future Russian oligarchs Khodorkovsky, Konanykhin, Berezovsky and Abramovich.

The Riggs-Valmet agents would advise the top four oligarchs in how to construct their vast money laundering schemes.

In the meantime, Riggs Bank was quickly solidifying banking relations with a couple more of the old Iran-Contra scandal participants: Bruce Rappaport, and Alfred Hartmann.

It is through this group that George Soros was brought into the fold, who then opened an assault on the ruble.

Rappaport and Hartmann would also extend their operations network to include of the Bank of New York.

It is at this stage of the operation that three more groups would be brought into the plan by Rappaport and Hartmann: The Russian Mafia, the Mossad, and the Rothschild family interests represented by Jacob Rothschild.

Soros and Rappaport would ensure that the Rothschild financial interests would be the silent backers for a number of the undisclosed deals.

For instance, when Vladimir Putin sent Khodorkovsky to prison for money laundering and tax evasion, Khodorkovsky would identify Jacob Rothschild as his major silent partner, and ‘sign over’ his shares (*worth £8BN*) in the oil giant Yukos to Rothschild before he went to prison.

Rappaport would also introduce an American gentleman named “Bob Klein” to the Russians and his Bank of New York partners.

Klein worked with the operation for several years, and when the Feds began its inquiries into the Bank of New York money-laundering scandal in the late 1990s, no one could prove Bob Klein ever existed, and he simply vanished.

No one ever thought to suggest that the presence of this “spook” indicated this was an intelligence operation from the very beginning...

**Part 4/4 - The Catalyst Event**

What happened *one day before* the Catalyst Event?

Well, on September 10th, 2001, Donald Rumsfeld announced that $2.3 trillion was missing from the Pentagon.

OK, so what happened the very next day?

Well...

Overall, we are talking about a group of Bankers and Intelligence personnel who view themselves as a different classification of human: elite, above-the-law, superior to the ""cattle"".

***They claim to defend the ideals of ""democracy"", capitalism and the American way of life while simultaneously murdering and financially enslaving their fellow citizens, or rather their subjects, in the name of National Security and profit.***

They don't take advantage of a Crisis - they create the Crisis, produce industrial amounts of Disinformation via their agents in the Mainstream Media, label talk of their actual ""conspiracy"" as a conspiracy ""theory"", then impose a New Order which enhances their power.

stocks,Stock market news | Santa Claus stock effect up next? This Week Stock Earnings Reports [12-14],"**Are stocks going to benefit from the Santa Claus effect this year? What’s the latest news in the stock market? This week earnings reports &amp; more**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday, as we saw the [DOW](https://ibb.co/XF2RH8q) finish in the green up .16% but closed the week down 0.57%, while both the [SP500](https://ibb.co/CBm2qZQ) which lost .13% on Friday and .96% for the week and the [NADSAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/RbY68rn) also down .23% on Friday and 0.69% for the week struggled to recover after a very bad start to the trading day. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/C68dbNJ) finishing the week at a new high, over the 23 levels, as the volatility index has seen a spike of over 12% in the last [week](https://ibb.co/0F78Vtm).

You can see that a big majority of the companies were on the decline on [Friday](https://ibb.co/NCBm6Bg), with low volumes, as only around 10B shares traded hands compared to 11.5B shares in the last 20 trading days, as some profit-taking combined with some healthy corrections in stocks have moved the markets slightly lower.

On a factor [basis](https://ibb.co/k1HTXfs), value plays suffered on Friday, especially small and mid-caps, while growth was pretty flat, with only Energy and Financials lost more than 1% on Friday, as Energy was the only [sector](https://ibb.co/ynW3BzJ) to finish in the green this week, up 1,21%, while Real Estate lost almost 3% and Financials also lost almost 2% in the past week.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/cNCSPHk) from Friday, not a lot of green to be seen, with the exception of Microsoft, Disney and Toyota.

While for the week, pretty much the same can be seen in the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/rfcfdL6), as Disney, AT&amp;T, Elly Lilly and Toyota were the only big gainers.

[Here](https://ibb.co/fXLgKLc) is the most interesting economic data coming out this week with Wednesday and Thursday being the biggest ones, as we get a better read on what the economy is doing, while also getting the Federal Reserve latest and last decisions for this year.

[Today](https://ibb.co/M9GFCFf) we get the electoral college across state capitols formally casting their votes, while On Thursday we also get the Moderna vaccine FDA Ad Com voting process and results.

The Fed doesn’t really have many [options](https://ibb.co/p44t6C0) at the moment, but they can still move to buy longer-term bonds or decide to buy even more than the current monthly allocated program. The Fed is not expected to cut the benchmark rates anymore, as they are already near 0.

So, I think we might start to see some of the Santa Claus [effect](https://ibb.co/1KF6gJC) starting very soon, probably sometime between this week and the middle of next week, as you can see in this chart, the SP500 has posted very good returns in the past 70years on average in this period, but yeah, who knows after what has happened this year.

Also, you can see in this [chart](https://ibb.co/2YMgNSK), that the big tech stocks have underperformed the market since the start of September, as small caps have outperformed, I think we might finally see some of the big tech names start to gain some momentum once again, especially Apple &amp; Amazon.

I think this might happen as more of the big cash flows that are sitting on the [sidelines](https://ibb.co/8dpv9gd), might finally start to be move to the stock market.

While on Friday we saw the consumer [sentiment](https://ibb.co/Vpc4Hfs) jumping more than expected, but is still way [down](https://ibb.co/5FTD721) from a year ago. We also got the producer price [index](https://ibb.co/jDTTkgb) for November which rose by .1% and is up .8% year over year, more than expected.

[Here](https://ibb.co/hLkWLYz) are the most interesting earnings report for next week, I am especially interested to see what Jabil, FedEx, Nike (Friday) and Blackberry report.

I think we can see great number from Jabil which will benefit from the iPhone 12 sales, while FedEx, the largest parcel delivery service in the world is on watch, as they are considered a proxy for the global economy. With Nike also expected to report strong numbers with an increasing number of physical stores re-opening and a strong boom in direct-to-consumer business.

Guys, [Disney](https://ibb.co/xfB6Qxz) saw a huge pop in the stock after a great investor day, but i won't go into more details as i have previously posted about them.

I also wanted to mention this, but I guess you already know this by now, the [FDA](https://ibb.co/8rPL1q2) gave the green light very late on Friday while the [CDC](https://ibb.co/kMkxfFf) also formally signed off in the weekend.

The first deliveries of vaccines are expected to reach more than 150 state locations [today](https://ibb.co/D9XjNyR) with another 450 locations in the next couple of days as the vaccine began to be packaged and shipped on [Sunday](https://ibb.co/84mzTwG) morning. So yeah, I guess we can keep the tradition of Vaccine Monday going. If both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will be available, with the US just exercising the [option](https://ibb.co/QkCFhW6) to buy another 100M doses from Moderna, the US is aiming to vaccinate 20M this month, 30M in January and another 50M in February, that would bring the total to over 100M people.

[Walmart](https://ibb.co/n6wJKvx) has started to mobilize to help with the distribution, while [CVS](https://ibb.co/qkWYTJx) also has plans to begin vaccinations starting next Monday.

Guys, just wanted to mention that I came across this [tweet](https://ibb.co/K5fsgxN), I think it pretty much sums up the latest IPO frenzy that we had with [Doordash](https://ibb.co/Rzq7g9F) and AirBnB, with both in my opinion starting trading at insane valuations, that aren’t really justifiable.

The big IPOs this week, had a big influence on the markets, as investors probably had to sell a lot of stuff to buy into DASH &amp; AirBNB, this might have led to an imbalance in the markets. As people who used market orders were forced to sell stuff to fund the buying of these 2 highly overvalued stocks in my opinion.

Just look at this [chart](https://ibb.co/9VpnfS7), as the average first-day return for IPOs has seen a huge spike in the last year, with an average of 37% first day return this year. But, just look at the % of [IPOs](https://ibb.co/V339X8N) with negative earnings also increasing since 2010, that just doesn’t seem to bother investors, as they are looking for fast growing companies that don’t emphasize earnings.

Just a fact, [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/S3QFQ64) became only the 3rd tech company to open with a market cap over $100B, the only others ones being Alibaba and Facebook.

After this 2 crazy IPOs some of the next [companies](https://ibb.co/J5BRZ8f) that planned to start trading last week, Affirm and Roblox, delayed the plans, as this companies seek to determine the right price for the shares and the right company valuation with advisors, so they don’t leave money on the table like AirBnB and Doordash have done last week.

My opinion is that if you don’t like these high-flying IPOs, don’t short them, just avoid them and buy stocks that you really like and expect to have great growth

We also saw a [report](https://ibb.co/86vpGyP) from The Information, which is not actually doing any reporting of any specific deals, that presented their next logical M&amp;A deals, this led to the [stock](https://ibb.co/D1VGXwj) of Dropbox to spike almost 14% including after-hours trading and [MongoDB](https://ibb.co/mHPQw0L) to gain more than 6% on Friday.

Other [news](https://ibb.co/5GJBH1w) came for videogames and video gaming consoles which saw a record $7B in sales, over 35% more than last year, bringing the total to over $44B for the year, with more than $1.4B spent on news consoles from Sony and Microsoft just in November.

While in the EU, [Brexit](https://ibb.co/YPQRhqv) talks keep getting extended time and time again as the EU and Great Britain still are trying to figure out some sort of a deal.

We also found out what companies are getting [kicked](https://ibb.co/4Y74VFQ) out of the SP due to the inclusion of Tesla and that the latest [shutdowns](https://ibb.co/C5116dp) for the holidays have been extended more than usual.

Let’s hope for a great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/Zzf0FVN) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.

financialindependence,[UPDATE] 2020 pandemic postFIRE update,"Hello folks! I'm sorting out end of the year finances and thought you might appreciate an update.


RECAP

[Link to first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ey9jcl/art_to_tech_fire_in_12_years/)

My partner and I are in our mid-30's with 1 kid. We hit our FIRE number but decided to keep working (thank god). I am a creative in tech and partner is in entertainment.

[Here's our updated savings chart](http://imgur.com/a/U8PHeQc)

___________

When the pandemic started, we lost $300k in a few weeks. We felt surprisingly OK about losing 25% of our life savings. Figuring out childcare, not seeing our loved ones, and the uncertain future was way more stressful.

After a month of juggling WFH and childcare, we moved in with my parents. We got a few hours of help a day but I still didn't have time to do much besides chores and work. Luckily, my work allows part time and my request was recently approved! My salary was cut in half to $123k pre-tax/year but I still get benefits like health insurance and 401k. 

My partner on the other hand is putting in a ton of overtime. They are planning to quit next year, maybe do the same thing working for themselves. They said they wanted a few weeks off for videogames first lol.

I've continued to work steadily on art projects including gifts for close friends and family. It feels extra special to give them something custom they will treasure and remember. I also earned a few thousand $ but splurged on a camera, art supplies, and remote art classes. Breaking even on a hobby isn't bad!

Most of my friends from art school have moved on and only a few are professionally successful. I'm proud of them, they worked their asses off to get their dream career. I couldn't do the same. For me, doing art for fun is more fulfilling than doing it as a job.

Like many other people, we spent way less this year. We hit a savings rate of over 85%! Child care ($2.5k → 0 per month) and rent ($2.6k → $1.1k per month) were the biggest savers. Kid expenses were very low, around $60/month since we mostly get used and free stuff from Facebook.

We were able to donate more including to a friend who lost her job. We shoveled extra $ into index funds and dropped bank savings to 2 months of expenses.

Staying with parents is a mixed bag. I appreciate their help and enjoy the family time. They do treat us like teens sometimes and struggle with boundaries, especially with parenting. Once the pandemic lifts we will move out but still visit often and everyone will be happier.

I'm trying to help parents with finances. Mom moved her entire 401k into the money market when it tanked and lost hundreds of thousands of dollars following a friend's stock tips. Dad does daily trades on his 401k and brokerage account. They do save a lot but their investments are Wall Street Bets level of nuts. So frustrating, but not my money, not my retirement.

What's next? I want to keep my part-time job if they allow remote work. I have amazing insurance and the extra money helps reduce sequence of returns risk. We hope to travel often when it's safe to do so. It's my goal to donate even more, aiming to get my company's matching first and then open a donor advised fund.

___________

SUMMARY

 Total $1.67 million in assets: $8k in bank, $250k in company stocks, the rest in index stocks split 80% US + 20% international. The individual stocks are from a liquidity event at a startup and vested RSUs. We're holding for LTCG tax rates. 

 This year we earned $323k pretax and maxed out 401k's, HSA, backdoor roth IRAs, and a mega backdoor roth 401k. I earned about $213k of this.

 Our expenses were $30k, the lowest it's been since college years. It's good to know we can fall back to this level of spending as a safety measure.

 Next year we'll earn ~$153k pre-tax due to me working part-time and my husband quitting. After maxing out tax advantaged accounts, we'll pay under $12k in federal taxes. Compared to ~$70k+ this year, it's crazy low.

___________

This year I learned it's ok to lighten up, be flexible, and change goals. No one could have anticipated 2020 and we tried to make the best of it. We're privileged to be in our position. I'm trying to be grateful, give back, and spend time with loved ones and doing things I love including lots of art!

investing,2021 Bull vs. Bear Case,"So there's a lot of uncertainty currently in the market regarding 2021. Although I'm personally bullish about the market I think it will be useful if we try to list the points supporting each scenario for discussion trying to be open minded. I'm listing my view below let me know what you think.


Bull case:

- Low interest rates.

- Earnings &amp; buybacks set to rebound in 2021.

- Low hurdles of expectations.

- New player in town (retail investors).

- ETF/passive investing trend.

- Reports of excess savings &amp; fund managers staying on the side line.


Bear Case:

- Large National Debt that needs to be regularized possibly by increased taxes.

- Inflation may comeback early bringing back interest rates.

- Low rates may cause bubbles across asset classes.

- Economic damage may materialize prior to the vaccine.

- New vaccine technology may have severe side effects.

- P/Es reaching unsustainable levels where stocks may not stay attractive.

- China trade war.",finance

On to my personal finance question: I need a loan to do some home renovations. I'm refinancing at the same time, but given the relatively small amount I need, seems like the fees of a cash-out refinance eat into how much money I'd actually end up with in the end.

personalfinance,Can having a combination of traditional and Roth IRAs cause me problems in the future?,"As of right now, my retirement funds are allocated into:

* 2 previous company traditional 401k plans (the bigger one and the smaller one).
* 1 Roth IRA
* 1 taxable account

I am considering taking the smaller of the 2 previous 401k plans and converting it to a Roth IRA, which would essentially add the balance of the old, smaller 401k to my Roth, and leave me with some taxes to pay.  I forget if there is withholding for the taxes, but, in this case, it's a small enough amount that it doesn't matter anyway.

For the bigger 401k, I want to convert this to a traditional IRA, because I don't want to pay a shitload of taxes next year.  That should leave me with:

* 1 taxable account
* 1 traditional IRA
* 1 somewhat beefed up Roth IRA

This account setup is what I want, because I want my accounts all as centralized as possible at the same brokerage, and I don't want to pay multiple account maintenance fees on the 401ks.  I should also add here that my income this year, and for the anticipated future is going to be above the traditional IRA deduction threshold.

I am also considering just taking a CARES distribution before the end of the year from the smaller account for the full balance, paying the taxes over 3 years, throwing that into my taxable, then rolling the other 401k into a traditional IRA and doing a partial Roth conversion.  I am 100% sure I qualify for the CARES distribution.

Plan 3 would be to do smaller 401k -&gt; Roth, then do bigger 401k -&gt; traditional IRA.  
 
My questions are: 

* Are any of these plans vaguely sensible?
* Am I going to face any tax issues, either now or in the future, with any of these plans?


If this is more appropriate for another sub, like r/tax or something, I'll be glad to post there instead.  If y'all need some numbers to attach to this, let me know, and I'll provide some.

**About Us:** 

We do not have firm plans or ideas of where and when we would like to retire completely. We might like to stay in the northeast and see where our children settle to be close to them, we might look to move down to the house in Florida, or we might be interested in relocating where some of our friends have moved. We do not live an ostentatious lifestyle, only occasionally eating out pre-COVID. Our hobbies include skiing, golf, and hiking. We take, on average, three trips a year (in a normal world). Maybe that'd be five or six a year in retirement? We would have liked to go to live in Europe for a year or so in retirement, but even the possibility of that is undetermined at this point (although totally possible in terms of budget, we assume). 

**Questions:**

1. Is there any order/hierarchy in which we should look to liquidate accounts or sell off assets (live off the cash? sell off one at a time? sell off proportionally across several accounts? sell by asset?) in order to draw an income?

2. With consideration for selling assets in mind, should we rebalance any taxable/untaxable accounts to hold certain assets? (eg. heavy on equities in my 401k and bonds in a taxable account)

3. At this point in the game, should we even bother to incur taxes on selling assets in order to rebalance?

4. Should we invest some or all of that $1 million in cash today? What would a reasonable retirement portfolio look like? Would 50% in VTSAX and 50% in VBILX be too risky/conservative? 

5. Should any future investments be with a focus on investing in assets which will grow, assets which will pay out reliable dividends, or vehicles which will be stable over time?",finance

personalfinance,Is my employer screwing around with my W2 Taxes?,"Hey there, this is my first post to the personal finance subreddit. Hope this doesn't go against any submission rules but I see taxes in the PF wiki so I assume it's fair game.

&amp;#x200B;

So a little backstory: I currently work as a w2 employee at a small video production company in NYC doing video editing. Previously I used to freelance with them on a 1099 contractor basis. This was on and off as needed from November 2017-March 2019. I joined full time in April 2019 and have been there since. They use TriNet to handle the HR/employment side of things.

&amp;#x200B;

At the beginning of 2020 my boss/the owner emailed me to tell me not to claim any money I earned in 2019 before joining full time as 1099 (Jan 2019-March 2019). His reasoning was that the IRS does not allow a 1099 and W2 from the same company in the same tax year. He seemed to indicate that he would be able to update my W2 to include the earnings between Jan 2019 and March 2019, which never materialized after multiple followups. First it was supposed to be TriNet updating the W2, which didn't work out. Then it was supposed to be the third party accountant the business uses, which didn't happen. After the W2 updates didn't work I was told that the wages could be counted as an advance payment for a project in 2020 that would go through TriNet. This is where it was left off in April 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

Now as the year comes to an end I followed up at the beginning of November. A month later, I received an email and call from my boss explaining that none of that is happening but the wages could be counted in the TriNet system as a ""Gift"" according to a TriNet representative he spoke to.

personalfinance,Student loan repayment vs other investments,"First post. I recently graduated medical school. I have 148 k of student debt at a 6% interest. I signed up for the REPAYE plan. My payments are 270 per month. Under this plan, half of the unpaid interest is subsidized and the interest doesn’t capitalize. 

I accumulate $740 per month of interest. If I make minimal payments, the debt grows at $470, half is subsidized, thus it grows at 235. This effectively makes the interest rate 3.96%. 

I have 6 years of residency total and will make 53-70 k during this time. I am going into a highly compensated field and expect a salary of 400-700 k after training. 

Obviously, money is tight at this point in my life. I live a modest life and am able to save $1,300 per month. I am debating if I should put this extra money into tax deferred account (Roth IRA/401k) vs aggressively pay off student debt. 

It seems people say student debt &gt; 4% should take precedent over retirement investing. I am just in an interesting finanical spot (high debt, high future earnings) with a unique repayment plan and would appreciate input. 

Thank you in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Would a personal loan to refinance be worth it?,"I got braces in March while I was working full time and could afford the payments on the credit card I used because the interest was deferred and I would have had it paid off by May at the latest. I ended up having to take two months off so I stopped making big payments and had to stick to the minimum while also relying on savings to pay my bills and using my credit card for necessities. Due to being diagnosed with a chronic medical condition during the two months off, I need to work part-time until it is fully under control which should only be another month or two. 

I've been looking at a few of the loan options and one is offering me a 22.9% interest rate which I know is a lot but it is less than the deferred interest will be/is and it is equal to my credit card. There are also ones that claim to be even lower interest rates but I haven't looked at those too much yet since I was looking at the worst-case scenario to decide if it's feasible. The payment will be less than what I am paying per month so I am definitely tempted. 

I would also use it for an emergency purchase to make the family car safe and legal to drive which would only be a few hundred dollars extra. The payment would still be at a level that I would be comfortable affording it. 

Is there something that I am not considering or that would make this be a bad idea? Right now it is looking like it will be a positive for me but I'm also not very experienced with this type of thing as I came from an extremely low-income family. Also open to suggestions for other options that I haven't thought of. 

TLDR: I have a deferred interest credit card plan that I used to pay off my braces which is ending soon. I also need to make an emergency purchase. I'm considering a refinance type loan at a lower rate to save money on interest charges. Advice?",finance

personalfinance,Finding your personal risk tolerance levels,"Hey folks,

We've been fortunate enough to accumulate a nice nest egg while being fairly young. In our 20s it was just easy to throw things into the 401k and forget about it. If the market drops 20%, no big deal, you lose a few thousand tops, not a lot in the grand scheme of things, so 100% US equities it was.

As we've accumulated more money, the risk of losing significant chunks of kids' college funds, our retirement funds becomes scarier. It is possible we're in a 2001 like moment where stocks lose 50% of their value and don't get back to the levels they were at for another fifteen years. It is also possible we're in a 2011 moment where we have a strong bull market for another 10 years. Who knows? And yet the first scenario scares us more than the FOMO of the second one.

Vanguard's official advice is still \~10% in bonds for our age (\~35 now). Even if we were to ignore that and buy more bonds, the bond prices are super high and at 0% interest rates it feels pretty risky to own bonds as well. You could just sit on US treasuries or TIPS or International equities, but each has their own downsides.

personalfinance,Rate Lock vs Loan Commitment Rate Difference?,"This is for those who maybe have experience getting or underwriting mortgages:

We're buying our first house, and we had been quoted in our pre-approval, loan estimate, AND official loan commitment letter an interest rate of 3.125% with zero points. I did want to lock this rate, so when I got the rate lock form back I expected this to be the same. However, in both the email from the loan officer AND the official form it says my rate, once locked, will be 2.875% with zero points. 

Obviously, I'm not complaining, but being a generally paranoid person, I can't stop thinking ""is this a mistake that will be rescinded"" OR  ""is there some other surprise/fee that I don't know about if I sign this?"" Because of ANXIETY, I don't want to ask in case it IS a mistake (though that shouldn't be my problem though---they're the bank not me) 

I checked their rate estimates on their website, and it says the same as it has for a few months now: 3.125% with zero points, or 2.875% with 2 points. How is is that all of a sudden I can be offered the same rate with zero points?

TL;DR - is it normal/common/heard of for a bank to suddenly offer a lower interest rate for seemingly no additional cost without my asking? Or does this sound like a mistake? Is there any reason other than a mistake this would be offered to me?",finance
personalfinance,Sell or rent out condo??,"I live in Austin, TX and will be moving to the east coast for work in early 2021.

It’s not downtown but it’s in a good location.  A special assessment of $10k is likely in the coming years. Possibly more. The condo HOA is broke. Do I sell? Do I keep it and rent it out?

I think I could get $2k a month for it. But I’d need a property management company to deal with the tenants and they’d take a big cut. Not sure if I’d be able to break even. If I keep it then I might refinance to make it work. The annual appreciation of the condo could easily be greater than 10k a year. World events have driven prices up faster than before too.",finance
personalfinance,Selling an inherited property after estate is closed (North Carolina),"My brother and I lost our mother in November of 2019.  She owned two properties that have needed extensive work to be able to put on the market.  We took it on ourselves with an overly optimistic eye about how quickly we could do the work, but due to a lot of factors we have only gotten one close to being ready.  The other property is a double-wide mobile home on 1/3 acre lot.  The home was installed in 1987 with an estimated tax value of $65k.  The renter that is currently in that home would like to purchase, but they cannot get a loan due to low credit and other factors.

They have asked us to owner-finance and we are considering but told them we needed to do research first.  The first thing that came to mind was how much and when we would be taxed on the sale of the home.  We cannot extend closing the estate to cover the 5 years they are asking to pay off an agreed upon price.

I think I'm correct that selling this property outside of the estate would trigger a capital gains tax, North Carolina has a 5.49% tax, but I don't know what the federal % would be.  Would it be based on our own employment income or something else?

If anyone can help me understand this, I would greatly appreciate it.",finance

 I will be getting some form of relocation assistance for both the move to AZ, and then overseas - I'm still working on figuring out if this is just straight cash or what. I'm assuming it's taxed as income, if it is? Does that also apply to situations like the company giving me a housing stipend?

But I can only think that after herd immunity is achieved next year, travel will absolutely explode.  Many of the drilling companies have drastically cut back on well drilling &amp; exploration.

Meanwhile the [VIX](https://ibb.co/mH5Pmsw) also spiked more than 6% and is nearing the 25 levels, which could mean significantly more volatility for the stock market.

We also saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/jwVnsXt) on normal volume of about 10.5B shares, as we finally went below 80% of the companies trading above the 50-day simple moving average, as small-cap growth companies outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/NNWkSQt) with large-cap value companies lagging, especially from the energy and industrial sectors. With energy losing more 3.5% for the day, while the only 2 gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/0ymGMHL) were Technology and Consumer Discretionary, which seems to indicate what I was expecting, that investors are dropping losers from this year for tax purposes and betting again on the companies that sparked the rally since the bottom in March. And keep in mind that funds &amp; money managers use this tactic for window dressing also, so that they can have a nice advertising brochure for next year.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/kMTNKY7) from yesterday, you can see here the big wall of red in the energy sector, with Disney which saw a healthy correction after a huge run and Pfizer being some of the biggest losers. While Netflix, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and PayPal were some of the biggest gainers alongside the biotech sector.

[HERE](https://ibb.co/tPnzGmN) is the economic data that will be received today, there isn’t anything big on the calendar, as we get ready for a lot of big numbers coming on Wednesday and Thursday. Just a reminder, there was no big economic data that came in yesterday.

So, Quadruple witching day is just a couple of days away, and this time it will probably bring even more heavy trading volume than usual.

For anyone that doesn’t know, quadruple witching [refers](https://ibb.co/p063Sgw) to the day when stock options, stock index futures &amp; options and single stock futures expire on the same day. 

This happens 4 times every single year, and usually brings increased [volume](https://ibb.co/Gxr4pnc) to the stock markets, and guess what guys, this will coincide with the last day of trading before Tesla enters the SP index.

So I believe this next week and especially the 17th-22nd will be very volatile for Tesla. 

At the [moment](https://ibb.co/SRTyzcN) there is more open interest in tesla stock options, with over 8 million contracts, which multiplied by 100 shares for each contract represent 800M shares, that is more than the actual free float for the stock at the moment at 760M shares.

And, right now, there are a lot more put options contract on Tesla, with a put to call ratio of 1.5

My personal opinion is that we can see the stock continue to rise in the following days before going for a dip or correction following this huge moment of volatility for the stock. We can see the avg [volume](https://ibb.co/qYNg2dL) for Tesla has been near 60M shares in the last 10days, so there have been a lot of shares that have already exchanged hands. I believe most of the money managers, who are not obliged to perfectly track the SP indexes, have already finished up buying the stock, so I expect there will be a lot more sellers than buyers when most retail investors expect the stock to go even higher. But don’t take my advice, do your own research and analysis. Full disclosure, I am a bull long-term on Tesla, but just think there is a downside risk approaching.

So let go through a couple of stock market news, [Apple](https://ibb.co/NVQsB0b) is planning on manufacturing almost 100M new iPhone in the first half of 2021, that would be an increase of almost 30%, as they are planning make more than 230M iPhones in 2021 (including new &amp; old models). This is great news for the stock as Apple has been pretty much flat after the September pullback, and might finally get some momentum back when they announce sales for the iPhone in the next quarters.

This might also be helped by the fact that US [consumers](https://ibb.co/f2Tfhpj) are expecting to spend more next year, even if they expect to have a pretty much flat income and earnings growth. This is an improving view of the consumers as they were expecting to spend less in the last survey from October.

Meanwhile, as I expected [AirBnB](https://ibb.co/xSdVJrG) and [Doordash](https://ibb.co/wLfyvFG) have started to fade after that crazy IPO frenzy. [Doordash](https://ibb.co/tmyyWnW) fell more than 8% yesterday and is down again pre-market while [AirBnB](https://ibb.co/GnRxn3b) is also down almost 10% since last week. And with downgrades from analysts already starting to appear, this companies have small to no room for error at this valuation. Especially with Doordash which has received a significant boost in the last year, growth will be more difficult in the future and won’t justify this price point.

We have also seen [Snowflake](https://ibb.co/J5j6DsP) come back to earth, dropping more than 15% in the last 5 trading days, as the first share lockup period expiration is today. This will allow current and former employees to sell 25% of their stock options, currently representing 1,3M shares. With Non-employee shareholders also able to sell up to 25% of shares, those shares stand at 38M right now, with the rest of the shares being unlocked after they release their second quarterly earnings report in March, 

We also got [numbers](https://ibb.co/8srNcwj) from New Jersey, as gambling keeps expanding even if sports are not back to normal. This is great news for companies like DraftKings. While others like Wynn will [benefit](https://ibb.co/zHL4Gvw) a lot from more tourism both in the US and in Macau.

And just keep an eye on [Shopify](https://ibb.co/nMHptKW), as the company seems to be in the eye of the tiger, with Amazon looking into ways of entering that market also.

So, guys, I still think there are a lot of positive catalysts for the markets, especially with a stimulus apparently very close, the European Central Bank [agreed](https://ibb.co/xqWDmZs) last week on a new stimulus for the Eurozone, as they keep printing money. And with interest rates probably remaining incredibly low after this week FED meeting, money will remain very cheap at the moment. So yeah, with the Pfizer vaccine yesterday, Moderna probably next week, and JNJ to follow in early 2021, I think we are poised for a good 2021 in the stock market. Especially with little political volatility after the Georgia run-off in early January as the US electoral College also formally [confirmed](https://ibb.co/pvjc9nf) Biden as the next President of the US yesterday.

Let’s hope for a great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/vjT9ghr) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.

personalfinance,"Refinancing home and appraisal came in lower than what I paid last year (Austin, TX)","I purchased a new townhome in 2019 in Austin for $374,900. All new construction, nice part of town, etc. 

Current interest rate: 4.0%

New interest rate: 2.75%
Appraisal: 373,000

This appraisal was based on comps (no physical inspection) because my girlfriend is in healthcare so we didn't want anyone in the home just to be safe. It just seems very odd to me, considering Austin home values have increased dramatically this year due to lower interest rates and the abundance of CA tech companies moving here (Apple, Tesla, Oracle, etc.). I have roughly 10% equity in the home.


Do I continue with the refinancing process to lock in that interest rate? Get a different appraisal? Or is refinancing not even worth it now? Loan fees will be around $5000 and will be rolled into the balance of the loan so nothing out of pocket.",finance

The only reason I can see why they would do something like this is so that if the CARES Act extends the forbearance on student loans they can decide ""Our 0% interest period is ended, so we're gonna charge you interest anyway"". Anyone else read that the same? Email quote below:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

"" 

As part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), your federal student loans are currently in a special forbearance, which means you are not required to make payments at this time. Also, your student loan interest rate is temporarily set at 0%.

We've noticed that you are continuing to make student loan payments even though this forbearance is in effect on your account.

If you are in a position to continue making payments, it's a great way to keep paying down your loan's principal balance, and it will also reduce how much interest you pay in the long run, once normal interest rates resume.

You have the option to end the current forbearance, since you are making payments anyway, while retaining the current 0% interest rate. Ending the forbearance enables us to send you monthly billing statements to show the progress you're making toward paying down your balance.

If ending the forbearance is something that interests you, please call us or respond to this email indicating that you wish to ""opt out of and end the CARES Act forbearance"".

High cost of living area: NJ

Salary: $42,000 (get a 9k raise every 4/1 for the next 9 years at my government job)

Overtime: This year I have made an additional $40,000 in overtime. I worked extremely hard for this. Although I do not like to count on this money because it may not always be available. I use it mostly for nice dinners once in a while or a vacation otherwise it is put into my savings account. I also make sure to max out my ROTH IRA from this account so it is not felt out of my normal monthly expenses. Which works for me. 

Monthly take home no overtime: $2,660

Current monthly expenses
Housing: $0 (At home)
Car: $350
Student loan: $260
Gym: $125
Transportation: $110
Car insurance: $77
Subscriptions: $23
Total expenses: $945

Remaining income: $1715

Current Savings: $51,000
Roth: Around $11,000
Trade account: $5,000

My current dilemma is I have always wanted to try and find a nice multi family home where I can get most of my mortgage paid for and begin to live on my own. Currently with many people moving out of the city’s and into NJ, the housing market has blown up. I am having a tough time finding anything worthwhile, let alone at a fair price. I will mention I qualify for a 1.7% interest rate through my job but the numbers are still not working for me. 

So currently I am looking to start living on my own, I think it’s time. My parents say I always have a bedroom here and not to rush out but I would like to mature by living on my own and to create a closer bond with my girlfriend. But there are not many properties I can comfortably afford with my base salary right now. A friend of mine owns a few properties and would give me a discount on a nice 1 bedroom 1 bath apartment, in the area I would like to eventually buy, for $1200 month. About $100 more in utilities. These units usually rent for $1800. 

I am currently debating taking this offer but realize without including overtime I have just over $500 of spending money until I get my yearly raises. Now if all went well I would like my girlfriend to move in after a couple months, hopefully before summer and that will take some financial burden off of just me as well.

Now I want to place the 20k somewhere but they need to be pretty liquid and stable so im not putting them into investments. but looking into HYSA but thatis a doozy as well with the current low interest rate.

is there a better stable/semi liquid placement i only need around maybe 1 withdrawel a quater if even that.

I'm also thinking about finding maaby a HYSA that has a good SUB to make up for the lower interest and then move it around quaterly/yearly to get new SUB's. any recommendations for good subs is welcome

\- I am putting asside to my 401k whcih is invested in a target fund

\- I am putting in my max for my HSA

\- House is refied and new intereste rate is to low to be interesting for a locked placement

The Factoids 

Now it's 10 years after my first year at CC, I since left University, my degrees uncompleted. (Switched majors, Completed all but electives before loans ran out)

I have $60k in private loans with a FCU. (Were foolishly taken out first, due to not understanding how to do Parent Plus Loans)

$300k in Federal loans (Great lakes, etc.). The university charged me out-of-state tuition for years, since my mother [falsely] convinced me if I officially changed my address, I'd lose health insurance &amp; my meds. (She did it for the tax break)

Plus a $10k in Private Loans my dad took out for me my last year after FinAid cut off. 

The most I've ever made at a job since was $17/hr (Security Call Center Manager) but the most recent was $13/hr (CFA Drive-thru trainer)

My combined minimum payments would be over $3k/month easy, and the interest rates as abysmal as my credit score, but not nearly as low. 

I can't declare bankruptcy, because if I do, the private loans companies will move on my Grandmother's house. 

(They even claimed non-payment and tried to scare her with a foreclosure warning letter during the pandemic despite partial payments being made every month)

My Grandmother is 73 years old, makes sub-$15/hr working as a Teacher's Aide for the same school for 42 years, and is starting to have intense back/hip problems caused by her second job. (Both of which she's working despite her high-risk)

I need a way to do something about these loans that doesn't end in her losing the house. (Which I'm also living in now too, thanks to losing my job due to COVID)

I'm here seeking advice from my fellow Redditors rather than a financial advisor as I have a whopping $23 left as I wait on over a month of PEUC payments on hold for who-knows-why reasons. 

I honestly have no clue what to do. 

My gran says that she thinks that the loans could be waved due to her public school service (but I don't think it works like that for co-signed loans), and with this hanging over my head, the idea to get a loan to start any kind of business or a home is laughable. 

Tbh, the hopelessness of it all has left me seriously depressed and nigh-suicidal, if I didn't know how much worse off that'd leave my gran. 

If it wasn't for her, I'd feel like my only hope for a life that couldn't be suddenly taken by a repo man is to become an Expat.

But even that takes more money than I can save...

Now yesterday, 12/14 I received a text picture of a letter from my co-signer about my loan now being past due for November and December. I called WF today to ask WTF. Turns out, my forbearance ended in November and “it’s not their responsibility to contact clients and let them know”. 

In short, I made the payment today for both Nov + Dec and asked if this would ding my credit as a missed payment. The woman on the phone said it wouldn’t if I paid both nov and dec. After looking up WF online, it says they report missed payments when they’re 30 days past due which obviously my Nov payment would be about 45 days past due and now I’m freaking out that I’m going to get a missed payment ding on my credit.

Does anyone here have experience with Wells Fargo and their reporting? Typically it comes up on my credit score on the 30th/31st of each month but November says “no info to show”.",finance
personalfinance,Approved by Earnest to refinance school loans. Seeking help regarding which Navient loans should be refinanced. Hoping to flag any obvious mistakes or unforeseen issues. Loans included.,"Approved by Earnest to refinance up to $155,000 of my loans at a fixed interest rate of 4.150% over a 20-year repayment. Looking for advice. 6 student loans listed below.

&amp;#x200B;

\--------------------

&amp;#x200B;

After previous discussions with the community, it's from my understanding that I should refinance my 01 Signature Student Loan and 02 Signature Student Loan. This would take their 8.250% variable interest rate (8.250%) with 22 years remaining (on an original 33-year repayment plan) with Navient (OG was Sallie Mae) and place them into a fixed interest rate (4.150%) with 20 years remaining (shorter repayment window at a lower interest rate).

This means only $17,951.14 + 17,709.35 would be removed from Navient and sent to Earnest. I think my total monthly minimum payments goes down about $75. Yes, I hope to pay them all off sooner (and I am able to do so with no penalty, I've checked with Earnest). But right now what I'm trying to tackle is refinancing. Does it seem like I'm doing everything correctly?

My biggest concern (and I hope I'm not missing anything obvious) is that I do not want to refinance my direct loans which are serviced through Navient/Federal loans. At this point in my life, I've decided that loan forgiveness on those two loans is the best step for me moving forward. If there comes a point in my life when I wipe out my private loans, I can reevaluate the next plan of attack.

Any thoughts/suggestions/concerns to flag? Without ripping me apart for a solid but failed attempt at trying to do what I thought was the right thing when I was a 17-year-old freshman in college? Thanks ahead of time for the help.

personalfinance,Would paying down a closed credit card improve my credit utilization?,"For some context, my boyfriend and I are planning to buy a house soon, and the lenders we've spoken to have suggested decreasing our utilization. We were planning on doing that anyway, but we're unsure of which route to take here.

My boyfriend had two credit cards, but one was closed due to a few missed payments during some financial instability. He's current with that credit line since then, and his other credit card is still open with no missed payments. We've had a fortunate couple of years, despite COVID, and were able to get back on track, and his credit is doing much better now.   


Both cards have comparable interest rates on the debt, and they're both down to around 2.8-2.9k, give or take. We have $566/biweekly to put straight into one of the cards on top of the minimum payments to pay them down relatively quickly. My question is, should we pay down the open credit line or the closed one first? We'll have them both paid off in about 4-5 months but want to be pre-approved before that, so I'm not sure which to prioritize first.

&amp;#x200B;

Some extra info: We have money in savings for the down payment, reno costs, and moving expenses already, that our lender advised us not to use towards credit card debt. We've budgeted in the additional bi-weekly payments into what our projected mortgage would look like, so getting into a home won't slow down the payments.

gaming,Developers are walking on mighty thin ice!,"Watch Dogs, The Division, Ghost Recon, Assassins Creed, Far Cry - Ubisoft titles - that again and again disappoints.
Cyberpunk 2077 - CD Project Red - not even going to comment on this trash.
The Last Of Us Part 2 - Naughty Dogs - jesus!
FIFA - EA Sports - pure robbery!

Unfortunately all types of games that i on paper, would enjoy playing - but unfortunately get robbed by game companies and developers time and time again!

EA Sports (banned) - been playing fifa since the first titles - the unplayable trash they have put on the marked the last 10 years without fixing the issues many people have been complaining about for years - is a joke - + the feeling that you just buy an update at a full games price!

Ubisoft (banned) - all their open world games - feels like the same: boring stories, boring characters, predictable side missions, endless boring cutscenes etc. Repetitive gameplay and animations.
Watch Dogs Legion and AC Valhalla was the final final straw for me....one game could have been a mod of the other. With that comes a history of downgrading graphics for Watch Dogs 1 and Ghost Recon Wildlands - crap AC releases like Unity and Syndicate.

CD Project Red: when gamers makes games? I thought so - the Witcher 3 - was a brilliant game - released ONE MANY PLATFORMS - so i bought into the Cyberpunk hype - just to be f**ked by another game company! While not on my personal banned list yet - i have absolutely no faith or trust in them anymore - and will never pre-order any of their titles again.

Naughty Dogs: while TLOU2 from an technical and visual point of view was outstanding - the story was so thin written - that i really have a hard time understanding, why no one at  Naughty Dogs said: hey do you think people will like Joel to be murdered within the first 10 min of play? And spend most of the game playing as his murderess? Deluded faith in themselves and not their consumers - could be the explanation here. I don't trust Naughty Dogs - and it started with the last Uncharted - where I felt half the game was the ending and very very repetitive gameplay through that last half of the game.
Naughty Dogs was 2013's CD Project Red - ND messed up and lost a lot of trust from me and other gamers.

Who is left? To mainly deliver a good open worldish game?
The only one who haven't hugely disappointed me YET - are Rockstar Games - they might dwell on games with dlcs etc - but have no one's forcing you to get them? But ROCKSTAR GAMES better deliver on GTA6 or i think a lot of people will get fed up with the game industry! 

In general you should never pre-order, buy expansions or dlcs - to put the pressure on the game industry to deliver! Just think if a game had the expansions and dlcs from the start? Wouldn't it be the perfect game?
Would it be unfair to demand? That we actually get what we're paying for? 

The game industry are walking on some MIGHTY THIN ICE these years - of course if you're going to buy their games over and over - no matter if they stole your money in their previous title - then it won't change anything. We gamers need to put more pressure on game developers who keeps throwing trash at us and steal our money - for a project - that was showcased with trailers and demos that have nothing to do with the actual game released! Demo I believe, is a demonstration of a finished product - that you led to believe is not a alpha or a beta version?

personalfinance,"Left state service, guaranteed 5% annual interest rate or transfer to Roth IRA?","Hello Everyone!

Recently left state employment (NY) for a private firm. I had less than 10 years served and thus not vested in the system. Based on my preliminary research, the state offers an annual 5% interest rate for 7 years, after which its moved to a non-interest bearing account. I believe at this point my contributions only amount to a few thousand dollars, so it's not some huge amount. 

My new employment offers a 401k through T Rowe Price with a %5 safe harbor as opposed to personal contribution matching. Researching that company, consensus seems to be their fees aren't the best. Therefore, I think my plan is to just focus on maxing my Roth IRA contributions while I still am under the income limit (attorney here, so assuming I stay private I think I'll hit that over the next 5-10 years)

So, the questions:

1) would the transfer from the ny pension system count toward the $6k annual cap?

2) I think I can deposit 6k into the roth annually on my own, and even catch up on 2019/20 contributions in the short term. Thus, given 5% is miles ahead of any interest bearing account, makes sense to just keep it in the state coffers?

stocks,Stock Market News Today | APHA &amp; TLRY Merge | APPLE Rises | Stimulus &amp; FED Meeting Today [12-16],"**What is the latest news in the stock market? Aphria is merging with Tilray while the stimulus may be agreed on today after the latest developments. Also, the FED starts its 2-day meeting, let’s talk about this and everything happening in the stock market**

**\~Very Long Post\~** 

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we see a great day for the stock market, the best in December actually, as a one-two punch of stimulus and vaccine data helped the rally, with the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/XkRWtZS) finishing up 1.29%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/dPpXW1X) 1.25% and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/smC2WMp) 1.13%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/F07KNd4) dropping more than 7% from the recent highs, as it was nearing the 25 levels which would imply more volatility ahead for the stock market.

We saw ¾ of the companies gaining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/PG7tysH) on decent volume, with 145 new highs, as all 11 sectors finished in the green, with Utilities and Energy leading the way up almost 2%, while just 2 [sectors](https://ibb.co/1sqbPxT) gained less than 1% for the day, the Communications sector and the consumer staples. This rally was pushed by almost every type of [company](https://ibb.co/5xf4s1b), especially small and mid-caps, as large-caps lagged a bit and were pretty much flat for the day, with the exception of Apple as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/TT2xp03), as I said in a previous post, I believe that Apple is ready for takeoff after more and more reports of great numbers in the new iPhone 12 lineup sales, and with the Fitness+ service launching this Monday this keeps increasing the number of services that Apple offers. I believe that the Apple One bundle will be a great revenue stream for them alongside the move to the 5G in the next years.

So here is the economic [calendar](https://ibb.co/dcbS2NG) for today as we start off early in the morning with MBA mortgage applications, followed but retail sales, PMI, inventories and finish up with the last meeting and decisions from the FED in 2020.

We also received news that as soon as the FDA &amp; CDC give approval, which could and probably will happen as soon as this weekend, [Moderna](https://ibb.co/B3q3Dkv) will be able to ship over 6M doses right away, more than double what Pfizer delivered in the initial shipment.

This is happening while the stimulus appears closer than ever, but it should be noted that it does appear it will not include any stimulus checks for citizens. As the Congress seems to be targeting a $750B relief [package](https://ibb.co/pvWY3bB). This is very needed as the savings, especially for low-income households, has been substantially on the [declin](https://ibb.co/SVwG1DD) since May, just like always, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.

This measures from the Government have been unexpectedly just been called upon from Warren [Buffett](https://ibb.co/cv0v8h9) also, as he emphasized that small businesses have become collateral damage, though he previously said he wouldn’t speak in public about this until May, the degrading situation probably made him change his mind. 

We will also have the FED starting its meetings [today](https://ibb.co/jy1TDvh), and follow up tomorrow, with most analysts expecting the FED to lay out the plans for additional asset purchases to provide additional support for the economy. And even if this is a temporary measure, it would be great for the economy if they keep this program going until the vaccine is more widely available and the reopening can come back in full force.

Yesterday we also got numbers on the Industrial [Production](https://ibb.co/xG9Rnsr), which beat the consensus with a .4% increase M/M while capacity utilization also increased with the manufacturing output way better than expected. This was led especially by motor vehicle and parts sales which were up 5.3%.

So, with some good news in the last period, a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/4dn08gY) showed that fewer respondents believe that stocks are overpriced or overvalued right now. I think this is a fair opinion, as we have gone through a period of consolidation since the beginning of [November](https://ibb.co/zVZ3vQQ), stocks have become more stable, some have lost ground, some have gained. This is very healthy for the broad stock market and may eventually start a new bull run very soon.

On some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/B22drnZ), we saw the whole green energy sector getting a big boost yesterday, as the US Congress seems to have agreed to a [package](https://ibb.co/GxpqGB6) of tax incentives and extensions for both wind and solar projects. Some of the biggest gainers yesterday were SunPower, Enphase, SolarEdge, with most of the companies from the INVESCO Solar ETF trading way higher. As we also saw [PENN](https://ibb.co/7zrVQMG) national gaining yesterday after giving great news again to investors, as they have acquired a new casino in Maryland as they keep expanding their nationwide footprint.

Meanwhile, we will get [Lennar](https://ibb.co/8482vyk) Q4 earnings today after the close, and I expect them to have a great quarter, but this hasn’t helped many companies this quarter, as even great earnings results haven’t pushed most companies to have big gains, I think Lennar will post a terrific quarter as a result of the continuing strong housing market as more and [more](https://ibb.co/QjbZsDz) people flee big cities attracted by better tax implications while they also run from the growing poverty in states like California.

Some good [news](https://ibb.co/rHYtC04) also came from the Eurozone this morning, as the PMI popped up to 49.8 which is still a contraction for the economy, but that is an improving view of the economy overseas, up from 45.3 in November.

We also have to keep an eye on what [ABNB](https://ibb.co/WPQ214K) and Doordash will do, as investors are starting to get the chance to short this highly valued IPOs. So, this might hit the stocks even more after they have suffered in the last days as I expected.

And one last bit of [news](https://ibb.co/j6Fxdv5), Aphria is merging with Tilray, they will become an almost $4B market cap cannabis player, as they seek to also move to the US and grow its market share in the country, as the full legalizing of cannabis in the US seems to be approaching.  This will help both companies to be able to have low-cost, state of the art cultivations alongside improved processing and manufacturing facilities. This will also position them for a better footprint in the EU, with Aphria having a footprint in Germany, while Tilray has a low-cost production facility in Portugal.

I think the pot and clean energy sectors alongside the EVs are the ones to watch in the next years.

Let’s hope for another great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/HY1vfFP) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.

I recently (Oct. 1) became self employed and am trying to figure out the mess that is taxes. I'm 25, single, living in New Jersey, and annually will gross \~$82,500 per year (about because it may be a bit more). I've been putting away 32% of gross and thought that was fine but went to an accountant today and almost got laughed out of the room, he said that was far far too low and at minimum I should be putting away 50%. That surprised me because I enjoy keeping as much money as possible.

Anyways, really just looking for some tips here, I left a job paying around $10k less and if it's 50% for taxes I actually lost a good chunk of money per year.

**Questions:**

* Is there a way to do self employment taxes easily by yourself? I've used TurboTax in the past but never checked for a self employment option.
* Is 50% realistic? I guess I don't doubt the accountant I spoke to I think I'm just in shock.
* Do you have any tips for legally lowering that percentage as much as possible? (Obviously expenses but I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything obvious).
* Can someone help me breakdown percentages so I can understand better? I know basically there are state, federal, and self employment taxes but I'm a bit confused as to how they work.

**Expense Information:**

* Rent is $1064 a month all util included except WiFi (this is where I live/work)
* Tolls are \~$50 per month
* Groceries are \~$300 per month
* Wifi is $81 a month
* I purchased a laptop this year for work for $2,040
* Subway fares are \~$30 a month
* Two product I use are $38 a month
* I drive \~1500 miles for work per month
* General work expenses are equal to around $500 - $1000 per month
* Dinner with the clients is around $500 per month

So let’s say if im supposed to have earned around $22K so far in gross pay why would it say around $10K under box 1 ""Wages, tips and other comp"". 

Is it possible they'll update it? Is this a mistake on their half?

personalfinance,Should I take out a personal loan for my credit card debt?,"Hello all,

I have been receiving offers for pre-qualified loans for $10k to pay off my credit card debt, which currently sits at $9,233.33. My goal is to pay off my credit card debt, increase my savings, and improve my credit, which right now is high 600s. 

I am 31 and I am single with no kids. I was making about $51k/year before taxes before the pandemic hit. I am very lucky I did not get laid off. However, I was forced to take a 20% pay cut for about 6 months, which set me back a bit and increased my credit card utilization and debt. I thankfully recently went back to my full salary. Currently after taxes and 401k contributions I take home $2,742.68/mo.

I currently have 2 credit cards: 

1.A Capital One Quicksilver with a $7500 limit and 22.99% interest. Current balance is $5,092.36 with a minimum payment of $151, but I usually pay $200 or more a month. 

2. A Chase Freedom Unlimited with a $4500 limit and 23.74% interest (it was 0% for one year, 2019, then went up this year). Current balance is $4,140.97. Minimum payment is $41 but I usually pay $150 or more a month. 

I've been making a dent, albeit small, over the last couple months, but my interest rates are so damn high it's tough to make any real ground. I have never missed a payment and have no derogatory marks.

I have no other debt. My car is paid in full and so are my student loans (as of January this year!). My biggest expense a month is my rent, which is $1410 + $120 +/- depending on the month, so let's say \~$1530. I live and work in an expensive area, which is why my rent is so high. $1410 in my area for a 1 br is actually  considered a STEAL. My other expenses (groceries, cable, cell phone, car insurance, etc. is about \~$500 a month. I have been working remotely the past 8 months and I live in a somewhat walkable city, so I don't spend much on gas or car maintenance at all.

The best loan offer I've received via Credit Karma was from Best Egg, at an APR \~13.99% (much lower than my cards!) with a $328/mo payment for 36 months ($2,507) in interest and fees. I would plan to pay more than the monthly amount so that I can pay it off sooner.

Based off of this offer, it sounds like a no brainer to me, but I am not a financial pro, and I would like to hear other opinions or recommendations. Should I look for other personal loans? Or continue paying more than the minimum on my cards? My goal was to get a new job in 2020, but then things went to shit and my industry imploded. Hopefully, things start to pick back up in 2021 so i can find a better job with higher pay. All I can do for now is work on what i've got. 

Thanks for your help!",finance

personalfinance,What should I do with my escrow account refund?,"Quick background: just refinanced my house from a 4.625% down to a 2.875% interest rate. In doing so, because of my liquid cash position at the time, I had my closing costs and new escrow account rolled into my new principal balance.

A few days ago, I received my refund from my old, now-closed escrow account in the amount of ~$5000, which is now just sitting in my checking account. 

**My question is: what do I do with this lump sum?**

Some other relevant/helpful information:

* I have no debt except for the mortgage
* 28-years-old, so very risk tolerant
* I earn about $110k/year
* Mortgage is for $234k
* I'll have my 3-month emergency fund in place in about a month or two (assuming I don't use some of this check to finish that out)
* I've maxed out my Roth IRA for the year
* I'm interested in purchasing a small rental property in the foreseeable future (1-3 years)

Here are some of the options I've considered:

* Put it all towards the principal of the house, pretend I never got the check, and cut a year off my loan. This saves ~$6700 in interest immediately, assuming I take the full 30 years to pay off the mortgage (which realistically based on my income is very unlikely).
* Put it all into a brokerage account invested in an index fund for long-term savings towards a down payment on a rental property (or another investment).
* Almost fully fund my 2021 Roth IRA, which I've invested in funds that have earned a ~42% gain YTD.
* Some combination of all of the above

Would appreciate another set of eyes on this scenario.  Right now I'm leaning towards the Roth IRA, but I'd like to hear some other points of view.",finance

Its very organized, intimidating and professional looking, at the bottom they the original paperwork I had filled out on the website, they are wanting an e-signature to complete the loan application.

Experience 2: Rocket Mortgage- Their preapproval letter consisted of how much they would loan me and that's it, just a fancy PDF with their Logo and a number. Then set me up with one of their Realtors. When I asked about interest rates and APR, dude said ""We go by the market. Just let us know when you found what your looking for.""

As I'm reading through comments, some other things are coming back to mind (like ""them"" sending me a security code to my phone); I'll update the story to include those moments.  Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

Original Post:

Got a call from a 800 number I didn't recognize.

**""Hi, I'm \[name\] from \[My Bank!\], is this \[throwawayschmoaway87\]?  I'm calling to confirm suspected fraud on your account; did you spend $411.76 at a Walmart in Dallas?""**  *No, not us!*

**""Okay, let's lock that down.""**  He confirmed that he was from our bank, that he was canceling our card, and would send us a new one.

**""Is your address still \[My Address!\]?""**  *Yes*.

**""I'm going to send a confirmation security code to your cell phone.  Let me know when you've received that, and confirm the number with me.""**  I got a text with a confirmation code, that I read off to him.

**""Okay, we'll get a new card sent out right away.  Would you like the new card in 1-3 days or 5-7 days?""**  *Why, in 1-3 days, please.  Is there an extra cost for expediting it?*

**""Yes, usually, but since you are victims of fraud we can waive that fee.""**  *That's very nice of you, thank you!*

***""What's your PIN number?""***

Before either of us could think, my wife gave her PIN number over the phone.  Oops.  ::Facepalm::  He was so confident with his information, he had so much correct information, he seemed to be from the bank, and we were in a rhythm of answering questions.  The conversation was moving quickly (and accurately) and she just responded reflexively.  I felt uncomfortable and my suspicion was up, but stayed with the conversation.  Cat's out of the bag.

**""Is your login name ""Lastname#####?""**  *No.*

I wish I could remember the exact number he read off, but I suspect that was him fishing...aybe it was my last name plus address, or plus the PIN number we had given?   I think that was him taking a shot--that if he's right--goes further to cement things.

**""Okay, what is your login and password?""**  Okay, now we're crossing the line again.

*Hold on a moment.  I think I need to hangup and call you back.  I don't think we're supposed to give out that info.*

**""That's very good sir.  I'm glad you take your account security very seriously.  If you look at the phone number on the back of your bank card for card services, you can see that we are calling from that same number.  Let's proceed.""**

*No, we're going to call you back in just a moment.*  Hung up.

&amp;#x200B;

After we hung up, we realized that was a scammer, and we almost gave away everything.  Called our bank in a panic, and it took 10 minutes to get to someone in Fraud.  Eventually we got through to Fraud, and he froze our cards.  Reported them as stolen.  We secured our info, changed everything up.  He said we've done all we can, and to monitor our accounts for the next few days looking for fraudulent charges.

Almost simultaneously, we started getting emails/texts asking to confirm charges being made at a grocery store in another state.  It appears everything has been denied, and we think we are in the clear.

&amp;#x200B;

After this experience, we were shaken.  We felt incredibly stupid.  We're trying to be gracious to ourselves--the guy was right about a lot of things.  He knew our names.  He knew our bank.  He knew our address.  His phone number matched our bank's phone number.  It's easy to get lulled into a sense of safety when ""the guy calling from the bank to help us avoid fraud"" knows a lot of accurate information and is giving us more info then we are giving him.  In retrospect, he could have gotten that info from a check, and then spoofed our bank's number on caller ID.  I guess it doesn't take much information to appear confident and in the know.  I think that's why we wrote this, to help other people.  Be on guard, it's easy to get fooled.

&amp;#x200B;

We feel really stupid.  We should know better.  No employee will ask for your PIN number (right?).  They should never ask for your login credentials.

We thought, ""We'll never get scammed by that, we know better.""  And then they almost got us.

&amp;#x200B;

SO...

A) Is there anything else we should do?

B) What personal information is public and shouldn't be trusted even if someone knows it?  (For example, bank, bank account number, and address are all available from any check.  Name, credit card number, 3-digit security code, and customer service number are available from any credit card that you hand to anyone.  On our debit card, our name, bank, debit card number, expiration date, security code, and customer service phone number are all available.  Is there any information that is significant if someone else has it?

C) Please be vigilant.  I consider myself a little bit savvy, and we almost got taken.  Tis the season.

Great suggestions from the comments:

/u/hello_detour: ""I make it a rule that if anyone calls me and says they need my information other than my name, I ask for a reference or case number and tell them I will call them back. Then I'll go look up a number listed on the public website.""

/u/BottledH2O: echoes that: ""If a bank **calls you to begin with -- THEY initiate the conversation -&gt;** hang up and call the bank again. Even if the legitimate bank calls you - hang up and call them back.""

/u/Dmacjames commiserates: ""Been getting calls from our ""electricity company"" saying our bill is over due. Number matched and caller ID. I just hung up and called back was told no all your stuff is in good standing. They are getting crafty now.""

/u/Pandas_dont_snitch (who seems strangely dedicated to encouraging us to tell pandas our secrets) has had a similar experience: ""I had this exact same call, almost word for word. The only difference was he wanted the cvc code from my card. I told him I had walked to the park with my dog and didn't have it with me. He then asked for my pin and I hung up, called my bank and they confirmed it was not them.  He knew my name, address, last 4 of my social and bank account. Its scary the info he had. I offered none of this, he used it to get me to trust him I think.""

The aptly named /u/TheAnusOfSauron adds some perspective: ""You and OP are suffering the fallout from the huge 2017 Equifax breach, which effectively made every single person who has ever had credit in the United states vulnerable to this shit...The good news is Equifax agreed to a $575 million settlment, so you should be receiving a check for about $1.50 any decade now.""

/u/anresj4 confirms as a bank worker: ""The bank will NEVER ask or your pin.""

/u/UnspecificGravity reminds us of Rule Number One: ""Rule number one: If you didn't initiate the call, then you give them zero information. It doesn't matter what info they already have. Hang up, and call your bank (look up the number yourself).""

/u/abjectdoubt reminds me of something that I know I \*should\* do: stop using debit cards.  Having fought and defeated credit card debt, I don't want to face that ever again.  But perhaps I should reconsider.

Lastly, thanks /u/ucrbuffalo for being kind and encouraging!",finance

personalfinance,25 years old and I feel like I am drowning,"I've got a hefty amount of credit card debt that has built up over the years of using the cards and not having the income to pay off balances. I've been paying just a little more than the minimum payments every month, but it's lowering my credit score because of how much of my available credit is being used. 

I have been thinking about getting a personal loan and paying off most of the balances just to consolidate debt and be paying a lower interest rate (most of the cards have pretty high interest rates). But I don't know if this is the best or smartest options.

Situation:

Upstart loan:
$1,344 paid towards principal on a $4000 loan
Interest rate: 13.76%

Total credit card balance: $12,901

Any and all help would be appreciated.
(For additional info: all the minimum payments for each month amount to roughly $460. That combined with the $100 loan payment and my $300 car note, makes my monthly expenses $860, which I can barely afford. The estimated monthly payment on the 10k loan is $261. Current credit score is 595)

Is it possible to get 0 closing cost for higher interest rate to begin with (I will go with builder's lender). Then a month down the line get it refinanced for the best market rate on 30-yr fixed. Even if refinance costs me a couple k's, it will still be a fraction of what I'm saving by paying 0 closing cost initially.

Assuming that rates stay the same, are there any scenarios where this could backfire ? For one - my credit score will take at least 2 hits, and the refinance rate could be higher than the best rate. But I am not seeing any other drawback.

Please advice.",finance

Brief personal situation, I'm working for a tech company in Austin. I made about 180k pre-tax in Y2019, about 210k pre-tax in 2020, and i'm anticipating about 280k pre-tax in 2021if stock price for my RSUs are doing well. I currently have no debt, no student loan, no auto loan. Credit score is about 770 based on Chase's score system. I am very single, and I don't see reasons that I will need more than one bedroom in foreseable future. 

I have been mostly buying stocks and ETFs over the last year or so, and the idea of home buying as an investment come into my mind after seeing how housing market grows in Austin TX significantly faster than most other areas along with the low mortgage rate.

&amp;#x200B;

Below are the 2 scenarios I have in mind:

For renting and stock investment:

* pay about $1700/mo rent for this built-in-2019 one-bedroom apartment
* invest my money in stocks and ETFs
* have nearly no tax advantage here, especially that I will likely be in the 35% income tax bracket

For buying a house:

* buy a single family house with 3 bedrooms, likely built in the 70s or 80s, for around 500k, with 20% down payment. (some pre-qualifications i made show that i can get about 2.0% rate for 15-yr, or 2.5% rate for 30-yr)
* house maintenance and lawn mowing  will likely require hiring people to do all the time. (I have conditions that basically prevent me from doing any major house maintenance/improvement tasks)
* property tax is likely about 10k a year
* have some tax advantage with the mortgage interest and property tax deductions
* Sell or rent it out after about 3 years

&amp;#x200B;

I'd hope to have help on what's a better option for me and the reasonings. I think my situation is somewhat different because how i cannot do most maintenance works myself so that incur extra cost for hiring people, meanwhile i can seen to get a very low interest rate while being in a rapidly growing housing market.

personalfinance,Rollover 401(k) into Roth IRA,"I think I might have goofed.  I withdrew 25K out of my employer 401(k) earlier this year for COVID reasons.  I wanted to pay it back before year end to make sure I didn't have a tax requirement.  So today I deposited the 25K into my personal Roth IRA as a rollover contribution.  Now I'm worried that I just took that money from a tax deferred account to a post-tax account.  

Is that going to end poorly for me at tax time?  Should I transfer that money to a traditional IRA before year end?

Thanks.

Edit: I did some digging and found this faq on the irs website: https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/coronavirus-related-relief-for-retirement-plans-and-iras-questions-and-answers

The repayment question (Q7) references another document that was used during hurricane katrina, where an exemption similar to the cares act was also setup. At the bottom of page 11 of this document is an identical example where they state that a person could in fact withdraw funds from a 401k and repay to another qualified retirement account, such as an IRA.

personalfinance,Trying to pay off collections and figuring out first credit card,"I have the opportunity to pay off my collections in full (about $380) and am trying to figure out the best way to do it. I can request to pay through mail, but I know that it's been recommended to get everything in writing, I just don't know if it's just to settle a debt for less, or should it be in all cases? Would paying through mail be enough? There is also a comment section included in the mail option.

Once I have the collections done, I wanted to apply for my first credit card. At almost 27, it's kind of a ""uh, yeah, get one"" point. My credit score according to Credit Karma is 637 (TransUnion) and 659 (Equifax), and on Experian it is 633, so I'm guessing I should get a secured credit card? I know that the Discover IT card and Capital One are the most recommended, and I am leaning towards the Discover IT, but are there any significant differences?

I've had one department store cc before, always paid off on time, but now it's closed since I never shop there anymore. I also have my car loan (roughly $3.5k) and my federal student loans ($13k). I'm waiting until the CARES extension is close to the end to pay off as much of the debt as possible, but in all honesty, I can pay both loans in full now, thanks to saving as much unemployment as I could, as well as living at home. However, it being pandemic times, I am a little afraid to suddenly throw all my money at things that don't necessarily need to be paid off right away, as well as the fact that they are my longest part of my credit history.

For more background info: 26 in California, living at home with a full-time job that I finally got a few months ago, at $17/hour. My goal is to be able to move out by February/March since the restraining order on my ex is done by then, and it would give me the most relief to know that he won't know where I live. I'm also hoping to somehow get a better paying job by that time, as it is getting more expensive in this area to rent, but I would absolutely have roommates. Am I missing anything?

tl;dr: What are the pros and cons of getting Discover IT or Capital One? And do I need to call and request in writing to pay off my collections, or is requesting to pay through the mail enough?",finance

Bitcoin,Assesment of USD - Relations with Digital Currencies/ Bitcoin,"DXY - Dollar Currency Index

Investors look at the DXY to determine, whether the complementary coin in an USD-pair, might strenghten or weaken in relation to the dollar. It shows the value of the USD compared to other fiat- or cryptocurrencies.

https://preview.redd.it/4204co3zyo561.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb1f9b059ca75802b40bbe9d83f42e6d64de630b

The technicals look rather bearish, the dollar struggles for support on the current level, and if this falling wedge is not breaking up, we might fall onto the lower levels.

At current day the price is ranging just slightly above the highest level of 2009.

Fundamentally an immidiate recovery seems rather unreasonable. The most important determinants are economical health, interest rates and inflation.

Gross domestic product (GDP)

&amp;#x200B;

[according to bea.gov](https://preview.redd.it/fhoff0v2zo561.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b28891e28d0517df785c0d4e3cb75361d2b6840b)

According to worldbank.org the GDP of 2019 was at 21.4 trillion dollar. It reflects Imports/Exports, PCE, Investments and governmental spendings.

PCE refers to Personal consumption expenditures, which basically mirrors the propensity to consume.

Projection of 2020 GDP and historical GDP (World Bank)

https://preview.redd.it/nofa1kq6zo561.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29963e4c0d8a9509f3c8527ae44b553abd49898a

Longterm Relations Federal Debt/ GDP

[according to cbo.gov](https://preview.redd.it/b9h1tcr9zo561.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16eadf70d6cc8addfaee2d457dd13e6e638ab881)

The national public debt is almost as high as 1945 relative to the GDP. Prognostics are officially published by governmental departments.

*We can only do a qualified guess grasping the estamation, but structural economical issues and longterm repercussion of the pandemic can support a likewise bias.*

*Us Department of the Treasury pretends to the provide official total numbers on public debt* [*here*](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/faqs/Markets/Pages/national-debt.aspx)*, sadly none of the hyperlinks is working.*

We will break it down here to these determinants and conclude to deal with weakening economic performance, while public debt increases. Other determinants for economic health are employment rate, infractructure, distribution of wealth and commodities.

Federal funds rates

https://preview.redd.it/j2cei11nzo561.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e2986cf671c878e9d5573905d8bf6e21dc92d49

The base interest is low, in order to keep banks and economies liquid. However if the base interest is low and the inflation rate high, ít has a negative effect on pecuniary remedies in the longterm.

Inflation rates

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dlkqop1wzo561.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6f9fabba4efdbd1b7ec2dfba61a3512312b4611

Inflation rate is low currently, although if we compare it to the interest rates, it can pose a concern. Furthermore the current fiscal politics can qualify to increase the inflation rate.

Consumer price index (CPI)

[according to bls.gov](https://preview.redd.it/wvkt92tzzo561.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f586ba4f93a4ecd0821846ef1ee61d58b5fdfda)

A more detailed view provides the CPI, it compares a broad measure of inflation relative to the cost of goods and services. It is used to asses price changes of individual cost of living. It rose by 1.2% since November 2019.

When rising up, consumers tend to spend less money for non-essential goods. Uncertainty and  insecurity during a crisis go alongside, and funds are less likely to recycle into economy.

Balance sheet of the Federal Reserve

[according to federalreserve.gov](https://preview.redd.it/07elp4d80p561.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f848fbde910e354c44a86ca44d481f4d3b6762f5)

The american government stocks of the supply USD in order to keep liquid, which ultimatly might lead to a devaluation of the currency.

Conclusive we acknowledge multiple threats to a strong US-Dollar. Aside that there are a couple variables to assesment, like evaluation of the final economical consequences, aswell as nature and pace of the recovery.

*Personally i think the vastly relevant restrains to most western economies, are originated in demographic structures, and the pandemic acts more as a catalysts, which might indicate structural problems lying beneath it.*

USD as the Reserve Currency

A large portion of global trading is handled in USD, hence there are many countries holding dollar for liquidity, and having liabilities in USD.

A devaluation of USD has likely indirect negative effects on several US trading partners, that likely overweighs positive effects on the clearance of their USD liabilities.

The overweighing effect though, adresses the USD itself.

When more institutions start replacing dollar as a currency for global tradings, the dollar might face bigger sell-offs at foreign exchanges. In times of Microstrategy\* this seems to be a predictable outcome in the longterm, but it should be mentioned that neither Gold, nor Bitcoin is yet capable to provide supply for the immense demand.

Next to counselor will be the development of a governmental regulated digital currency, however with more countries launching their own digital currencies the dollar is no longer as convenient as reserve currency.

Effect on blockchain industry and bitcoin

Several chairman of various major investment banks predicted a weakening of the dollar, some are formerly arguing a crash scenario. The blockchain industry is likely ready in a few years to serve the overwhelming demand of institutions and countries, which would occur in a dollar sell-off.

This could be hugely beneficial for the blockchainindustry and Bitcoin &amp; other cryptocurrenies, but the applicable element will be the the development of governmental regulated/distributed digital currencies compared to cryptos.

In a free market, the consumer will have to bear the choice in the end.

btc,Exploiting Gresham's Law,"One thing I think really hurts cryptocurrency from becoming mainstream is the fact that since basically all cryptocurrencies have such low inflation rates outside of their early years, they become unpopular for commerce due to Gresham's law. 

**Would a cryptocurrency with a base rate of inflation, say, of around 25% of the cap per year would incentivize commerce?**

Everyone in cryptocurrency dislikes the the federal reserve, understandably, but the whole reason they exist is so that they can (in principle) incentivize spending and saving at appropriate times for the economy's stability; And unsurprisingly, cryptocurrency struggles with adoption because everyone just wants to save theirs and spend fiat, especially outside of a rare community like this one that doesn't have scripting languages named SPEDN and matras such as ""spend and replace""! 

Maybe people wouldn't rant against a robo ""fed"" as part of a currency if the inflation schedule is fixed or at least predictable and high enough to consistently incentivize adoption.

Obviously this has limited application to Bitcoin Cash. I'm not proposing BCH suddenly change it's inflation schedule because I want Bitcoin Cash to stay Bitcoin. *But maybe it makes sense to create a Gresham SLP Token?*",cryptocurrency
investing,Why do bond funds go down?,"My strategy is similar to what is advised in ""how to stash that cash"" with a little more risk/reward. 70% bonds or so, 30% stocks or so. 90% of my bond money is in traditional Vanguard bond funds.

With the rest I am looking at bond funds that seek capital appreciation mixed with high income. Right now I am in PHK and HNDL. I have noticed that over the long run all these bond funds go down. Their NAVs go down as well. Let's look at a few:

(MUTF:[USHYX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USHYX))

(MUTF:[PBHAX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PBHAX))

(MUTF:[FHAIX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FHAIX))

(MUTF:[MHHIX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MHHIX))

These are all high-yield, so you could take your winnings and put them some where else, but you would do well to put them somewhere else. In PHK, the dividends have dropped and the value has gone down. Now, I get that we are at a low-rate environment, and over the past 20 years rates have just kept getting lower - perhaps that is my answer - but as an investor I feel odd about a fund where my best strategy may be to sweep the money out and put it somewhere that will actually grow, verses the ""capital appreciation"" promised in all the prospectus's.

Any ideas on what the Fed buying bonds will do to this? My guess is they are just buying t-bills to keep the rates low (to defeat natural supply/demand). This could create a flight to yields that will pump money to high-yield funds, that could benefit closed high-yield funds. OR ... I could be wrong. I've been wrong before.

stocks,Stock Market News Today | FED Meeting News | Stimulus Deadline? FedEx &amp; Lennar Earnings [12-17],"**What did the FED reveal yesterday after the meeting? FedEx reports today after Lennar smashed earnings results. Is today the stimulus deadline? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/Nj34Qdp) leading the way up 0.5% and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/WcwDrN2) also finishing in the green, up 0.18% and ended over the 3700 level for just the 2nd time in history, while the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/Sdvkw4L) lagged and lost 0.15%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/w62QhvW) continuing to drop 1.7%, back to some more normal levels after the recent spike near 25.

Despite the broad market rally [yesterday](https://ibb.co/Z2qpxL2), about 55% of companies were losing ground on average volume, as we saw the Tech and Consumer Discretionary [sectors](https://ibb.co/BftQNpd) leading the way, while the only sector losing more than 1% for the day was the Utilities sector. As only Large-Cap growth [companies](https://ibb.co/cyY67bQ) from the tech sector finished in the green, while small-caps and especially value play lagged behind.

You can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/5LKrKdx) that most of the big tech names, Microsoft, Amazon, NFLX and even Alibaba which has suffered lately finished up well into the green, while the industrials and utilities were a big block of red.

We also got some economic data yesterday, with business [inventories](https://ibb.co/jZndKhQ) rising more than expected as sales increased by 0.9% month over month. We also saw retail [sales](https://ibb.co/XjqJyhW) falling 1.1% in November from the previous month, but this may be misleading, as sales actually rose by more than 4% year over year and by almost 6% after stripping out auto, gas and retail sales. 

We also continue to see the housing demand market being [strong](https://ibb.co/cTT9BjX) as the housing market index was down from the previous month, but came in at the second highest level ever.

One last number that we got was a reading on the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/Mg0pgHq), which came in at 55.7, below expectations and the last month number. This was the lowest reading in three months as growth momentum keeps slowing down as more restrictions are re-imposed, but this is still a strong expansion of the manufacturing and services.

[Today](https://ibb.co/fGq6Bqc) we will get some critical economic data, starting with initial and continuing jobless claims and housing starts, while we will also see get other important numbers later in the day.

So, we also got the AAII [survey](https://ibb.co/ynQhYRg) yesterday, which for me personally, was a good indicator that stocks may still go up, as the bullish number of investors declined by 4.6%, with most of them switching to a neutral view of the stock market. There are still a lot more investors that are bullish compared to the historical average of 38% but, this is an improving in the last weeks, as this is a very good contrarian indicator. When more people tend to be bearish that is usually a good sign that you should just go and buy stocks, as you can mostly buy them at a discount, while when to many people are bullish, there is a significantly bigger risk of a pullback or correction nearing the stock market.

[Yesterday](https://ibb.co/5BwsTzH) we saw the FED keeping rates unchanged and signaling that they will continue to keep a near-zero rate through 2023 to support the economic recovery.

They also announced that the economy is expected to contract by only 2.4% in 2020, that is a big improvement from a contraction of 3.7% previously expected. They also expect the economy to grow by 4.2% next year and by more than 3% in 2022, with both revisions also being up from the previous estimates. They also vowed to keep buying bonds until there is substantial economic progress in the US, so they are expected to continue to buy $120B, with $80B in Treasury securities and another $40B in mortgage-backed securities.

Other revisions in the projected economic data also showed an improved outlook in the unemployment rate, which is expected to drop to 3.7% by 2023.

The FED Chief Powell also reinforced the commitment to aid the economy with even more easing if it deems it necessary while also suggesting they will give ample warning before tapering bond purchases.

This was happening while the congress was still haggling over details on a bigger $900B relief [BILL](https://ibb.co/PQBrH2Y). We also saw a major change from the last day as now it is expected that it will include a 600$ stimulus check and extended unemployment benefits. I think this must be agreed on as soon as today if it stands a chance of passing by the end of the week, even if Congress leaders have repeatedly told they will remain in session as long as needed, even working through the weekend, they should just put their act together and pass the stuff they can agree on so that uncertainty goes away, at least for the moment.

We also have some interesting [earnings](https://ibb.co/vHCS87T) reports coming today with FedEx, BlackBerry and General Mills.

[FedEx](https://ibb.co/D89m06D) is expected to post an EPS of over 4$, that would be up almost 60% over last year with an operating Margin of 7.1%. FedEx has also just received an upgrade from Credit Suisse based on accelerating e-commerce trends with a longer and stronger holiday season than expected.

[JABIL](https://ibb.co/tL2qNRb) just reported while writing this post a nice surprise due to the high demand in the new Apple lineup, with a beat of 34 cents on earnings and almost $800M on revenues. The stock skyrocketed after the release.

We also got [Lennar](https://ibb.co/f9pLZxP) earnings after the close yesterday, as they beat the estimates easily, while also offering better numbers in new orders and guidance. As they expect more than 62K deliveries and 24% gross margins in FY 2021, that is up from 53K and a 20.6% gross margin in FY2020, this pushed the stock up 3% in after hours, in an unexpected move to the upside for me, despite my expectations for a great quarter for the company.

In other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/C82FmBg), we saw Roku gaining more than 5% in after-hours, after they finally reached an agreement with Warner Media to make HBO Max available directly to their streaming business.

Meanwhile, gambling seems to be getting a boost every other day, as the most [recent](https://ibb.co/YhtQJH9) comment from Cuomo, made investors feel like gambling could become a big source of income for the state of New York. This boosted companies like DraftKings and Penn Gaming even more, as gambling is coming faster than expected in the entire country. [DraftKings](https://ibb.co/1QdMW97) also managed to strike a deal to launch a brand-new retail gift card just in time for the holiday season. This will be available in multiple convenience stores and is a good way for DraftKings to attract even more users to their platform in my opinion.

We Also saw [companies](https://ibb.co/yVS3v1H) lose ground yesterday like Fiverr which dropped in early trading before recovering to finish -2% for the day, after a report that Facebook is eyeing an entry into the gig business, this would be a major competitor that could eat up a lot of growth that Fiverr expected

Let’s hope for another great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/1zf63r8) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.

personalfinance,What happens when you refinance during the same month a portion of your escrow pays off your property taxes and results in a shortage?,"Sorry this is a bad title, please forgive me. I could really use some guidance here.

We are refinancing our home because we can decrease our interest rate by 1.25% and save approx. $200/mo on our note. Our current mortgage however does not have enough in escrow to cover our property taxes and flood insurance, which are both paid this month according to a recent escrow analysis. This gives us a $1,800 escrow shortage once they’re paid.

Our current refi estimate has us bringing approx. $1,600 cash to close, and the lender is currently estimating 6mo worth of escrow in the closing costs (which the loan originator has said will likely be brought down to 3mo at closing). We are currently scheduled to close in early January, before our January note is due.

Should I just let the refinance pan out and not worry about the escrow shortage, or should I try to call our current loan servicer and get ahead of this potential escrow shortage we’d be facing?",finance
personalfinance,Is a credit card worth it for my recent grad/low income situation?,"Pre-C19 I had planned to go to college abroad or work where I was living at the time making 42k/yr.

The economy as we all know basically seized up, all my options were gone, and so I had to move back home. Right now I make only $10/hr and work for 26 hours a week, and I can't really think of ways to make more money online due to the fact that I live at home with my parents. English teaching has China hours which I know my folks would yell at me for keeping. My mother gave me the job I currently have and is ""thinking"" about giving me a raise to $12/hr (she keeps telling me that there are people who are 50+ that will work for $13 so ""I should be happy"" to make what I do). If I could get a job in DC (or remotely) I'd finally make real salary of around 40k/yr, most places I looked at start you at 42-45k for having a political science degree like I do. 

The primary reasons I don't feel like I want a credit card is A) I don't think I can handle it mentally (I've had really bad spending habits in the past) and B) although I could put expected business purchases on it (I stream on Twitch and there's a lot of art that goes into what I do), I don't know if that's how that should work and I don't think I make enough to qualify for a good card? Additionally, I have around 27k in federal subsidized student loan debt which I could theoretically pay off at least one of the loans with my current assets (I have just under 5k in savings, one of the loans is around 2.8k).

To give a bit of an example- the last 6 months or so I've put in time making content for Youtube and Twitch around VTubing, having the money in the form of a credit card would have been nice, but I know almost for a fact that my liquid assets at the time (around 2k in cash) would have been burned in order to pour into the business expense that is streaming/broadcasting/YT content via paying off a credit card. I would've bought a new mic, a new PC, art.. all because ""well I can pay it off over a few months"", even though I had no money coming in whatsoever outside of my family throwing me money for food each week. 

Instead, I bought a decent amount of art and have things in the works for a brand relaunch in 2021.. but I still don't have consistent income that is meaningful. I'm trying to live within my means, and I feel as though there's nothing I can really put on a card each month (besides maybe Adobe suite or my Spotify subscription) that wouldn't come close to how much I make each month net, because the industry I'm in basically requires a 1-4k investment to be at a professional level.",finance

Bitcoin,"In these days of only price talking, a piece of bitcoin when it was priceless","**One of the last posts made by Hal Finney on bitcointalk.org. For the uninitiated, Hal received the first ever transaction of bitcoin. 10 coins from... Satoshi (for the uninitiated still, the builder of Bitcoin)...**

""I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.

For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.

When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.

After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.

The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.

My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.""


p.s: If something has to get to r/all, I wish it is some post like this, so people can really see what Bitcoin is, and not just its price and monetary value. Thanks for any and all upvotes..",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Outside of retirement, should you not invest until all debt is paid off?","One word of advice I've heard from people and financial planners is if the debt interest rate is lower than the return rate you could get on investing, you should invest.

But that really only applies to long term investing? Like 10+ years and for retirement? It's not reasonable to expect that I'd get a say 7% return on my investment short term like 2-10 years.

So really, that first piece of wisdom just goes out the door once I've basically am at the retirement goal of like 15% saving.

So really, it be best to not actively invest outside of retirement accounts until my student loans and car loan are gone? Even if I have super low like &lt;4% interest rates

Idk is my logic off here?

Really struggling with pay off debt or go heavy with investing....I hear mix things.

FWIW my debt financial picture is like....

* $10k private student loans at 3.5%  monthly payment of $75
* Car lease of $260, but plan to buy out and am getting rates around 4% and $190 with pretty little down.....its up in June.

All in all my debt is pretty manageable and could pay off probably all of it in like 2 years.

I have in my budget like ~$1k I don't have a full idea on what to do, before it was saving for a 6 month emergency and thats done.

personalfinance,Refinance /pay off private student loan vs investment,"I've got some money that I'm looking at putting at a private student loan but am looking at advice of how this works and also weighing out if making the payments long term is better and instead using that money to invest in like an interest earning savings or something else.

So, the student loan is private, is higher interest, my credit isn't fantastic, but has no penalty for early pay off.

What im thinking is, do I try to finance for a lower interest rate and then pay off the balance in full, which would essentially leave me debt free once that balance is paid off. (Can you do that, refinance and theoretically have a lower interest amount you're responsible for for early pay off? Am I off base in thinking that? I'm new to financial moves and getting this private student loan was definitely me being irresponsible and taken advantage of way back when and I'm trying to crawl out and learn along the way about smart money moves).

Or, is it better to take a sum of money and instead put it towards some other investment? Interest earning savings/etc. 

I feel like being debt free is the way to go, however, I'm looking for insight from people on things they've done, especially, in regards to paying off private loans/getting lower interest rates/etc.

My thought was to trade in my truck, I think I may have about $0-$1500 of negative equity &amp; get something for around $25k or less (OTD) putting down around $7500. I may potentially sell the vehicle to my parents &amp; they would likely just pay out my loan but I am not banking on that. My main plan would be to knock out the new cars auto loan first &amp; then tackle my wife’s car. Her car is currently worth more than she owes but I really love her being in a newer up to date car since she drives with our LO &amp; majority of the time. 

We would ideally keep her car for a significantly longer time &amp; start saving a great down payment for another truck for me in 2-3 years time. 

Main financial goal is to build a healthy savings account, contribute more to my LOs college fund, paying down our mortgage &amp; potentially keep the wife home after we have #2.

Anyone have any experience in doing something like this or am I completely crazy? Feeling like we are in a rut financially &amp; looking to do something drastic.",finance

personalfinance,Car loan (or personal loan?) question,"I applied for an auto loan from my credit union and was pre-approved for a rate of 1.5%. However, I'm buying the car from my father (who lives very far from me and cannot travel due to illness) and the credit union said that the auto loan would require him to come in person. To eliminate him having to physically come, they suggested I get a personal loan instead - but the interest rate for this is 6%. 

Is it worth it to get the personal loan? Or would that cause problems? Could it later be switched to auto loan?

I have good credit and could afford the payments on either. New to all this and would appreciate any advice. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Permanent Insurance - Fraud,"Good afternoon, PF-

As a former broker, I've always tried to look the other way when massive IUL/VUL permanent life insurance policies were blindly recommended due to massive upfront commissions paid out. Due to the insurance industry not having a federal regulator, it is up to individual states to police the rampant deception and fraud that's occurring. Today I will no longer will be indifferent to the fraud taking place.

Curtis Ray of SunCor Financial in Gilbert, AZ (TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, etc.) is proclaiming that his all powerful MPI ""Maximum Premium Indexing"" account is a unique and proprietary product, when in reality it is an old Mutual of Omaha product that is similar to every single IUL in the marketplace. He has recruited over 100 agents across the country to preach his wisdom without any disclosures, disclaimers, or realistic projections.

What is an MPI Account aka IUL? At best, it's a complicated permanent life insurance product that puts guardrails on your ""investment"" strategy. It can be creatively used to take out money tax-free in a tax sheltered vehicle, given the right circumstances. At worst, it's an insanely over-leveraged, high risk, high cost and high commission account that locks you in for 15 years of premiums before you can change your mind without insane surrender charges.

Currently on all channels of social media and www.mympi.com , the fraud is currently taking place at an epic scale. Curtis touts over 2,000+ policies totaling $20,000,000.00 in value have already been written. He proudly touts ""math"" as his north star, but he is insanely and unrealistically optimistic with all of his assumptions. This product has never seen a low-growth, low interest rate environment. When you have your entire portfolio value at 4-6% leverage working against the returns, it's only a ticking time bomb.

Please do your research and invest accordingly. Insurance nowadays is disguised as investing, and it almost always is at the direct benefit of the insurance company. I have submitted complaints with two states thus far.

UPDATE: Thank you for the kind gold, anonymous stranger.",finance

personalfinance,Purchasing land by refinancing current home?,"My husband and I bought a home with land 5 years ago. We got a great deal and the properties value has risen dramatically since then.

financialindependence,My journey to $100k NW as a college dropout (22M),"EDIT: Numbers are in $CAD

Hello everyone, I've been following this subreddit for almost 2 years and recently hit a milestone I wouldn't have reached this early if it wasn't for all of you. I wanted to give my thanks, as well as show you how I ended up where I am for anyone interested in reading. 

Current financial breakdown: 

- Checking Account: $3201.89
- Savings Account: $19,199.92
- Investment/Retirement Accounts:$78,736.47 

TOTAL: $101,138.28


2016 ($14k NW end of year) 

[June]  - Just graduated from highschool and had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. With college application deadlines coming to an end very soon, and having my teachers, guidance counselors, and parents rush me to make up my mind, I randomly decided to take an accounting major in college because I heard it was in demand. 

[September] - Began my first year of college as well as maintaining 30+ hours at the grocery store I was working at throughout highschool. 

2017 ($31k NW end of year) 

[February] - First semester of college was coming to an end and I was completely miserable. The work was not difficult, the load was not too much for me, but deep in my stomach it just felt so wrong. I knew it wasn't for me and I began showing symptoms of depression because of it that even my close friends began to notice 

[April] - After 2 more months of feeling unmotivated and depressed I decided to pull the plug and drop out. I had no plan B, it was a spur of the moment decision and it felt like the 1000lbs I was carrying on my shoulders was finally gone. 

[June] - Spent the last 2 months working at the grocery store full time and my parents were fed up. We we're arguing every day because of my decision to drop out and after a heated argument they kicked me out the house at 19 years old. 

[July] - Spent 2 weeks with a friend while looking for a place. Ended up finding a basement apartment for cheap and moved in. I knew the minimum wage grocery store job wasn't going to cut it so I found an ad for a construction labourer position paying slightly higher ($35k/yr) and got hired. I spent the rest of the year slaving away and saving every penny I could. I was living VERY cheaply 

2018 ($46k NW end of year) 

(June) - After almost a year of working my ass off, starting earlier then everyone, staying later then everyone, coming in on the weekends to sweep and clean up, the company owner began to be very fond of me and gave me the position of Lead Labourer. This new position almost doubled my income, putting me at $60k/yr. Although the massive pay increase tempted me to splurge, I continued living as if I was still making $35k, and dumped all the extra money into my investment accounts. 

2019 ($72k NW end of year) 

(January - December) - This year not much changed. I was working the same job and still living in the same basement apartment alone. I continued living extremely frugally and was focusing on adding as much money to my investment accounts as possible, even if that meant sacrificing things I really wanted. 

2020 (101K NW end of year) 

(March) - Bought a car for $11k as a birthday gift to myself as I was tired of taking the bus. 

(April) - COVID hit, but thankfully I was able to continue working, most weeks actually working more hours then usual. 

(September) Been working consistently the whole year with no breaks or shutting down due to the virus. The same company owner that gave me a promotion in 2018 asked me if I'd like to train to become a crane operator and I gladly accepted. My wage will remain the same, but once I'm fully certified in about 3 - 4 years I can expect $120k/yr. 

(December) - Just deposited the cheque that puts me at $101k NW! Thank you all for the motivation!",finance

My current salary is $255k, but I will start making $280k in January and should be receiving a ~$90k bonus (minus taxes) at the end of that month. 

Currently, I have $70k left in law school loans and some credit card debt that I’m able to pay off each month.  I also have about $10k in savings and $50k in a 401k.  I’d like to start looking into buying a house given the very low interest rates, but am not sure whether that makes sense given my loan and savings situation (not to mention the fact that I wouldn’t have a 20% down payment for the houses I’ve been eyeing).  Ideally, I’d also like to start looking into investing some of portion of my paychecks going forward.  I also have a much younger brother with a disability and have been wanting to talk to someone about ways to start putting away money for his future.

All in all, I have a lot of questions about where to best focus my efforts and cash, and thought getting a fee-based advisor may be a good next step.  However, given that I don’t have a lot of cash on hand and probably won’t be investing anything right away, I’m not sure it’s the best idea.

investing,Invest in (undervalued) Citibank despite poor personal experience with the bank?,"Banks appears to be trading at a discount, and Citibank is trading an even lower price relative to book value. One may argue that retail banks may recover when the economic situation improves and interest rates rise. Currently, loan losses are a significant risk factor for banks.

Looking at the [results of the Federal Reserve's stress test](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2020-dfast-results-20200625.pdf) (an updated one will be released tomorrow), a number of banks appear to be a good position to endure economic downturns relatively unscathed:

BK, NTRS, PNC, USB, UBS, TD bank, and C

BK is a custodian bank that has severely limited earnings in a low interest rate environment.

NTRS appears to be trading close to fair value.

PNC also appears to be trading close to fair value.

UBS also appears to be trading close to fair value.

UBS looks interesting, though it is a Switzerland bank with operations in the U.S., but I have no idea how well it is doing in Switzerland.

TD bank does not trade in the U.S.

Citibank (C) has a diversified global operations, and it still appears to be undervalued (in terms of discounted cash flow and book value), but maybe there are strong reasons for this?

**Symptoms**

* Citibank accidentally wired $900 million to creditors of Revlon, and it got fined by the Federal Reserve for this. (I bought C when this news came out and sold about month ago, because it had been rising steeply with no news.)
* [J.D. Power Customer Satisfaction survey 2020](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2020-us-retail-banking-satisfaction-study) ranks Citibank retail dead last in California, and near the bottom in the Mid-Atlantic region. Citibank derives 28% of its revenue from U.S. retail. Would Citibank also have poor customer service in the rest of the world?
* I opened a checking account with Citibank (U.S.) recently, and my personal experience has been just abysmal. I have dealings with 9 banks and 3 brokers, and Citibank offers the worst customer experience by far.
   * My sign up bonus was never applied to my account after I called to inquiry about it after 3 months. I found many online posts describing similar experiences.
   * Every time I need to do anything with my online account, I need to go through an onerous and very silly verification process unlike any other bank that I deal with: I need to call a Citibank number; the agent asks me many questions and sends me a text that I read back; the agent then connects me to a bot that reads me a verification code that I answer on the website. Sometimes, the agent has trouble sending me a text, which led to an impasse where the agent refused to do anything. Indeed, this is just a user experience disaster.
   * The website randomly logged me out every 1-2 minutes even when I am actively using the website. I have not experienced this with any other bank to the same extent.
   * Except for the new customers, calls from existing customers appear to be routed to an off-shore call center (you can guess where this is). The agents often have trouble understanding you. Some should not even work in customer service.
   * Citibank managed to sent me checks that were missing a digit in the account number.
   * Last time I logged in, I saw a message to the effect of: ""Due to recent security concerns, next day transfers will be limited to $50.""

Does anyone else have a different take on Citibank in terms of customer experience and/or its financial outlook?",finance

- 1) This income will be taxed on a federal level.

- 2) This income will also be taxed on a state level.  If I move to a state that does not tax income, then I do not have to worry about this part at all?

I want to be able to pay off my house fast for peace of mind. my income has dropped dramatically recently but I have $220,000 saved up. I know 20% down payments can give you a lower overall interest rate, but what if I had the means to do a 40% down payment? Would it make a difference on the rate? Would it give lenders more peace of mind? One things for sure, it would sure be nice seeing that monthly payment go down in price.

-If I wanted to buy a $300,000 home, and I put down a $100,000 down payment, would I be getting a loan for $200,000? Or would I just be getting a loan for 300,000 with 100,000 being paid off?

-How does the owner get paid? If I start a mortgage with a lender, does that lender pay the previous home owner all the money upfront?

-Of course banks want to make money off interest. Will my interest remain the same regardless of my payment size? For example if I'm paying $1500 with $200 interest included, what would happen if one month I decided to pay $50,000? Would I only have to pay $200 interest on that whole payment?

-does the amount of interest I pay decrease as I pay off more of the mortgage?

Weed is back in favor folks and should be in strong play next year both in Canada (where it's been legal since 2018) and definitely in the States where it's state by state (there's about 40 states where it's legal in one form or another) but the Dems have a good shot at capturing the Senate with the GA run offs in January so accelerated Federal Legalization if that happens.

My favorite Canadian LP (License Provider) is VFF (they sell under PSF and are currently the #1 brand for dried flower in OCS per above link). They also have presence in the states and are ready to go once it's federally legal to do so.

For the States right now, you need to go with an MSO (multi state operator) which are all trading OTC right now b/c of the federally illegal thing.  They're going gang busters as of late and you really can't go wrong with any of them right now.  If you're unsure, look at the MSOS etf.

Good luck. I think weed is one of those generational opportunities.  Obviously, picking the right horse is key but I think we're still early in a multi-hundred-billion dollar global industry so definitely lots of money to be made here.  I think you definitely want to have your ticket before the US legalizes at the Federal level.

stocks,Tesla’s SP 500 Moment | FedEx &amp; Nike Earnings | Stock Market News Today [12-18],"**Today will be the last day you can trade Tesla before it enters the SP500. FedEx crushed earnings but still dropped as investors looked for guidance. What to expect from Nike after the close? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw another great day for the stock market with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/vQZKh9Y) leading the way up 0.84%, the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/r2K5TXj) also up 0.58% and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/j5MYhLG) up almost half a percent, as all 3 big indexes closed at new a record high. We also saw de [VIX](https://ibb.co/P6dnhX7) dropping below 22, as it dropped 2.5%.

Almost 2/3 of the [companies](https://ibb.co/SsV2KG6) were advancing yesterday with over 200 new highs on average volume, as 9 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/yhc1562) in the SP500 were in the green with only energy and communications losing ground for the day, as small and mid-caps outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/g7zCvs9) while large-caps were flat for the day.

You can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/bdFGb96) that yesterday was a good day for most of the stock market, while only a couple of companies lost significant ground like Boeing, AT&amp;T and Google, while Tesla rose again ahead of the SP500 inclusion.

Important economic data also came in, as initial jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/dJQv6d0) rose even more from the previous week by more than 20k, while the continuing jobless claims fell to 5.5M, lower than expected and the last week number. I think it is possible we can see the initial claims jump to over 900K in the next weeks as the economy feels more pressure from the rising cases numbers and more restrictions.

Meanwhile, we also got the December Kansas City FED [INDEX](https://ibb.co/L6zW9Zp) reading, that came in at +14, above the estimates and the numbers from November. But this is still more than 10 points down from last year’s reading, while the Philly Fed [outlook](https://ibb.co/LJwCCpT) came in worse than expected and last month’s reading.

We also got numbers from November housing [starts](https://ibb.co/jvcyWyV), as this came in with a more than 1% increase month over month, bigger than expected, as building permits also jumped more than 6% to over 1.6M.

While [TODAY](https://ibb.co/2hMmxy3) there is not a lot of important economic data that will come in, as the outlook for the economy remains very uncertain at the moment, as the economy needs to survive until enough people get the shot so we can reach herd immunity, which will allow business to come back again, as restrictions will go away.

We also saw Moderna receive the [FDA](https://ibb.co/fqC4Qys) Ad Com endorse the vaccine with a 20 to 0 vote and 1 abstention.

So, today is a big day, today is quadruple witching day and also the last day that Tesla is not included in the SP500. It’s [expected](https://ibb.co/ZVQ9MRR) that there will be over $80B worth of shares trading hands today, as they will become the most valuable company ever to enter the main index on Wall Street. This will also force index-tracking funds and money managers to buy Tesla shares to correctly reflect the index, while also selling positions in other companies that are part of the SP, as Tesla will account for over 1% of the index starting Monday.

Meanwhile, the company also just received an [upgrade](https://ibb.co/mHnpZHb) on its crediting rating from S&amp;P Global ratings as they noted that Tesla’s net debt is essentially zero based on key metric, DEBT to EBITDA.

So, expect some massive volume to be traded in Tesla in the final minutes before the close today, Tesla is already the most traded [stock](https://ibb.co/1XZ58xj) on Wall Street and has surged more than 50% since the SP news came out. I think either outcome is possible as we can see either the stock heading to new highs or see a decent correction if bears prevail. Just watch out for the closing of the session today.

This is will be key moment for the stock market, with the FED also coming out today with the latest round of stress [tests](https://ibb.co/26CZDCh) for the banks. I don’t expect any surprises coming from here, as they were found to be able to weather big capital losses last time around in the summer.

In some other stock market news, [FedEx](https://ibb.co/ZVmggDG) delivered great earnings results, delivering a beat of more than 80 cents on EPS, while it also saw a bigger increase in revenue than expected, with a more than $1B beat and the operating margin coming in pretty much as expected.

The net income and earnings per share more than [doubled](https://ibb.co/vV7FTbv) since last year after rate hikes and spiking volume from e-commerce shipments, as the company has seen a boom alongside the e-commerce growth. But this was not enough to help the stock, as it dropped 3% in after-hours, as the lack of a formal guidance kind of disappointed investors, as they did not offer an improved [outlook](https://ibb.co/C1LFVDf) for FY2021 and the capital spending is still expected to surpass $5B.

While today we also get [Nike](https://ibb.co/s15BfJH) earnings after the close, as the company is expected to have a lower EPS than last year, but to increase the revenues by more than 1%. Nike is a great company and the world largest sportswear company, and I expect them to deliver on these expectations as its digital strategy is offsetting much of the lost retail sales after massive investments in technology that are transforming its business.

Some expected [news](https://ibb.co/qMs6xv5) also came in from Coca-Cola as they will cut more than 1K jobs in the US and more than 2K worldwide. This is another move that is looking to improve the efficiency of the company, as they have been hit alongside the restaurant business.

While Doordash fell [yesterday](https://ibb.co/LCdsSN1), after the short sellers from citron research called it the most ridiculous IPO of the year, giving the company a Price Target of $40. I usually don’t agree with such drops after short sellers make some statements or publish something, this is a common-used tactic by them, they get into a stock and publish a report that sees the stock plunge as the make money. But I kind of have to agree with them on this one, the valuation for Doordash is just ridiculous, but I don’t see it going down that much…

In comparison, investors seem to like [ABNB](https://ibb.co/F47f56X) somewhat more than DASH, as AirBNB traded higher, but still has a ridiculous valuation, bigger the BP, FedEx or even Deere, despite negative margins with more competition and new lawsuits from different cities in the world.

personalfinance,Teacher: Student Loan Payoff vs Minimum Payment with Very Low Interest?,"Good Morning,

I am a first year teacher and in 4 1/2 years I will qualify for the teacher loan forgiveness program. In regards to my situation that means the government will forgive 5k of my student loans. Currently I owe $10,520. Because of Covid my federal subsidized and unsubsidized student loans have been placed in forbearance up till now. I have set up autopay starting in January to begin paying off the loan for $120/month (a somewhat arbitrary yet comfortable number). Because I set up autopay I have been given an ""interest rate reduction percent"" of 0.25%. Firstly, does this ""reduction percent"" mean that that is my overall interest rate now or that my rate of 4.5% is reduced to 4.25%?

Second question: Should I pay off the max amount (I have the cash) of $5,520 to reach 5k and then simply autopay a very small amount to cover the interest for the next 4 1/2 years or with such a low interest rate should I try and calculate a payoff rate to get me to 5k in 4 1/2 years with as low of monthly payments as possible to land right at 5k when the loan forgiveness would take affect?

Namely, would my money ($5,520) be better used investing these next 4 1/2 years instead of paying a lump sum to reduce my overall principal?",finance
Bitcoin,"Bitcoin is just a bubble, a scam, a ponzi scheme, fool's gold (click bait)","You can believe whatever you want of course. What I can tell you is that the Internet was seen exactly the same way during the 2000 bubble. The majority of people thought that it's nothing concrete, nothing of real value, and that its only use case is for stocks speculation and international illegal activities like drugs and porn and so on. The reality is that 99% of the people involved in crypto are not using it for illegal means, same as for the internet and same for USD cash. 

All my friends are still telling me that crypto is no more than a speculative asset that will burst in a bubble just like in 2017, and that it's actually a scam for fool people, fool's gold. At the moment I'm fully in the green because people who believe in crypto are in for the long run and just HOLD (as you said trying to be an improvised day trader and going in and out of the market will most likely just net you losses). It has proven to be way better than just park money in the bank and watch it get killed by inflation. The time of those sweet 7% interest returns on locked bank depos are over. For the first time in history, interest rates are basically negative and the US just keeps printing more and more trillions to overpump a stock market that is overextended and had an insane 10 plus years bull market. All the big companies can just get money for free and keep buying their own stocks. Billionaires are getting richer, while the poorer 60% don't own stocks and are getting more and more enslaved by all kind of debts.

I don't want to convince anyone because it's impossible. What I urge people to do is to do extensive research on this technology and these assets and build their own informed opinion. I, like everyone else, also believed (in 2013) that this bitcoin thing is a scam and that it will get banned by governments eventually. Economist  Saifedean Ammous thought exactly the same before studying crypto, changing his mind, and writing the book ""The Bitcoin Standard"". Well today Bitcoin has more transaction volume than Paypal, so they decided to allow their customers to buy and hold crypto, Binance exchange is rolling out their Visa cards and Coinbase exchange is about to go public and makes more money than Deutsche Bank.

CryptoCurrency,"SEC Announces the Creation of the Security-Based Swaps Joint Venture, Led by Division of Examinations and Division of Trading and Markets.","[https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-323](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-323)

&amp;#x200B;

 

*Washington D.C., Dec. 18, 2020 —*

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the creation of the Security-Based Swaps Joint Venture, a collaborative venture among several SEC divisions and offices that will be responsible for coordinating functions related to the regulation of security-based swaps (SBS) and oversight of certain entities that will be required to register with the SEC (SBS entities).

The co-leads of the SBS Joint Venture will be Vivi Mazarakis, an Acting Assistant Director in the Division of Examinations, and Carol McGee, who is the Assistant Director for the Office of Derivatives Policy in the Division of Trading and Markets.  The joint venture will also include participation from staff across the agency, including from the Division of Enforcement, the Division of Economic Risk and Analysis, the Office of International Affairs and the Office of the Chief Data Officer. The SBS Joint Venture will be an important part of the agency’s efforts to regulate and oversee the SBS market, including by positioning the agency to effectively monitor SBS transaction data for regulatory purposes, as the SEC implements the SBS regulatory regime established by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).

Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive framework for regulating the **over-the-counter swaps markets**, with authority divided between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The SEC’s role is to regulate and oversee the SBS market, while the CFTC oversees other types of swaps (e.g., commodities, currency, interest rates, etc.).  In December 2019, the SEC adopted the final rule amendments that stood up the Commission’s broad SBS regulatory regime and triggered the compliance date for SBS entities to register with the Commission.

Beginning in November 2021, SBS entities will be required to register with the SEC and will be subject to various requirements, which, among others things, include capital, margin and segregation.  SBS entities will also be required to report their SBS transaction data, which will be used for various regulatory purposes, such as monitoring the build-up and concentration of risk exposures, preventing fraud, systemic risk supervision and resolving issues and positions after an institution fails.

“The SBS Joint Venture will bring together the divisions and offices most closely tied to the implementation of Dodd Frank’s security-based swap framework,” said SEC Chairman Jay Clayton. “Under the demonstrated leadership and expertise of Vivi and Carol, this cross-agency approach will greatly enhance the agency’s ability to oversee the SBS market and SBS entities, including by enhancing coordination with the CFTC and other regulators.”

“I look forward to collaborating with this talented group to stand up the SBS regime and helping to prepare SBS dealers to fulfill all necessary requirements prior to the November 2021 deadline,” said Peter Driscoll, Director of the Division of Examinations. “The SBS Joint Venture will enable the Commission to identify key risks in the SBS market and provide guidance to assist dealers in managing them for better compliance with our regulatory regime implemented pursuant to Title VII of Dodd Frank.”

“The complexity of regulating the SBS market requires knowledge, commitment, and a multi-division and office approach,” said Brett Redfearn, Director of the Division of Trading and Markets. “This effort demonstrates the Commission’s commitment to the SBS regime and I am confident that Carol and Vivi will do an outstanding job of ensuring that the Commission is prepared for the November 2021 deadline.”

investing,Portfolio Allocation,"I have been reading ""The Intelligent Investor"" by Graham which seems to be one of the must read books on investing. Graham's take on portfolio allocation is to have a large proportion of bonds in order to hedge on deflation as well as market volatility. I understand that right now the interest rate is very low which favours continued performance of the stock market and bond performance that likely will not beat inflation. I have done a deep dive search of history  and the general consensus in this group is if one has the stomach for volatility, and a large run off to retirement (still probably about 30 years away for me and 25 for my partner), that a high proportion of equities is preferred.

My financial advisor who currently is managing most of my money has me in 50% equities, 50% bonds. Some of the corporate bonds funds he has have actually performed remakably well in the bull market (better than S and P and TSX in the same time frame). I am wondering specifically why people advocate for much higher allocation to equities. If someone looks at the performance of the stock market over the last 100 years isn't it erroneous to predict what will happen in the next 30-50? Surely, we can all agree that the equity market is a bubble that is bound to pop eventually. Whether specific stocks or broad market ETFs, we know a huge proportion of the market is overvalued. We also can't predict what will happen in the future in terms of interest rates and bond performance.  

I have two questions:  
1. Is there a good reason to have 50% fixed income allocation if I am younger and have 30 years to retirement?  
1. Why do people advocate for 100% equities in this crazy overpriced market? 

TL;DR: Very credible investing book from 70s says to hold large proportion fixed income, why do people advocate equities in today's current market conditions?",finance

i also need to figure out how to balance paying off student loans, mortgage (esp. to knock off PMI) and boosting retirement payments.  essentially, the approach im thinking is that they all come down to their interest rate... pay the highest down first, and minimum payments on anything below inflation or a bond yield (or maybe a low risk ETF).  

to top it off, i set aside some fun money to do retail investing and learn more intimately how the stock market works.  of course gains have taxes, but oof, it sounds like day trading makes taxes a nightmare if its not done as a professional.

personalfinance,Better Mortgage is trying to give me a higher monthly payment than I currently have. Refinance with 1% lower interest rate. Are they miscalculating the Escrow?,"I'm in process of potentially refinancing from 3.25% to 2.35% (almost 1%) by paying about $1300 in points (and about 6000$ in closing costs).

I bought the house in 2019, and I've already refinanced once this year from 4.25% to 3.25%.

Initially my loan estimate looked reasonable, and my monthly payment would be about $200 lower. I'd break even in about 2 years, and by 5 years I'd save about 10k (between cash savings and equity).

Well after they got the title company involved suddenly my Loan estimate had me paying about $50 higher a month than I pay now.

I asked for an explanation and here is what they said:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The reason the property tax amount is different is because on the tax certificate we received, the assessed value on it was too low. It showed it to be $21,500. Because of that, my title team took a conservative approach by manually calculating the taxes to be 1.25% of the reported value of the home at $500,000 which equaled $6,250.

&amp;#x200B;

**Currently I only pay 290$ to Escrow monthly, but Better thinks my new monthly Escrow will be 590$ monthly**

&amp;#x200B;

**I get that my taxes might go up, but how on earth would they go up 300$ a month?**

Kaspersky Labs software is a case in point, he said: it took over a year to get it off networks.

personalfinance,Please help me make the best of my horrible student loan debt situation,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

Private loan:

 - Current balance of ~$136,800
 - 4.61% interest rate (just refinanced)
 - Monthly payments of ~$875 over 20 years

Federal loans:

 - Current balance of ~$28,700
 - Monthly payments of ~$197 (currently $0) over 20 years
 - PSLF eligible

I'm 23. My current income is ~$73,000 in a cybersecurity position with US federal government in High-COL area.

---

I graduated with a 2 BS's, one in IT and one in Information Security, in 2019 and started paying loans regularly earlier this year. A parent of mine makes a lot on paper, but doesn't know how to manage it and was unable/unwilling to help me pay for expenses. I went to a public state school, but I was an idiot 18 year old who didn't realize the implications of taking out this much in loans with a &gt;98% expected family contribution. Hindsight is 20/20, though I often think about how much I regret that decision.

I'm sort of miserable because I make a decent amount but have little to show for it between my higher living expenses, and of course, the loan payments. I can't take advantage of some tax credits and two month of payments alone maxes out the student loan payment deduction. 

Basically, I'm looking for ideas as to how to optimize what little money I have left. I'm happy with my workplace and want to stay for at least another few years because of all of the training offered and full master's program reimbursement. My federal loans are eligible for PSLF, but if I stay in government it won't be for that since PSLF would almost certainly be outweighed by the bump in salary.

Things I do right now I find helpful:

 - Zero-based budgeting. I use [Aspire Budget](https://www.aspirebudget.com/) for this and it's changed my life. I probably would have given up if not for ZBB. Seriously, /u/Sapphire_Rapids, thank you so much.

 - Credit card juggling; I never carry a balance, but I recoup between 2%-5% in cashback on nearly all of my expenses. I've yet to be turned down for a card, likely because of my income and good credit score.

It's so discouraging penny-pinching just to throw an extra few hundred bucks every month at this ungodly loan balance I'm paying off over 20 years. The stress keeps me up at night and the only thing I have to thank about the situation is the security of my field and a government position. My DTI is around 40% and that's with my fully paid-off car and cheap apartment for the area (rent's ~$1200). God help me if my car breaks down.

Thank you very much in advance.",finance

personalfinance,How to prep for buying a home (veteran),"So I’m a veteran with 100% disability and plan on using my bank navy federal to buy a home. I’m 27, I planned on waiting til I was *~married~* to buy a home but that’s not happening any time soon lol. And I’m tired of wasting 1500+ a month on rent that doesn’t actually invest into anything. 

Not gonna lie nice been kinda flying by the seat of my pants with finances, shopping a lot, and reinvesting a lot into my business. But this new year I wanna get it together. 

What all do they look for when buying a house? I had a friend tell me they watched his spending closely while his new house was being constructed so he couldn’t even go out with us or go shopping for months. 

I make 3k for disability and gross (emphasis on gross) 6-10k from my business (I’ll maybe pocket 4K since I’m still in the beginning stages of growing). I’m not sure how I feel about reporting my business income because it’s so up and down (it started as a hobby because I’m unemployable and got bored, and it just snowballed I don’t really need to depend on it but it’s nice to help pay bills and use for fun. 

Whenever I’ve reported my business to buy cars it gets 10000 times more complicated. Most of my business friends say they report as being employed by their business. 

Anyway, sorry I digress! Anyone else in a similar situation or know what I can expect?",finance
personalfinance,Is it worthwhile to go from a lease to finance on a car?,"Sorry, if this question has been asked, but I tried to search Reddit and other places but search results were just Quora responses from dealers offering their thoughts. If it has been asked, I am hoping someone can post the link to that thread as their reply. TIA! 

I leased a Honda CRV in December 2019 with the intentions of purchasing it at the end of the lease. Normally, I am not a fan of leasing, as I like to drive my vehicles for as long as I can but due to some financial obligations and car troubles that were not worth repairing (needed 2k+ of work but wasn't worth that much), so I decided to lease, as the payments were below what I intended to spend.  I am 12 months into a 36 month lease. I would consider my residual to be something I would be willing to pay for a 3 year old car. 

Covid has changed my driving habits as my office has closed and I am working from home full time, and not driving as much as I used to but would still like to keep the vehicle and with interest rates being low, I wanted to know if it makes sense to convert the lease to a finance? I would like to know if this is even an option? Does it make sense to do this now, or should I just wait and do it in 2 years?  Really would like to get some feedback or options, so that I can figure out what to do. Thanks in advance Reddit, I appreciate the help.

investing,5 IPOs to watch for in 2021,"2020 was a bumper year for tech IPOs. Companies like Snowflake, Airbnb, Doordash and Palantir\* have been standout IPOs this year. Snowflake’s IPO was the biggest US software IPO in history while Palantir’s stock price has more than doubled since going public in September.

It looks like this IPO trend could continue well into 2021 with some of the biggest names in tech expected to go public. Here are 5 of the most anticipated IPOs for 2021.

***\*Note:*** *Palantir went public via a direct listing, not an IPO.*

### 1. Robinhood

The stock-trading platform looks set to go public in 2021.

2020 has been a massive year for Robinhood. In Q2 of 2020, they made revenue of $180 million. Up from $91 million in Q1 of this year. Revenue growth of 100% in a single quarter is incredibly impressive.

Robinhood hasn’t been without controversy this year. Many people cite the app’s popularity as a big contributing factor into the high market volatility we’ve seen.

Robinhood’s growth plans seem to be centered around providing more financial products to its US customers, as opposed to expanding into international markets. It launched Robinhood Crypto in 2018 and a 1.8% interest rate savings account in 2019. This was around the same time that plans to launch in the UK and Australia were postponed. It will be interesting to see how this growth strategy plays out and if international expansion gets a renewed focus in the future.

All of the signs seem to be pointing to an IPO in the first half of 2021. A Reuters report states that Robinhood have partnered with Goldman Sachs to begin IPO preparations at an expected valuation of over $20 billion.

### 2. Gitlab

While not a household name, Gitlab is an impressive company that looks set to go public in 2021. Gitlab is a SaaS company that markets a DevOps platform which allows their customers to build software more efficiently.

Gitlab is an interesting company to say the least. All of its employees are fully remote. Meaning that Gitlab doesn’t have a corporate office and employees can work from anywhere in the world. Gitlab is a proponent of the “open-source” software model and sells its software under an “open-core” business model. This is where the core functionality is released under an open-source (MIT) license while the additional functionality is under a proprietary license.

Gitlab’s business has been performing very well. When it last raised money in September 2019, it announced that its revenue growth rate was 140% year over year. In January of 2020, Gitlab hit an annual revenue run rate of $120 million.

Gitlab had originally planned on going public in November of this year. But in May, they decided to hold off on these plans due to the uncertain economic outlook at the time. However with the recent performance of tech IPO’s, you can expect that they will be going public sooner rather than later.

Gitlab is currently valued at over $6 billion, after shares were sold in the secondary market in September of this year. That’s more than double its valuation when it raised money in September 2019.

### 3. Stripe

Stripe is a SaaS company that provides payment processing services and other financial products to businesses of all sizes.

Stripe is one of the most valuable startups in the world. Its most recent round of funding valued the company at $36 billion.

Revenue numbers are hard to come by for Stripe, but a recent interview with co-founder John Collison shows the scale of the business:

&gt;*Mr Collison said that 200,000 new businesses have signed up with Stripe since March. “Those businesses, since March, have already processed more than $20 billion in revenue,” he said.*

Stripe typically charges 2.9% per transaction. So a back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that Stripe earned almost $600 million since March **ONLY** from companies that have signed up to Stripe since March. Their actual revenue numbers are obviously much higher.

There is no hard evidence that Stripe will go public in 2021. In fact, in the same interview, Mr.Collison stated that “We have no plans to IPO”. However, a recent major partnership with Salesforce and the hiring of a high-profile CFO from General Motors seems to signal that an IPO might not be too far off.

### 4. Bumble

Bumble is a dating app with a twist - on Bumble, only women can make the first move when a man and a women ‘match’.

Match Group (owners of Tinder) are the major player in the online dating space. But Bumble seems to be catching up. Bumble posted revenue of $240 million in 2019 and has 100 million users as of 2020.

Bumble’s growth strategy seems similar to that of Tinder in that it offers premium features such as “Bumble Boost”. But a key part of their growth strategy also seems to be to move outside of just dating. They recently launched two major products; BFF helps you to meet new friends while BIZZ helps you to network more effectively.

According to a Bloomberg report, Bumble just recently confidentially filed for an IPO in February 2021. The expected valuation range is $6-8 billion.

### 5. Instacart

2020 has been a massive year for the grocery-delivery company, Instacart.

Similar to other delivery companies like Doordash, the pandemic brought on a massive spike in demand for Instacart. In March, order volume on the platform jumped by over 500%.

Instacart’s valuation has grown in line with its order volume this year. It grew from $7.9 billion at the beginning of 2020 to more than $17 billion by October.

Instacart looks set to be planning an IPO for 2021. A recent Financial Times report stated that the company is consulting with banks ahead of a potential IPO in early 2021.

gaming,Cyberpunk 2077: Development hell and Cut Content,"This essay goes over the amount of cut content and the development hell it clearly went through.

PDF link   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1\_-gBslUQR3YFOTwgfu\_j5\_24zNcg\_a10/view?usp=sharing

I think we all know by now the amount of shit cyberpunk has been getting about glitches, but one thing that has been less talked about is content. How much content has been cut. In all games, content is cut, but in cyberpunk, its clear they cut so much that it ruined the game. In 2018, they released a 45 minute demo that, in my opinion, was the same thing anthem did. Anthem had an amazing gameplay demo shown at E3 but it was later revealed that it was made just for E3 and nothing was made yet. I feel like in cyberpunk, that same thing happened. I am going to give a full rundown on everything I have found on cut content, changes, etc.

Later on I will go through some of the history of the project and a lot of the departures and how they affected the project. Some things may seem redundant at times(such as mentioned things that may have happened after confirmed they happened later on), this is because I am going out of order when going into the articles so some things, though correct, may slightly conflict with a word or two in later or earlier paragraphs.

Warning: Some plot mentions may be a bit off/wrong but the majority of it I am sure of.

In 2013, the first video teaser was released, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P99qJGrPNLs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P99qJGrPNLs). In this teaser alone, you can tell the plan was a very different game. The game was fully announced in mid 2012 so my guess is that they were working on basic stuff since around 2011. So that Is almost 2 years until the release of the trailer. The game in this trailer looks so much different from what we got. From the graphics style to the tone. The game has a much darker tone and vibe. It was brutal and bloody and gave off a depressing vibe. In the game we got, it had almost a cartoonish vibe at times, the gritty darkness wasn’t there as much.

At 0:23 you can see a bullet bounce off her face. This type of armored skin is not seen at all in the game.

At 0:49 you can see a whole squad of police officers coming to try to kill the woman who is going through cyberpsychosis. The rifles they are using and the outfits are totally different than what we get in the game.

In the game we got, they can easily be killed with a few shotgun blasts, a clip of basic rifle ammo, and a basic hack. In the video, they need a special group to kill the psycho, MAXtech. If it is so easy for a solo to do it, why does the NCPD take so many shots and so many men to kill one of them.

At 0:42, You can also see a cyberware shop, something that is not in the game from what I have seen.

At 0:56, you can see massive buildings that are a mix of gothic and sci fi. This is nowhere to be seen in the final game.

In 2017, Mike Pondsmith was interviewed by gamereactor. In this he was asked about the 9 classes and if we can expect them in the game. He said “yes, yes you can. They are all going to be there but I think your gonna find some surprises about how we have done it.” This happened at 7:24 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQXim8oKt9c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQXim8oKt9c). This interview makes it clear that even in July 2017, they didn’t have even the basic classes ready. In cyberpunk, we were forced into one class with a few extra options, that is a MASSIVE change from what was in the final game and even the first demo.

In the 2018 trailer, we see our first look at cyberpunk 2077 in the form we see in its modern look. It is clear as day that it is nothing at all like the original teaser from 2013. The first thing you see is that it is game engine footage, so not a full CGI trailer. The graphics are clearly better in the trailer than in the game we got.

When the actual thing starts, you are on a subway which was cut from the game, something we have seen in GTA4 over 10 years ago on the xbox 360 and something we see in RDR2, a game from this gen that is bigger than cyberpunk 2077. You also see a much larger variety of people in that one train than I have seen in ALL of night city. In addition, you can see that V’s jacket glows, which is seen at 0:13.

Two seconds later, you see 2 punks harassing a suit, I have not seen anyone looking that punk in the game. V’s voice actor seems to have changed also.

At 0:24, the place outside your apartment has a much higher population density along with a subway seen crossing the skyline.

At 0:26, you see a few things. First, a few open buildings in the background clearly showing missing interiors, a curb that shows advertisements, NPCs doing things that we do not see in the game(such as leaning against the curb hanging out with their stuff on the street. You also see a man in a 6 wheeled motorized shopping cart. None of this is seen in the final game. That isn’t even mentioning the amount of grafitti.

At 0:30, you see that the megabuilding has much more to access but is missing certain things such as the boxing ring and gunstore but that may be out of shot. NPCs are also doing stuff such as drinking and leaning on the edge, though he is glitched into the railing so it is a bit more faithful to the new game there.

At 0:35, it confirms there is children along with being able to sit and watch the hologram television in the couch. The man seems to be on some sort of original version of braindances.

At 0:40, you see Jackie sitting on a bench seemingly waiting for something.

At 0:41, you see a man getting beat up with what looks like V doing some sort of deal with a man in fedora. You also see two hookers talking to a man parked in a car. Clearly none of this happens in the game, especially at random. You also see “Wheres johnny” on a wall, its either an easter egg showing he is in the game or a plot point removed(as we know johnny died in 2024 so it would be obvious that people would have known. This also contradicts the 2018 demo where it says johnny died in 2076).

At 0:43, you see a pool table and people drinking at the bar, people playing pool, etc. This is not something you see in the game. There are multiple people wearing cyberwear in their eyes and a character that may be a nomad front and center. I am not sure if this person appears in the game or not. Characters are around and talking and drinking with others. NPCs do not interact in the full game like this.

At 0:46, you see a guy boxing along with other people exercising and such. You can box, but all the other stuff is not in the game. It also seems to be on another floor than where V’s apartment was. The layout is different too.

At 0:47, the taxi scene I do not remember and the men in the back I do not remember. This clearly points to a taxi service that is not in the game.

The scene at 0:51 shows a woman with a mount inplant that can be removed, pointing to customization that is not present in the game.

At 0:53, theres a man lying down with what looks like an early version of braindance on. You can see that he is interacting with something and his sunglasses are up. This would also support the man at 0:35 is also using a braindance. You also see what seems to be hookers being rented to night city and buildings that are not in the game in the background.

At 1:00, you see the flat heard bot in a scene that is not in the game along with other characters. Dex is scene in the game but he has a different type of arm, showing either this was an early design or there was more plot where he lost his arm and got a new one. You see a punk which seems to have been a major character. Also a version of the bot. This may be the first design of the afterlife as it seems like a similar set up as the first mission but after it.

At 1:03 You also see what looks to be someone who may be Jackie being robbed at gunpoint, something not seen in the game. He looks different but may be after something big happens or may be another character in the game. This also shows you could have been able to sit down and eat in the game.

At 1:05, you see people playing basketball and hanging out in a lesser part of town, something not seen in the game with NPC interactions. You also see that they may be maelstrom or at least some of them.

At 1:08 you see riots that I do not think are in the main game. From what I can find about it though, this part was not in the main game through it seems like a major plot point. On the text, you can read “Dozens killed since April amid a wave of anti-corporate protests”. It also mentions “stolen petrochem assets with intention to reduce inequality and poverty”. I cannot make out the first part. I have not heard of “petrochem” in cyberpunk 2077. It seems like this plot point was fully removed.

Also at 1:08, You alse see what was the map of night city, which is so much larger than what we got Along with a different type of police car than see in the game.

What looks like T-bug killed arasaka agents via the netrunner chair at 1:10 from what I know, is not in the game either. Plus, t-bug dies early on in the game.

At 1:13 You also see V, looking very different from her real game counterpart, hiding from a police vehicle which do not do this sort of thing in the game. Plus there is much more trash and such in this alleyway, along with her hiding the cycle.

Less than a second later you see a guy getting his eye ripped out, not seen in the main game

At 1:14, you see a scene where a punk is shot to death by a shop owner holding a shotgun, not something you see in the main game.

At 1:16, theres a scene with trauma team comes up and kills a bunch of dudes along with a dude who seems to be bulletproof. This may be the first scav mission we do but the first version of it. The bulletproof dude is clearly the boss and the environment around it is the same. Plus you can see a bit of the layout is similar and environment. This may have meant that you could have called trauma team in to do the work for you.

At 1:28, you see a camera showing you the back of the car, not something you see in the game plus a car chase. The male V design is also very different.

At 1:30, you can see there is so many more advertisements than what we see in the game.

From this 1:40 second trailer, we have at least 25 things that were missing/changed in the main game. From plot points to NPC interactions to mission choices to design. This isn’t a full in fake CGI trailer like the infamous killzone 2 trailer, this is in-engine footage as stated at the start.

During E3, the press got to see the demo then later on the public did a few months later. Someone already did a great write up on everything but the mods of [r/cyberpunkgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/) deleted it but there is a good screenshot so I will link that and I will use that as a outline to put things wrong about the demo. I will add what I find in the game along with elements of that outline. The user who made it is [u/MrStuntAction](https://www.reddit.com/u/MrStuntAction/)

0:41 we see that V’s default appearance in the game has changed and cannot be recreated in the final game. People asked for years about this.

0:42, we see the character customization screen, specifically the “birth record”. There are 5 different panels seen. Birth record, Background check, biometric scan, appearance, and biostats. You see both characters are naked but censored. Apparently, according to an interview, this was so people don’t focus just on the nudity and in the full game, this would be removed and be fully naked. In the main game, they were clothed(until you changed their dick or vagina but even then you only see them that one time unless you glitched and V’s pants were removed and you saw your characters no no square).

At 0:47. They mention a deep customization system. Besides visuals, which do not really matter in the main game as you can rarely see your character, nothing is really deeply customizable.

At 0:58, they say “we want to give you a glimps at what will be possible in the released game” Even though there is the “work in progress”, this proves this was the original idea and this was what they wanted, not the lifepath system.

At 1:00, there is the background check system. This is not in the game at all. In the left side, you see your characters face, their ID, ID type, First Name, Last Name, Alias, Date of Birth, Gender, Prior convictions, Education, details, and authenitacation code. There is also an “Edit details” button, proving all of these were features. You were to be able to change your name, choose your past criminal history, your education, and details. These could affect how you are seen in the game by people and really get you in dept with the “Deep RPG” feeling.

Also at 1:00, they say “This is an RPG, so before we get into our appearance, we need to define our backstory. What you choose here will unlock different possibilities later in the game. ”

At 1:00, you see the backstory mentioned in the dialogue above. You have multiple options. Childhood hero, key life event, and why night city.

For childhood hero you could choose Johnny silverhand, morgan blackhand, and Saburo Arasaka.

For key life event, you can choose death of sibling, ran away from home, or first big kill

For Why night city, you can choose unfinished business, ex-lover in town, and something to prove.

All of this proves that before the lifepath systems which were deeply cut in the main game, the background was much similar to other RPGs such as the 2020 pen and paper game, which had all these details.

At 1:10, you see the biometic scan option. You see the original version of V and her jacket and different customizable options. These include: Body type, hairstyle, tattoos, makeup, skintone, tattoo locatons, tattoo colors, glow colors(proving tattoos can glow), eye mods, surface wiring, skin mods, body scars, eyes, eye color(many more colors), nose, mouth, jaw, ears. There is a better layout of the options, choose starting clothes, able to change the glow color of your eyes. All of this seems to be for third person cutscenes which were ripped from the game.

At 1:10 to 1:21, he talks about all the major types of modifcations Which are “Body type, hairstyle, tattoos, makeup, skintones, and many many more.” From this quote and all the options, even the “Deep” customization we got is not even close to how deep it is in the original design.

At 1:21, you see the biostats section. This includes: Strength, constitution, intelligence, reflexes, tech, and cool. You could assign points to these sections. In the main game, there is only body stat.

At 1:28, he says “You notice, we didn’t pick a class. Cyberpunk 2077 features a fluid class system.” This directly ignores what mike pondsmith said back in july 2017. Remember, even though the video was released in late august, the demo was released in June to the press and most likely made weeks earlier if not months. This means that either mike pondsmith lied about the class system or it was changed recently and this demo was thrown together.

At 1:35, the man says “This demo takes place near the beginning of the game”. In the final game this mission is the first real mission of the game past the lifepath missions which really was only 20 minutes each max. Back when this demo was released, they didn’t have the lifepaths. From what it seems, this takes place a few hours in maybe? The lifepaths aren’t even mentioned in this demo so I doubt they were even thought of. I don’t think they even knew where this would fit in anyway. This is also agreed with by the post I am looking at at times.

At 1:47, you see a third person cutscene, something that is missing in the main game.

At 1:47, you also see V and Jackie’s looks that are different. They are both wearing different clothes and look very different than from the main game. Jackey looks more serious and grizzled in this cutscene.

At 1:52, T-bug shows up on the upper left side, but whats different is that it is showing video, not the generic red picture. The UI also is different. This may have been cut due to performance on weaker hardware. Having NPCs not be there may be better.

At 1:54, the woman comes out of the apartment says dialogue and comes out much farther. You can also interact with this woman, telling her to go inside quickly. The hall seems to be different too.

At 2:14, the area seems much less cluttered in the first room.

At 2:19, the room looks mostly the same, maybe a bit bigger. Some stuff moved around too. The screens are also on and showing different things.

2:42, most things look the same in here environment wise, a few differences tho but mostly item placement

At 2:43, it shows Non Lethal takedowns could be done instead of fully lethal. This also goes with a quote said in an interview about being able to do a no-kill playthrough, which clearly isn’t the case. This interview will be brought up later.

At 2:46, you can see environmental takedowns, such as V shooting the scav under the water to muffle the sound. This is not seen in the game, you just snap his neck and throw him in. You also see body parts chopped up inside.

At 2:51, it mentions “Reflex boosters”, drugs to enhance abilites in the game. These are not seen at all in the game besides health. So, at least bullet time was cut

At 3:02, you can see the design was changed a bit. Some more detail in this area.

Another difference is that you can wait for people to leave in the final game as in the demo that is not shown. There is also grabbing shown. You can also hack into things which is not shown in the original demo.

at 3:24, you can see the pillar is more destructive.

At 3:39. You follow the main boss and he starts shooting through the wall, creating a big hole. In the main game, this boss is removed and you go into a mostly empty room.

At 4:02, it mentions a scanner. In the main game, the scanner you already have. There is also no bullet counter.

At 4:17, you get a better look at the boss. It seems to be the same character from the trailer who was bulletproof from trauma team, further proving that was the original scav mission design. The rifle he is holding is the exact same also. There is also a lot more destruction and debris everywhere.

At 4:24, Jackie takes the bosses gun

At 4:50, There are a few differences. You get a few more options in the demo than the main game. In the main game, there is a very clear downgrade in quality graphics wise. The info scene from the biomon on the demo and game are different too. The main game has a more complex look to it. The dialogue is a bit different too. In the demo, there is more dialogue, more detailed. In the main game, Jackie describes the area more, making it seem a bit like a horror show. The demo is more technical though. In the demo, you can use the airhypo to revive the girl or attempt to revive her. In the game, you only have the airhypo option. The woman is also nude in the demo while in the game she is clothed.

At 6:42, the trama team come in and there isn’t a lasered off area for the trauma team like the main game. The way the trauma team come in is a bit different too.

At 7:48, there is another third person cutscene. The dialogue is totally different.

At 7:58, instead of the entire driving scene back to Watson, V wakes up in her apartment in a third person cutscene. The Watson drive may have been cut from the gameplay though. But the conversation V and Jackie having in the game vs the demo would have had to be more towards the game if the Watson lockdown were to be included but the dialogue may have taken place later.

At 8:15, you see a man leaving the apartment and V looking like she just had a hangover. This refers to the one night stands they mentioned you were able to do in interviews and in the game. This is absent in the main game.

At 8:35, the radio host mentioned Johnny Silverhand and how its been a year since he went on his last ride. This means he died in the year 2076. In the game, he died in 2023. So, this proves the story was entirely different when the demo was made. It seems as if they didn’t have a story down anyway. That would make sense given the differences with classes as seen in the 2017 interview, made less than a year before the demo was released. If the classes were changed that much before the demo, I doubt they had much of a story ready. Another explanation may be that when Keanu Reeves hopped on board, they totally changed the story to give him more screen time. Could also be a mix of both.

At 8:41, it mentions the afterlife bar and how “gonks sitting in the afterlife waiting for something better”, meaning that, instead of the more upclass and excusive version of the afterlife we say in the game, the bar may have been much more open instead.

At 9:06, the old chippin in is heard, even though it is still in the main game, it is not the one made by samurai as that was changed to refused’s version.

At 9:13, you can see a news story, the temp, messages, and shades. You can apparently changed to morning and night along with a braindance mode. IT seems like there was much more interactivity. The braindance mode might be a reference to being able to buy braindances in-game, which you could in the game but unable to use them. Another thing is that in both other instances of seeing braindances, the user was in a dark area or an area with lower light than the rest of the area around them.

At 9:20, you can see there is a few differences in the demo version and the game version. It seems like a lot of the outdoor is placeholder and bland.

At 9:25, you can see a mix of television screens above hovering. The in-game version is much less detailed and has less color. You also can’t use them, you can only use a TV near the side

At 9:54, you can see a samuri poster, showing V knew about johnny silverhand in the demo. Also see a few differences in the apartment layout.

At 10:15, you can see the multiple jackets and you pick them out from the hanger intead of going into a menu. In the game. It also mentions how clothes represent certain stats, those are removed in the game for a simple armor mechanic.

At 10:22, the man says “V’s current apartment”. This means that there were more than one apartment in the game. In what was supposed to be a “Rags to riches” storyline, you become a millionaire and you still live in that shitty little apartment. It makes no sense. It seems that they cut a feature for buying apartments later on in the game, something GTA5 did. You might get all the most unique weapons supercars so expensive they are ultra rare. You still live in a shitty little apartment.

At 10:25, you can see a man riding a little motorized scooter, not something you see in game. Plus you see characters interacting with eachother.

At 10:33, you can see its more bright and theres more stuff going on, more levels.

At 10:58, the narrator says “A big part of our RPG experience is having a world that’s interactive”. The narrator shows the player interacting with an ad, which goes into a self tailored advertisement. This is not to be seen in the game at all. Interactive consumerism, which is huge in the cyberpunk genre, is not there. Honestly, at this point, the “punk” of cyberpunk isn’t in the game. Theres the cyber, but no punk.

At 12:05, when you go down the elevator, you can see more than normal

At 12:27, that interaction doesn’t happen.

At 12:37, a similar interaction with the silverhand album also is not there.

At 12:50, you can see there are so many more NPCs in the streets. In the main game, even in big areas, the city feels empty, even during the day. Night city is supposed to be more populated than big cities like Tokyo. Wheres the huge crowds of people?

At 12:56, the infamous quote occurs “We’ve greatly enhanced our crowed and community systems to creat ehte most believable cityh in any open world game to date”. This is clearly false. You can’t go sit down and eat, you can’t go play games like pool, theres no qwent-like minigame, theres nothing to do in the game. You can’t even get your haircut or interact with people. GTA san andreas had more to do!

At 13:16, you can see the crosswalk change colors when you stop and go, this is not in the full game.

At 13:45, you go and meet jackey at a railing. In the full game, you meet jackey at another point at a food stand. In the demo you don’t see him at a food stand, you see him on a corner. You also just walk down stairs to see dex, not go for a ride. Another difference is the order between dex and the ripperdoc. In the demo and game, its flipped.

At 14:00 when you go into the car, the dialogue is a bit different also. Some changes.

14:30, dex doesn’t have a heist for us. In the demo, its just about the flathead. In the game, they discuss a heist. It seems like they didn’t even have any sort of plot laid out yet. Wouldn’t you think they would have mentioned the heist?

At 15:25, dex didn’t pay for the flathead. In the game, he did and got scammed. That’s a decent sized change story wise for that mission.

At 16:15, dex says “See you at the afterlife”, this adds to my earlier point about how “Exclusive” the club is.

At 19:33, it seems like ripperdocs were butchered heavily. Viks conversation was mostly the same but the interaction with ripperdocs were stripped down heavily. Sitting on the operation table was cut, the screen that appears in front of your face as the cyberware menu still does in the cutscene but is useless. Installing new arms, legs, heart, valuves, spine in the final game gives you the same menu as a food vendor. Also, there is no sign that you actually got the cybernetics. Everyone else has signs? Even dex who is rich as hell. Why wouldn’t we see ours?

At 21:55, there is a zoom in feature not seen in the game. You can also zoom and scan separately in the demo, in the game you cannot.

At 24:10, there is a different quest flow. The way characters progress, as I mentioned earlier, is totally different. In the final product, Jackie never buys a car and the scavs don’t stalk it.

At 25:04, shooting from the car was cut except in scripted scenes.

At 25:47, the narrator says the scavengers looking for revenge is a random encounter and shows “how your actions directly influence your open world experience”. None of this happened.

At 26:34, Jackie comes with you but stays up and hides. In the game, the dialogue is the same but Jackie isn’t there, making it so the dialogue about other people there make no sense. IT seems like act 1 was glued together from half baked concepts and early version of the plot.

At 28:30, there is an option to grab the gun. You cannot do that in the main game.

31:41. In the demo, it says you can go in gun blazing, in the game you cannot. You have to go in the normal way.

35:19. The entire flathead part where you could own it was cut. It wasn’t shown in the demo but we found out later. You could keep it in your techie builds

37:44. The inspection system was completely cut. The only thing close is the shard system.

38:24, there is shown to be alternative fire types in weapons. In the main game, this only comes in power shotguns. Other weapons seemd to have had this either, maybe representing other ammo types.

39:43, weapon modules such as beingt able to make bullets kick off of walls and hit your target was removed.

40:10, the targeting system revealing enemies turned into marking them with your skanner ala far cry

40:15 may reperesent different ammo types

41:58, Jack never uses any advanced cyberware in the game. You can see him use cyberware here. This makes me think that he had a much bigger role in the story and they didn’t have the plot ready yet if any at all.

42:22, you hack into an enemy’s neural socket. This is greatly simplified in the final games netrunning.

42:57, mantis blade wallrunning is gone. Games like Wolfenstein and tomb raider allowed players to climb on certain walls. Why couldn’t CDPR do a similar system? Have a little way to see where and how you can climb using the blades.

45:48. “So many options, so many possibilities, and each will have consequences ripping through the game world and your story”. At least 90% of the games “choices” are make-believe and don’t actually matter in the long run of the game. The 2018 demo is the game they wanted to make but the 2020 was what they could scramble together in 2 years or so. It’s a miracle we got this much! I truly feel like CDPR pulls an anthem.

Also, I’ll be honest. Its fucking late. The last few things I skimped on, I am sure there is much more. Pretend I did it so the viewer can go investigate themselves. More interesting than the in-game investigating I’m sure.

In the 2019 demo, I am not as well versed as I didn’t do much netrunning and I also really lost interest and hope in the game so I didn’t make it this far, so I will say what I know but I am sure there is more. Plus it is 3:45 AM, I’ve been working on this since 11:30 PM. I’m exhausted and done with this shit. Gonna be longer than my fucking Poverty and social welfare final essay for uni.

In the 2019 gameplay demo, there seems to be a lot of netrunning stuff removed, such as the cyberwire to hack into enemies. The netrunner mechanics seem to be downgraded a lot also.

At 7:46, you see the MASSIVELY downgraded character creator. This is the first sign of the lifepath system. The Characters are also wearing clothes. The list of customization options seems to be much less than what we got in the main game.

In this demo, it also seems like there Is a bit more destruction than the final game.

Overall, the 2019 demo and above seems to have a lot less cut content than what we have seen so far, so unless anything notable is missing, I won’t bring it up.

In the 2019 CGI trailer, it seems like the way the ending of the heist mission is different than the game.

At 0:11, you see the city is much more bright and almost bigger than what we got in game. You can see more buildings.

At 0:55 when V goes into the room, it seems like the dialogue is different but it has a very similar outcome, just there are certain changes. This includes T-bug being in the room and the way the fight goes down. In the CGI triler, you fight the man at the door and he hits you when you come out. You also have the mantis blades which you don’t have at that point in the game beforehand. There is also a lot more dialogue when dex betrays V.

At 3:45, the way you meet Silverhand is different also. Instead of in your apartment, you see him at the junkyard.

This trailer mostly had a few changes to the dialogue and such, not many huge changes besides the end.

In night city wire episode 2, the one that covers lifepaths, there are a few lies in the lifepath trailier

At 1:25, streetkid is chosen. It shows a whole montage of what it makes out to be exclusive missions but is just normal missions all players get. This same thing happens for the other intros too.

Besides this, everything is pretty much the same

Everything after this was pretty much the same, so, now I am going to go more into interviews and older stuff.

In this article from Janurary 25th, 2013, around the same time the teaser released, there are a bunch of things talked about, a big one is braindances. It even shows an early version of braindances. It mentions how BDs are the most popularform of mass entertainment in 2077 but when you look through the game, it doesns’t really seem like that besides in a few areas. It also mentions “underground recordings” which you see a few, but one mentioned, about a serial killer murdering his victims and feeling all the emotions, is not in the game. In the picture, you see a MAXtec agent with the original and more badass design ([https://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2066517/Definition\_of\_braindance\_1020.jpg](https://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2066517/Definition_of_braindance_1020.jpg))

In the article, it mentions that Marcin Janiszewski, the lead gameplay designer, says “We want to assure fans of the -pen-and-paper this is still the same cyberpunk you know, Night city as changed in the interening decades, but there are still places that you know, this is the same city.” Compared to the pen-and-paper, it doesn’t really feel like it is. Lots of things from the pen and paper is not there. The Friday night firefight system, which was very lethal, is not there. Now you are a bullet sponge. The 9 classes are not there, the customizable backstory is not there. Besides the afterlife and a few names, the game doesn’t truly respect the material. The pen-and-paper was dark and gritty with a bit of dark humor. The game is almost cartoonish at times, not as dark as the material.

personalfinance,Conflicting language in loan documents. Am I SOL?,"Hi, I closed on my first house in March. It was kind of a panic purchase because rent was going up A LOT and I did not really know what I was doing. My finance guy got me into the Home Plus program for down payment assistance. He said he got me the non-refundable program because it came with a lower interest rate than the refundable program. At signing the title copy is walking me through the paper work and we get to the part regarding the second mortgage for the down payment assistance and it says IT IS forgivable in 3 years as long as I live there and do not refinance in that period. We tried calling my finance guy to check the language, but he will not answer. Title says ""if the language is in there, then it is forgivable. Make sure you keep all your documents."" I signed it and we moved on.

&amp;#x200B;

Well I just got a letter from the HomePlus Program Compliance Administrator saying they reviewed my loan documents and found conflicting language. While it makes no mention of the language regarding forgiveness, it goes on to say ""this letter is being sent to remind you that the 2nd mortgage loan is fully repayable when..."" one of these events occurs. And here is a document from the loan that says that and you signed it. I went back to my loan document and sure enough, it is there. (Honestly, I have no recollection of going over that page with Title and I don't think we did given that this document came first followed by the document with forgiveness that started our conversation. That said, my signature is definitely on it.) Consequently, language for forgiveness and non-forgiveness are both in my loan documents and both signed. The securities company is saying only the language regarding non-forgiveness matters. Do I have any recourse?

personalfinance,Need to lower car payments,"In mid-2019, my two businesses failed resulting in personal bankruptcy (Ch 7) earlier this year (2020). 

Maybe I should have abandoned both of our cars at that time, but we didn’t. I now have a better paying job ($120,000/year) in a much more expensive city (Denver). 

After taxes and insurance, etc., I take home about $6500/month. Our family of five lives in a suburb and our rent is $2600/month. By the tenth of each month, we’re broke again and scraping by until the next monthly payday. 

It seems ridiculous to be in this situation. 

My car payments are about $1000/month (8 year old Ford Expedition and two year old Hyundai Sonata.  I’m sure we’re upside down on both of them by at least a couple grand. 

I’d rather be driving an older car with no monthly payment, if it’s reliable. With three kids in Colorado, one of the cars should probably be 4 WD. 

The bankruptcy makes it hard to imagine anyone refinancing our existing cars at lower rates.  

We could probably buy new cars with lower interest rates but we’d still have at least $700/month payments.  Or we could sell the cars at a loss and pay off the loans and buy two used cars (and inherit inevitable problems and repairs).

economy,The Crisis Housing Act would automatically activate housing vouchers for the poorest to spend on housing after hurricanes and wildfires—or if a state’s unemployment rate increases drastically.,"The Crisis Housing Act Program (CHAP), a new bill introduced this week by Senators Brian Schatz, of Hawaii, and Chris Van Hollen, of Maryland, aims to put an end to the cycle of ineligibility and inaction by allowing the dispersal of emergency funds to be automatically triggered after major disasters. That would eliminate congressional stalling every time there’s a catastrophe, and also ensure the poorest qualify for financial assistance.
the main aim of this bill is to focus on disaster relief, it also has a second trigger—for unemployment. Specifically, resources would be triggered by a 0.5% increase in the six-month average of a state’s unemployment rate, relative to its low during the previous year (a metric known as the Sahm Rule, named for economist Claudia Sahm). That arm of the bill was influenced by the COVID-19 economic crisis, as unemployment has greatly exacerbated people’s inability to pay rent, and there’s currently a bipartisan bill under discussion that would extend the eviction moratorium for another month and set aside $25 million for rent relief.

But rent payment has been a problem for a long time: Even before the pandemic, 15% of U.S. households spent more than 50% of their income on rent. “We really want Congress to shift its focus to be thinking about systemic, long-term solutions that really get at the heart of these issues,” Sarah Saadian, vice president of public policy for the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC), says. Those measures would build a stronger safety net for future disasters and emergencies. In the long run, the bill would also be more resourceful, Saadian says, in preventing homelessness’s costly problems, like shelter, healthcare, and foster care. “It’s pretty inexpensive, in the scheme of things.”



“When disaster strikes, families shouldn’t be left without a home or stuck in limbo waiting for Congress to pass a disaster relief bill,” Senator Schatz said in a press release. “Too many people in our country are housing insecure, and this is a good first step to building a safety net to support them.”

When disasters hit, poorer people have to wait for weeks or months for Congress to enact federal funding so they can access aid. After 2018’s Hurricane Michael, the first Category 5 hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. in 26 years, Congress took eight months to approve funding. While CHAP would have to initially pass in Congress, it would then permanently allow the automatic authorization of resources in the event of a major disaster, without the need for congressional approval—making funds ready and available for the most in need.",finance

personalfinance,Roth Conversion vs. Student Loans,"30+M here. Graduated from business school this spring and was fortunate to get a well-paying job. Living with my parents currently so expenses are effectively $0. Debating how to juggle paying off school loans and saving for retirement - specifically, whether to convert more of my Rollover IRA dollars to my Roth IRA (and pay the related taxes), or just hoard cash til COVID ends.

Cash: $70k

Rollover IRA: $40k

Roth IRA: $50k

Student Loans: $200k @ 0% (Federal)

I maxed out my Pre-tax and Post-tax 401k contributions this year to reduce my taxable income (only worked half the year). Converted some of my Rollover to Roth already earlier in the year, bringing my 2020 income up to $85k or so (22% bracket).

Now that's its the end of the year, I'm deciding whether to convert the rest of my Rollover to my Roth, or move it into my company 401k to clear the account so I can do a back-door Roth in 2021. Figure I can convert the Rollover and pay 24% marginal tax on that (plus state tax), say $12k in taxes total.

Ordinarily I'd pay off the loans - but at 0% interest right now, with a student loan bubble about to burst...I'd feel exceedingly stupid if any type of government assistance for federal loans comes to fruition. Assuming I can refinance at \~4% once COVID ends, is there any reason not to jump on the 2020 window and convert to my Roth now? I'll make too much in future years, and 2020 income tax rates are at historical lows.

Thanks in advance for the advice!",finance
personalfinance,Helping dad refinance home loan but both confused,"I've been trying to help my father deal with this but it's a lot different than what I know. Just sort of understanding how interest works for home loans. Originally thought it was just home value x 1.0interest like cars. Also, agent kept giving both interest rate and APR. Am I correct that APR is the rate we should be using for our estimations? It was a bit higher than the interest rate for both the 15 and 30 year offers. About +0.2. 

We financed the house 8 years ago at 3.6% for 30 years. Seems like we've just been paying off interest. Our monthly is 1270 and remaining loan is 330k of originally a 280k loan with 22 years left which is why I'm guessing we've been paying mostly interest up to this point. 

I called our mortgage holder(major bank). Was offered 2.593 APR for 15 years so 1570 monthly (principle + interest) with $4700 closing cost. The agent wasn't super clear. This would lead to an overall cost of 282000 including interest. Which would be a savings of $50k over the current $330k we still owe, right? Just seeing if this checks out before I commit this for my father. 

There was also a 30 year option with 2.649 apr with a lower monthly at 930 and closing cost of 5600. This would be about the same as our current situation and not worth locking ourselves into a new 30 year plan, right? 

Dad said he's comfortable paying extra $300 a month for the 15 year plan if it leads to significant savings. We don't plan on moving very soon but definitely don't plan to stay here a very long time. At least 5-10 years. Any help and advice would be appreciated. The agent is calling again tomorrow at 9AM.",finance

btc,"Executive Order 6102 CONFISCATED Private Gold Holdings, Could it Happen with Crypto?","On April 5, 1933, USA president FDR signed Executive Order 6102, ""forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States."" Private citizens had their gold stolen by government agents so that the Federal Reserve could freely increase the US dollar money supply without the gold price spiking wildly.

Let's discuss if such an order could be enacted with cryptocurrency. Yes, those holding their own private keys could act to protect their crypto holdings, but as many here know, *the majority of crypto holdings are held by exchanges custodially for their customers*. Exchanges are easily targeted by governments, and they typically already have close relationships with government regulatory and law enforcement agencies.

Already this month we've seen Treasury Secretary Mnuchin saying he wants to ban private wallet ownership and KYC each and every exchange user. This would be a logical step toward total control or even seizure of crypto assets. Naturally, if governments could accomplish this confiscation (ideally with the element of surprise), there would be a huge panic and price dump for all cryptocurrencies. Of course there would be blowback from Wall St, but those insiders would probably be protected, just as very wealthy gold holders were mysteriously exempt from gold confiscations.

personalfinance,Minimum wage budget + staying with girlfriend update,"Skip to budget section if you don’t wanna read the update. 

Hey all. You may remember me as the guy who got kicked out of his dads house lol. Things have slowly been turning up for me. 

In short, we are in the process of moving to a much better house (still in the local area) with the same monthly rent. My girlfriend’s mom has gotten a new job and will be making anywhere from $20-25 an hour. My girlfriend is also looking for a part time job somewhere (she does college classes online). 

Myself, I started work at the gas station at the end of November. I work 24 hours a week at $8.75 an hour. I’ve gotten 2 paychecks so far and I am making about 193 a week, so 193 x 4 = about $770 a month. 

I opened up my own bank account yesterday, with about $440 in total. Once my checks clear I’m going to split them into my savings based on my budget, but even when I was with my dad I only had about 20 or 30 dollars at a time after buying groceries and gas, so it feels really good to have my own money I earned. Some of that extra money came from selling my ps4. I’m leaving 50 from selling my ps4 in my checking as a buffer and the other 50 was used to open up the savings account.

I even get my own music room here at the house! We are keeping my guitars, my girlfriends keyboard and her brothers drum set in there and I’m going to be spending all day in there lol. So I think things have slowly gotten better and will continue to. 

BUDGET

With that out of the way, I have some questions about my budget. I’ve already went through and checked the sidebar and everything multiple times. I’ll be listing my expenses and stuff too. Also get Medicaid and food stamps (food stamps will change after I report my income) 

$193/ week

Expenses: total 23% of my paycheck- what isn’t spent at the end of the week goes into savings.

Gas 8% ($15 a week - probably a little more than I need- will update over a time)

Spending money 15% ($29 - includes food, eating out, guitar picks any small stuff, also includes helping cover costs for when we eat out as a family.)

Savings: total 77% of my paycheck 

Save up for a car 29% (about $56 a week towards a car, includes making first months insurance and expected repairs purchasing a beater car)

Pay off 4K in scholarships 28% (54 a week. Goes towards the 4K I owe after dropping out. Idk any of the interest rates or how I would even go about making payments, I can’t login to my student account and all my mail for school goes to my dads house. I will call them tomorrow to ask about it)

Ableton upgrade 20% (38 a week. Ableton is a music making software and upgrading from the free trial version to 
The standard version will allow me to work better. I make music for a hobby but I have a long term goal of one day being an audio engineer or producer and upgrading the software will allow me to do my passion better in the free time, but also allow me a better workflow when working with (hopeful) future clients locally and online.

How does my budget look? I also am not sure if I should even worry about paying off that 4K right now, I don’t think it will go anywhere or do anything crazy. I also am using an iPhone 5 which doesn’t even have cell service. I use my laptop at the house but I just use the phone for messenger on wifi. I’ve learned to get by with it and it doesn’t really bother me, should I invest in buying a flip phone with service or anything or save up for a better phone? Let me know what you guys think since you all are pretty good with this.

And I also realize I need another or a better paying job. I am about to send out another wave of applications, but working just this little bit has given me the perspective that I don’t have to love my job, just make the best out of it. If it gives me money I’m
happy lol. So I may steer towards the trades or something. I’m not sure yet but I still have time. 

Thank you so much for making it this far, and if you have any questions about any info I’ll drop it below.",finance
Bitcoin,Why bitcoin matters,"Hi r/Bitcoin community! Been a member for a long time but never had a chance to reflect upon my motivation to use btc. 

To make a long story short, I have some sort of a side hustle with people from third world countries. It’s not easy to transact with them and my choice fell on Payoneer. They used to do their job well for over 6 years until September this year when they suddenly blocked $18k of my funds for no apparent reason. It’s been a long battle with their support but to no avail. I clearly explained them the nature of my business (nothing illegal, I assure you), but they kept asking for more and more details including my personal correspondence with customers. At one point, I got fed up with their silly requests, swallowed my loss and moved 100% of my business to bitcoin. Even though it’s still expensive to buy btc by my partners from third world countries, at least I am in full control of my funds and no shitty scammer like /rPayoneer can confiscate my hard earned money. 

I wrote this post for two reasons: 1) to warn you not to trust your money to third parties like Payoneer 2) to advise you not to be afraid to use crypto for peer to peer businesses. 

Stay safe and have a great day!

I have no way of contacting a real person, and when my loan payments begin in January, I figured I'd just have to put a check in the mail and hope somebody is there to receive it.

Submission Statement: A Pfizer vaccine built on dead viruses,{versus a Moderna vaccine built on immune response } requiring ultra low temperature stability, strict administration of doses, and a 40k trial basis, with limited research as experienced with a normal vaccine.

**Mislabeled dosage vials, labeled with 5 doses, when in fact 6 doses are available.

# **Wall Street strategists see stocks gaining 9% in 2021 after a possible speed bump to start the year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/wall-street-strategists-see-stocks-gaining-9percent-in-2021-after-a-possible-speed-bump-to-start-the-year.html)**
*****
&gt; The stock market appears set on rising into 2021 — a year expected to see some return to normalcy, above trend economic growth and a higher stock market, according to Wall Street strategists.
*****
&gt; Even with this year’s sharp sell-off, the S&amp;P 500 is notching a near 15% gain for 2020. For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.
*****
&gt; Those in CNBC’s survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&amp;P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.
*****
&gt; Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.
*****
&gt; But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.
*****
&gt; “The shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It’s nothing like what you saw in the spring,” said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. “It’s going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.”
*****
&gt; Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.
*****
&gt; # The week ahead
&gt; Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&amp;P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&amp;P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla’s entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&amp;P on Monday morning.
*****
&gt; “We’ll see whether or not there’s selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it’s absorbed within the S&amp;P,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&amp;P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.
*****
&gt; Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. “At this point, the vaccines are stimulus,” she said.
*****
&gt; Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday’s Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.
*****
&gt; Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.
*****
&gt; # First-quarter speed bump
&gt; “The first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there’s the potential for some negative outlooks. “I think we’re due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.” Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.
*****
&gt; Fundstrat’s Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he’s looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.
*****
&gt; There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it’s more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.
*****
&gt; If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.
*****
&gt; “The January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it’s close. It’s important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,” said Krosby.
*****
&gt; But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.
*****
&gt; “But I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it’s pretty clear you’re going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don’t like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,” said Bank of America’s Harris.
*****
&gt; Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.
*****
&gt; In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.
*****
&gt; “Given the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it’s hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,” said Arone.
*****
&gt; Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don’t have solid earnings streams.
*****
&gt; The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.
*****
&gt; He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.
*****
&gt; In the CNBC/Moody’s Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.
*****
&gt; If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.
*****
&gt; “If you put stimulus like that into the economy that’s open, that’s a big boost,” Harris said.
*****
&gt; Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed’s 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don’t.

&gt; # An Overbought World

&gt; The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US. As shown below, of the 23 ETFs tracking each of these countries' equity markets, nearly all are up double digits since the end of October. A dozen have risen over 20% and Brazil (EWZ) has risen more than any other country, gaining over 40%. China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.

&gt; In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

&gt; # Leading Indicators Positive

&gt; Leading Economic Indicators for the month of November came in higher than expected this morning, rising 0.6% versus estimates for an increase of 0.5%. One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.

&gt; If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.

&gt; While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.

&gt; # Real Santa Claus Rally

&gt; Stock Trader’s Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: “If Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.”

&gt; The “Santa Claus Rally” begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&amp;P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3322e79e3993ba91f3cdc2c8998bb304/c0018ed75496c55e-24/s500x750/c30f76e8944ab933165b8e4605df1949e55c1e8a.jpg))**

&gt; The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch’s now famous line states, “If Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.”

&gt; # VIX Run Above 20 Tops 200 Days

&gt; With today's close, the VIX has now stuck above 20 for 207 trading days and counting. That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**

&gt; Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.

&gt; # Wretched Retail Sales

&gt; If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn’t enough, October’s report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October’s report.

&gt; Breadth in this month’s report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don’t hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars &amp; Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics &amp; Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food &amp; Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online– all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/table.png))**

&gt; The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.

&gt; # Chart of the Year

&gt; Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. “One thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Given that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don’t bet against several more years of new highs.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We’ve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here’s the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&amp;P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.

Main reason for a house would being able to do my music without disturbing neighbors. However I don’t like the idea of being tied down for 5-10 years &amp; also worrying about potentially having to spend a lot fixing a roof or an ac unit. 

Condo would be sweet but I worry I would have to be really cautious with music and noise which I’ve had issues with in the past. I like the idea of not worrying about dealing with the exterior. 

I am single and eventually would like to find a significant other but given how much work &amp; music I do right now it’s not first on my priority list. I like the idea of having my own place do work &amp; do my music. 

I do see myself traveling as much as possible once Covid lets up. Whether it be for touring or just to see what I want to see so a condo sounds like a positive when it comes to that

I saw that you don’t need to be putting 20% down, granted i don’t have that. Houses/townhomes I’m looking at right now are 250-290k. I want to have enough to make sure i can furnish my house which I’d assume is close to 10k or something . I was looking at townhomes because i wouldn’t have to do outside maintenance but the HOA fee is pretty high.

Here’s a couple questions I’d like to ask -

How much would I need to put down? Is 5% max ok?

What’s cheaper overall? A $250k townhome or house as far as insurance and HOA go? 

How much of my personal income should i be putting towards rent ? This is the biggest question .

Thank you all!",finance

Bio: ex-Paramedic and ex-British police medic. He was first hired by Bain to clean up the payday gangs mess they left. The first bank the gang ever robed wasn’t owned by the government but instead owned by a crime family called the Kavodski crime family, the reason why the gang never saw the family is because in 2 hours of the Kavodski’s hearing of the robbery they was all dead. Luckily there was no children in that family only a husband a wife and an army of hired guns.  The reason why he came out of the shadows is because Bain died and without Bain he isn’t getting paid so he decided to get more involved with the robberies.

Obviously paying the loan off and investing the money would be better spent, but the interest rate being so low, means keeping the loan open with a zero net position is better for us to add cars onto the loan?

personalfinance,New Job: Need help allocating savings,"Hi Everyone,

I'm 26y/o and I accepted a new job starting in a couple weeks and will see a jump in pay from $76k to $97k.  I previously put about 10% in my 401k with no real savings on the side (student loan payment is $800 per month).

With my new income, my first move is going to be refinancing my student loans after I get my first paycheck.  Currently at $800/month but was thinking of making the term 20 years at ~$400 per month (I have $63k in loans left)

My question is how should I allocate my savings after that?  I know from reading hear it's best to max 401k (which would be 18.5% of my paycheck), but what are PF's thoughts on just doing 12% and using that extra ~6k over the year to build up cash savings (currently at under $1k) and then investing the rest in a mix of non retirement tied ETFs and some cryptocurrency?

Saving for retirement is definitely a priority, but I don't want all my funds to be impossible to access until I'm at retirement age.

Also - if my student loan interest rate is low, should I just try to push it out to the longest period possible (with a slight increase in interest rate) so I can then have more cash to work with in investing?",finance

personalfinance,"Paying for College with High EFC, but Parents won’t Pay","Okay, so I’ll keep this question short and give context as fast as I can.  

Basically, my mother is the COO (Chief Operations Officer) of a very successful credit union, and as a result she makes...a lot of money. 
So much money, in fact, that my EFC, or expected family contribution, for the FAFSA is over $35,000. This would cover all of tuition and room and board for an entire year almost twice. It’s a lot. And as a result, the FAFSA guarantees me little to no financial assistance, because of just how much my mother makes.  

The kicker to this plan? She has no intentions of paying anywhere NEAR that amount for my college education. And when I end up going to a college other than the one she’s been shilling for from the very start, there is a VERY high likelihood that she won’t support me at all.  

Now, I understand that it’s her money, and it’s her choice. I’m not gonna guilt trip her or make any moral judgements, because I’m just the one who would be leeching money from her. But the main question I have is, how do I tell my college and scholarship officials that that money just ISN’T what I have??  

Does that even qualify as any sort of financial need? Would I just put down “very high EFC so no federal assistance, but parents will not be paying any of it, so no assistance from them either”?  

It’s stressing me the hell out, and I’m more than likely going to have to work my ass off during my undergrad regardless.

personalfinance,Purchasing a home with an SO (unmarried),"For some quick background, I've been with my SO for a little over 5 years with plans to eventually get married in the next couple years. I've been considering buying a home for awhile as I've managed to save up a reasonable downpayment, and with our apartment lease up soon and interest rates as low as they are, now seems like the right time to buy. While my SO makes decent money, he unfortunately is not in the same position with his savings and likely couldn't afford to go in on it with me. I'm also hesitant to make a purchase together prior to marriage in fear of complicating assets should the worst case scenario happen.

Given our situation, I've been contemplating going ahead with a purchase if I find the right place. Since we're not married, I would take sole ownership and have my SO contribute as a ""tenant."" A few questions on this:

1. Is this the correct strategy to take with our pre-marital status if I'm in the position to buy? 
2. Once we do get married, how will ownership be affected? Would I put him on the deed as a shared owner? 
3. If we do decide to share the property once we're married, how does it work with the downpayment and mortgage contributions made pre-marriage? Is there such a thing as a ""majority"" owner for home real estate?

personalfinance,"PVIF, PVIFA and deciding what age to take SS","Assume a 62 year old white male earning more than $100,000 per year in 2020, he has to decide whether to take a lesser amount of SS now or wait 4 years (age 66 in 2024) to get his full payment.

As a white male in the top half of income distribution he can expect to live until age 86. (“Trends in Mortality Differentials and Life Expectancy for Male Social Security Covered Workers, by Socioeconomic Status,” Social Security Bulletin, vol. 67, no. 3 (2007), Chart 3).

(Note: the differences in life expectancy among income groups and race is appalling, but that is another discussion)

So if he retires now he can expect to enjoy 24 years of retirement, and if he waits until full SS payments at 66 he can expect 20 years of retirement. 

Using round numbers, his SS disbursement at 66 is $3,000 per month ($36,000 per year).  At age 62 the amount is about 75% of this or $2,250 per month ($27,000 per year).  This is a difference of $750 monthly ($9,000 annually).

Using a 4% interest rate (for government distributions) applied to 20 years at age 66 and 24 years at age 62, the PVIFA are 13.5903 and 15.2470 respectively.

So the $36,000 annually at age 66 is equal to $489,251 in 2024 dollars, while the $27,000 annually at age 62 is equal to $411,669 in 2020 dollars.

But for an apples to apples comparison, we need to equate the 2024 value in 2020 dollars.  Again, using 4% for government distributions, the PVIF of this amount 4 years hence is 0.8548.  This reduces the present value of the age 66 retirement to only $418,212.

Though this is still about $6,500 in present dollars more than the age 62 retirement, the difference (only 1.6%) is not so great (especially over two decades).  Assuming that I did the math right, can we conclude that it really doesn't make much difference whether he retires at age 62 or 66?",finance

BCH is on the edge of epic bull run.

A lot of people are now tempted to spend bch. If you believe the price of bch will go up more than the interest rate you are paying to crypto lenders, then it might be a viable idea to put bch as collateral, borrow fiat against bch and purchase some BS.

When the masses are rushing into bch, then use a part of the collateral and repay the loan. Thus, instead of spending 1 bch today, by this method you might end up needing only 0.001 bch in 1 year. That's called deflation. Your purchasing power goes up instead of down over time.",cryptocurrency

* I made about $50K doing freelance consulting work this year
* I expect to deduct $30K of that to business/start up expenses, leaving $20K in taxable income
* I have $51K in a traditional IRA and $91K in a 401K which I would like to roll over into a Roth IRA. I have another \~$200K in a 401K from another employer, but I intend on leaving that lone for now

Fancy models aside, the quickest way to “price” BTC is to think about what it could replace. 

Gold’s market capitalization is $9 Trillion. Divided by 20 million bitcoin to make math easy/to account for lost coins, we see that if Bitcoin were to replace gold each BTC would be worth $450,000.

The Fed’s Balance sheet is $7.2 Trillion, or $360,000 per BTC. ([https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst\_recenttrends.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm))

World governments currently hold 12 Trillion in currency reserves. If 5% were in bitcoin, that’s $30,000 per BTC. If the reserves are 100% in BTC, that is $600,000 per BTC.

The US national debt is $27.5 Trillion, or $1,375,000 per BTC. A quick note, this means the US government owes more money than the entire country produces in a year. Literally, a 100% taxation rate for a year would not eliminate our debt. ([https://www.usdebtclock.org/](https://www.usdebtclock.org/))

Interestingly emerging markets and developing economies have a total GDP of $75 trillion, or $3,750,000 per BTC. It is important to note here that this means the developing countries currently have more wealth than the established ones, and this is where BTC is seeing the most use. Bitcoin representing 10% of all transactions would be a price of $375,000 per BTC.

Total World Gross Product is $130 Trillion, or $6,500,000 per BTC. If you think that 25% of the world economy will one day be transacted in BTC, that is $1,625,000 per BTC.

Total Global Debt is $277 Trillion, or $13,850,000 per BTC, if you believe in the future all debt will be denominated in BTC just like foreign debt is often denominated in US Dollars.

Anything that is left over after all of our expenses, we save into our HYSA. 

Debt/Expenses

I currently have a mortgage for a townhouse in just my name for $225,000 with an interest rate of 4.35% and a monthly payment of $1,310 that includes taxes and insurance (no PMI). Student loans are $45,000 with a usual interest rate of 7.65% and a payment of $500 a month (right now no payment is due and interest rates are 0% because of covid). He has a car loan of $20,000 with an interest rate of 2.99% and a monthly payment of $330. Car insurance for both of us is $240 per month. Energy is $60 per month, water/trash is $55, internet is $45, and HOA is $120. All of our other expenses per month are groceries $200, restaurants $75, phones $100, subscriptions $30, gas $120, miscellaneous $100 (but varies). All of these expenses are put on our credit cards and paid in full before the due date.

I feel like we are doing alright but am positive there is something else we can do to make ourselves more financially responsible.  So what other advice would we benefit from?? Thanks for your help in advance!!!",finance
investing,How are we feeling about the metal markets?,"So my thinking is that gold, silver, nickel etc have had good years (think 30% gains), but have been struggling recently. Top cryptos have gained 200%+ and are seeing the most hype since the 2016 bubble. The way I see it, the fundamentals that have cause the crypto run up are bullish signs for traditional metals as well (inflation). So, if we see a short term correction (thinking 20% or maybe even bigger), traditional metals will go way higher cause the fed is still printing money regardless. Thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,Roth IRA Conversion from Employer Sponsored Plan,"My employer sponsors a SIMPLE IRA plan, 3% match. I have been contributing up to the match limit for several years. Unfortunately the plan advisor is useless, and the money has been sitting in Money Market the entire time. So I'm considering rolling over to a Roth.

I'm mid 30's, AGI $65k. The IRA distribution amount would be around $20k. If I convert this year it should result in break even on Fed taxes (expecting a \~$2500 refund). My questions are..

1. In the IRA rollover FAQ, it says that 'Withdrawals electing out of automatic contribution arrangements' cannot be rolled over. At first glance I take this to mean the automatic paycheck deferrals to IRA? However it seems like that would be too common to be excluded.
2. To apply to the tax year 2020, I would need to take the distribution by Dec 31 correct? Would there be any implication if I take the distribution in 2020 but deposited to Roth in 2021? (Within the 60 day window)
3. I'm looking at purchasing a home, and may take advantage of the penalty free distribution for first time homebuyer. Would the Roth conversion cause any issues with that?
4. At the moment I can't contribute much additional to retirement plan. Perhaps $2K a year max. Should I consider a yearly rollover from SIMPLE to Roth?

personalfinance,Student financing options,"Hey Guys, I hope someone could give me some advice on a topic. 
I’m a student in my senior year of college. So far I’ve been lucky enough to finance my school through scholarships, and thus far I have about 10k in federal student loan debt. This semester I had to move off campus due to Corona. The school scholarship plus the federal subsidized loans covered about 8 months of rent. I am in a major metropolitan city, with 2 roommates (3 total including myself) paying for rent. 
Returning home was not an option for me. 
My issue is that the scholarship plus the federal subsidized loans only cover 8 months of my rent. I applied for more loans but the school won’t certify rent expenses for the months that school is not in session. 
I have a job lined up post grad, expecting to make around 60k a year (accounting). 
I can not get traditional student loans because the school won’t certify the rent cost as a valid school expense. I could not get a lease for less than a year. 
What are my financing options ? I need about $3k to pay the last of the rent. What would you recommend? I am confident that I will be able to repay the loans after graduation. What would you suggest? Personal loans? 
This might be an obvious question but I come from immigrant parents and they never taught me about these things.

* 5 yrs @ 4% payoff 12/2024 - $14,247 balance
* 5 yrs @ 4% payoff 12/2024 - $1,592 balance

My retirement account ($170k currently) has seen tremendous growth since I switched to a more aggressive investment strategy back in March 2020. I am 36 and do the required contribution of 6% and my employer matches 10% of my salary ($121k). I am thinking of taking out a personal loan to pay this off, as I feel I would get a better return with the money being invested vs paying myself 4% interest.


I pre-qualified with SOFI for $22,500 @ 5.99% interest rate/36 months/ $684 payment. My husband and I will be combining incomes next month, as we want to increase our emergency fund (currently $10k) to $45k by the end of 2021 and then move on to start saving more for our 3 children's college savings and additional retirement savings. We bring in combined roughly $10,700 net, if his OT continues and regular expenses which includes the 401k repayment of $7,000 (mortgage/debt/monthly expenses). The difference would go to sinking/emergency savings as well as various 0% promotional APR balances that will be expiring over the next several months.


Does it make sense to takeout the personal loan to put the $26k back into my retirement account for active investing? Or should I just continue with making payment and eventually pay additional once we reach our emergency savings goal of $45k.

Congress reached a deal Sunday on a $900 billion coronavirus relief package, according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Lawmakers will move to vote on the proposal, along with a full-year government spending bill, as soon as Sunday night.
Millions of Americans have awaited aid for months as Congress failed to agree on another plan to boost a health-care system and economy buckling under the weight of the pandemic.

Congress reached a deal Sunday on a $900 billion coronavirus relief package, a long-delayed effort to boost an American health-care system and economy buckling under the weight of the pandemic.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced the agreement on a pandemic aid and full-year government spending bill. He did not delve into many details. Congressional leaders have not yet released text of the more than $2 trillion legislation, which they hope to pass in the coming hours.

The agreement follows months of sniping on Capitol Hill over how best to fight a once-in-a-century crisis. A new round of aid cannot come soon enough for the millions of Americans who have tried to scrape together enough money to afford food and housing.

The $900 billion coronavirus relief plan under negotiation on Capitol Hill was set to include direct payments of $600 to many adults. Some families were also expected to get $600 per child.

The proposal was set to put at least $300 billion into small business assistance including Paycheck Protection Program loans. It would also add a $300 federal unemployment supplement and temporarily keep in place pandemic-era programs that expanded unemployment insurance eligibility.

If those provisions expire the day after Christmas, 12 million people will lose unemployment benefits.

The measure was also set to put critical funding into the distribution of the two FDA-approved Covid-19 vaccines. Health-care workers and top government officials have started to receive shots, and widespread inoculation in the coming months will help the world to emerge from the pandemic’s shadow.

The rescue package was also set to send relief to hospitals, many of which have struggled to keep up with a flood of Covid-19 patients. It was also expected to put new money into education and transportation.

As lawmakers finally reach a deal, the help comes too late for the nearly 8 million people estimated to have fallen into poverty since June. Many in Congress say the proposal will not go nearly far enough to address the scope of the health and economic crisis.

Progressives and some Republicans have pushed for larger direct payments and retroactive federal unemployment payments. A $600 weekly supplement that buoyed millions of jobless Americans in the early months of the pandemic expired over the summer, and it took Congress months to agree to reinstate it.",finance

personalfinance,[US] Removing hard credit inquiries for mortgage when credit union took too long?,"I did a refinance this year with everyone else due to low interest rates.

In the process, my credit union (mortgage lender I went with) took over 4 months from start to finish --- and near the end, said they needed to do _another_ hard credit pull to finalize the loan because they had taken so long. I asked if they'd assist in getting it removed afterwards since it's their fault (they declined), I said ""sure"" anyways to not hold up the refinance process, they pulled a second report and finished the refinance.

Now I've got a group of hard credit pulls in July (rate shopping) and this latest one from a few weeks ago.

It's a ""legitimate"" credit pull in that it was from my lender and authorized by me, but it also feels not particularly legitimate or relevant to be on my credit report since it's a second pull for the exact same loan that simply took too long from my lender. Do I have any chance of getting it removed if I go through the ""credit inquiry removal letter"" path? Or should I just suck it up and move on?

I have strong enough credit that I'm not particularly concerned that it'll impact anything for me meaningfully, but it's annoying enough that I'd like to fix it if it's reasonably possible.",finance
personalfinance,Should I renew my lease or move back home?,"Okay so I have never posted anything like this before and I am trying to get as much information as I can. I will also be as blunt and honest too, and I'm trying to make the most sound financial decisions as I can at the moment. I moved from a suburban town near Chicago to a much smaller town (Moline) to finish up my undergraduate degree at WIU at their new Quad Cities campus. I had moved out of my parents house (again) when I moved back home after doing my time in the military (go Chair Force). I am currently 34, male and live by myself. Initially, when I moved into my apartment I had my doggo come with. Now this building and the ownership had stated that it was not pet friendly, however they had made an exception for him since my dog was very well behaved. Well not more than a few weeks later, they had unfortunately had to tell me that my dog or I had to go as there are some tenants that are (allegedly) deathly allergic to dogs and they said either my dog needs to go or I do. To be clear, they were not in anyway mad at me and I hold no ill will towards them either. They fully refunded my pet deposit ($1,000) and gave me the option to terminate my lease at any point (within 30 days notice) and they will not penalize me and return my security deposit as well ($1,100). So now here is the tricky part. Initially when I first moved here, I was projecting to graduate by December of 2020, but then 'rona struck and basically forced me to drop a ton of classes. So now my projected graduation date is now December of 2023. I have no student loans, and as of writing this will be using the remainder of my Post 9/11 G.I. Bill (3 mo/21 days remaining). The GI bill has a clause that allows tuition to be paid in full for the whole semester, despite me having only 3/4 of it for the semester remaining. I will only be getting paid the BAH amount/month of 3 mo/21 days instead. The remaining amount left for school will be paid using the Illinois Veterans Grant. So the question being posed is this: My lease is up in May of 2021. Should I renew my lease for an additional 24 months or move back in, save some money and ????

Car - $750 (I plan on refinancing this ASAP)

Insurance $180

Internet - $96.99

Hulu - $82 (cable package is actually a legit value IMO)

Upgrade - $116 (debt consolidation loan, will go up after 1/2021 - requested hardship cause rona)

Credit Cards $300 / $500 / $5000 (Currently paying minimums on these and will throw whatever I can to the highest interest rate one (19% I believe?) on the 5k one, which unfortunately is maxed out. Usually $25/25/150)

After bills I usually have about +/- $800 remaining, which usually goes towards food or gas. Utilities are included in rent as this building is old af and is considered ""historic"" so there's only so much renovations that can be done. Unfortunately, they leak air like a seive so they throw in utilities as a benefit.

I do anticipate on paying off my credit cards as soon as possible to (1) avoid paying more interest than I need to and (2) I would like to refinance my Jeep as I love the car and will drive this expensive af car till the wheels fall off it or it explodes...whichever comes first. There are a few various miscellaneous financial things that will work towards my benefit but I will pretend they are not here till they actually are (looking at you second stimulus.....)

personalfinance,Looking for advice on possible options for Parent Plus loan forgiveness and/or refinance approaches,"Hello everyone!

I'm posting variations of this on a couple of different subs to hopefully get a good range of responses.

TLDR;

Have a parent plus loan that I am looking for options to possibly have it forgiven, before I attempt to refinance, but also looking for advice on ways to refinance.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I wanted to include as much detail as possible. I am really overwhelmed about where to start and trying to navigate the legal landscape and avoid the numerous scams that are out there.

I have recently found myself motivated to find where I can save costs in my finances, and was hoping to get some insight or feedback that might help with my student loan situation. I was young and simply ignored the truth of taking out a loan like this and what it actually meant financially until now. Admittedly, I am ashamed it took me this long to take a serious look at doing something about it, but here I am.

I understand that I took out the loans and should have been responsible enough to understand what that entailed, but I was young, gullible, and quite frankly misled by a system that absolutely should not have been allowed to operate this way. That said, I am looking for advice and insight into any ways that I could possibly still get this loan forgiven based on the information provided below. I am currently looking into refinance options to lower the interest rate and get the loan under my name instead of my father’s (God forbid something happens to me and he is stuck paying off the balance).

In the case of refinancing I'm looking at some of these options:

* Using my 401k to pay off the balance
* Refinance my mortgage and roll the student loan into that
* Personal loan with lower interest rate
* Breaking into my emergency fund - something I'd rather not do.

The school was The Art Institutes International Minnesota.

Loan Details (Not including the smaller one that was under my name I have since paid off):

* Navient (Previously Sallie Mae) Parent Plus loan (FFELP) at 8.125% interest (Under my father’s name). I am still not clear if this is considered a private or federal loan.
* Original loan disbursement in 2007 was $45,000
* Now, 14 years later, the balance is at $36,000
* I’ve currently paid well over the original loan balance with less than $10,000 being put towards the principal.

The Art Institutes fraud and lawsuit:

* Closed a number of schools including the one I attended
* Lied about accreditation
* Misled my father and I about the parent plus loan. Ended up completely under his name and not under both with him as co-signer.
* Lied about job placement rates and active assistance after graduation was pretty much non-existent. I ended up finding a job in my field on my own.

From my understanding I do not qualify for the two main ways to discharge the loans.

1. The Borrower’s Defense Against Repayment Program - Not eligible because it is a Parent Plus loan.
2. The Closed School Student Loan Discharge Program - Not eligible because I graduated well before the school was closed.

In Summary:

If I continue the way things are currently, I will essentially end up paying well over six figures on a $45,000 loan for a school that was sued, lied, and is no longer open. Any advice in terms of loan forgiveness or good refinance options to look into are appreciated.

Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Deciding if refinancing is worth it,"Background information:  I bought my house at the very end of 2007.  Because of my wife's and my top credit scores, the bank offered us a 75-25 split on the mortgage so that we didn't have to pay PMI.

Then the 2008 recession happened, rates dropped, and stayed low long enough that we decided to refinance the two loans in the 2011/12 time frame.

Current balances:  mortgage 1, just over 71K.  22 years left on a 30-year term.  Mortgage 2, just under 13K.  Five years left on a 15-year term.  Bank's website is inaccessible right now so I'm unable to confirm interest rates, but my memory says it's sitting around four percent.

Age:  46 (spouse, 45).   Household income slightly over 100K.

Rates today appear to be lower still and we are considering the possibility of refinancing a second time.  Specifically, my spouse has suggested that since we've paid off more than twenty percent of our initial principal, that there's no reason necessarily to continue with two payments anymore.  If we combine them into a single payment, starting up a new 15-year term, we're wondering if that would be advantageous, or if it would be more drawback than not.

What are the questions to ask, or things to look out for, as we approach the bank with this application?

I know that refinancing the first mortgage from 22 years down to 15 would increase the payment for that piece, but (depending on the interest rate) might be compensated by the increase on the second mortgage from 5 years back *up* to 15.  The other side of that, I kind of like the idea of having one less bill to pay once the second mortgage is paid off.

stocks,Post-pandemic stock increase?,"I am recently new to trading, so i'm a bit of a rookie in the game. I've come up with some general ideas of what industries could posinly boom after the pandemic ends and the economy recovers. I'd like to become a generally more long-term stock investor, not a penny trader or day trader. But i'd like to hear any opinions or criticisms on my ideas:

Tourism. I know that investing in tourism is a generally risky industry. Airline and cruise holdings plummeted when lockdown was put into effect and the pandemic really spread. Royal Carribbean stock plummeted 30 dollars, and airlines crashed. However, is it a good idea to buy now when they're cheap and down, and after pandemic, when demand for visiting, vacations, and business trips increases due to a prolonged amount of time of that being unavailable, the stock goes up, and i've made a profit. 

Pharmaceuticals. I've already put some money into pfizer and Biontech shares. There's been discussion amongst online news journals discussing whether Biontech and Pfizer stock is a buy. A vaccine is obviously gonna be in demand. But, to my knowledge, most countries are going to buy the vaccine with federal funds. So, is this going to improve stock? If so, it might be a good idea to invest in Moderna as well. I'd like to hear thoughts on this one.

As a new stock trader, are there any industries that will boom after quarantine? There's certainly gonna be a resurgence in the economy, or at the very least, a general growth after the pandemic is resolved. So i'm wondering if any stock might see a rapid growth due to being unavailable in quarantine. Also, please provide me some tips about trading, i'm a young a fresh dude who's interested in it.

personalfinance,Can we buy a car?,"Basically me and my wife want to buy a car, and I want the fine thoughts of reddit people to let is know if that seems financially wise. I know we CAN but not sure if it is a good idea. First a overall view of our finances I suppose.

Monthly Spending=2000

Monthly take-home=5,800

Current assets= 2k ish checking account buffer

Emergency= 6k

Debts: vehicle 1 2.7 owed at 5.4%. Value around 4k  (Vehicle 2 owned. )

That is a pretty clear picture of what we have currently (excluding retirement accounts). Low savings but that is quickly building, as we were both new grads and well getting married, moving, etc. There were a lot of expenses in the beginning, and our income just went up significantly. 

So vehicle one is a pain, lots of issues, and frankly unpleasant. I have a commute and really want something that doesn't keep having issues making getting to work a pain. I would like to spend around 15k and some nice used car (mid 2010s)

The caveat is we are planning on our income dropping to about 3000 a month in 2 years, I will be going back to school. So I do not want to be in a place where that is an issue in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to wait about a month, then trade in vehicle one (should cover the loan amount) and then put down about 3k. I realize I could wait and buy cash and maybe I should but with interest rates being so low (800 FICO) I struggle with if that really makes sense. And to be frank, I do not like this car, and damping it 6 months prior is appealing.

I’m pretty new to taxes and this will be the first year I don’t use a CPA. In 2019, I received a stock inheritance so I paid a large amount of taxes on my capital gains on my 2019 Tax Return. I haven’t paid any quarterly taxes in 2020 yet but I do pay roughly $850 per month in federal taxes from my employer. For the 2019 Tax Return, I paid roughly $7,500 to the IRS. 

My question is, does the IRS have a support number for me to figure out how much I would owe? If I choose to just accept the penalty during the 2020 Tax Return, will TurboTax help me figure the correct amount I owe? 

Any advice would be appreciated.",finance
investing,What I am doing and why,"I have been trading since March. I got into stocks after 2 years of investing in collectables in markets were you could go to zero in less then 30 days and liquidity was a nightmare. A 30% crash at worst seemed like a dream vacation. I read a lot of Warren Buffet, Prof Malcom and did all the TD ameritrade courses and watched about 200 hrs of youtubers, cnbc and listen to quite a few investing/trading books on Audible. I am a Jim Craimer fan and follow action alerts.

 My initial portfolio consisted of SPY Growth and consumer discretionary ETF at 75% and single stocks for the remaining 25%. Beta and sharp was decent and my single stocks I sild at 20-30% gains or cut losses at 10%. I made 25% since march but wasn't fully invested until around October. 

 The spyG was for Fang and margin of error while having some drawdown protection if I missed a trend shift. I used it as a fundraiser to repotion my portfolio for the reopening trade/rotation. I got this wrong 3 times but hit most of NOV move because there was a lot of shared volumes in both side of the "" reopen/covid"" bifurcation in the ETF and some of my single stcoks were Hybrids like MRVL. But SPYG is underperforming relative to value, or at least soon in my estimation so I will replace incrementally towards small cap value ETF to capture earnings growth in 2021 and have been in XLF and XLI incrementally for the last few months as a low beta way to capture recovery and resultant rise in interest rates.

 Single stocks are : Ford, GM- cheap EV exposure with tailwinds from corona cyclicality and non-cyclical EV and assumed increase in discretionary spending as our Economy improves.

 MRVL- Five g with a data center kicker, 21 pe seems cheap and M&amp;A looks accretive

MGM- Value as opposed to Wynn. Pent up demand all over the place. A clear vaccine play as travel improves.

Simon Properties- Safish dividend, Increased market share and possible retail exposure ( they are buying all the failing anchor stores in malls) Better deal on Taubam then exspected and JC pennies for dirt cheap. Again Pent up demand and vaccine play

Dis- Pure reopen play with Netflix kicker. I cannot think of a better way to capture pent up demand while diversifying in a single stock. Parks-check, Theatres-check. Cruise lines-check. Cash on hand-check, history of stability- check The mouse, seriously got to respect that rodent.

GE- Played it as a trade and made 20 each time.. nt sure what to do with it up 11%. I like wind buisness and healthcare. The fact they went cash flow positive last quarter is nice.

Polkadot,ELI5: Where do the staking rewards (interest rate) come from?,"I'm having a hard time grasping where the staking rewards come from? and how it ties to the polkadot's inflation rate?

I understand that polkadot has a current inflation rate of 10% in the first year. When polkadot first came out, the staking rewards was as [high as 65%](https://swiss-staking.medium.com/polkadot-inflation-staking-reward-4ea753380e0e) (when only 5% of DOTs were staked). If only 10% are newly created (due to inflation), where do the other 55% of rewards come from? Transaction fees? That seems like very high transaction fees. Even at 20% staking rewards (with 10% inflation rate), that still remains 10% in transaction fees?

Bonus question: What happens when staking rewards drops below 10%? Does that mean you're  not keeping up with inflation?",cryptocurrency

stocks,Tesla Joins SP500 | Nike Blowout Earnings |Stimulus Deal News| Stock Market News- Crash Today? [12-21],"**The stimulus package is finally here. Tesla enters the SP500 while Nike posts blowout earnings. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday, as we saw all 3 big indexes finishing down for the day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/vh3NzhK) losing more than 0.4% falling as lawmakers continued to [struggle](https://ibb.co/mcHVyNh) on the stimulus bill, but finishing half a percent up for the week, the SP500 losing 0.35% but rising by 1.4% for the week and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/sCNjHGy) only down 0.07% while posting a huge 3% gain for the week. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/HpF7kz2) dropping again more than 1.6% on Friday and finishing almost 7.5% down for the [week](https://ibb.co/j3CzN3m).

We saw a massive day of trading on [Friday](https://ibb.co/72Q668L) with almost 80% of the companies trading above average volume, as it was quadruple witching day, and people had to move a lot of stocks to make room for the Tesla SP500 inclusion, but most companies lost ground despite this huge volume with the biggest losers being the Real estate and Energy sectors, losing around 1.7% for the day, while there were only a few [sectors](https://ibb.co/cwsj2b2) that had small gains with Materials leading the way in a late rally, as value plays suffered while growth companies were gaining on [Friday](https://ibb.co/gjvKvP8).

Here is the HEAT MAP from [FRIDAY](https://ibb.co/5nhchr6), mostly RED as you can see, with INTEL losing more than 6% after the Microsoft [news](https://ibb.co/gM5F1kF), while Tesla spiked in the closing moments almost 6% after trading down in the last hours of the day.

For the week though, this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y0tPpHR) shows that most companies were gaining significant ground, with the biggest companies in the world Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft being up significantly for the week, while Google which was hit by several outages and a couple of antitrust lawsuits was trading down. We also saw the Energy sector doing pretty bad for the week with most of the companies losing ground, while Tesla was the biggest gainer heading into the SP500 inclusion.

We also got some economic data, that showed the November leading [INDICATORS](https://ibb.co/Q6dkKVd) up 0.6% to 109.1, better than expected with manufacturing orders, residential construction permits and initial claims for unemployment insurance moving the number higher.

While the Q3 account [deficit](https://ibb.co/4mbJCtK) widened by more than $17B but was better than the $24B widening expected by analysts, as the gap was reflected by the increasing goods deficit.

[Here](https://ibb.co/3smh0PD) are the most interesting economic events and data scheduled for the short week of trading with most of the important stuff coming on Wednesday and Thursday.

We also do not have many [earnings](https://ibb.co/DgC3MX4) reports this week, with the only company that I am watching being CarMax to see how the red-hot second-hand car market is keeping up. These results could also see other names like Carvana move up or down.

So, Friday was the last day of trading before [Tesla](https://ibb.co/SNkQLpT) will be a part of the SP500 and this saw the stock surge another 6% to a record high, as the company is up 70% since the news came out. The stock was trading lower towards the end of the day on about 80-90M volume, before a late spike pushed by the index buying saw the volume pop to an incredible 222M with 47M in after-hours [trading](https://ibb.co/6ByprLp). Expect the stock to have a slight pullback in the short-term, as profits will start to be taken from this huge run, especially after the year ends, as people may wait out the profit-taking to avoid tax implications until next year. Tesla is currently down 4% in pre-market [trading](https://ibb.co/hyvK6wt) already, as there are not a lot of people left to buy this company now.

We also received [news](https://ibb.co/CJPVyMS) late on Friday, that the FDA formally approved the Moderna vaccine and that it will start shipping this week. Moderna is expected to deliver around 20M doses by the end of the year in the US, with the European Union also [expected](https://ibb.co/v3tqMsJ) to rollout the Pfizer vaccine starting after Christmas.

Meanwhile, the only big earnings report that came in on Friday was from [Nike](https://ibb.co/yWrnZqX), as the company crushed earnings, with a beat of 16 cents, up 11% and a revenue beat of $730M also up 9%. Gross margins also improved with Nike direct-to-consumer sales better than expected, as Nike brand digital sales jumped 84% in FQ2 more than the 82% increase in FQ1 with the company setting a target of 50% of the total sales to be made online in the foreseeable future. The company also noted that the revenue will likely be better than previously expected, which helped push the stock more than 4% higher in after-hours.

We also got a [report](https://ibb.co/8XZrT3Z) from a Morgan Stanley analyst who expected the iPhone to outperform expectations in China based on data through November. I also expect this to be true, and expect Apple to continue to have a significant growth as the 5G cycle will pick up steam in the next years.

In some other stock market news, [Microsoft](https://ibb.co/gM5F1kF) is reported to be working on their in-house chips for its cloud servers and Surface PCs. This would be another hit to Intel who still holds the biggest market share in the server chip sector, after the recent news of Apple working on its in-house chips for the Macs.

We also saw the whole bank sector trading significantly higher in after-hours, after the [FED](https://ibb.co/SKk85Xf) announced they will allow them to start buying back shares. This news came after the results of the FED’s second bank stress test in 2020, as all firms remained above minimum capital requirements after taking hypothetical losses. With [Citigroup](https://ibb.co/y0dhzfn) planning to restart stock purchases and pay quarterly dividends, [Morgan Stanley](https://ibb.co/pjMFC5R) already authorizing $10B in buybacks and [JP MORGAN](https://ibb.co/0mFZr0m) signing off on a huge $30B buyback program after the FED decision.

Let’s hope for a recovery in the market as the [futures](https://ibb.co/L0yZqwB) seem to be pointing at a very bad open after the most recent [news](https://ibb.co/M5wJcY6) from Europe, which shows a new strain of the virus believed to have a more than 70% increased transmissibility, but we shouldn’t worry at the moment, as there is no evidence that it has worse symptoms, outcomes or that it isn’t affected by the vaccines just approved from Pfizer &amp; Moderna.

Maybe after Congress votes today, as the Congress is [expected](https://ibb.co/x10zj57) to vote on a $900B aid package today, the second biggest in history, with Trump also supporting the bill, which will provide $600 direct payments to individuals and a $300/week in boosted unemployment benefits, with money also included for small businesses, food assistance, vaccine distribution and more. The bill is also expected to extend the moratorium on foreclosures and provide $25B in rental aids while also giving support to the [airlines](https://ibb.co/0ZP1YQV) with more than $15B to reinstate payroll reimbursements. 

My belief is that the market was poised for a healthy correction, but I don’t think this is a long-term problem for the stock market.

MachineLearning,[N] Montreal-based Element AI sold for $230-million as founders saw value mostly wiped out,"According to [Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-element-ai-sold-for-230-million-as-founders-saw-value-wiped-out/) article:

**Element AI sold for $230-million as founders saw value mostly wiped out, document reveals**

Montreal startup Element AI Inc. was running out of money and options when it inked a deal last month to sell itself for US$230-milion to Silicon Valley software company ServiceNow Inc., a confidential document obtained by the Globe and Mail reveals.

Materials sent to Element AI shareholders Friday reveal that while many of its institutional shareholders will make most if not all of their money back from backing two venture financings, employees will not fare nearly as well. Many have been terminated and had their stock options cancelled.

Also losing out are co-founders Jean-François Gagné, the CEO, his wife Anne Martel, the chief administrative officer, chief science officer Nick Chapados and **Yoshua Bengio**, the University of Montreal professor known as a godfather of “deep learning,” the foundational science behind today’s AI revolution.

Between them, they owned 8.8 million common shares, whose value has been wiped out with the takeover, which goes to a shareholder vote Dec 29 with enough investor support already locked up to pass before the takeover goes to a Canadian court to approve a plan of arrangement with ServiceNow. The quartet also owns preferred shares worth less than US$300,000 combined under the terms of the deal.

The shareholder document, a management proxy circular, provides a rare look inside efforts by a highly hyped but deeply troubled startup as it struggled to secure financing at the same time as it was failing to live up to its early promises.

The circular states the US$230-million purchase price is subject to some adjustments and expenses which could bring the final price down to US$195-million.

The sale is a disappointing outcome for a company that burst onto the Canadian tech scene four years ago like few others, promising to deliver AI-powered operational improvements to a range of industries and anchor a thriving domestic AI sector. Element AI became the self-appointed representative of Canada’s AI sector, lobbying politicians and officials and landing numerous photo ops with them, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. It also secured $25-million in federal funding – $20-million of which was committed earlier this year and cancelled by the government with the ServiceNow takeover.

Element AI invested heavily in hype and and earned international renown, largely due to its association with Dr. Bengio. It raised US$102-million in venture capital in 2017 just nine months after its founding, an unheard of amount for a new Canadian company, from international backers including Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp., Nvidia Corp., Tencent Holdings Ltd., Fidelity Investments, a Singaporean sovereign wealth fund and venture capital firms.

Element AI went on a hiring spree to establish what the founders called “supercredibility,” recruiting top AI talent in Canada and abroad. It opened global offices, including a British operation that did pro bono work to deliver “AI for good,” and its ranks swelled to 500 people.

But the swift hiring and attention-seeking were at odds with its success in actually building a software business. Element AI took two years to focus on product development after initially pursuing consulting gigs. It came into 2019 with a plan to bring several AI-based products to market, including a cybersecurity offering for financial institutions and a program to help port operators predict waiting times for truck drivers.

It was also quietly shopping itself around. In December 2018, the company asked financial adviser Allen &amp; Co LLC to find a potential buyer, in addition to pursuing a private placement, the circular reveals.

But Element AI struggled to advance proofs-of-concept work to marketable products. Several client partnerships faltered in 2019 and 2020.

Element did manage to reach terms for a US$151.4-million ($200-million) venture financing in September, 2019 led by the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec and backed by the Quebec government and consulting giant McKinsey and Co. However, the circular reveals the company only received the first tranche of the financing – roughly half of the amount – at the time, and that it had to meet unspecified conditions to get the rest. A fairness opinion by Deloitte commissioned as part of the sale process estimated Element AI’s enterprises value at just US$76-million around the time of the 2019 financing, shrinking to US$45-million this year.

“However, the conditions precedent the closing of the second tranche … were not going to be met in a timely manner,” the circular reads. It states “new terms were proposed” for a round of financing that would give incoming investors ranking ahead of others and a cumulative dividend of 12 per cent on invested capital and impose “other operating and governance constraints and limitations on the company.” Management instead decided to pursue a sale, and Allen contacted prospective buyers in June.

As talks narrowed this past summer to exclusive negotiations with ServiceNow, “the company’s liquidity was diminishing as sources of capital on acceptable terms were scarce,” the circular reads. By late November, it was generating revenue at an annualized rate of just $10-million to $12-million, Deloitte said.

As part of the deal – which will see ServiceNow keep Element AI’s research scientists and patents and effectively abandon its business – the buyer has agreed to pay US$10-million to key employees and consultants including Mr. Gagne and Dr. Bengio as part of a retention plan. The Caisse and Quebec government will get US$35.45-million and US$11.8-million, respectively, roughly the amount they invested in the first tranche of the 2019 financing.",technology

personalfinance,Student Loans and House Savings,"I'm currently in a very fortunate position where I'm able to save about $4500 a month due to having basically no monthly expenses except for $165 in student loans. I'm trying to save up to buy a house and have money left over. Currently I have $25k in savings, not including the $4.5k I plan to add at the end of December when I get paid.

I want to have $25k for a down payment/closing costs. Everything else is general savings. I might need to get a car for my wife, about $8k, but that's still up in the air. We plan on getting a house built starting late spring and moving in by the end of the year. Meaning there will be credit checks, income verification, and DTI calculations being run all the way up until the end of the year. By the time we start the process I'm looking at a total of 40-45k saved. I should be able to continue saving to a lesser degree, but I'm not specifically banking on it since I'm not sure how my financial situation will change at that point.

I have federal and private student loans. The federal loans are not a concern (15.5k, low interest, currently in in school deferment but I pay the interest off). I have 2 private loans: 12.6k @ 9.44% and 5.3k @ 6.8%. Currently on SCRA so they're dropped to 5.75%, but that will be over within 6 months.

I know mathematically it makes the most sense to just outright pay off the highest interest student loan. However, in the context of qualifying for the best mortgage terms, does it makes sense? It will lower my DTI because it would eliminate about $150/month in student loan payments at the full interest rate, but it will decrease my available savings by about $13k. Is this trade off worth it? Or should I pay the extra interest for another year and then pay it off with the extra savings after getting the house?",finance

personalfinance,Compound interest formula,"The formula for periodic interest compounded over a shorter period (like APR compounded monthly) is generally taught to be

*P*(*t*) = *P*(0) \* (1 + *q*/*n*)*^(nt)*,

where *P*(*t*) is the principle after *t* periods, *q* is the interest rate, and *n* is the number of times the interest compounds in one period.

My issue is that this formula is clearly incorrect for *n* ≠ 1. Taylor expanding the binomial expression shows that the expression fairly accurate for small *q*, but has error on the order of *O*( (*n*\-1)*q*^(2)/2*n* ). So for 1% interest it's a decent approximation, resulting in 1.004% annual interest. But for larger rates, like a costly ""23% APR"" personal loan, you're actually paying 25.6% assuming the lender uses this formula.

This has always baffled me, and now has become important to me as I am calculating the relative benefits of different investments. **So my question is: do banks use this formula?** Or do they use the exact expression *P*(*t*) = *P*(0) \* (1 + *q*)*^(t/n)**?*

(I apologize for the aberrant asterisks in the formula, reddit's formatting parser seems to have some problems.)

Secondarily, I'm curious why one would use this rather opaque approximation when the actual expression is just as simple to punch into a calculator and easier to explain the form of. I'm aware that for most practical situations the use of the approximation amounts to a relatively small amount of money for any individual, but it just seems strange to teach and use this formula when the exact calculation is so straightforward.",finance

personalfinance,Debating on refinancing our home or purchasing something bigger while rates are low,"We've been in our house since August 2016. We purchased the home for $158k with effectively $0 down. The bank paid the down-payment in exchange for points, so we ended up with a 5.125% interest rate.

As things stand currently, we owe approximately $140k on the home, but with comps in the area, it's looking like an appraisal of $177-180k+ are not outside the realm of possibility. In my area, houses similar to mine are getting into bidding wars and going for significantly more than asking.

We recently got married, and have been debating on moving into something larger at around the $220k price point, using the equity from our current home as a down payment, and attempting to keep the monthly payments somewhat similar to what we pay now.

That said, we do have some other scattered debts that we'd like to start chipping away at as quickly as possible, and if a refinance could significantly drop our payments (by way of lower interest and PMI dropping off), it seems like that may be a better route.

Refinancing seems like the obvious choice, but if we do decide to move within the next year, I feel like the loss in equity and the headache of going through all the closing again would just set us back. What seems like the better play here?

*Edit*

A bit more detail on our current financial standing. Our gross household income is right around $145-150k a year, with the net being around $100k. For most purposes, I cover a majority of the shared expenses, and my net is around $75k.

My current required monthly expenditures (mortgage, software subs, car payments, insurance, student loans, medical bills, a personal loan, cable, cellphones, utilities, etc), are right around $3,800 a month. 

We don't necessarily *need* to move in a hurry, but with the influx of homes on the market and the lower rates, if we could slide into something nicer for more or less the same out of pocket, that almost seems to make sense as well.

Looks like my largest holdings are between the last 3 on this list anywhere from 20-30% of portfolio (ones with asterisk by them).

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are as follows:

Is my split between aggressive, growth &amp; growth+income a good decision?

The 5 investments listed, are these the correct ones to be in? Looks like i can pick and choose between about 20 others but there is little to no information on what they actually are or what they do.

Side note: I'm putting in $91.11 per each paycheck, this is just the needed amount for my company to match the most they will, they are putting is $71.15.

&amp;#x200B;

Background info:

I'm a 28 year old male.

My income is $50,000 pre tax.

I own a home.

I have 1 child.

I live in MN.

My fiance is a stay at home mom for the time being so money is fairly tight.

\---------------------------

I'm really trying to get myself set up for retirement. I have always been stingy with my spending but have never really seriously invested and with age i am seeing how much of a waste money sitting in the bank is vs investing. I'm looking at getting more involved in the stock market but want to get my 401K squared away before I do. I have $20k in the bank and want to avoid inflation by investing as well as hoping seeing some growth. I also dabble in some bitcoin that i bought 1-2 years ago... i know this is pretty much gambling but i bought when things were severely down &amp; I'm up quite a bit and want to pull some out to go into the traditional market with.

I budget my income really well and manage to save a few hundred dollars on my solo income even after my mortgage, groceries for myself, fiance &amp; child as well as all bills.

&amp;#x200B;

Side question: Should i be putting more in my 401K? I could probably spare another $50 per paycheck or so.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this this a lot and all feedback is appreciated.

personalfinance,Advice on getting first credit card,"I need help choosing my first credit card and getting my head around how interest works with them. The reason I’m getting one is because my credit rating isn’t the best so I’d like to improve it and hopefully get some rewards too. 

I always get quite stressed with banks as I feel like every other word or phrase is thrown in just to confuse me. I’m with Barclays and I’ve been looking at the forward barclaycard and the interest rates are just not explained in a clear way at all for me, do I have to pay interest on everything I buy or do I just have to pay interest based on my balance? What’s the sense of paying interest at all when I can just use my debit card? Ideally I don’t want to be paying anything for it and I would be making my payments in full and in time.

Is there a card that people would recommend for someone like me? I’ve read that Amex do good credit cards and rewards. I appreciate anyone’s help and advice!",finance
personalfinance,First Time Home Buyer- Roll Closing Costs into Loan?,"Currently in the market as a first time home buyer. I will have saved about 10% down payment for a $400,000k home although do intend to go this high.

This will me to have more cash on hand for any initial improvements, furniture, etc. 

Would this be a good idea given my situation or should I focus on paying closing costs? Or should I consider any other factors?

If I pay for closing costs up front, I am delaying spending on any improvements/Furniture, and most likely paying 7-8% down instead of 10%.

personalfinance,Question about breaking a mortgage and choosing a new rate (Canada),"I was offered a few options by the bank in regards to breaking my current mortgage term and choosing a new rate, now that they are much lower. 

I'm currently 2 years into my 5 year term (purchased in 2018), with 3 years remaining.  My interest rate is 3.51%.  My bank is now offering 1.75%. My current mortgage sits at $328,000, and 27 years 10 months remaining amortization.

The offered me three options. The number may be slightly off but should be mostly accurate. The first option is not ideal because I don't have that equity to spend.  Are any of these options favourable to me, given the current outlook of low interest rates holding for the new few years?  Or is it better for me to see my term through and sign a new 5-year term, 3 years from now, and hope I can get a low rate?

1.  Pay $14,700 up-front to break the mortgage. Resign a new 5-year fixed for 1.75%.
2.  Pay $4,700 up-front to break the mortgage.  Add $10,000 to the mortgage itself.  Resign a new 5-year fixed at 1.75%.
3.  Take a 'rate-penalty': Break the current mortgage and resign a new 5-year fixed at 2.65%.",finance

I am interested to ensure I am doing my math right on this. I currently am a nurse in Seattle that makes decent money.

I do not have all the information ( and first time using student loans) so please correct me if I am wrong, but student loans have a max 120 month repayment plan. Therefore, my minimum payment will be 132$ a month. Over the 10 years making only the minimum payment I will pay a total of 15,799 or $2,000 with the 2.75% interest.

I could save and easily pay this off when I graduate and therefore not accrue any interest, but instead wouldn't it be better to just take that 13,000k and put it in a safe investment?

personalfinance,40 and finally feel like I have my financial feet under me. How to make the most of it?,"Overview


Bought my house over 16 years ago height of the housing market and ooooohh did I pay for it.

But I did a good job refinancing during the financial crisis and ended up getting what I think is a good mortgage modification.


I make over 100k a year gross although my health insurance is incredibly expensive.and high tax state. My net is 80-85k. My spouse doesn't work but has a guaranteed income of just over 45,000 a year that will go up by a few percent a year till she passes.


Every year for years felt like just getting through one either work related or medical emergency until this year. I honestly have some survivor's guilt about this. I got a foreberance with my mortgage company for initially 3 months than 6 and finally 7. We were already about 6 months ahead on payments so now we are just even again.


We have owned this house about 16 years 


I did lose about half my income for 3 months but it did eventually come back. I am grateful that I was able to get the mortgage work around as we would never been able to pay it otherwise.


THE GOOD

By the end  of January I will have about 20,000 between checking and short/medium term savings. 

 I will have about 70,000 in retirement between my current 401k my former 401k(that I don't want to roll over as I would lose my Class A stock I already rolled over everything else) and my IRA.

No auto debt and mortgage is reasonable at less than 1,500 a month all in including taxes and insurance.

Student loans miniscule and almost paid off. The interest is so low not worth paying off now.


Spouse's income is guaranteed no matter what so even if I were to lose my job suddenly we don't need as big as an emergency fund as you would think.



THE BAD.

Many of those emergencies were medical and my health insurance sucks. There is about 10,000 in outstanding medical debt that I have slowly been paying off.

Spouse's student loans approx 30,000 already negotiated everything I can to reduce the payments they won't go lower.


House needs some work some of which we did when we had a break from but there is still more to do 


THE BAD.

Approx 50k in credit card debt that is down a few thousand from the beginning of last year.


I swapped around some high interest cards for low or zero percent. I also had to make a few necessary purchases, appliances that died mostly, earlier in the year but got them at zero percent for 12-18 months. 


Obviously using all of the cash we have saved up in the past 9 months to pay off credit card debt doesn't make sense. But how much does or should I just continue to save th few hundred that we have been for the past?


Edit 1 with more info.


I went in and subtracted all promotional purchases, credit cards with 0% offers etc. 

This leaves me with 46,000 total credit card debt. All 0 percent cards I have already set automatic payments that will pay the full promotional balance one month before it is due. No reason to pay them off early. I need to attack the highest interest cards first.



Next I looked at the cards with the highest balance. Conversely these are the cards with the lowest interest rates. They represent 68% of my over all credit card debt but the avg interest rate is only 15.3%. There are 4 of these cards and I never use them. I have just been paying the balances down. All our set to pay the amount necessary to pay off the card in three years plus a few more dollars. 


The remaining cards at about 15,000 total dollars but with a higher avg interest rate. 

The avg rate for that balance is 22.60%.

The avg rate for all non zero percent cards is 17.69%


Obviously I need to attack the credit card debt first and I have been generally paying off the highest interest lowest balance cards first to free up more income and snowball into other cards.

In the past four months I am averaging $3,600 in credit card payments across all cards. It's a huge chunk of income. Really the question is how far do I drawn down emergency fund? I don't really need to keep 3-6 months as my spouses income is gurantteed. That income can make up a large portion of th difference if the worst were to happen.

By the end of February I could zero out my two lowest balance card and push that payment into the next cards. I have paid on avg $614 a month on those cards over the last four months. 

Keeping that scenario rolling the third lowest balance card would be paid off end of April and the fourth lowest end of June.



That reduces my avg interest rate to under 17% and without even factoring in what I pay off on th other cars I would be around 40,100 total. It would obviously be a good bit lower as I would still be paying off the higher balance cards.


Edit 2.

I haven't contributed anything to my my IRA in a long time. I just have DRIPS set up for the stocks there.

My class A company stock has a much higher dividend than the regular stock and I lose it if I roll over the old 401k.

I didn't contribute anything to my current 401k until th end of last year and only recent set it up to maximize my company match. I wouldn't want to reduce it anymore and it helps out on my taxes.",finance

My 2009 Toyota Venza was dying and I made loads of money with the stock market this year, I decided to buy a newer vehicle. I bought a 2019 Toyota Prius XLE from a dealer in South Florida. I work for the Federal Government due to issues with parking at work I used my old car for a couple of days then started driving the Prius this weekend. 

I had a 2008 Prius many years ago and it seemed relatively quite. The 2019 sounds like there is absolutely no sound deadening material in the vehicle at all. I got a loan through my credit union and was planning on paying the vehicle off almost immediately.

The dealer had a 5 day/250 mile return policy. I reached out to the dealer yesterday and got no response, today they called and when I inquired they basically said the vehicle had to be back in their hands yesterday and then hung up on me. 

I've considered selling it/trading it in- considered taking it to a body shop nearby that does restorations on antique cars and seeing if they can do anything. I'm aware that I'm going to take some kind of loss if I do anything but keep it. If I decide to sell it, what's the least damaging way to handle this?

Edit: Since people have asked: theyre P215/45 R17 87V and their brand is Yokohama. It's dark and I have a mild disability so crouching to get a decent picture was moderately difficult. While I think buying new tires would stink, it's certainly orders of magnitude less hassle and less costly than selling the car.

personalfinance,Disappointing experience with a Credit Union,"When I bought my current car, I was able to get financing through Police and Fire Federal Credit Union. ""Great!"" I thought. My great aunt banked there for years and I had heard so much about how much better a credit union is than a national bank. Over the last three years things have been fine. I never had to deal with any real issues, I made my payments on time and it was nice to have a ""kickback"" of the member rewards. All was well.

Well, until Saturday. I get a call from an unknown number with a ""robocall"" telling me they have an important message about my account with PFFCU. The number, and the callback number, are not anywhere to be found on PFFCU's website, but I call the main PFFCU number anyway just to check. I am informed that my account is past due. I look at my account with Ally and confirm that the check had been sent. PFFCU says they haven't received it and that I should stop payment on the check and make an electronic payment. I tell them this doesn't sound reasonable since there is a widely known mail delay, but they insist that this is my only option if I want to avoid my account being sent to collections.

I go ahead and do what they asked and Ally tells me there would be no stop payment fee unless someone tries to deposit the check. I call PFFCU back the same day to deal with the electronic payment, and am told that they need to transfer me over to collections because it was already sent there. I'm not sure why the first representative didn't tell me this, but whatever. I explain the situation and they tell me that while they've received communication from USPS regarding late checks, they are not making any accommodations. They will waive the late fee only because this is my first time making a late payment, but not in acknowledgment of the current mail situation. Whatever. I pay the bill and ask them to confirm that the check won't be deposited, but they say I need to talk to Operations who isn't open on the weekend.

Today rolls around and I call back. The first person I get on the phone informs me that my account is still delinquent as I haven't paid my late fee. She can't get through to Collections so sends them a message to call me back later. Operations is even less helpful and tells me that they will be depositing the check as soon as it is received as is their policy. You see, they cannot commit to stopping the check as *they have a backlog of 1000 checks to process.* Yes, exactly. They're sending me to collections for a late payment and there's a very good chance my payment is sitting there in their office waiting to be processed. They then said that any concerns about the stop payment fee are Ally's problem, not their's.

I guess I just want to 1) warn people away from Police and Fire Federal Credit Union for their terrible handling of this situation, but 2) ask what my next step should be here. Ultimately it's only about $40 total between the late fee and the stop payment fee I will incur when they deposit the check, but it's kind of the ""principle of the matter"" at this point.",finance
personalfinance,Stay at a job you don't like for promises of a future promotion and a fat raise? Talk me down from the ledge.,"Been at my current company for a year (corporate IT). The company is not very well organized, there's a long of incompetence among parts of management, and I frequently end up in shitty situations/getting thrown under the bus because of other people's fuck ups and me being responsible for fixing them. I work on jobs as a lone wolf with often my only support being a phone call or email, normally it's just me sent in alone without much info to go on and with the expectation that I'll get the job done. I also don't enjoy working in corporate settings (way too much pedantic bs, people talking about behind each other backs aaaaalllllllllllll the time, high-school like drama). I've seriously considered finding a different job multiple times over the last year, but always decided I wanted the stability and it might just be worth sticking around in hopes of a promotion and professional development.

Had my performance review last week and my boss, among other positive things, said I was ""exceptional"" and said he wanted to get me a 15%-20% raise (as if upper management/accounting would ever approve something like that regardless of what my direct supervisor says).

I actually got a 3% raise, 1.8% when you take into account inflation...

The excuse I was given was pretty much ""ohh but the economy is so bad right now and we didn't have to lay off any body because of the pandemic and we're still doing holiday bonuses."" Yea the economy is bad, guess that's only a problem for the company and not for the employees. My manager also played the ""we send you to expensive trainings"" (I was required to go and of like the three I went to in the last year, only one was relevant to what I actually use for my job). Then he went on to talk about loyalty, investing in employees, and how he disliked seeing people develop skills at one job just to leave for another company. But honestly it feels insulting to get preached to about company loyalty and then not see that company show you the same loyalty in return. 

Meanwhile, I know that my company never stopped working this year because we are considered essential, I've heard directly from multiple managers that the company is doing really well right now and had a lot of cash flow, and to top it off, the company got more than $5mil in PPP money. Point being, I don't believe the company is really hurting for money.

My boss has also been having me start working on a huge project that will affect the whole company (something outside of my normal job duties for the position I was hired in). I got fed the bullshit line of ""stick with it and we'll get you a nice big raise next year."" I've heard that load of crap before and it's always turned out to be a lie, not about to start believing it now.

My salary should only account for my performance of my job duties as defined by the description of the job I was originally hired for. Want me to learn advanced skills and perform higher-level tasks above those of my current role? Sure, but that's different to the role I was originally hired in and I should be compensated to match.

From my perspective, it seems like the company wants to milk me for another year with promises and pipe dreams so that I can get this big project off the ground for them, essentially getting above market work for a below market price. Then in another year maybe I'll get a big raise and or/promotion.

Honestly, I just don't want to have to keep waiting another whole year for a maybe. I've had jobs before where I demonstrated my ability well and my manager like me and said I'd be taken care of, only for that manger to leave and be replaced by a total dickhead, essentially putting me back to square one. I've worked my ass off the last year, have demonstrated time and time again that I do quality work and am very knowledgeable and good at what I do, and have been told many times by managers and clients alike that I'm doing a good job. 

I know my worth as a person with my particular skill set, abilities, and experience, and I don't feel like I'm getting the respect I've earned through my hard work.

I've decided I have to rock the boat and bring all this up to my manager because I'm near the end of my rope with this bullshit and I refuse to be treated and led on this way.

What would you do in this situation? What is the best way to handle that maximizes my benefit?

personalfinance,Buying a townhouse/duplex for my parents and renting second unit/basement,"Hello!

Posting to check if my plan makes sense. Currently living in California and my parents living in Northern Virginia (Alexandria). Basic info:

**Parents (60F, 56M)**

- Combined annual income: ~$22K before taxes. (maybe double next year if my father is able to find a job)
- Savings: ~7K in checking account (no retirement accounts)
- Location: Northern Virginia (Alexandria)
- No much social security expected for retirement as we are all immigrants who have been here less than 10 years (parents have now citizenship though). My father might get ~$700/month from country of origin.
- I currently send them ~$1.7K/month to help with rent, utilities, car insurances
- No current debt
- Credit score: 630 (mom), 590 (dad)

**Me**

- Single, no kids planned in the future
- Annual income: ~$240K (~$170k salary, $70k stocks, company is public)
- Current personal costs (not including the $1.7K that I send them): ~$3200/month
- Savings (not including retirement accounts or HSA): ~$95K (10% cash, 40% company stock, 50% index funds [3-fund portfolio])
- No current debt, no car
- Credit score: 740
- Had plans to buy a one br house for myself (~$450K) but can postpone a couple years (current rent is 1800).

**Plan**

Sending them $1.7K a month is a lot of money especially since all goes to rent and utilities. It also leaves me on the hook for that amount for the foreseeable future which severely limits career opportunities to only other high paying jobs and prevent me from moving into a different location (not a concern in the next 5 years, but might in 10). So my plan is to buy for them a house in the ~$350K range which for the area we are targeting (15-20min from where they are now) will cover a 3-4br townhouse with a basement. The idea is to then rent the basement and one of the bedrooms to cover most of the house payments. Another possibility is to buy a duplex and rent the second unit but those seem harder to find or are out of the max price range of $400k that I am targeting. With either of the solutions, it will allow me to reduce considerably the amount I send them each month, I got to own the house which might lower my taxes and gives me some more flexibility.


Timeline for buying is 4-5 months from now (don't plan on traveling until I get the vaccine) which should add another $30-40K to my savings. Target downpayment is 15% which should leave me with enough money for closing costs + emergency fund.

**Questions:**

- Any glaring issue?
- Based on the info, should I buy the house and treat it like an investment, be a cosigner in a mortgage for them or just give them the money for the downpayment and they buy it? Last one doesn't seem feasible due to their poor credit scores and low income. I am worried about the second one in case them being in the mortgage will increase the interest rates and limit any other governmental benefits they might get for low income people.
- If I want to find professional help to understand my possibilities, who should I contact? Financial advisors? Real estate agents from the area my parents are living?

Thanks!",finance
stocks,Banks performing amid near-zero interest rates,"So something I am curious about. The title pretty much says it. Why are banks performing well while rates are at near zero. Doesn't low interest rates mean tighter margins and less revenue for the big banks? 

The recent jumps were likely caused by the announcement that they can resume buybacks, but I'm more concerned with the general upward trends of the last few months.",finance
personalfinance,Extra income - what's the best way to approach savings and loans?,"Hi all! I'm a 21 y/o college senior heading to law school next fall. I've worked part-time all throughout high school and college to reduce the amount of loans I needed during undergrad, but most law schools don't allow students to work during their first year, meaning I'll be relying entirely on loans and scholarships. I don't know how much in loans I'll be taking out yet because I am still waiting on some financial aid packages to arrive so I can begin the negotiation process, and I've been applying to 3rd-party scholarships. I'm set on a high ranked school so I will be taking out some loans regardless.

Here's where I need advice: despite the pandemic, I was incredibly lucky to get more hours and a raise at my job, and I'm considering some options for this extra money. I could...

1. Put it all towards emergency savings. I've saved roughly $3,500 in a high-yield account, but my goal is $5000. Unpredictable things always come up and its been a lifesaver in the past.
2. Put it towards my undergrad unsubsidized federal loans, roughly $18,000. This is especially attractive considering they won't start accumulating interest again until Jan 31st and they're in deferment until I graduate law school, but they'll be accumulating interest. If I get ahead now, could I offset some of that?
3. Save this money specifically for school so I can take out less loans. I already do not plan on taking out the maximum amount, but less loans means less interest.
4. Put this money into my Acorns account. I started it a while ago with the intention of using it to cover the cost of living when I'm studying for the Bar exam or for paying off loans after I graduate. I started it when it was free for students, and now the dividends more than make up for the monthly fee.

I'm not sure what the best option is for me. On one hand, random emergencies and unexpected things (like pandemics) pop up, and just saving the money helps ease my anxiety. On the other hand, I want to set myself up for a solid long-term future and be smart about mitigating my loans.",finance
personalfinance,Private undergraduate school loan bankruptcy: not sure if ‘09 private student loans from OG lender has any benefits over new lender ‘21 loans?,"Is there any reason to NOT refinance my already existing PRIVATE undergraduate school loans (which entered repayment in 2009)? I've never missed a payment but no thanks to poorly managed minimum payments and high-interest rates my existing total ballooned over the original balance. I've been approved from one lender to a different lender at a better rate (same length in term repayments) which ultimately saves on my monthly payment. 

However, the reason I'm concerned: If I'm able to eventually bankrupt my private undergraduate student loans at a future date, (...should those bankruptcy laws allow an individual to do so?), I'm not sure if having 2009 private student loans from one lender has any benefits over newly refinanced 2021 private student loans from a different lender? Would I have been better off with the older loans from the original lender? Do the newly refinanced loans not consider my original disbursement date, should they enter bankruptcy court?

Also, the loans were originally dispersed for NY private college, but I would refinance in CA where I currently live. If that matters/helps.",finance

personalfinance,My father has lost his battle to depression and I want to make sure my mom is financially secure.,"Hi all,

Im posting this so I can give my mother some advice. My father has been struggling with depression and a prescription drug addiction. My dad recently he took his life. The family is broken. But it's time to make sure my mother is going to be okay financially.

Lately my dad has been really bad and used every excuse to not go to work. Doctor notes, COVID exposure, FMLA, etc. The last check came in recently, it was $36 after insurance etc.

Some info about my mom and dad

* Mom and dad are in their mid 50's .
* We live in Illinois if that helps.

Heres what my mother has right now after looking at all my dads accounts.

* Mom works, makes around 40k a year.
* Dad had around $6000 in the bank across accounts.
* Dad had a couple life insurance policies that will pay out, one for $100,000 and one for $10,000.
* My dads work is giving my mother 5 years of paid health insurance, and $40,000 for life insurance through work.
* Dad has a 401k, has $110k in it.
* Mom has a 401k, has around $70k in it.
* Dad has a partial pension, not sure when my mom could access it. Not sure how much is in it, but it's only partial and not fully funded. He only contributed around 8-10 years. I dont think it will pay out til my mom turns 65 but will have to look into it.

Here are the known expenses and debts that I know of...

* My dad was pretty weird with credit cards. He would buy something and pay it off almost the same day. I don't know whats on his cards.. but I cant imagine its more than a couple hundred dollars. He also collected cards like pokemon cards. Has around 10-15 of them. Drugs do weird things... but im almost certain there isnt a huge amount of debt here.
* The house has around 80k left on the mortgage, interest rate of 2.75%. I believe it has about 10 years left on it. Was refinanced a few years ago to a 15 year.
* Theres a car payment of around $600 a month, owes around $8000 with interest rate of 2.2%
* Internet/TV/Phone - around 200-300 Id guess, not sure exactly. Will reduce this after canceling dads phone(s). (He had two, one for work)
* Misc expenses like food, etc.. I have no idea what she spends here... but it has to be called out. Thankfully family and friends have set up a meal schedule and shes taken care of for a few weeks.

Whats currently in motion.

* Funeral is costing around 13k.
* Mom says she wants to pay off the house so she doesnt have to worry about it
* My brother currently lives at home due to a recent split. Has said he will take over the car payment... but my brother isnt exactly reliable.. infact doesn't have a job right now so this isnt set it stone. He has some money saved so will most likely make it happen.
* She does not want to touch the 401k unless she has to.

My questions are...

Does it make financially sense to pay off the house or should we roll with payments and do something else?

How can she make sure she is financially secure to last until his pension starts rolling in. If she has to wait til shes 65, will be around 10 years.

Thankfully has insurance for 5 years, but after 5 years it will be an issue. Her current job is a small business of 3 employees and thats not really an option. Theres also talk of the shop closing down due to owners retiring in the next few years.

Thankfully there is some life insurance that makes this a little easier, we just want to make the right moves.

What can she do to make sure shes secure for the future?

I am also willing to help out myself, I do pretty well so if I need to step in I will ,just trying to make her self sufficient in the future.

Thank you in advance for any advice!",finance

cardano,Using Wolfram Alpha for a personal staking calculator,"Maybe some of you know the problem to calculate one's own stake, because there's a compound interest rate running every epoch (=5 days) in Cardano and maybe you don't have enough mathematical background to calculate it by yourself. The given calulators for compound interest rates are further normed for yearly rates, following the bankster logic.

For that, you can use the wolfram alpha website: [https://www.wolframalpha.com/](https://www.wolframalpha.com/)

Use the command line and enter:

continuous interest PV=\[enter your present stake value\], FV=\[enter your target/future stake value\], rate=\[enter the interest rate for each epoch\]

Then you get the number of epochs you need to stake to come from PV to FV. There are 73 Epochs per year, so you know the time period for the condition of your estimated interest rate.

Example: 

You hold 3500 ADA at the moment. You want to know how long it takes to stake until you have 5000 ADA under your given interest rate per epoch. You can encounter your prior experiences with staking rates per Epoch here: Your Rewards per Epoch / Your Stake. For example, you asume that there will be an interest rate 0,06 % per Epoch.

Enter into the command line:

continuous interest PV=3500, rate=0,06%, FV=5000

The result in this case is 594.5 periods (=epochs). This means, it endures 594.5 / 73 = 8.14 years.

&amp;#x200B;

So you can give it a try how much you want to stake or how long you need to reach your target.

Note: Nobody knows your exact mean interest rates per epoch in the future. It depends on the rewards mechanism in the following years, the fees of your stake pool and its gains of transactions/block production.

personalfinance,Ultra Noob doing cash-out refinance. Help!!,"I, 26m, bought my house for around 50k a while back in an up and coming neighborhood. I couldn’t really afford to buy at the time, but I made it happen. Barely. 

Flash forward to today, I’ve accrued over 12k in CC debt,(most of it needed for housing supplies, tools, etc, and then some not lol) but am making more than minimum payments on all of those. 

I serve pizza and run social media account for said pizza restaurant for a living for the vague amount of 50-70k/year (closer to 70 this year, but hard to budget out when it fluctuates week to week.)

I am in the process of cutting my interest rate in half, lowering my payment from $490/month to about $470/month, and getting a check for about 28k.

My question for you all is this: Do I pay off my credit card debts with said money? Pay of some of the ones that may lead to penalties in near future? Pay off my car? (18k or 385/month) Or do I use them for much-needed renovations such as a brand new kitchen (building is cheap in midwest should be able to do whole kitchen under 15k) finish bathroom in the newly-renovated master suite upstairs? 

I will likely never come across this much money at once again in my life, so I want to make sure I do this right for my gf and our 9-month old son.

here goes

I am totally aghast at peoples holdings, the chances of you making a long term gain on companies like snowflake or tesla are zero. These are not casino stocks because there are few in a casino who might make money in the long run. Paying $600,000 dollars per telsa ever sold is insane. Paying 100 times sales for snowflake is suicide. The only way you would make money is if you held the onver 40 years and had happened to pick the next walmart or apple. american equity indexes will be flat over 10 years. growth stock will be lower than flat.

But somethign like ARK innovation which has bundled the most speculative companies will become the poster child for this climate. Almost all of the return of these etfs is just multiple expansion, thats it.

People pointing to these recent stock success of these companies  is like using a plane as an example of why gravity does not exist.

Palantir for example is trading at similair PS multiples like Akamai in 2000 the stock is still 68% down. 99% of the stocks you know im talking about will do incredibly poorly.

there will be an amazon style winner in their somewhere.

you wont hold it for the length of time youll need to to make a return.

My guess is the extreme specualtion will carry on for a while yet, low interest rates and psychology will push this higher for now.

If you are holding these stocks you are the patsy and the poker game.

you may make extrmely large retunrs over the next few years.

I implore anyone with singficant amounts of their net worth in such speculative stocks or products to reconsider.

some part of us who do this for a living are looking forward to the inevitable reconing. dont give us the satisfaction.

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a very bad open after the UK [news](https://ibb.co/gRtBKsQ), but things did turn around as the big 3 indexes mostly recovered, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/PrY0RJx) finishing down just 0.10% for the day, the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/8gTGLps) even posting a small gain finishing up 0.12% while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/tppPJ2r) lost 0.39% dragged down by the recent addition, [Tesla](https://ibb.co/dB2pbc2), which finished more than 6% down for the day. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/0GHcjF4) opening very high and was up more than 30% at one point before eventually finishing the day around the 25 levels, as the new strain in the UK caused some panic selling and overreactions in the stock market in my opinion. [Here](https://streamable.com/832r8c) is a short-clip from the Admiral Brett Giroir, the US HHS assistant secretary sharing the facts on CNN yesterday, as there is a lot of misinformation going on.

So, he gave us reassurance, and I don’t believe there is anything to dispute [here](https://ibb.co/8XmJ4PL), as I have done a lot of research yesterday on the matter, as this strain has been circulating for 3 months already and is not something new with the only point of concern being that this one is more transmissible and has become the most common in the UK. This should not impact the effectiveness of the vaccines and has not been proven to be more lethal than any other strain. So, hopefully the vaccines become more available as fast as possible so that we can get past this whole thing already.

[Yesterday](https://ibb.co/8N8qSgR) more than 60% of the companies were losing ground on above average volume, as companies have started to have some retracements to the 50-day moving averages. Only one of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/z6P1DDX) in the SP was gaining yesterday, with Financials gaining 0.81%, while Energy, Real Estate and Utilities finished the day down more than 2% as growth companies outperformed the value plays [yesterday](https://ibb.co/RgBp7cP), especially the mid and small-caps.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/ncyyDVm) from yesterday, as there was a whole lot of red going on, with only the biggest tech companies in the world having some small gains, with Microsoft &amp; Apple up more than 1% while Amazon &amp; Google also finished barely up for the day. We Also got the US banks which did pretty good following the FED decision to allow share buybacks again and Nike also surging after terrific earnings. We also saw some of the biggest losers in the oil &amp; gas industry joined by Tesla which saw a significant pullback after the SP500 inclusion.

Meanwhile, the US Congress finally [passed](https://ibb.co/4f0zbdv) a $892B bill after many months of gridlock that is expected to be signed into law by Trump. The bill will include $600 payments to most American. The bill which is more than 5K pages long also includes a federal spending budget of over $1.4T and has a net cost of only $350B in relief spending with the rest coming from unspent money from the previous bill.

[Here](https://ibb.co/3dcfyNc) are the most interesting economic reports coming today, with the GDP revision, consumer confidence index and home sales coming early in the morning.

We also get a single big earnings report today, coming from [CarMax](https://ibb.co/k4vtbFp) which will show us how the second-hand car market is doing, this may impact other stocks like Carvana and even car manufacturers. So, will writing this, CarMax released the [earnings](https://ibb.co/Z2r0qBy) and delivered a beat on the top and bottom line but underwhelmed on comparable store sales which were down 0.8% vs the 4.1% increase expected. I will come back tomorrow and discuss more about this after I get into the earnings report more in-depth.

In some other stock market news, [GM](https://ibb.co/dMJrMQd) has landed 10K pre-orders for the new Hummer EV for the Edition 1 model which will be listed well above the $100K mark and will start production next year, this is another manufacturer that is going to keep putting more and more pressure on Tesla’s EV market share.

Tesla also continued to drop yesterday after [reports](https://ibb.co/sgvtSh3) that Apple is moving forward with a self-driving car by 2024 that would include its own breakthrough battery technology. Apple has started this project in 2014 but this had low interest from the company in the past years, has recently been brought back into focus, as they are targeting a unique mono-cell battery design that could radically reduce the cost and increase the range of the vehicle. Though I believe this is very unlikely to happen, as Apple is more likely to license this kind of technology, or maybe they will try to rely on some kind of a manufacturing partner rather than start manufacturing their own cars

We also saw the whole solar energy stock rallying again after reports that the spending bill will [include](https://ibb.co/N2q4RWp) $35B in energy R&amp;D programs, with an extension of the Tax Credit for solar &amp; wind power.

While another stay-at-home winner, [Peloton](https://ibb.co/dbhH7xQ) just agreed to acquire Precor for $420M as they seek to expand the market share and the manufacturing capabilities to keep up with the big demand which has caused delays.

Another recent stock market favorite also received a one-year $114M option contract from the US army. This helped pushed [Palantir](https://ibb.co/q0dgSkK) almost 10% up in regular trading and more than 2% again in after-hours.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/02kV0jF) seem to be mixed right now, with the Nasdaq Composite leading the way, as the stay-at-home stocks are back in flavour alongisde this new virus strain, but who knows how long this will last...

Bitcoin,Fuck Hackers,"I'm prepared for the down votes but this is just my opinion. 

I understand peoples frustration on the ledger hack and their irresponsible role they played in it, I'm not debating that argument at all. I just want to clarify its the black hat hackers themselves that causes this in the first place. In my opinion this is a very small compromise when you consider hacks on apple, Microsoft, facebook, verizon, at&amp;t and even banks like navy federal just to name a few.  News flash people, our private information has been published to the public and dark web years before this ledger hack happened. Simply owning an apple device or facebook account makes you vulnerable  to private information leaks. 

Let's eliminate hacks for 1 second, I just want to put this into perspective. Real estate is public information. I have done real estate investing and part of the marketing process is gathering up property info. Some  ways to do it is buying mailing lists of specific criteria or website scrapping of public state records and websites. I got asked all the time how did I know there name, address and housing status and I simply tell them its public information and their jaws drop.

I say all this to try to put peoples mind at ease if possible. If someone really wanted to find you, they can simply do some reconnaissance on social media, public records and hacked info on the dark web from Apple, Microsoft, Facebook etc. Sad to say but this is the world we live in today. Not saying the hack on ledger is justified, but just a reality. IMO hackers are keyboard thugs that are too weak and pathetic to do anything else outside of their computers.",cryptocurrency

Yes of course that's not enough especially now that we are getting a pool and a Tesla Model Y.  So I've been having issues with my SunPower panels not seeming to produce enough after several emails and calls they sent a tech who found 4 of my Micro-inverters are showing red ""X"" or bad, and the rest of the panels showing good but WAY underperforming on a perfectly sunny day at 1pm.  I asked them to replace all the inverters as they may have been part of a bad batch. When SunPower finally called me back last week they said they are going to replace 2 micro-inverters.  As you could imagine I'm pretty pissed about this.  They said they did a firmware upgrade that fixed the others, which I know is a bunch of BS because if they come back bad they usually stay bad and don't miraculously turn good.  

So with the crappy support I have been receiving from SunPower I think it's time I move on.  What brand Panels and inverters do you all recommend?  I had Solarworld Panels and SolardEdge Inverter &amp; optimizers in my last house and loved it, but you know their story.  So any recommendations I would appreciate it.    
I did reach out to a couple other places that are wanting to sell me the following, but the price per watt seems really high to me. Are these good deals or ?

18 - 330 watt Trina Panels with SMA Inverter and SMA Tigo Optimizers = $20,790.00 before the 4% fed tax rebate.

15- 410 watt SunPower Panels = $24,000  (Yes I know I'm looking to get away but thought I'd throw that out there.

I also have a LG panel quote that I'm waiting on that I'll post once I get it.

stocks,Thoughts on Aerospace comeback?,"Due to COVID, companies such as Boeing, Delta, United, AA, etc are still all down 10-50% from a year ago. This is not surprising in the least, and I expect a full comeback at some point in the future to a relatively stable equilibrium once travel resumes. I hate the term ""too big to fail"", but many aerospace companies will get bailed out by the feds before that happens; proven by the recent stimulus. It seems, however, that despite the stimulus bill being passed and the industry being given $17B, that not much has changed in their stock. 

What gives, and does anyone have some insight on how long it will take these industries stock to get to pre-covid levels? 

Would my money be better placed in an equally important industry that will come-back quicker?

personalfinance,Understanding Historical Stock Market Interest Rates with Inflation,"My question is about how to interpret the often cited fact that the historical interest rate of popular indexes is around 7%-8% 

Googling around, it seems like that rate is ""after inflation"". I want to make sure I know precisely what that means because messing it up would have serious implication for retirement planning. 

For example, let's say I start with $0 and add $10,000 per year to a retirement fund for 40 years (assuming 7% average annual returns). The number that will be returned by this compound interest calculator is **$2,136,095**. 

**In the year 2060** should I expect:

A) the **actual dollar value** of my investments to be 2,136,095 2060 dollars. (meaning I would actually have the equivalent of around a million dollars in 2020 dollars)

or

B) the value of my investments to be **some higher dollar amount of 2060 dollars that is equivalent** to $2,136,095 in 2020 dollars

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty sure the answer is ""B"" but I really want to double check because getting this wrong could mean shooting for a retirement amount that is waaayyyy too low.",finance

1. I'm *trying* to refinance a vehicle from CarMax Auto Finance (originally) *to* Guardian Credit Union.
2. I've already submitted the loan paperwork to GCU, and I see the active loan balance in my account.
3. I do not see the pay-off having been delivered in my CarMax Auto Finance account.
4. I've been calling and calling, both GCU and CAF. CAF says they haven't received the payoff check, GCU say it's been sent to the correct address for the correct amount.
5. I *finally* got the tracking number from GCU, and UPS says the package has been in transit since December 8. It was only going one state over via UPS Ground.
6. I'm freaking out that it has taken 3 weeks to get this payoff through, and might turn into more.

This is my first time financing a vehicle period, and my first time refinancing a vehicle. It needed to be done, I went from a robbery interest rate (8.45%, yes I know this was stupid) to 2.2%. I've only had the car about two months.

If this payoff amount doesn't go through before January 6, I'll be due for 2 car payments.**AND** because it has taken so long, will I be liable to pay the difference in the 10-day payoff amount and the check they receive (which was sent for the 10-day payoff amount *earlier* this month)?

personalfinance,The case for bonds or not,"I've been reading Millionaire teacher and learning a lot. Great on audible too. I have mostly been interested by the authors case for bonds. He says that you need bonds roughly same percentage in your portfolio as your age, so when there is a downturn you lose less and bonds are expensive and you can sell and get more equities.

Now my question is on the current economic situation. My understanding is bonds were dirt cheap in March and so were equities. And bonds didn't really recover due to low interest rates.  Why? Is the whole premise of balancing bonds and stocks out of the window then and the paradigm shifted? Do you keep almost all your money in stocks/ real estate and if not,  what's your bond share?

personalfinance,Using a new student loan to repay older student loans?,"I have about $16k student loans from college with interest rates ranging from **3.4% - 4.66%** (currently 0 due to covid forbearance). 

I'm returning to school in spring semester, which is technically halfway through the 20-21 award year. Since I didn't use my financial aid for fall semester, I was awarded more $$ for spring semester. Which means after the cost of tuition, I have about $5k extra in direct unsubsidized loans.

The interest rate for 20-21 year is **2.75%**, which is lower than the interest rates for all of my previous loans. So, I'm thinking maybe to use the $5k extra towards repaying my older student loans... Is there any reason not to? Is it not a smart decision to do this?",finance
personalfinance,"Prioritizing PMI, tuition, HSA, or Roth IRA?","Hi all, 

Before I start, yes I've seen and understand the prime directive.

I'm trying to prioritize where I place my extra funds next year. I already have a 4 month emergency fund, and I'm maxing the employer match in my 401(k). My wife is a graduate student and works part time; her employer does not offer a company match.

I feel my next financial priorities should be

1. Pay down my mortgage to remove PMI.
2. Either pay for my wife's grad student tuition up front or take out a loan.
3. Max out my and my wife's HSAs. I'm one who will pay HSA-eligible purchases out of pocket, save the receipts, invest the money, and get reimbursed later to enjoy the triple tax savings.
4. Open and max out a Roth IRA for my wife and I.

Here is some relevant information:

\- I just bought a house. Total cost = $402K, Down payment = $40,200, Mortgage interest rate = 2.5%, PMI = $60.30/mo. I've read here that the effective interest rate of PMI is roughly 12\*(PMI monthly cost) / (remaining $$ needed to reach 80% LTV) + Mortgage interest rate. So, my PMI is effectively 12\*60.30/40200 + 0.025 = **4.3%**, right? I also understand that as your LTV decreases towards 80%, the effective PMI increases... so it seems once you commit to attacking PMI you should follow through. 

\- My wife is in graduate school. Coincidentally, a [federal loan](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/interest-rates) is also **4.3%.** 

\- My wife and I both have HSA's, both currently at 0 balances.

\- Neither my wife nor I have a Roth IRA open.

My current plan is:

i) Take out federal loan for wife's grad school.

ii) Max out both my and my wife's HSAs.

iii) Pay down PMI until it's removed.

iv) Pay off wife's grad school loans.

v) Open Roth IRA.

gaming,Secretlab Omega chair with PU Leather 2.0 Review,"I recently purchased an Omega chair from Secretlabs and thought I'd give it a bit of a review. I have looked at reviews of this chair before and decided to make the jump to find out for myself. I ordered it in black PU Leather, with red stitching, and the gold embroidery.

Price

I bought it just over a week ago so there was a bit of a sale on their site. Regular price is $499 CAD so its definitely not cheap. For the price you're paying, the quality better be there! There are similarly priced chairs that aren't necessarily gaming chairs, but I liked the look and felt that spending that amount was a risk i was willing to take. 

Shipping

YMMV. Within a week of ordering I received my chair through Fedex, and it arrived a day earlier than expected. I ordered on a Thursday, and the chair arrived Monday just after lunch. It was originally slated end of day Tuesday. Quite amazing, considering there is a christmas rush to deliver packages, there was a winter storm warning during that time, and all this was going on during the pandemic. Very pleased with that.

Packaging

I did watch a lot of youtube unboxing videos so I wasn't surprised to see the contents and packaging. It is a fairly heavy box and may need 2 people to carry it comfortably. Each component was compartmentalized, and packaged nicely. The chair back and seat assembly were the biggest pieces in this very sturdy box. It came with the giant posterboard instructions, with no pieces missing. The head and lumbar pillows were packaged as well. Nothing unusual to report.

Assembly

Instructions were easy to follow from the poster that comes packaged. Lots of pictures with step bybstep instructions that are very easy to follow. It comes with an allen wrench and a magnetic bit driver with a phillips bit for you to use for assembly. It can be put together by one person if you are handy. 2 people are recommended, just for some parts like lining up the high back with the seat assembly. It took me less than 30 minutes from unboxing to complete assembly. Definitely follow the instructions on the poster that comes with it to have little to no trouble. I would suggest to start the supplied screws in by hand, and not by the tool to prevent crossthreading. That is the last thing you want to happen after spending the amount of money for this chair. 

Comfort

The chair feel is very firm, but it is exactly what I was looking for. I am not a fan of plushness, and the extra firmness doesn't bother me at all. I do expect the firmness to soften up over time, but brand new, the feel is perfect for me. I'm 5'7"" and around 165lbs currently so im not a very big person.

I do have to have the seat at the lowest position, and when i tilt the chair or recline, my feet are dangling over the edge of the seat. I have a foot rest that i am using and find that helps a lot. I went for the smallest sizing according to the site's size chart and the Omega is almost the right size for me. 

I do like the myriad of adjustments for the armrests and tilt. The head pillow has an adjustable strap and is easily adjustable to where you wnat it to sit on the high back. The lumbar pillow gives additional support for you if you want it as well. It is not as firm as the seat so compresses nicely, and doesnt feel like its pushing you to the edge of the seat.

Everything feels very solid, and the quality is everything i expected out of my purchase. It looks and feels great, and there are a few areas that have some carbon fibre accenting to add to the finish of the chair. I do not have any buyers remorse at all and feel pretty confident i made the right choice. I have sat in it for several hours trying different positions including the full recline. So far, no issues with discomfort. I do sit cross-legged sometimes, and I find that I am still comfortably able to do that despite the racing bucket seat shape. I am very impressed and happy with my purchase. Its hard for me not to recommend this chair, but it really depends on what you are looking for. Its a big risk to purchase a chair without sitting on it, so if you could try it out from someone before you buy it, I would recommend that.

I will update this in a couple of months to update how it holds up. Hope you found this review helpful, if you made it to the end, thanks for reading! 

Cheers :)",technology

personalfinance,Federal Taxable Income Potentially Wrong? Potentially withholding too much as a result.,"I am in the US and I think I am having too much money withheld from my job. 
From my Statement of Earnings I see that my total pay for the pay period (paid two times a month) was $2833.33. My federal taxable income is listed as $2776.48. My federal tax withholding for this pay period was $481.01. 


I’m a single tax filer, with no dependents. So my standard deduction should be around $12,000 for the year. Wouldn’t that mean my federal taxable income should be around $2333.33? That would bring my federal withholding a bit.

CryptoCurrency,"If Bitcoin's value proposition is all about scarcity then why not accelerate halvings to 2 years instead of 4? Why not cut issuance by one fourth? Why not do both? Somehow people believe that the four year havings are an immaculate monetary policy, but it is not.","These rhetorical questions are loaded with sarcasm because it should obvious that Bitcoin's issuance schedule may be less than ideal. Perhaps hardcore Bitcoiners may answer it by saying that ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"". However, that is a very dangerous way to reason why and if Bitcoin's monetary policy is efficient or if it is sustainable. This topic is rarely analyzed from a pragmatic view point, but it should be one of the actively debated topics in the Bitcoin community.

In the early days PoW was also an effective mechanism to distribute ownership of the token without relying on the interaction with a party that owned it - high levels of issuance served a purpose of fair distribution. However, circumstances have changed and we as a community often forget to consider the purpose of monetary policies when it comes to crypto: **issuance's sole purpose is to subsidize the decentralized security model**. With that in mind, we should automatically deduce the following:

1. It is hypothetically possible to optimize the issuance rate according to the need for subsidized network security.
2. There are implications related to the network becoming overwhelmingly dependent on this form of subsidy. Adjustments to issuance on a network that is mainly financed by issuance can create severe disruptions.
3. The elimination of issuance subsidies implies that the income from network transaction fees must dramatically increase to obtain long term sustainability sustainability.

Bitcoin's issuance schedule has not been an issue so far because the price of Bitcoin has gone up exponentially during each halving period. That means that the overall network income (issuance + fees) keeps going up despite the issuance being cut in half every four years. What happens when the price of Bitcoin stabilizes? Consider how quickly the price of Bitcoin is going up... how many more cycles would it take for Bitcoin to hit gold's market cap? Optimistically, it can happen with one more halving cycle... so a certain level of price stability is not as distant as people might think. The one thing that we have to recognize is that the price of Bitcoin must double in each halving cycle in order to maintain the same level of subsidy. This will become particularly dangerous if mining operations continue to expand at faster rates since it will result in a faster increase in mining costs. Mining costs should always move towards equilibrium with the price of Bitcoin. In other words, new miners will join the network as long as the mining cost is lower than the price of Bitcoin and in doing so they will drive up the cost of mining. Within the next ten years we will probably start seeing permanent reductions in the total network income and consequentially its security due to a combination of the stabilization of Bitcoin's price and miners operating with a small margin. Most people are acting like they are absolutely sure this will not happen, and I don't like it one bit.

&amp;#x200B;

**What could be done to mitigate a potential degradation of network security?**

1. Implement a flexible issuance schedule.
2. Reduce the cost of operation (eliminate electricity and specialized equipment costs related to mining).
3. Maximize non-subsidized income:
   1. Increase layer-1 network transaction capacity.
   2. Increase layer-2 network throughput amplification and ease of use.
   3. Increase the utility of the network in order to raise demand.

With the exception of item 3.2, these are all things  that the Bitcoin community is valiantly opposed to changing. Love or hate it, these are all being worked on Ethereum. It may fail to execute it, but what if it doesn't?",cryptocurrency

My retired parent is refinancing her property down to a lower interest rate, there is some savings for her but her primary thought process is that she wants the interest rate to be as low as possible for me so that when I inherit the property its an easy rentable property that has better returns. This sounds fine to me but I cant find any clear details if this would actually work out.

My wife and I are planning to live there the next 3-5 years and then use this home as a rental if/when we move into a larger home. I work in real estate and property management so rentals are appealing to me and I can self manage. A new 30 year or 20 year seems appealing as we are looking to have children in about a year or two (lower payment is nice). Here is what I am weighing:

&amp;#x200B;

* 30 year refinance pros: Lower payment (should save about $200 per month), if and when we rent it out it should provide us a nice buffer to cover non-major wear/tear maintenance costs and vacancy and setting aside some funds for larger capital expenditures monthly. Estimating $150 cash flow per month after all of this.
* 30 year cons: Takes longer to pay off than a 15 or 20 year.

&amp;#x200B;

* 20 year pros: New rate leaves my monthly payment basically unchanged but pays off the loan 10 years sooner than a new 30 year.
* 20 year cons: Doesn't lower the monthly payment for the rental scenario but the rent should still cover the mortgage (PITI), vacancy, maintenance, increased taxes (no homestead on this property if it is not my primary home), ect. Shouldn't have to reach into personal funds unless the maintenance is more major. Estimating break even to $50 cash flow per month.

&amp;#x200B;

* 15 year pros: Lowest interest rate, quickest loan pay off
* 15 year cons: My total payment would increase by about $200 (still manageable to pay). As a rental the cash flow numbers are not great. Rent would cover the mortgage (PITI) but maintenance would come out of pocket.",finance
personalfinance,Should I overpay my mortgage or student loan?,"I've tried researching this myself but I've either got covid for the second time or just a very annoying cold and my brain is too fuzzy.

The interest rate on my mortgage is fixed 1.99% for the next 2 years then after that I don't know until I choose a new product. I owe £89,000 over 23 years with up to 10% overpayments without being charged. 

The interest on my student loan is 2.6%. I currently owe £5000 but I'm hoping to do a master's next year and will potentially need the full loan of £10,000 so total debt may be up to £15,000 (I don't know if this interest rate stays the same)

I'm only looking at small, one off payments throughout the year maybe not even £1000 a year total.

I've seen that the best advice is to pay off the debt with the highest interest rate which in my case is the student loan. However I can't help but wince at the yearly interests on my mortgage vs student loan which right now is £1770 vs £130.

Also knowing that I may be borrowing even more from the student loan makes me feel that paying off a few hundred quid now is pointless, and at least a mortgage is equity.

cybersecurity,Beating Imposter Syndrome - Landing the Job,"Hey Friends!

This is kind of a long story, but I wanted to share it with you. I spend a fair amount of time helping people overcome imposter syndrome so I wanted to share how I overcame mine. Enjoy the read, if you have ever thought that you aren't good enough, hopefully this convinces you otherwise.

So I just completed running what was probably one of the most anxiety saturated and stressful situations of my life. It started out as a very innocent exchange on LinkedIn, and ended up being the most significant career move that I have made in my life. I fought my imposter syndrome every step of the way, and won. I hope that some of you find inspiration in the following post to never give in to self-doubt and push through some of the barriers that people in this field construct for themselves.

To start at the beginning, let me share some things about myself. Two years ago I was an enlisted member in the military. I had worked in IT for the entirety of my military career, but it was mostly telecom until the last few years where I was a network architect. When I was about 6 months out from separation I tried my hand at the OSCP. I had always been interested in tinkering with systems and figured that getting involved in cybersecurity was a logical choice for both my interests and career progression. I completely underestimated the road that I had put myself on. The OSCP was day after day knowledge bombs, I gave so much of my life to earning the knowledge in the course. It was a learning experience like nothing else, it fed my curiosity and challenged my ability to critically think through technical problems. I was devastated when I failed. It was the first exam I had ever failed in my life.

Defeated, I picked myself up and re-evaluated my path. I was determined to succeed and get into this field. The immediate problem I was facing was one that we all have, time. I had very little time after my failure to rebuild a plan that would make me hirable upon my separation from the military. I had an amazing stroke of luck and was accepted to a SANS academy. Energized by this, I attended the academy and was able to earn my GSEC, GCIH, and GPEN. My resume was starting to take form, I saw that I was getting connected to the right people. I needed something that I felt would put me over the top for entry level consideration so I went for my GXPN. Yikes, I won't go too much into it, but that cert took me way beyond what I thought I was capable of doing. I earned the cert, walked away with ample confidence, and began the full-time job hunt.

I was picked up relatively quickly by a small sub-contractor that was providing IT services to a larger, more prominent contractor. I wanted to be a penetration tester, it was written all over everything that I had put out there about myself. Well, I ended up joining a Red Team. I knew very little about the differences between Red Teaming and Pen Testing at the time, but figured I was able to command enough knowledge that I would be able to supplement my deficiencies with some on-the-job training. This was more or less true, it took me a while to get the hang of all the other stuff (Physical Pen Testing, Face-to-face social engineering, long term persistence operations) but I had just enough skill to contribute and learn.

And for a year and some change, it was amazing. I was a Red Teamer. It was the best job I have ever had by far. The management was amazing, the team was capable of anything, the energy and enthusiasm were high, and the productivity was off the charts. Now coming from the military, getting a job like this, where I was able to work independently, select my own projects, collaborate with brilliant and seasoned professionals, was literally my wildest dream come true.

**But that's not where the story ends.**

One day late in 2020, I was sitting at my computer working on a project and I kind of zoned out. I was staring at my monitor and received a notification from LinkedIn. It snapped me out of it and I went to the reflexive motion of checking my feeds, just kind of on autopilot. Surfing through my dashboard, I noticed a significant uptick in traffic to my profile. I post often on LinkedIn with cybersecurity content and something tripped a wire apparently.

Now, something that I regularly do on LinkedIn is connect with people. When I see that someone checks me out, I throw the connection request and just a little blurb to the tune of:

*""Hi! thanks for checking out my page. I just wanted to make a connection to let you know that I am always up for talking cybersecurity with other professionals on this platform. Have a great one and see you around!""*

So, I just went down that road and started adding connections. More often than not I get a courteous response and some post engagement and that's the end of it. Well this time, I got a bite. I connected with a gentlemen that I ended up chatting with for about an hour. We mainly talked about cybersecurity in general, red team operations, and COVID-19. Nothing really amazing, but a professional conversation none the less. We closed the conversation on good terms and I thought that was the end of it.

**It was not.**

The next morning I received a call from a recruiter from another large and prominent contractor. This was completely unsolicited, I do not usually take cold calls from recruiters directly because I prefer to start the process with emails, probably because it stresses me out way less to be able to have a measured exchange in writing over couple days, but I digress.

That was not the case with this recruiter, and I quickly realized I did not have that option here.

The Recruiter informed me that he was reaching out to me because I had apparently had a conversation on LinkedIn with Vice President of IT Services for this company. While the recruiter was revealing this to me, I simultaneously looked up the LinkedIn Profile of the gentlemen I spoke with.

Everything happened really fast, I have never had a panic attack before, but I think that's what happened. I had managed to chat my happy a\*\* right out of my comfort zone. My stomach felt like it dropped through the floor, I couldn't rest my eyes on anything, I couldn't understand what the recruiter was saying over the phone. I felt like I just went CyberPunk 2077 on PS4.

Breathe, just keeping breathing. Slow and deep. I asked the recruiter if I could call them back, so I could reboot because my buffer was completely overflowing. I got ahold of myself and did just that. Except now I had a gorilla on my back that would not be ignored, a gorilla that goes by the name ""Imposter Syndrome"". I recognized it though and that was the foothold I needed to unravel that beast. I didn't know how I was going to do it, I just knew that if I listened to the gorilla I was going to miss something important.

I called the recruiter back, and just listened to what they had to say. They wanted to set up a panel interview. I have never done a panel before and all the horror stories that I had heard were immediately summoned into mind. Before I could get in my own way, I agreed to the panel. I asked if we could schedule it ASAP because I knew that I wouldn't be getting a good nights sleep again until this was behind me. The soonest availability that they had was 3 days out. I had bungled this so badly up to this point, I didn't even ask about the specifics of the position, just that it was Red Team related.

Those were probably 3 of the worst days that I had ever experienced. I would not allow myself to be confident, I would not allow myself to think that I was good enough for this job. It was virtually impossible to think that I earned this chance on my own merit. So, naturally I defaulted to the idea that I had somehow misrepresented myself and was about to be professionally humiliated in a really bad way. Compounded by the fact that I was so embarrassed about my episode on the phone, I wouldn't even call back to get additional details about the position.

That was the gorilla. Just sitting on my back, amplifying self-doubt, keeping me ""safe"", keeping me from thinking about growth because I had it so good where I was at.

Now this is the vicious cycle that imposter syndrome presents. Anxiety, doubt, and isolation. I looked in the mirror and told myself that I would not allow this continue. I think there is some value to taking that first step, making that statement to yourself that you won't allow this to continue. My statement was empty, I didn't believe it myself at the time, but I committed to not listening to the gorilla anymore. I was going to do anything but what that gorilla was telling me to do.

I took the panel. I usually try to brush up on different domains of knowledge and current events before I interview, but not this time. The only reason I had to support this choice was that these people only know me for who I am at this point, and what I share on LinkedIn. There was no resume provided, no application submitted. They are after me, not the other way around, and they were going to get just that. Just me.

The panel felt like a roller coaster. This was my first interview with a panel, first time interviewing during COVID-19, first time ever talking to these people video face-to-face. The panel of 5 consisted of the VP, 2x Program Mangers, Director of the Security Operations Center, and the Principal on one of their largest contracts. All the big players, and for what? some random nobody that just starts shooting off chats on LinkedIn.

But, I had one very distinct advantage. I could play the role of myself for these people, they knew what they were after and all I had to do was get out of my own way and have a conversation. The panel kicked off, I let go of my ego, fears, doubts, and just tried to project the most accurate version of who I was as a person. Now, this was quite the effort for me, the gorilla was there the whole time letting me know how out of my depth I was, and I had no business with these organizational leaders, that I was just racing to fail.

But, I ignored the gorilla. I took all the negative energy and did my best to turn it into excitement and enthusiasm, and it worked. I was able to behave like a human that wasn't facing a firing squad.

It was 4 painfully long days that I had to wait. Something was different this time though, I knew that I made it through, I felt like things went well, and I resigned to the fact that I couldn't change anything at this point.

Then the call came. I Saw the caller ID and the world kinda stopped again. Panic attack incoming. Breath, focus, pick up the phone.

I don't think I really processed everything that they were saying completely at the time, I was in low grade shock most likely. But when the mist in my mind cleared, I realized that I got the job!

I was chosen to become the Red Team Operations Lead for an organization of over 200,000 people that does business all over the globe. They chose me to build their program, and staff it, and run it. I couldn't have imagined this for myself even in my wildest dreams.

I got off the phone and felt hot tears streaming down my face. Release. Not because I got the job, but because I wouldn't allow myself to be defeated by my self-doubt and insecurity. I did it, I beat back that damn gorilla and was able to grab ahold of what I am certain will be the most significant career move of my life so far.

**I won, and I know how to win again when the time comes.**

I wholeheartedly believe that anyone can do this. You don't have to be completely self-confident, but you do need to realize when you aren't giving yourself enough credit for how brilliant you really are. Other people will see your brilliance, and it's ok to let them. Your dreams are out there waiting to happen, make sure that you aren't in the way when that train comes through, because the one opponent that is the hardest to defeat...is yourself.

personalfinance,Why is my Roth deductions lower for the current pay period?,"I work for the federal government, and I have my Roth TSP set to 16% of every paycheck. (I increased it from 5% a few months ago). Normally, this is $418.69 of every paycheck that I contribute. 

For the last pay period of the year they only took $324.48, even though it’s still set to 16%. My year to date contributions are $5411.56, so no where near the $19,000 annual maximum.

Any ideas about why the full amount was not contributed? Nothing else on my paycheck changed; my take home pay is just $94 higher.

Edit: I used some special COVID leave category a few months ago because I was told I had to stay home for illness. Apparently they can’t deduct TSP contributions from that type of pay, so this was retroactively applied to account for that. 

Very strange they didn’t do it in the same pay period, but at least there’s solid reasoning. Thanks all!",finance
personalfinance,Student loans (avalanche) but deferred?,"I just graduated from school and will be starting my job in March.

In the meantime, I figured I would try and make a plan as to which loans to pay off first. I got a graduation gift of $10,000 (with the stipulation that I can only use it to pay off my student loans, otherwise I don't get the money.) 

I was looking at the avalanche method, but I'm not sure how it would work in my situation since my highest loan (5.05%) is a federal subsidized loan and is in deferment for 6 months. My loan info is below. I've been paying the interest on the unsubsidized and private loans while in school.

Loan Type | Interest Rate | Amount | Deferred?
---|---|----|----
Federal Subsidized | 3.76 | 5000 | Y
Federal Subsidized | 4.45 | 2750 | Y
Federal Subsidized | 5.05 | 5500 | Y
Federal Unsubsidized | 4.45 | 1000 | N*
Private (recently refinanced) | 3.99 | 14000 | N

*is currently deferred, but might not be come February 2021.

My gut says to put the 10k in the private since it's bigger and its collecting interest, but I wanted to see if there would be a smarter play here. My goal is to pay these off as quickly as possible. Any advice would be welcomed, thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Best way to pay off mortgage early?,"Looking for advice on what the 'smartest' way is to pay off my mortgage early. I know there's debate on PF whether it's worth paying off a mortgage early based on low interest rates but my personal preference would be to relieve the stress of having the debt. 

I currently rent out 2 of the bedrooms and use the extra cash to make extra monthly payments. But would it make more sense to invest that money then make a big lump sum payment? If so, where do I look at make that investment? How do I do that? I've browsed Charles Schwab's Intelligent Portfolio but am not sure if that's the right choice.

My remaining mortgage balance is $120,000 at a 3.25% interest rate, with a monthly payment of ~$1870. Extra payments have been $1200/month. Original amount was a $200,000 loan at a 15 year rate.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Refinance Question - Newly home buyer,"As the title says, we recently purchased a home through navy federal. We closed on the house in March the day of the pandemic. Unfortunately we were locked into a higher interest rate of 4.625. I have the navy federal military choice loan I believe. Since then rates have went down to 2% for a fixed conventional loan and 3.3% for the home buyers choice loan.

I was wondering if it would be smart to refinance the home. Loan amount on home was 152,500. Still owe around 151k. Plan on living here for 10+ years, most likely until retirement in 30 years though. 

Also, if it requires closing cost, could that be rolled into the loan amount? Just wondering what the best options would be. If we could afford to pay closing costs we would, but we just started saving towards our emergency fund and I increased my retirement amount.",finance
World_Politics,No Hope Ahead for Palestinians,"By Brian Cloughley at Strategic Culture Foundation

It is difficult to come to terms with the mentality of those who would willingly destroy the dwellings of poor people struggling to make a living in a cruel harsh world. In this day and age when we, the human race, are supposed to be at a peak of civilisation, it is appalling that there are people who are prepared and willing to drive a bulldozer through the home of a fellow human thereby rendering an entire family destitute. It is disturbing (to put it mildly) to realise that this sort of barbaric behaviour illustrates the policy and posture of an intensely religious and supposedly democratic country.

The state of Israel encourages persecution of Palestinians by undertaking or condoning obliteration of homes and agricultural facilities. It is recorded that so far this year 689 Palestinian structures, properties and animal shelters have been bulldozed and destroyed by Israelis, and on November 5 the European Union issued a statement noting that in the previous week Israeli forces demolished more than 70 structures, including residential, livelihood and sanitation facilities, belonging to 11 Palestinian families. The EU is concerned that 52 Palestinian schools are also under threat of demolition, including one in the central West Bank co-funded by the EU and “calls for protection of children, including ensuring their right to education in a safe and secure school environment.”

There is no chance that Israel will ever approve of education for Palestinian children. The Israeli state wants to eradicate all traces of Palestinians from the lands seized by Israel over many years, and if this includes demolishing schools, then so be it. The EU rightly declares that “Education is a basic human right that should be protected and maintained” and “reiterates its call on Israel to halt all such demolitions, including of EU-funded structures, in particular in light of the humanitarian impact of the current coronavirus pandemic.”

But so far as eradicating Palestinians is concerned, the coronavirus pandemic is indeed a boon and a blessing for Israel, because it has created a dreadful crisis. The UN Children’s Fund warns that “The protracted protection crisis in the State of Palestine, which has been exacerbated by the coronavirus disease pandemic, has continued to impact children. More than 2.2 million people need humanitarian aid and over 1 million children living in the Gaza Strip have difficulty accessing essential services.”

But Israel’s reaction to the Palestinians’ humanitarian crisis is to carry on destroying their fields, their farms, their fruit trees, their animals, their living-shacks and their schools.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is a dedicated agency that does as much as it can to alleviate suffering around this horrible world, but it can’t do anything about the misery of the Palestinian people other than record the facts about their persecution. All that its Coordinator for occupied Palestinian territory, Yvonne Helle, could do in November after “Israeli authorities demolished homes and other structures and destroyed belongings in the Palestinian community of Humsa Al Bqai’a” was to issue a statement to “remind all parties that the extensive destruction of property and the forcible transfer of protected people in an occupied territory are grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention. While assuring that the humanitarian community stands ready to support all those who have been displaced or otherwise affected, I strongly reiterate our call to Israel to immediately halt unlawful demolitions.” And Israel, as usual, paid not the slightest attention, but revved up the bulldozers for the next round of destruction of Palestinian homes.

And Israel paid no attention to the five (non-binding) UN General Assembly Resolutions of 2 December, “one of which cited the illegality of annexing any part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.” Further, the Assembly approved the resolution on “Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine” and “called for the full respect for international law. It also called for the promotion of human security, the de-escalation of the situation [in Palestine], the exercise of restraint and the establishment of a stable environment conducive to the pursuit of peace.”

Global support was overwhelming, with 145 nations favouring “peaceful settlement” of the situation in occupied Palestine. The seven countries voting against this call for peace were the United States, Israel, Australia and Canada plus the nonentities of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia and Nauru which have to jump to Washington’s bidding lest they lose financial support. It is most regrettable that Australia and Canada have joined the pro-Israel, anti-Palestine lobby whose leader is the U.S. which under Trump has spent the past four years fostering Israel’s campaign to eradicate the Palestinians.

The New York Times summed up Washington’s attitude by headlining that “For Netanyahu and Israel, Trump’s Gifts Kept on Coming”, and this was no exaggeration. First of all it was pointed out that on November 20 the Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard became free to go to Israel after serving his well-deserved prison term for betraying some of America’s deepest secrets. He wasn’t even spying for principle; he spied for money. As Encyclopaedia Britannica records, “Pollard claimed to have been motivated by ‘sectarianism’, though Israeli agents had agreed to pay him $30,000 each year for a period of 10 years and had already paid him more than $45,000.” He is loathsome and contemptible, and his release was warmly welcomed by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu who declared “We are waiting for you, even during the time of the coronavirus, with open arms, and you will receive the genuine embrace of the Israeli people . . . I truly want to congratulate you that your nightmare is over and you can return home, to Israel. It will truly be a big moment, a big moment for us all.”

The spy-welcoming Netanyahu is the prime minister who is so energetically supported by Washington, to the extent that “the Trump administration cut all funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees across the Middle East.” Trump also stopped the U.S. Agency for International Development providing $200 million to support other efforts to help the Palestinian people. The financial punishment he imposed included cancellation of $25 million for Palestinian hospitals and $10 million for Israeli-Palestinian coexistence efforts.

The message is clear, in that Israel could get away with anything, so far as Trump Washington was concerned. He and his adherents have been unfailingly anti-Palestinian, and Israel could therefore persecute Palestinians without the slightest fear of international justice being applied. Secretary of State Pompeo paid a valedictory visit to Israel at the end of November and, as reported in the NYT, “announced that the United States would henceforth view the international boycott-Israel movement as anti-Semitic. He stopped on the occupied West Bank, becoming the most senior American official to visit one of Israel’s settlements, which much of the world considers a violation of international law.”

So what will the Biden administration do? Will he continue Trump’s support of Israel’s determination to eradicate the Palestinian people?

Although he may not be as vicious and pitiless as Trump, he is no friend of the Palestinians, and it is significant that Biden’s victory was greeted with a Netanyahu tweet saying “Joe, we’ve had a long &amp; warm personal relationship for nearly 40 years, and I know you as a great friend of Israel. I look forward to working with both of you to further strengthen the special alliance between the U.S. and Israel.”

There is no hope ahead for Palestinians.",finance

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has filed an action against Ripple Labs Inc. and two of its executives, who are also significant security holders, alleging that they raised over $1.3 billion through an unregistered, ongoing digital asset securities offering.

According to the SEC's complaint, Ripple; Christian Larsen, the company's co-founder, executive chairman of its board, and former CEO; and Bradley Garlinghouse, the company's current CEO, raised capital to finance the company's business. The complaint alleges that Ripple raised funds, beginning in 2013, through the sale of digital assets known as XRP in an unregistered securities offering to investors in the U.S. and worldwide. Ripple also allegedly distributed billions of XRP in exchange for non-cash consideration, such as labor and market-making services. According to the complaint, in addition to structuring and promoting the XRP sales used to finance the company's business, Larsen and Garlinghouse also effected personal unregistered sales of XRP totaling approximately $600 million. The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to register their offers and sales of XRP or satisfy any exemption from registration, in violation of the registration provisions of the federal securities laws.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,10 year fixed rate mortgage - a good idea?,"Hi

I'm seeking to buy a new place and arranging my mortgage tomorrow. Ive been looking at mortgage products and there is a 10 year fixed rate mortgage available for 2.69%, as opposed to a 5 year mortgage of 1.69%.

personalfinance,Sell Long Term Capital Gains and rebuy to take advantage of 0% tax rate?,"I'm thinking I should have talked to a tax specialist first, but here I am.

I've done really well on personal investments this year. Several of them will be classified as long term capital gains. In Robinhood, I'm up about 210% this year, a little over 115k in gains. I have a previous investment in a separate fidelity account from buying AAPL 15 years ago that has obviously done really well and is pretty much all gains at close to 30k.  

I'd like to sell some stock as my understanding is all longterm capital gains up to 80k in income will be taxed at 0%. In other words, at the very least, I should sell and rebuy. I don't need the money right now unless I felt like I wanted to pay off all remaining debt, but at such a low interest rate, I see no point right now.

Background: My income will be around 56k this year, my wife made 18k before having a baby.  These are pre deduction amounts (gross). My deductions before taxes on my paycheck (HSA &amp; other items) will add up to be around 8k and 1k for my wife. 

Debt: Townhome:  est. value is at 250k, we have a 105k in mortgage, 11 yrs left @ 3.25 APR   
Car: 32k (2019 Tesla Model 3), refinanced at 1.99% interest rate.   
No other debt, just revolving credit cards that we pay off each month.

Is there anything else I should be aware of? It seems like most people I'm around don't talk about this tax situation and had I been more aware, I could have been pulling out my gains when I was younger. Between my wife and I, we'll show 74k in gross income. Last year we were at 82k gross income and 56k taxable income for our 2019 taxes. So I figure it would be a good idea to pull around 25k-30k out in gains this year.",finance
personalfinance,"Buying a home - Initial closing disclosure shows no seller credits and applies them to the taxes instead. This removes ~$10,000 of my tax deductions?","I did my best to make a concise title, but oh well.

So I'm buying new construction from a building company, and it's time to close. They offered $15k of seller incentives for using their pet lender, so I'm using them. I just got the initial closing disclosure, and it's set up way differently than I expected.

My understanding is that a normal closing disclosure should have everything the Buyer pays in the buyer-paid column (title costs, fees, interest rate points, property tax, etc), and everything the Seller pays in the Seller column (in my case, that's just the state tax for a first time homebuyer in Maryland), and then total buyer charges - seller incentive = cash to close. But instead, my closing disclosure shows $0 in seller credits, and instead has $15k spread around the ""Seller Paid"" column. All property taxes, prepaid interest, and title fees are paid by the seller and what was left of the $15k went to interest rate points. So instead of a seller credit at the end, there's $100 here, $4,000 there, all spread around. The math adds up fine, it all ends up being $15k so no big deal right?

But I got to thinking about tax deductions. The way they shifted things around, they're ""paying"" about $10k in real estate taxes and interest. On paper, I should be the one paying those taxes and claiming them as tax deductions, but instead they're the ones paying for them by shifting costs over to the Seller's side.

Since I'm not paying those taxes, am I losing out on a huge tax deduction from the prepaid interest, interest rate points, and state/city/county taxes that aren't paid by me? I've still got time to get them to change things, but if I'm wrong and overly paranoid then I don't want to waste anybody's time with changing paperwork.",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage Question - Early Pay or Refinance,"Hi! 

Looking for some advice.
I moved to the US from Canada 3.5 years ago for work. Part of the relocation package I accepted allowed me to sell my home in Canada and buy a new one in the US. However, this meant I was forced to accept a mortgage interest rate of 4% (due to having no credit history). My loan is worth ~$175k. 

As it stands now, my mortgage is my only debt. I have roughly $30k in my checking, $175k in my savings and another $100k sitting in Canada.

I called the bank today. There is no fee to pay off the mortgage early. I can also refinance at 2.75%, 30yr and closing costs to do so would be ~$2.5k.

Questions:

A) does it make sense to refinance?
B) does it make sense to pay off a large portion of the mortgage early? 
C) should I say status quo?

personalfinance,Is a 0.5% reduction on a private student loan refinance worth it?,Currently I have a private student loan totaling 49k at 4.05% interest rate. Browsing around I got an offer from Earnest to refinance to 3.5%. I’d be keeping the same term length. My plan is to knock out the loan within 2 years. Is there any downside to going through the process of refinancing?,finance
financialindependence,Thoughts on buy and hold on margin at 2.5% interest rate,"Very interested in this community's thoughts on buying and holding a position in BRK.B now that margin rates have dropped at Robinhood from 5% to 2.5%. I expect a negative reaction, and even some quotes of Warren Buffett saying not to invest with margin. But I'm adding this post because there are some inherent advantages of pursuing FIRE that I think could make a small dose of this strategy a way to accelerate time to FI. For someone with no debt, a high savings rate, and an existing balance in a taxable account that I don't intend to withdraw any time soon, I'm wondering about the financial risks this position would expose me to.

Using round numbers here's an example:

\- Current account balance of $150,000 invested 100% between 4 individual stocks
- Margin allowance of +$125,000
- Invest $30,000 on margin in BRK.B indefinitely, no trading, no options, just buy and hold
- Total invested amount: $180,000
- Maintenance margin: $80,000 (MM is the amount of capital required in the account before needing to deposit more cash).

I understand this magnifies risk and increases downside in a down market. The goal would not be to take advantage of all of the leverage available, both to reduce risk of a margin call and increase the sleep at night factor.

**Upside:**  
\- Pretty simple, if BRK.B can grow more than 2.7% per year (2.5% interest plus $60/year for Gold membership), I come out ahead financially. This isn't a very high bar.

**Risks:**  
\- BRK.B falling precipitously along with all other stocks in the portfolio. The holdings would need to collectively fall by 55% in order to go to a maintenance margin situation. This could happen due to systematic risk (e.g. recession) or unsystematic risk (Warren Buffett passing away). I think these risks are somewhat mitigated by the margin of safety Berkshire enjoys, $100b in cash, and commitment to buy back shares.  
\- Margin rate increasing at Robinhood. If the interest rate increases, the hurdle rate is higher.  
\- Emotional attachment. Investing borrowed money could increase stress without discipline, and that has it's own cost even if I come out ahead financially.  
\- Getting greedy if this works near term, overextending to use additional leverage, and then encountering large losses

Again I don't expect positive reviews but I want them to be a little more reasoned than ""DON'T DO IT!"" What am I missing here? Has anyone else pursuing FIRE done this? How is this different from, for instance, keeping $30,000 in your mortgage at 2.5% interest rate while having $30,000 invested in a stock?

Thanks for reading!

Ripple,Response to SEC Attack from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and lawyers,"[https://ripple.com/insights/the-secs-attack-on-crypto-in-the-united-states/](https://ripple.com/insights/the-secs-attack-on-crypto-in-the-united-states/)

 Here’s the note I sent to Ripple employees yesterday – we remain confident after reviewing the SEC’s complaint today that we are on the right side of the law and of history.

Also – more reaction to today’s filing from our lawyers: 

* “The SEC is completely wrong on the facts and law and we are confident we will ultimately prevail before a neutral fact-finder. XRP, the third largest virtual currency with billions of dollars in trading every day, is a currency like the SEC has deemed Bitcoin and Ether, and is not an investment contract. This case bears no resemblance to the initial coin offering cases the SEC has previously brought and stretches the Howey standard beyond recognition.” Andrew Ceresney, Debevoise &amp; Plimpton
* “This complaint is wrong as a matter of law. Other major branches of the U.S. government, including the Justice Department and the Treasury Department’s FinCen, have already determined that XRP is a currency. Transactions in XRP thus fall outside the scope of the federal securities laws. This is not the first time the SEC has tried to go beyond its statutory authority. The courts have corrected it before and will do so again.” Michael Kellogg, Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel &amp; Frederick

Hi Ripplers,

In my 5+ years at Ripple, I’ve seen an incredible amount of progress, innovation and growth. This year alone, we’ve brought to market new products and features leveraging XRP, like[ Line of Credit](https://ripple.com/line-of-credit/), enabling a better payments experience for our customers – and their customers. Interestingly enough, after all these years, it’s the two things that have NOT changed that stand out to me the most: 1) our vision, the[ Internet of Value](https://ripple.com/insights/the-internet-of-value-what-it-means-and-how-it-benefits-everyone/) and 2) the fact that XRP is a currency, and not a security. It’s unequivocally the best digital asset for payments. As you read on, know that today, maybe more than ever, I continue to vehemently believe this. 

We’ve always said that there is a lack of regulatory clarity for crypto in the US, and the SEC here in the United States has sat back and watched for years. In fact, the discussion around why XRP is a currency (and not a security) is one we have been having with the SEC for nearly three years and yet we’ve never been met with clarity. We have, however explained that XRP is not a security because, among other things:

1. XRP is not an “investment contract.” XRP holders do not share in the profits of Ripple or receive dividends, nor do they have voting rights or other corporate rights. Purchasers receive nothing from their purchase of XRP except the asset. In fact the vast majority of XRP holders have no connection or relationship with Ripple whatsoever.  
2. Ripple (our company) has shareholders; if you want to invest in Ripple, you do not buy XRP but rather shares in Ripple.
3. Unlike securities, the market value of XRP has not been correlated with Ripple’s activities. Instead, the price of XRP is correlated to the movement of other virtual currencies.

As you all know, we have always tried to over-communicate, be as transparent as possible, and explain how we think about the long-term value of XRP. We have always worked to partner with regulators. We have proactively partnered globally – and even here in the US, cooperating and acting in good faith with the SEC. Even while these conversations have dragged on, we were ready and willing to continue the dialogue. Unfortunately, in this lame duck status as Chairman Jay Clayton exits, he has decided to make very serious allegations, which suggest that Ripple, Chris Larsen and I have violated the Securities Act. I expect the SEC will share that filing publicly in the next couple of days, so I wanted to give you all a heads up, **but please keep this internal-only for now**. You should also know and expect that the SEC will likely do everything they can to paint Ripple, Chris and me in the worst possible light – quotes could be taken out of context, personal details may be shared, etc.  

To be clear, this is all based on their illogical claim that XRP is, in their view, somehow the functional equivalent of a share of stock. What’s more, for them to say that XRP has been a security all along and that Ripple, Chris and I should have known makes absolutely no sense… particularly when the US Treasury and US Department of Justice have long ago concluded that XRP is a currency. Our entire AML/BSA compliance program is built on the fact that XRP is a currency! When you marry this with the fact that many other G20 governments call XRP a currency, it is truly confounding that the SEC would take this step. 

Chris and I had the option to settle separately. We could do that, and it would all be behind us. NOT happening. That’s how confident Chris and I are that we are right. We will aggressively fight – and prove our case – through this case we will get clear rules of the road for the industry here in the U.S. **We are not only on the right side of the law, but we will be on the right side of history.** 

Let me be clear: Ripple, Chris and I may be the ones named in the filing, but this is an assault on crypto at large. In this case, XRP is a proxy for every other ‘alt-coin’ in the space. From there, you have a snowball effect; this isn’t good news for any market maker, exchanges like Coinbase, etc. This sets a terrible industry-wide precedent for any company working with a digital asset. With this allegation, coupled with the SEC’s “good housekeeping seal of approval” bestowed upon ETH and BTC only (directly benefiting [China](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/pools)), they’re creating an unfair advantage to companies here in the US – and dramatically benefiting BTC and ETH. It’s just incredible that the SEC, a U.S. regulator is in the business of picking winners in this industry (or really any industry) and disadvantaging companies here in the US. 

Interestingly, Jay Clayton has been incredibly focused on showing a legacy of supporting innovation. Despite what he would like the public to think, it’s obvious the SEC is not at all committed to fostering innovation in the digital asset space. With this behavior, **the SEC is engaged in an all-out attack on the crypto industry.** That will be Jay Clayton’s true legacy. 

It’s incredibly frustrating. There’s a massive opportunity up for grabs to be the global leader and win this[ new technological and economic cold war](https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/513082-the-tech-cold-war-is-here-and-the-us-isnt-winning). Instead, the SEC is way out of step with what other governments are doing, ignoring the very positive macro trendline and incredible potential (and existing utility) of crypto. The crypto industry can and will thrive – but this will push innovation outside of the US. It’s very interesting, but not surprising, that the lame duck Trump administration is making consequential decisions that will jam up the Biden administration… which will increase the focus on consumer protection and transparency. The timing is really quite remarkable. 

Like I said, I think the claims are misguided and defy basic logic. Regardless, I’ve obviously never had an assertion like this before, and am taking it very seriously. I hope that you all understand the gravity of the situation too.

What I DON’T want is for you to worry. We will get through this, and we will prove our case in court. We have a phenomenal legal team and like I said, we are on the right side of the law to begin with. Know, however, that the legal system is slow, and this is just the beginning of a long, civil process. 

No matter what twist and turns are ahead, we will stand by our employees, shareholders and customers. It’s still business as usual – we need to stay focused and continue to deliver the value that hundreds of customers around the globe have come to expect from Ripple. Although the SEC’s decision brings an even greater sense of urgency to our decision whether to move our HQ outside the US, we also look forward to working with the new Biden administration to see if we can find a rational path forward here. 

Nothing will fundamentally alter our trajectory. We are extremely fortunate to be in a position that we can fight this, and aggressively defend our company, this team, our products and – at a fundamental level, the industry as a whole. 

Best,

Bitcoin,How FIAT might survive and become as desirable as bitcoin,"So I watched an interview with Raoul Pal today. He is obviously a mega bitcoin bull. But he was asked to play devils advocate by the interviewer and come up with a macro economic outcome in which he would dump his position.

The jist of it is, for governments to print their way out of the crises we find ourselves in with fiat, then a government needs to print orders of magnitude more than they do now. But, if all governments around the world did this at the same time and by an equal amount, then that doesn't disadvantage anyone as all is equal. 

He goes further to say this is probably what will happen, with the IMF creating a cabal or bucket of world currencies, and to be a member each government will have to print x amount of fiat and follow certain rules. The interview talks about it in much more detail and how fiat can become as desirable as bitcoin by being essentially as low inflation wise.

So if that is what is on the horizen.. thoughts? Are you concerned that the argument for bitcoin as a hedge against inflation might be taken away from us with a radical new monetary policy globally?",cryptocurrency

stocks,Is there a correlation between federal interest rates and the performance of growth and value stocks?,"I looked at the performance of the  VUG (Vanguard Growth ETF) and VTV (Vanguard Value ETF) over the past 16 years, and the only times Value has given a better yield than Growth is between 2004 and 2008, where interest rates were around 5%. However, when interest rates were 0%, Growth has performed better over value tremendously.

If you had invested your money in VUG instead of VTV 10 years ago where the interest rates for the majority of the decade was 0%, you would have made 190% more money.

The Feds are saying they want to keep interest rates at 0% through 2022. 

With this in mind, why should people invest in value companies at this point? The dividends that value companies give compared to growth companies is a slap in the face compared to their rates of return.

investing,ARKK and ARKG in a taxable account &amp; tax on capital gain distributions,"ARKK and ARKG are actively managed ETFs. I wonder what would be the tax consequences of capital gain distributions for these ETFs, or at least a rough estimate of them, with a taxable account.

I am aware that ARK Invest has a pretty high turnover in their funds. Because of this, the majority of distributed capital gains is likely to be subject to short-term capital gain taxes. You can find ARK Invest projections of the 2020 distribution on this link:

[https://etfs.ark-funds.com/hubfs/1\_Download\_Files\_ETF\_Website/Performance-and-Other/Capital\_Gains\_Distribution\_ARK\_ETFs.pdf](https://etfs.ark-funds.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ETF_Website/Performance-and-Other/Capital_Gains_Distribution_ARK_ETFs.pdf)

If I understand well, when a distribution occurs, the NAV is reduced by the same amount. With tax-deferred accounts, you can reinvest the entire distribution and you will not lose anything. However, with a taxable account, you need to pay taxes on these distributions. I am in California and short-term capital gain taxes can be nasty (around 50% in federal and state taxes for high income earners). Although ARKK distribution will be only 1.75% of the NAV this year, high earners would have to pay around 0.7% of the NAV in short-term taxes. This does not seem like a lot, but in a less favorable scenario where the distribution is 10% of the NAV and all gains are subject to short-term capital tax (a bit extreme and unrealistic case, but hey... who knows...), you would need to pay 5% of the NAV in taxes, which sounds horrific to me.

Does any of you own a significant amount of ARKK and ARKG shares in a taxable account? Can you share your experience with taxes on capital gain distributions with us?",finance

economy,"After destroying its economy, Erdogan is indebting Turkey","In the last two and a half years, Turkey's economic situation has deteriorated sharply, and just when it was struggling to get back on track, after the recession following the currency crisis of the summer of 2018, the pandemic emergency, and the foreign military campaigns stopped its recovery. In the second quarter of 2020, in the months of the main production activities and international connections closure, the Turkish GDP contracted by 11% compared to the previous quarter, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates a contraction in growth of 5% at the end of 2020.

To avoid the political and financial collapse, Erdogan took out a loan from the World Bank. That shows the inability of Erdogan and Turkey to secure even a very small amount. According to the World Bank, $300 million Rapid Support for Micro and Small Enterprises Project for Turkey, implemented by the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Organization of Turkey (KOSGEB), will help people and firms by providing reimbursable support financing for manufacturing firms and other, innovative young firms focusing on manufacturing, scientific research and development, and computer programming. If Ankara presents Turkey as an industrial and rich country that lends Somalia and other nations, in reality, it appears to be unable to secure this amount.

It is clear that the policy adopted by president Recep Tayyip Erdogan in recent years, namely that of stimulating growth through broad access to credit favored by low rates, has not only not worked but has been counterproductive. The unsuccessful attempt to support the lira over the past two years has cost Turkey 140 billion dollars in foreign exchange reserves. Also, for this reason, the management of former Finance Minister Beret Albayrak, who resigned after Erdogan replaced the governor of the Central Bank, become the target of criticism, not only from the opposition but also from within the ruling party. Among the most critical within the AKP, it seems that there was precisely Ağbal, his predecessor in the economy.

Erdogan is aware that the deterioration of the economy could cost dearly the political stability of his party. However, today the AKP, also due to the negative economic performance, is suffering from a decline in consensus and is suffering from internal divisions and several spills, such as that of former Finance Minister Ali Babacan, who last March founded the Democracy and Progress Party (Deva), and Ahmet Davutoglu, a former prime minister.

“The WB financing provided under the project will go to Micro and Small Enterprises in Turkey, which are the main source of employment for poor and near-poor households and account for more than 40 percent of employment in the manufacturing sector,” remarked Stefka Slavova, Lead Economist at the World Bank and co-Task Team leader of the project. But it will be impossible for Turkey to repay this debt in the short to medium term.

If international investors have seen the appointment of the new Governor of the Turkish Central Bank as a signal of a change of direction and a return to a more conventional monetary policy, and more independent of President Erdogan's bankruptcy line, it is probably just a measure that doesn’t go beyond the short-term objective of stabilizing exchange rates. As long as Erdogan remains at the helm of Turkey, his interests and the Muslim Brotherhood's expansionist ambitions in the region will continue to weigh on the state economy, effectively making it impossible to return even 50% of the amount provided by the World Bank.

One month after his appointment, the new governor of the Turkish central bank Naci Agbal has implemented a significant increase in the interest rate from 10.25% to 15%. A move that reverses the low-interest rate policy pursued by the monetary institution over the past year and a half to stimulate growth - as requested by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - but which nevertheless did nothing but accelerate the devaluation of the Turkish lira and increase inflation, which has reached almost 12%. In the immediate future, the central bank's decision resulted in an appreciation of 3% of the national currency, which from January to early November lost 30% of its value against the dollar.

GTA6 might suffer from a similar problem where they announce the game and 7 years later they finally reach the targeted release date for the game, after numerous delays they release it because fans are fed up and tired of the wait, to no ones surprise it probably won’t be finished. A easy dodge for this is don’t announce the game and hype it up so early in development, maybe wait until you have a finished version of the game to release it, and have a good chunk of the game to announce it. I understand Cyberpunk is fine on PC but console it’s not

You can tell that this echos a lot of the frustration in the BCH community. It's hard not to experience some FOMO when looking at the BTC price. To respond to this I'd like to offer my prediction for 2021.

BCH is waiting for the day when major retailers (amazon, walmart, etc) start to accept crypto. It's hard to tell when exactly this will happen but my guess is late next year and this is why.

You constantly hear on crypto subs how the fed is printing [crazy](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eak01r/more_money_printing_from_the_fed/) [amounts](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/d62n0c/all_that_money_printing_will_end_badly_buy_bitcoin/) [of](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7guh08/this_bitcoin_chart_is_insane_oh_wait_thats/) [money](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/g0nqxq/had_to_speed_the_money_printer_up_4x_brrrrrrr/). Now for the time being this is OK because growth is slow. However when we get out of this COVID slump my prediction is people are gonna spend, spend, spend on all the things they missed out on this past year like travel, concerts, restaurants, etc. This sudden jump in growth will cause price inflation to quickly catch up with the [monetary inflation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1) everyone has been complaining about because - let's be honest - the fed is [never going to raise rates](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fed-sees-rates-near-zero-through-2022-says-asset-purchases-will-continue-2020-06-10) at this point.

When price inflation hits every business out there is going to think long and hard and whether or not they should keep excepting US dollars and look for alternatives. If this happens and if BCH is positioned well, it's gonna see massive gains.

personalfinance,Move some Heloc debt to cheaper CC?,"I owe 25k on a heloc that is currently 3.99% (tied to prime). If I get the notion that interest rates are going to go back up, I have the option to lock it at 4.2% for the next 10 years.

As it turns out, another bank I'm with is offering a card at 3.25% APR (tied to prime) for three years. There is no annual fee nor any balance transfer fee.

I was thinking about transferring some of the heloc debt to this new card, and save a bit of interest if it looks like interest rates are going to stay at the bottom, presuming that CC and heloc interest is calculated equivalently. If interest rates do end up shooting back up, I don't see any issue with moving the debt back to the heloc.

What do you think? Anything I'm missing?",finance
personalfinance,Whole Life Policy [ IRC 7702(j) ] Question // Maximizing My Extra Cashflow,"Hi all. Was sent here from r/investing with a question. Seeking advice from anyone who has dealt with and / or knows about whole life policies as a form of long term wealth management and growth. 

The basics of my situation: (age 28) I currently trade in my Roth IRA account with Schwab, have a decent amount of crypto stored up that I bought back in early 2017, I'm getting into real estate (purchasing my first rental property this year), and I also dabble in daytrading with an etrade account (stocks and selling options contracts). Above and beyond my current investment allocation (I work as a private contractor, so it depends on ""what type of year"" I'm having) I have about $300 / month to spare in investing at this time, above and beyond my current diversification strategy. 

A few years back, my dad got me looking into something called an IRC 7702(j), which is an IRS code for a Whole Life policy type, that allows for 1/3 premium payments towards death benefit and a 2/3 ""paid up additions"" that earn interest and dividends in the account, and can be used as collateral to borrow against the policy, getting lent money from the insurance company via a line of credit they take out. I started my first policy about 6 months ago, opting for the $900 plan, meaning I pay $300 towards premium with $600 towards paid up additions each month. However, with covid and contract work in my relevant industry being sketchy, I am only able to just pay the premium each month and $10 towards the paid up additions (the minimum required to keep the policy going). When I reached out about possibly canceling the policy, I received a lengthy, sales-pitchey email from my agent explaining i can cancel anytime, but I must be ""misunderstanding how my policy works for me"".

 I'll post the contents of that email below, but basically I wanted to know what the general consensus would be on me being able to better utilize that $300 / month extra cash flow. Since I am only able to just barely pay the premium and only $10 of the actual paid up additions, would it make sense to find better use for maximizing that $300 / month, or am I jumping the gun wanting to surrender the policy so soon? Thanks in advance! Here are the contents of the sales pitch response: 

*Your overfunded, maximized whole life policy isn’t an ordinary ”investment”.  It is a financial tool.  A multi-faceted financial account, that we call the “Wealth Maximization Account” (WMA), and it does the following:*

*It provides a tax-free death benefit to your heirs.*

*The death benefit funds will bypass probate.  The policy acts as its own Will and Trust with a direct designated beneficiary.  So, there’s no additional court costs, time delays, or attorney’s fees.*

*It provides tax-free cash to you, while you’re alive, in the event of a terminal illness.*

*It can provide tax-free dollars that you can use to cover medical expenses, long-term care, college education costs for your kids, or retirement income funds for you and your wife.  It can do all of that without cashing out the account, or limiting future growth.  How?  You’re not using your money!  Instead, the insurance company allows you to use their money (fully collateralized by your cash values that are still compounding in your account).*

*It provides guaranteed interest, plus non-guaranteed dividends that can grow tax-free.  Those dividends provide inflation protection.  Dividends generally rise with interest rates.  Furthermore, there’s no stock market risk involved.  So your funds are safe and protected.*

*It is private.  Nothing is reported publicly, and nothing is reported on your State or Federal tax return.  You’ll never get a 1099 interest statement.*

*A portion of the cash values are protected by State law from your creditors, so there’s a layer of liability protection.*

*If the insurance company becomes insolvent, you have several layers of protection.  First, as a policyholder of a mutual company, you are an owner of the company and are entitled to your share of their assets, unlike a stock company.  Second, there’s a huge pool of stable and highly profitable insurance companies all around them that would be chomping at the bit to gain the policyholders of the insolvent company and would likely buy them out before a bankruptcy would ever happen (much like what happened when MassMutual purchased Met Life a few years ago).  Third, each State has an Insurance Guaranty Association that collects funds from each insurance company that does business in that state each year and holds those funds reserve to make the policyholders that live in that State whole if a default were ever to happen.*

*You can keep YOUR money in the cash value of YOUR account, while simultaneously using the insurance company’s money to invest in other areas.  So, while your funds have been in the account over those 15 years, you’ve been able to use those funds to invest in other areas at the same time.  For example, you could take out a policy loan, using the insurance company’s money, to purchase Facebook Stock.  So, you don’t have to decide which one is better (the life insurance or Facebook).  You don’t have to sacrifice one to get the other.  You can do both at the same time!  Funnel your cash through the life insurance policy and then use the insurance company’s money to invest in stock, or a business, or cryptocurrency, or whatever you want.*

*YOU control all transactions from start to finish.  You decide if, how, or when to take policy loans, make additional payments, or loan repayments.  It’s totally up to you.  There’s no loan repayment requirement.  You basically act as your own personal bank.  You still get to use that $7.64 Million of cash as you see fit, even while the policy is providing you and your family with all of the benefits I just listed.  You’re enabling a dollar to work more effectively, without losing access or control of the dollar.  You’re creating additional gains at the same time on the same dollar.  In the stock world, we call that arbitrage!*",finance

stocks,$PFMT Performant Financial: Boring Business but a Diamond in the Rough,"Disclaimer: I originally posted this in r/securityanalysis (Link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/ki8z2q/pfmt\_performant\_financial\_boring\_business\_but\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/ki8z2q/pfmt_performant_financial_boring_business_but_a/)) yesterday and received some responses. I am reposting it here to a bigger audience, with an added section to respond to some of the questions I received. I am hoping that by reposting on here, we can get more a discussion. I am not too familiar with reddit as I typically post on smaller value investing forums, and it is first time posting there. I plan to long in this company as I see the long term position of the company's growth in the health care sector. This is a minor position (5%) in what is a concentrated (10-15 company) portfolio.

**PFMT- Performant FinancialOverview:**PFMT is a technology-based provider of audit, recovery, payment accuracy, coordination of benefits (COB), and outsource services in the United States. PFMT analyze claims, identify, prevent and correct inaccurate payments. Using their proprietary analytics platform and industry expertise, PFMT aim to reduce losses on billions of dollars worth of improper healthcare payments, state/federal/and treasury tax delinquencies, defaulted student loans and other receivables. Primary customers include government commercial health plans, CMS, Blues plans, regional Insurers, private/commercial programs, etc that operate in complex and highly regulated environments that rely on PFMT's innovative and disruptive approach. Revenue is generated based on a percentage of validated recoveries for clients. Contracts are negotiated on case by case basis, fees may range from 10-30% of recoveries and the duration of contracts may last 3-5+ years. These are high margin, recurring revenue contracts, expected to provide multiple years of prolonged double digit growth.This is not a sexy business, quite boring in fact. However, a good investment should be boring. Hopefully you will also appreciate the new path management has coursed, and see the potential upside in this turnaround story.Historically, PFMT was known for its legacy business as a collection agency for student loans, federal/state tax delinquencies and other receivables. Since the taking over of student loan originations by the Federal government a decade ago, PFMTs student loan collections have seen a diminishing contribution to revenues over time. Currently, the student loans collection business accounts for about 22% of revenues. While ""Other"" legacy collections still account for about 26% of revenues. Growth in Other legacy collections has remained relatively flat over the years. A smaller business segment derives marginal revenues from first party call centers and licensing of hosted technology solutions to clients. ***The diamond in the rough refers to PFMT's up-and-coming*** ***healthcare*** ***business segment***, composed of claims auditing and eligibility reviews. After seeing losses in 2018/19 due to high ramp up costs and standard implementation time lags, this segment appears to be set for robust growth going forward. Management has been clear that from 2017-2019, adjusted EBITDA has witnessed a slowdown to reflect a period of transformation in the company to establish itself in the Healthcare space. Management has confidently reiterated their belief in successfully reaching a 2021 goal of achieving $200M revenue with 20% EBITDA margins, with double digit growth continuing for years to come.

**Covid-19 Impact:**This year was shaping up to be a strong year for PFMT, as Q1 showed promising results that validated the new trajectory of the company. Unfortunately, Q2 and Q3 were impacted by the public health emergency related to Covid-19. The CARES act brought changes that affected the student loans collection segment. Student loan payments, interest accrual and involuntary collection of payments (wage garnishments) were originally suspended till September 30, 2020 but were extended till December 31, 2020. However, PFMT continued to generate student loan revenue for a number of months from existing in-process borrow rehabilitation agreements. Another impact of Covid came from existing healthcare audit customers that requested a short-term pause on PFMT activities. Mgmt has indicated these pauses have largely ended during the third quarter. To mitigate the impact of this temporary slowdown, mgmt had furloughed more than 500 employees which could result in savings of about $18 million. The company is now aggressively ramping up efforts (including hiring/recruiting). Mgmt anticipates the ramp up efforts to be properly reflected in revenue by Q1 of 2021.

**Healthcare Business:**The healthcare platform has finally reached scale, accounting for the largest (and continually growing) contribution to PFMTs revenue. In Q3, the healthcare business generated $17.6M in revenue (48.5% of total revenues (refer to Figure 1 below to view a cut out from the latest 10-k)). That is a 20.5% increase on sequential basis and a 63% increase from the same period last year. Please refer to figure 2 below, to see the change in healthcare revenues over time. This segment will continue to grow as Mgmt has made it clear this will be a main focus for the company. Soon healthcare will be the primary source of revenue (50%++), leading to a market multiple re-rate.Healthcare revenues over last 11 quarters:

Q3 2020= $17.6MQ2 2020= $14.6MQ1 2020= $17.5MQ4 2019=$14.3MQ3 2019= $10.8MQ2 2019= $9.3MQ1 2019= $9MQ4 2018= $9.9MQ3 2018= $6.6MQ2 2018= $6.1MQ1 2018= $3.5M

\[Figure 2: PFMT Healthcare Revenues\]([https://imgur.com/a/W1OtGXu](https://imgur.com/a/W1OtGXu))

**Macro:**The macro environment indicates there should be tailwinds for the audit, recovery, payment accuracy and coordination of benefits outsourcing business solutions PFMT provides. According to the CMS, national healthcare expenditures are forecast to grow at 5.4% CAGR for the next 8 years. Reaching $6.8T by 2028. Despite efforts to reduce the amount of improper payments, error rates in the industry range from 6% in commercial to 14.9% in government plans. Healthcare spending growth is driven primarily by a combination of increasing enrollment and cost inflation. Given the current unemployment environment, we are witnessing a spike in Medicaid enrollment, which should continue to benefit the business via rising utilization and claims volumes. It is useful to note that there can be a lag of several months between Medicaid eligibility and resulting claims volumes. This indicates that a majority of the benefits from the current environment are still to come. Also, as private organizations and state governments are struggling with lower revenues and budget deficits, this could create an increased focus on cost containment strategies where PFMT could play a supporting function. PFMT mgmt sees a $200B+ healthcare TAM growing annually.**Competitors:**PFMT differentiates itself with its proprietary technology and customizable approach to each of their customers' needs. The space is mostly dominated by large, slow moving players, that lack flexibility and uniqueness in their approach. Major competitors include HMS Holdings Corp (HMSY-US, \~\~$3B mkt cap) and Cotiviti (acquired in mid-2018 for $4.9B). Contracts in this industry are limited, take time to implement and can last years. PFMT continues to build a moat around it's business by consistently winning, maintaining and being awarded new contracts. An example includes being re-awarded CMS recovery Audit Region 1 and being awarded the newly created Region 5. Thus, successfully showcasing PFMTs superior product and path to success in this space. PFMTs will continue to encroach on incumbents' healthcare market share as the market begins to realize the superiority of their technology and approach. Refer to Figure 3, below, for an image taken form the CMS website showing the audit region relative to competition. Figure 4 may help to visualize the healthcare insurance payment cycle, and where PFMT may offer value.**Debt:**On Aug 2017, PFMT entered a credit agreement with an existing shareholder and customer, ECMC. As of September 30, 2020 PFMT has about $62M loan outstanding under this credit agreement. ECMC has been able to accumulate about 5.8M warrants in PFMT as part of the agreement (about 10% of outstanding shares) all at an average exercise price of $1.95. The effective interest rate was about 13.9% in the 1H 2020. The loan is classified as a current liability, with maturity in August 2021. However, PFMT has two one-year options to extend maturity.PFMT currently (as of Sept 30,2020) has about $17.3M cash and equivalents on hand and is entering a period of FCF generation.The current low interest rate environment offers low hanging fruit for companies looking to refinance their loans at a lower rate. Reducing their loan rate to 5-8% could save up to $5.5M in annual interest expense.**Timing/Technicals:**As the calendar approached their earnings announcement date (Nov 11), PFMT stock was trading around recent highs of $2. The stock started selling off aggressively into the earnings and significantly further following earnings (despite a very positive release). The selling pressure appears to have been caused by portfolio management layoffs at Invesco, a top holder. Public disclosure of these layoffs coincides with timing of initial selloff, and a recent 13G filing confirms the exited position. This should quell any fears holders and followers of this stock may have had, as the selling was not based on fundamental flaws in the company or a new short thesis. Invesco owned about 18% of PFMT. Following the recent pressure, it appears the stock is in extremely oversold territory. Since their exit, the average volume profile of the stock has improved significantly, making accumulating a position easier for both retail and institutional demand.**Valuation:**The timing of Covid partially contributes to why the market overlooked this stock, as Q2 and Q3 earnings were impacted. To establish a fair EBITDA estimation for 2020, we will use Q1 results with a conservative bias. Q1 is most appropriate because it will give us the clearest picture of how the company was performing prior to the temporary impacts of Covid. Using Q1, EBITDA was $6.4M (after deducting stock compensation). Annualizing that amount will give us an EBITDA run rate of $25.6M. This is a conservative measure because we do not account for the impact of any potential interest rate savings or growth in the healthcare segment. Next we need to establish the enterprise value (EV= debt + mkt cap - cash). Which we use to calculate EV/EBITDA. Calculation below.EBITDA= $25.6MEnterprise Value (EV)= $62M (debt) + $41 (mkt cap) -$17.3M (Cash) = $85.7 MEV/EBITDA= 3.3XFully diluted share count of 59.7M o/s

Now lets take a look at some Healthcare IT comparables. The first 7 are general comps, the bottom 3 are the most similar comps to PFMT. To clarify, HMSY is currently publicly trading and is a direct competitor to PFMT. In December 2019, HMSY acquired Accent (a coordination of benefits/payments accuracy unit of Intrado focused on commercial and Medicare Advantage payers) for $155M. Accent had generated about $50M of revenue during the 12 months ending october 2019 (vs PFMTs $150M revenues in 2019). Based on the transaction price, HMSY paid an estimated 11-12X EV/Ebitda on a TTM basis. COTV was acquired and taken private in 2018, it continues to be a direct competitor with PFMT. COTV operated in payment integrity and was acquired for $4.9B in mid 2018, an estimated EV/EBITDA multiple of 14-15X based on consensus 2019 estimates. Also, keep in mind that the average EV/EBITDA for S&amp;P companies in 2020 is about 14.5X.Healthcare IT Peer Trading Comp Table                        Mkt Cap  SHARES O/S           EV         EV/EBITDA

The market still largely views PFMT as a declining student loans collections firm. Yet growing beneath the surface is an attractive healthcare business. As this segment continues to grow the market will recognize the high quality recurring revenue, ability to scale, and increasingly healthcare-focused pure-play as a catalyst for a multiple rerate. Now using the comps above, I will provide 3 scenarios (best, base, worst case scenario) applying a discount to conservatively account for the micro-cap nature and higher leverage of PFMT.In the best case scenario, we apply a 14X EV/EBTDA ratio (rounded down from the most similar comparable peer average of 14.3X) which, on a fully diluted share basis, lead to a current price per share of $6.In the base case scenario, we take a couple of notches off the closest peer average and apply a 12X EV/EBITDA ratio. Resulting in a current target price of $5.15/shareIn the worst case scenario, we further take off two more notches from the most similar peer average to apply a 10X EV/EBITDA ratio. Resulting in a price of $4.29/share.Also, considering the existing ownership of the company. Parthenon investors, Prescott Group, Mill Road Capital are all large shareholders. It is not unreasonable to think that they pursue a more aggressive activist role in the company and set it up for sale at a premium. It is also possible that competitors recognize the massive discount of this up-and-coming threat, and decide to acquire PFMT before other market participants drive up the price making such a strategic acquisition far more expensive. All of which offer upside to existing shareholders.As we approach future quarters and results continue to support this positive narrative we should start to see investor appetite pick up for this name. Average daily volumes have quadrupled since Invesco's recent exiting has added to the freely trading shares, improving the liquidity profile of PFMT. These signals will start appearing on investor screens as they (professional small cap investors, value investors, quant investors, generalists, hedge funds, etc) look for new ideas. There is virtually zero sell-side coverage of this stock at the moment, this will likely change in the future. **Accumulating a position now, presents an opportunity for entry at basement level prices in a stock that has the potential to provide 500-700% upside.**

**Part 2:**

$PFMT hit $1 by EOD yesterday, as much as I would like to think that the prior write-up was a catalyst for PFMTs recent performance, it is more likely driven by some significant and recent industry developments.  This will be a short follow up summarizing the recent event and why I think it is important to the underlying thesis. Also, I will try to respond to the some of the questions received last night. Thank you to all who have engaged me. Hopefully we can continue this constructive dialogue around this investment idea.

On Monday morning (Dec 21), HMSY (a direct competitor of PFMT) announced it had agreed to be acquired by Gainwell Technologies for $3.4B. Gainwell is owned by the private equity firm Veritas Capital. In March 2020, DXC Technologies announced the sale of their Government Healthcare business segment for $5B in cash to Veritas which renamed this new segment: Gainwell Technologies. Prior to acquiring this segment from DXC, this healthcare business was generating $1.5B in annual revenues, growing double digits year over year with 20% margins (inline with industry standard and PFMTs 2021 margin goal). The transaction values HMSY at 16-17X forward 2021 EV/EBITDA.  From what I gather, this is above most consensus estimates but still seems to be a fair price. A reminder that Veritas also acquired Cotiviti (COTV) in 2018 at a slightly lower valuation of 14-16X EV/EBITDA. The willingness to pay a premium relative to their COTV recent transaction indicates growing opportunity in the space.

Veritas intends on breaking up the various HMSY segments and redistributing them among its portfolio companies COTV and Gainwell. COTV will take on the payment integrity and population health management business while Gainwell will take on the Medicade, Coordination of benefits/third party liability services business. Strategically, Veritas is able to secure HMSY's valuable set of data assets in the Medicaid market, and gaining exposure to the potentially higher EBITDA in 2021 due to the positive recent Medicaid enrollment trend. However, HMSY has been under pressure for failing to deliver predictable results and underperformance in some segments (particularly their population health management business). This inherent volatility in the revenue model is a burden on these companies (including PFMT) as it masks longer term growth and margin expansion potential.

Though FTC concerns don’t appear to be an issue. It is uncertain to me what this new Veritas combination will mean for their Medicare RAC regions. As HMSY has one region and COTV has two. I believe there is a program limit of two regions per vendor. This could prove to be an obstacle for the new entity.  Also the inherent culture clash in executing large mergers typically leads to significant employee turnover and loss of talent. In such a niche industry, I would imagine the labor market is tight and any brain drain could hurt the new entity. In fact, a basic linkedin search of these companies indicates a recent influx of talent from large competitors into PFMT. If industry incumbents, particularly experienced sales people, are realizing PFMT has a superior platform relative to the large slow moving competition then this should be another positive signal reinforcing PFMTs trajectory. Discount this as anecdotal investigative evidence but I think it has merit.

The continuing theme of consolidation in this particular area of Healthcare IT highlights the large market opportunity across cost-containment and solutions services.

Recent transactions:

Access acquired by HMSY in 2018 at 11-12X EV/EBITDA

DXC HC segment acquired by Veritas/Gainwell

COTV acquired by Veritas at 14-15X

HMSY acquired by Veritas at 16-17X

&amp;#x200B;

This all bodes well for PFMT, as it solidifies my view that this turnaround story is not being valued as an appropriate comp to its peers. If TODAY the market determines that HMSY is worth 16-17X EV/EBITDA, this supports my Base and Best Case Scenario of valuing PFMT using a 12X ($5.15/share) and 14X ($6/share) multiple, respectively (accounting for microcap nature and leverage by reducing the multiple by a few notches).  The recent price improvement in PFMT appears to be driven by a recognition of PFMT being undervalued on a comparable basis. Volumes have improved in the last few sessions but the stock is still extremely undervalued. Likely some retail investors accumulating entry positions. Imagine if a small fund of $100 AUM identifies this stock as an ideal investment, decides to initiate a small 200 basis point position. It would require 2-3M shares. The stock was up 20% today after trading only 1M shares, accumulating supply for a single fund position will require a significant movement in price. Given the current valuation, this opportunity could soon hit the radar screens of multiple funds. The recent string of transactions will continue to attract attention to this space. Sooner or later someone will start kicking the tires on PFMT...

Responses to recent questions and comments:

1. Is it possible that customers build/improve their internal tools to the point where they become threats to PFMT?

Good question. Customers may marginally improve their ability to audit claims internally but not to the point of being a threat. It's important to understand that the solutions/services offered by PFMT, HMSY, COTV, etc require technology- heavy platforms that require significant amount of resources (financial and intellectual) to develop, once developed there are minimal incremental costs for higher volumes. These types of commitments are not usually within the realm of possibilities among the customer base.  The ever-changing complexity around these types of industries makes in-house billing departments ill-equipped to maximize value relative to specialists like PFMT. An example to illustrate such complexity would be the ongoing changes in the International Classification of Disease codes (ICD). When the WHO decided to change the medical classification codes of ICD9 to ICD10, it increased the number of procedure codes from 13,000 to 68,000. This is just one example of the type of nuance that will always provide opportunity for specialist support from a PFMT.

2. Terms of the credit agreement and Why hasn’t management refinanced the Debt?

For anyone eager to learn more about the terms of the Credit Agreement, i would advise you read the latest 10k (link posted in my original report). The 10-k is helpful in clearly outlining all details.

I think management is working towards refinancing the debt. But these are not things that can be negotiated or arranged immediately. It is possible that management wants/needs to have a certain number of consistent quarter over quarter improvement before they can renegotiate terms. In the current interest rate environment and following their recent turnaround progress, this low hanging fruit should be picked soon enough.

&amp;#x200B;

3.   Divesting legacy business?

I would not be surprised to see parts of the legacy business sold off as the focus turns toward the growing health care business. I will continue monitoring management discussion on next earnings call for any evidence to support this.

&amp;#x200B;

4. PFMT is transitioning to focus on its healthcare business.

Some commentators have referred to PFMT as a pure-play student loans collection firm which would be a false description. Student loans do not account for a majority of their revenues and management has made it clear their focus has changed towards a constantly growing healthcare industry.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Comparables mentioned are 100X larger than PFMT, why is that a fair comparison?

This is a reasonable observation. The answer to which is a function of numerous factors. The current market cap is significantly depressed as the popularity contest that IS the stock market is not identifying the value of this name. The stock was depressed further as a large holder just sold their 18% position, pushing the price near all-time lows. The huge gap in public market valuation is one of the reasons why this is a table pounding buy in my opinion. As this gap closes the difference in market cap will seem more acceptable.

Also, despite being small, the fact that PFMT is able to compete on the same level with these giants is a testament to its superior product and team: evidenced by their ability to secure two Medicare RAC region contracts (competing directly with COTV and HMSY), among other contacts won from incumbents.

6. What is the moat/""secret sauce""?

I am not a software engineer, nor do I have inner workings into PFMT's technology. Based on publicly available information, I can speculate that PFMT's disruptive technology refers its ability to differentiate itself over the competition. Competitors have been using a ""one-size-fits-all approach"" to their customers. PFMT uses their proprietary software to scrape data and yield higher rates of potential recoverable claims. Their solutions are more client-centric than the competition. As a smaller player they can be nimble, providing customized solutions to fulfill each client’s needs. For this reason they continue to be rewarded with new contracts taken from large incumbents. See the recent presentations (on their website) for quantitative case study examples.

These contracts are difficult to win, have long term time horizons.  The technology to service customers is unique and initially capital intensive to establish. Barriers to entry are significant.

So I'm going through the process of financing and purchasing my first home (yay low interest rates). When I was on the phone with my lender yesterday I got a surprise hit on my credit from Spectrum for an account that I closed several months ago, billing me in error &gt;:(.

personalfinance,Pay off auto loan first?,"This post is a brief celebration and then a question, TL;DR at the bottom.

2020 handed lots of people a great deal of hardship, and I was briefly one of them; on the other hand, my family and I have come out far better financially than we started and we are eternally grateful for that. I was laid off as a result of the pandemic in February (working for a Chinese company, so it hit me a few weeks before everyone else) with somewhere around 30k in high-interest debt and was certain we were going to spiral into profound hardship. Thankfully, I was able to land a new job fairly quickly -- though at a laughably reduced pay -- and then, last month, spun that into another new opportunity that is where I would have wanted to land all along, pandemic and layoffs aside. Due to the assistance that was available to us because of the pandemic, as well as some hearty belt-tightening and smart budgeting, we managed to pay off that debt down to now a 6k balance that I expect to wipe out before Q1 2021 closes. Huzzah! It feels amazing, especially since, right as I got laid off, we were trying to do a cash-out refi in order to get ourselves out from under the debt. How happy I am, in retrospect, that it was not approved and we made our way out without giving up our equity. 

Now - on to the advice part. Our remaining 6k is currently sitting interest-free thanks to a balance transfer offer we had on an existing credit line, and we've got one of our cars nearly paid off with just $700 to go and expected to be paid off, via regular payments, in March. All this time, I have been focusing on paying down that larger, higher-interest debt because, duh, interest. Now that we aren't accruing interest on that balance (and wouldn't be until sometime in 2022; but, again, we are forecasted to pay it off well before then), I think it makes sense to go in and pay off the car entirely, which we have the ability and cashflow to easily do now. 

Does that make sense as the next move? Is there anything I'm not considering? We have student loan debt that we are chipping away at, but it is at very low interest rates (1-3%), lower than the car. The car's balance is so small, it's very tempting to get that satisfaction and pay it! 

TLDR: paid off tons of debt in 2020, yay us! now do I turn my attention to paying off a small auto loan balance rather than a larger credit card balance that is currently at 0% until 2022 and will otherwise be paid off by March 2021?",finance
personalfinance,"My money market account interest is getting limited, I have too much -- what now?","My money market account has a two tier interest setup -- a better (but tbh not amazing) rate if you have so many transactions a month on a connected checking account, and a much worse rate otherwise. Thanks to the drop in interest rates, they're limiting the better rate to only the first $X at starting at the end of the year, where X is about 40% of what I have stored there.

To be clear, I have too much regardless, but I thought most of it would be used this year. Thanks to covid, it wasn't, and now my head is spinning with all the options for where to move it now that it's going to be earning next to nothing.

========

**Details:**

(Didn't think exact dollar amounts mattered too much, so leaving them off)

Late 20s, software engineer, Texas, living with parents in the home they've owned for 15 years and helping with the mortgage and bills, own my 3-year-old car outright. Base salary is in the middle of the 24% tax bracket, bonuses (quarterly performance-based that are a percentage of salary, as well as an annual imitation-RSU payout based on company performance) push me towards the top of the  bracket. Company 401k with Fidelity is matched 50% of the first 6%, I was contributing 12% pre-tax, but after a recent raise, bumped it to 15% pre- and 3% post-tax (based on back-of-napkin math on how close I'll to pre-tax limits this year -- plan on revisiting soon). Also max out an HSA every year.

Savings breakdown is as follows:

* 20% is my e-fund -- works out to ~ a year of current expenses

* 20% is earmarked to help my parents pay off their mortgage if they need/want to get it over with

* 40% _was_ to get a place of my own this year because my commute was getting too long and all the expenses that come with that. Thanks to covid, I'm going to be remote for a while and potentially permanently, so now I'm thinking it could instead go to a reno on my parents place to make it work better. Also, there is an option on the table for my parents to sell their house and move with me if I find the right place (ie a good chunk of land or a place with a usable guest house).

* 10% was for trips that didn't happen due to covid, and who knows if/when they will

* 10% is for everything else -- I'm a YNAB-er so this is all my annual bills, Christmas and birthdays, future new car, etc.

I know I don't _need_ all of what I have listed above, so my first step is to open an IRA and max it out for this year and next. Then I'm going to add to a CD ladder I started a couple years ago since I didn't this year (interest rates dropped right before vesting time). After that, I'm a little lost. I know for sure some will go to a better HYSA, the rest to investments.

The question is, how much do I realistically need to keep liquid given the fairly fluid plans above? I'm typically pretty risk-averse, but I know I need to bite the bullet and do more to make more.",finance

MachineLearning,[D] How do you think we can detect fake news?,"Hello, newbie here. Wanted to just ask this question for spark thought-provoking discussion.

I  think detecting fake news is a really difficult problem because people  can always come up with different types of fake news that evade being  labelled as fake news (if they learn what is being fed into the model).

My  thought right now is that information needs to be cross-checked with a  source that we know to be credible on a topic, and I can't really wrap  my head around how to do that (what sources do we delineate as credible  in the first place?).

As of now my  brainstorm is thinking that in order to do this, we need to tackle the  root; the person who spreads it (similar to how when you are trying to  stop spread of a disease, you need to understand the root cause to  prevent it from happening again).

Now there is new [research](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/10163/8063)  that may be helpful in finding of who is spreading misinformation, as  the mass amount of bots are known-perpetrators for spreading  misinformation; but here, the problem is that bots != all people who  spread misinformation.

It gets  messy when you consider that people who spread misinformation may be  intentionally or unintentionally doing so, which makes ALL THE  DIFFERENCE .

personalfinance,How to consolidate debt with poor debt to income ratio and fair credit?,"Hello,

I have a question about consolidating debt with a poor debt to income ratio and fair credit.

Long story short, I quit a great job where I had no debt (other than federal student load debt) and sold my house to move to Central California to help a family member with some medical stuff. Thought it would be only a few months, but ended up being a number of years and I eventually burned through all my money. By the time I realized that this was going to be a long term situation and I needed a job, I was much older and had been out of my profession for like 4-5 years, so struggled to find a job. I was in denial for a while thinking I could get back to my old position and old salary, but eventually just had to face facts.  I drove for uber and lyft for a while but started to rack up debt. Some of this debt was for things like car repairs where I'm getting like a 25% or 30% interest rate and barely paying off the principle.  And then COVID hit, and I couldn't even drive, so I missed some payments, and my credit score went from almost 800 (which it has been for most of my adult life) to under 600.

I finally have a steady job and I'm building my credit back up, but I'm earning MUCH less than I used to. I have about 20k in credit card debt at rates that vary from 15-30%, and then student loan debt (which is currently in deferral), and then about $25k left on my truck, but that's at a much, much more manageable 4% interest rate.  I make about $40k a year and pay about $1400/month for an apartment.

So, adding everything up, I make about $2900 a month after taxes and medical and all that. About 1600 of that goes right to rent (+ utilities/phone/etc), so I have about 1300 left. $400 goes to my car, $100 goes into gas, $200 into groceries, and my credit card bills are about $500/month.  I end up with about $100 a month extra every month, and I'm currently saving that (rather than paying down bills) until I have enough for emergencies and whatever (I'd like to get about $3k-$5k saved up for emergencies). 

The thing is, being able to consolidate or refinance these credit card debts would make a HUGE difference. I have just under $20k of credit card debt I'd love to consolidate somehow. I've spoken with a ton of banks and credit unions, and tell them my wages and debts, and my credit score (about 650-660, depending on the type of score), and the loan agent can usually give me a quote.  They all say things like, ""with your wages, debt, and credit score, we will give you a rate of 12%"" or whatever.  They offer me a rate of 11%-14% with the condition that the underwriters approve it.  The thing is, the underwriters NEVER approve it, saying that my debt to income ratio is too high, which I totally understand.

So what I'm worried about is... I'm barely paying down the principles on these loans, so my debt to income ratio is not going to change anytime soon. I feel like I'm a responsible person (owned my own home, held down a great, steady job, great credit score) until the last few years just screwed me over (i mean, a lot of it was my fault, I'm just saying that the last few years are an anomaly given my prior track record).

Am I just trying to consolidate my loans all wrong?  I'm going through banks and credit unions and asking to do a debt consolidation loan (if they have one) or just a personal loan (if they don't have specific debt consolidation loans). But it's not working, and I don't know what my other options are.  I've seen companies that have you just TANK your debt and then they negotiate for you but that seems like a bad option.

Questions:

1) am I doing something wrong?  Applying wrong, or to the wrong places, or the wrong loans?

2) IS debt consolidation the best option for me?

3) what are my other options for consolidating debt?  Other debt consolidation companies besides banks/credit unions? I see some companies, but they all seem so shady...

4) What else have I not thought about?

Help me Reddit, you're my only hope!

Thank you all!  Happy holidays!",finance

CryptoCurrency,What the Ripple lawsuit could mean for the token and DeFi ecosystem,"I know most of us like to shit on Ripple for their long-standing hoarding and dumping. That aside, I do not see what makes Ripple fundamentally different from a bunch of other ICO tokens, including but not limited to XLM, ADA, LINK.

Whether or not a token issuer is a for-profit or non-profit corporation is irrelevant for the definition of a security according to the Howey Test from what I can tell: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp

What matters is whether or not the ""investors"" are partaking in a speculative enterprise, and that is undoubtedly true for these tokens.

Looking at the SEC press statement, all of the charges brought forth could equally be applied to other ICO token and issuers:

&gt; According to the SEC's complaint, Ripple; Christian Larsen, the company's co-founder, executive chairman of its board, and former CEO; and Bradley Garlinghouse, the company's current CEO, raised capital to finance the company's business. The complaint alleges that Ripple raised funds, beginning in 2013, through the sale of digital assets known as XRP in an unregistered securities offering to investors in the U.S. and worldwide. Ripple also allegedly distributed billions of XRP in exchange for non-cash consideration, such as labor and market-making services. According to the complaint, in addition to structuring and promoting the XRP sales used to finance the company's business, Larsen and Garlinghouse also effected personal unregistered sales of XRP totaling approximately $600 million. The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to register their offers and sales of XRP or satisfy any exemption from registration, in violation of the registration provisions of the federal securities laws.

Source: https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-338

Raising funds through the sale of tokens is common practice in the crypto space, that's what ICOs are. So it boils down to the question whether a token is a security under the Howey Test.

If XRP is a security, then why aren't XLM, ADA, or LINK?

So let's say Ripple loses the lawsuit. I fear this would have a disastrous effect on the entire token and DeFi ecosystem in the US. It would be impossible to trade and transact using anything other than mined coins such as BTC and ETH.

Someone please correct me, because I certainly don't like that prospect.",cryptocurrency
investing,IPOs to watch in 2021: The 5 most anticipated debuts,"Despite the near-constant upheaval caused by the [coronavirus pandemic](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-update-us-buys-more-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-doses-cdc-says-uk-strain-likely-already-here-161435856.html), 2020 will go down as one of the best performing years for initial public offerings (IPOs). Over the last 12 months, a stunning 216 companies went public, the most since 2014, with firms raising an astonishing $78.1 billion in the process.

Consistent with previous years, healthcare and technology were the most popular sectors of the IPO market. Airbnb ([ABNB](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ABNB/)), Doordash ([DASH](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/dash)), Snowflake ([SNOW](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/snow)), Lufax Holding ([LU](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/lu)), and Royalty Pharma ([RPRX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/rprx)) were the largest companies to go public this year.

And 2021 looks like it could be just as good for public debuts, according to Kathleen Smith, IPO ETF manager at Renaissance Capital.

“As long as the market holds up, we could very likely see a better year in 2021 than we saw in 2020,” Smith told Yahoo Finance. While the IPO market started out strong in 2020, the pipeline essentially closed down in March because of the pandemic before picking up steam again in the second half of the year. Momentum looks promising heading into the new year, assuming the Federal Reserve’s easy money policy stays intact for the foreseeable future.

 Overall, this year’s slate of public offerings performed extraordinarily well during and after their IPOs. The Renaissance IPO ETF ([IPO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IPO/)) is up 119% this year compared to the S&amp;P’s overall 14.3% gain, logging its best year ever. The average return on a U.S. IPO this year was 75.4%, compared to last year’s 24.4% and 2018’s -1.9% loss.

With two COVID-19 vaccines now authorized in the U.S., one potential shift is a so-called return to normalcy that may not favor growth-oriented healthcare and tech companies, and instead may benefit cyclical names that aren’t as high-flying. “We can’t be so sure that the tech IPOs will be the ones at the top of the 2021 list. The minute there’s any kind of worry, markets correct and deals get priced more conservatively and they don’t get done,” Smith said.

2021’s big-name companies range from communication services and consumer discretionary to fintech and materials. Juggernauts like gaming platform Roblox, buy-now-pay-later retailer Affirm, and chemicals and equipment company Atotech are each poised to raise as much as $1 billion. And there are plenty of other firms waiting in the wings.

## Roblox (RBLX)

If you’ve got children, you know [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/). The online gaming platform, valued at $4 billion, allows users to create and publish their own video games using Roblox’s tool set. It’s part creation, part play, and expected to hit the public market next year. Founded in 2004 by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel, the company makes money through the sale of its Robux in-game currency.

[Roblox’s S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm) indicates the company, along with the rest of the gaming industry,[ has experienced rapid growth](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-world-turning-to-video-games-150704969.html) in users and revenue, but its losses have ballooned in lockstep.

In the nine-month period ending in September, Roblox had 31.1 million daily active users, an 82% increase from the same period a year ago. Revenue hit $589 million, but its net losses totaled $203 million, four-and-a-half times the $46 million it lost in the same period of 2019.

Roblox, which was widely expected to debut in December, delayed its move into the public markets after Doordash and Airbnb made it difficult for the video game company to price its shares, [according to The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/roblox-delays-ipo-until-next-year-11607742940?mod=article_inline).

Smith says the firm should see a huge amount of interest from investors.

“I look at Roblox and, although they are losing money, they have positive cash flow and it’s a $1 billion-plus IPO, so I think investors are going to pay attention to that,” Smith said.

## Affirm Holdings (AFRM)

Affirm Holdings, like Roblox, was expected to IPO in December 2020. However, it delayed the move until at least January 2021 after Doordash and Airbnb saw massive pops during their public offerings.

The company, which could see its valuation top out at $10 billion, is part of a growing number of buy-now-pay-later services that provides 0% interest or simple interest loans for consumers looking to purchase everything from shoes to exercise bikes.

Founded in 2012, the company is still losing money, posting net losses of $120.5 million and $112.6 million in 2019 and 2020, respectively, [according to its S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465920126927/tm2026663-4_s1.htm). Still, Affirm, which was founded by Paypal co-founder Max Levchin, is likely to see its IPO raise billions of dollars.

“The company is losing money and I think, although it’s growing really fast, these types of companies are like payday lenders,” Smith said. “They have some things investors have to pay attention to when it comes to rules and regulations.”

## Atotech (ATC)

Initially expected to IPO in the first half of 2020, Carlyle Group-owned Atotech delayed its debut due to the coronavirus pandemic and fears that it would hurt its valuation. The company makes specialty chemicals and equipment found in everything from smartphones to communications infrastructure.

[The German firm filed its F-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1762459/000119312520008031/d903704df1.htm) with the Securities and Exchange Commission in January 2020, reporting consolidated net losses of $23.7 million in 2018 on $1.2 billion in revenue. In the nine months ending in September 2019, though, the firm saw net income of $12 million on $877 million in revenue, and its IPO deal could top out at $1 billion.

Of course, the company will also have to contend with variables in the broader tech industry including the whims of consumers and enterprises purchase cycles for electronics infrastructure.

## Petco (WOOF)

It’s where the pets go, and in 2021, it’s where investors will go, too. The pet retail giant Petco is set to go public in 2021 with a deal worth as much as $800 million. Founded in 1965, the company was last publicly traded in 2006 and has since been owned by private equity investors.

[In the company’s S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1826470/000119312520309678/d62974ds1.htm), CEO Ron Coughlin goes even further, saying: “Petco has grown from a local veterinary supplies shop to a disruptive, fully integrated, digital-led, comprehensive pet care ecosystem that puts the health and wellness of pets first.” 

That’s a fancy way of saying you can get virtually everything you need for your pets from the retailer. And judging by online pet retailer Chewy’s ([CHWY](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/CHWY#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)) stellar performance since going public in June 2019 — up 107% — Petco thinks the demand for pet products will only continue to grow.

The company, which will be delightfully listed as WOOF, has seen its profitability improve as of late. Net losses in 2018 came in at $413 million, but fell to $103 million in 2019. Net sales in the same period rose from $4.39 billion in 2018 to $4.43 billion in 2019.

## Southeastern Grocers (SEGR)

Southeastern Grocers, which operates 420 supermarkets under the Winn-Dixie, Harveys, and Fresco y Más names, is an interesting addition to this list because it only emerged from bankruptcy in May 2018. [In its S-1](https://sec.report/Document/0001047469-20-005232/a2242541zs-1.htm), the company says its overall financial performance was hurt by its aggressive expansion from 2011 through 2015, which saw its store base expand by 256%.

Since then, its profitability has improved with the company reporting a net loss of $62 million in the 28 weeks that ended July 10, 2018, only to turn that into net income of $205 million in the 28 weeks that ended July 8, 2020.

Now a leaner organization, Southeastern Grocers is seeking to IPO in 2021 and could raise as much as $500 million.

## The future pipeline

While many of these companies are looking to hit the public exchanges in the traditional way, 2020 was a banner year for alternative ways to go public — namely, the SPAC (special purpose acquisition company). Two hundred and forty one SPACs raised $73.4 billion. While household names are likely to pursue a traditional IPO or even a direct listing, those looking for a quicker liquidity option will consider these so-called blank check companies to take them public.

Investors should expect to see alternative means of going public remain prominent in 2021. “Private companies like Paysafe and Opendoor took advantage of the speed and price certainty that the SPAC structure offers during an uncertain market. Now, companies have more options than ever when they pursue a public listing with SPACs and direct listings both emerging as ‘mainstream’ options,” according to pre-IPO marketplace [EquityZen](https://equityzen.com/).

Aside from the aforementioned five that are almost surely going to go public in 2021, there’s a slew of other hotly anticipated debuts of companies that have become household names. Payments platform Stripe, grocery delivery startup Instacart, stock trading app Robinhood Markets, residential real estate brokerage Compass, dating app Bumble, online education platform Coursera, and fashion players ThredUp and Poshmark are all readying their market debuts.

personalfinance,Credit card balance transfer offer ==&gt; cash?,"Received my new credit card in the mail which is allowing 15 month balance transfers from other credit cards at zero %, along with a 3% one-time balance transfer fee.

I can log onto the new credit card's website and enter the credit card numbers I'd like to transfer the balances from.

Is there a way to get this in cash instead? The card does allow cash advances but for a much smaller amount and at a much higher interest rate, so I'd rather not do that.

One thought I had was to get the balance transfer done to a credit card that I already have but that currently has a zero balance. Then after a couple of weeks, I could call that credit card's customer service and tell them the payment was a mistake and could they please send me a check for the same amount, given the card would have a negative balance. Do you think that's worth trying?

CryptoCurrency,Thoughts on this? Saw this in a crypto chat,"my super rich friend just got this from his crypto analyst: feel free to delete

The more interesting news yesterday was in crypto. SEC is suing Ripple and calling XRP an unregistered securities offering. This is a landmark lawsuit which will have serious implications for crypto going forward. It is not unusual for the US government to launch major anti-trust action in the waning days of an administration. The US vs IBM lawsuit was filed in Jan 1969 in the last days of the Lyndon B Johnson administration after a crazy 1968 year when Martin Luther King and Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated and Nixon was elected. That government lawsuit broke IBM’s monopoly on the computing business during the Nixon and Ford years and led to the creation of Microsoft, Intel, Apple and the entire US personal computer industry that we know today. So these type of lawsuits filed at the end of an administration matter and they matter a lot. It will be a mistake to consider this a lame-duck lawsuit. It will be continued in full force by the next administration.

Ripple is singled out here because it is a private sector company and their crime was that they dared to print a currency which is the privilege of the US government. The US government wants to make an example of Ripple that private sector entities should not be in the business of creating currencies. It will be easy for the US government to prove their case because Ripple was trying to get banks to use XRP as a cash replacement by paying them. The SEC is being very tough in this lawsuit. They are prosecuting directly the CEO and top players in Ripple and will accuse them of securities fraud. They will ask them to return the money from the token sales and will force them to pay penalties. In effect, Ripple will be destroyed and with it, its XRP token. The US government will force all the crypto exchanges to delist XRP. So if you have any XRP, you have to get rid of it and don’t think about buying it again. This thing is going to zero.

What are the consequences of this lawsuit for the crypto industry? The first thing I can think of is that the SEC will treat crypto as securities (like stocks) as opposed to commodities, bonds or currencies. That means you will have to report and pay capital gains on your crypto transactions just like you do with stocks. I guess retail investors are kind of ready for that anyway if they invest via Kraken or Coinbase. But this is a more far reaching determination than appears at first from a different perspective. This determination means that the risk weighting for crypto as a financial instrument will never as low as Gold, cash or government bonds. Crypto is Tier 3 capital. It will never be Tier 1 capital like Gold, cash and government bonds. That means that the dream that Bitcoin will be on Central Bank balance sheets is simply NOT going to happen. Bitcoin will never be like Gold, a Tier 1 central bank asset.

The 2nd thing is that the SEC will go after public and non-public companies that invest into cryptocurrencies and charge them if they don’t do proper disclosures and follow investor protection guidelines. The first thing that comes to mind here is Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy who decided to put his company’s corporate cash into Bitcoin. The US government will not consider Bitcoin a cash substitute and Saylor will run into trouble for using Bitcoin to store corporate cash. MicroStrategy is likely to be hit next and Saylor will be forced to sell the Bitcoin. So I think we have big Bitcoin sales on the horizon. Obviously, Saylor is more than welcome to become an investment manager where he can invest in Bitcoin and have an investment fund or ETF that has passed SEC approval. But the pipe dream that S&amp;P 500 companies will be allowed to invest their corporate treasury money into Bitcoin is over. SEC is making it clear that crypto will not be allowed to be used on corporate balance sheets.

The SEC lawsuit means that Facebook’s Libra is over before it even starts. While I can see the SEC being ok with USD pegged stablecoins like USDC or USDT as US dollar substitutes and various cryptos as equivalent to stock market investments, I don’t think the Fed will allow companies to create their own cash substitutes. And Libra is Facebook’s cash substitute. Facebook’s Libra is not a stablecoin pegged to the USD but to multiple currencies with its own formula. Regardless, Facebook meant Libra to be a cash substitute and the SEC simply won’t allow that. So Facebook’s Libra is out. Stellar is also going to get nailed by this because XLM is also a cash substitute.

To summarize, XRP, XLM and Libra are dead.

We likely see a big selloff in Bitcoin as the SEC forces Michael Saylor’s hand. As a result all other crypto sells off. But I think that is simply the next buying opportunity for our Gen 3 POS crypto. Neither Cardano, nor Polkadot, nor Algorand have any similarity to Ripple. They never were meant to be cash substitutes but tokens used to power a cloud computing network so they will be treated as securities (like Microsoft stock). The founders of these networks know all of that stuff and they know to stay away from money printing power of sovereign governments.

As soon Yellen comes around, Bitcoin and Ethereum will be assessed carbon taxes. This SEC lawsuit against Ripple is the beginning of the regulation of crypto. And once crypto gets regulated, the Proof-of-Work consensus carbon footprint will become a major issue for the governments in Europe and the US. So some form of carbon taxation for Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions will be the minimum we will see. Bitcoin can crash big time here. I won’t be surprised if Bitcoin drops to $10,000 and below in coming months. Once Bitcoin sells off, it will selloff fast. All that institutional buying of Bitcoin can stop on a dime if the SEC halts it. And we know that Bitcoin drags the whole alt-coin complex with it. So be ready for a big dip.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Want to invest but have a few loans,"As the title suggests I am really itching to invest.

I am 30 years old, married and with one 2 year old thank Gd.

How do you balance with paying down the loans (while I’m currently collecting unemployment) and wanting to put something away that I can start saving and having a solid return in 20-30 years?

personalfinance,PMI and Refinancing,"So I’m in the process of refinancing my mortgage and I just got it appraised. Here are my numbers so I can ask my question lol

My original loan when I first bought my house: $419,000
My current principal: $405,000
Current interest rate: 4.75%

Appraised value: $500,000
New loan with closing costs rolled in: $412,000
New interest rate: 3.25%

So I refinanced because I want a lower monthly payment and a better interest rate and I really really wanted to get rid of PMI. However, in order to get rid of PMI, I have to hit the 80% threshold which is $400,000. I was so close but now I still owe PMI. 

My question is, can I still get rid of PMI when my principal hits $400,000 based off my appraised value? Or is it based off my original loan? Do I have to get it appraised again just to get rid of PMI? How long are appraisals valid for?",finance
personalfinance,Is it better to have an auto loan or private student loans?,"So basically, I have two big expenses coming up. I will be buying a car for probably around $11K in March, and then I will start a 2 year masters program in the fall. 

Luckily I got a fellowship for full tuition. I will be taking out federal students loans for cost of living for my master's, but the max of 20500 annually won't quite cover it all (high CoL area).

So, there are two routes that I could take based on my amount of savings:

1) Buy the car in March with cash (which will deplete a lot of savings) and supplement my federal student loans with private student loans when I get low on money 

2) Get an auto loan for the car in March and then live off of savings plus federal student loans during grad school


I'm trying to logic my way toward which one is better - should i basically pick whichever one (auto loan vs private student loan) has a lower interest rate? My credit score is ""excellent"" so hopefully they won't be awful.


Are auto or private student loans typically higher interest? From my quick initial research it seems that auto is lower. Are there any other risks I'm not taking into account? Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Helping my father save for retirement (tough situation),"What is situation: My father retires in 5yrs at 67, but he can pull it off to 69 so say 7yrs. He has only 45k in 401k (mother has no 401k). He doesn't know anything about the stock market and is fearful of something he doesn't understand. So his cash savings are ~50k in full value. His income is not enough to max out yearly contribution into 401k (his company stopped matching since covid but they used to match only $2,000 annually, and according to his budget the max he can contribute is 8k yearly or 15% of his salary). As for debts.. His mortgage rate is 2.75% with 10yrs remaining after making some principal payments (200k total remaining after 5yrs in). He has solar panels, which will be paid off in 2021, so no electric bills. Their cars are paid off. No credit-card debt. His credit score is around 800. So there is some positive even though overall situation is dangerous.


What I did: I changed my dad's 401k to 60% stock, 40% bonds. I will raise it to 65-35 once post-covid (#1, should I go aggressive 70-30 for couple years for bit more compound interest on his 401k?).

personalfinance,Should I finance or buy car outright?,"Hi Everyone,

So I'm finally getting my credit under control and things are looking up after making some mistakes in my early 20's (got roped into one of those student credit cards that gave me a crazy limit, hospital bill right out of college with no insurance, a calamity of errors and bad circumstances; oh well life goes on!). I make about 70k/year before taxes and this could reach 100k in 2021. I have \~25k in the bank. I'm lucky enough to own my house outright and just pay heat, electricity, cable, water, and property tax totaling around 500/month. I have 2 credit cards with $1000 limits that I charge around 200-300 each month and pay off in full every month. 

My FICO score is \~645. My current car is ""worthless"", engine failure after 280k miles (Hey at least it lasted a long time) its probably worth 500 bucks in scrap but is otherwise negligible. 

My current plan is to buy something nice and reliable with low miles in the $10-12k range that will last me a few years while I keep building my credit score and might hold some value when I go to sell it. 

Basically I'm wondering if it would be worth financing $4000-$5000 even though my interest rate will be high (10-12%) in order to have another mechanism building my credit, does this make sense or should I just pay for it outright?

Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,First time home buyer Orlando seeking advice,"Hello, as the title states we are a married couple with no kids looking to buy our first home in southern Orlando area. I have a stable job earning about 120k per year with a total take home of about 6200 per month (this is a slight underestimation because my wife does not currently work and she was working a part time job last year and I forgot to adjust my w2 to account for this). My estimated tax refund will be about 6-7k. 

I contribute 10% to  401k and max out my hsa (660 per month). My only debt is student loan which is at 32k which I am making minimum payments (770) at the moment because my interest rate is at 0.54% in order to save for a down. I have almost 50k in savings so would only be comfortable putting 5% down right now in order to keep some savings. 

We are considering a new build house which would be about 440k - 450k depending on upgrades. I got a preauthorization from the builders preferred lender for monthly payment of 2600k (includes tax, pmi, home insurance, hoa and interest rate of 2.75%) build time would be 6 months and would not be able to lock in a rate until closer to build completion at which point I would shop around to see if I could get a lower interest rate

Internet in the area would cost 100, water and electricity I estimate would be about 250 per month, and groceries at ~300. We eat out occasionally but due to covid very little now. 

That would mean about 50% of take home would be going to fixed monthly expenses. If we were to go through with this I would start to pay student loan a little more aggressively to try and complete it within the next two years. I would also try to make additional payments to the house to pay it down faster before we have kids. My wife does plan to work again but I want to budget this out considering my income alone as we are planing for kids in the future.

There are houses that are cheaper (350k+) but those houses are a lot older and would require a lot of work. There aren’t many resale homes on the market around this specific area and looks like everything that does come up is being priced about 20k higher than similar houses that were posted in the summer and selling within days. Other new builders are also increasing the prices of their houses by about 20k for 2021 including the builder we are considering.  Does this seem doable or am I being optimistic?",finance

personalfinance,Ally Auto how to pay car off the quickest?,"Long story short, I got a car and this is my first time making payments on a car

The total amount owed on the car was about $6653

My minimum payment is $239 however I have intended to pay much more than that from the start thinking I am going to save on interest and get out of my only debt which is this car

My interest rate is 17.25% even though my credit score is high because apparently I don't have enough of a history

Anyway, this is my question

The company is Ally and I am confused on how the hell I am supposed to save in interest and pay this car off quick like I am and did intend

I just put $500 on the car instead of $239 last month which brought it down to $6293

My next due date wasn't until December 26th which hasn't happened yet

I just paid $861 as an extra payment and it brought it down to $5512

That was supposed to go down to $5432 but instead went to $5512 which means they took 80 from me which I'm assuming was interest that was owed for each day

Well my due date was dec 26 and now it says a payment isn't due until Jan 26 whenever I never told it to switch the due date and specifically told it to be a extra payment 

So my thing is this

I have almost another 2k I can put on this debt in the next month

I was going to put anywhere from 500-800 a month on this when my minimum payment is only $239

But I noticed they keep taking interest out when I am trying to make EXTRA payments 

I thought that i would pay the interest once a month on my minimum normal payment but that my extra money would go straight to the remaining principal debt

I am trying to pay off my car fast and not owe a crap ton in interest and I am getting confused if I am getting ripped off or not or if this is normal

For example my loan is supposed to be for 3 years but they would make over $1300+ in interest on me

I was trying to pay my car off in about 5 months and put $800 a month on it to AVOID paying that crazy interest

I figured they would get a few hundred of interest on me maybe over the course of 5-8 months

Does anyone have any experience with ally and how I can pay this car off as quick as possible

I have almost 2 grand to put on it but I want it to go to the actually debt and not stupid interest when its EXTRA payments and not my monthly payment I am trying to use to pay the car off faster

I was supposed to pay dec 26th and it moved it to Jan 26th when I thought by paying extra it would just take my debt down while still making me pay on dec 26th my minimum payment of $239

Instead it says I don't owe anything until Jan 26th

I specifically told it NOT to lower my next month payment and to go to my debt 

What is the best way to LOWER my interest as low as I can get it and the quickest way to pay this car off

I was trying to put $800 a month on it extra but if they are somehow still making a lot of interest on extra payments that seems like bs",finance

defi,DeFiPie Staking-as-a-Service –Providing DeFi Users an Alternative to Lending,"Lending  activities  are  subject  to  several  risks.  When  borrowers  use  volatile  assets  as collateral, a sharp price drop can result in the lender losing some of the value of the loan after it is liquidated. Furthermore, an oversupply of loans on the marketplace can suppress the interest rates available to lenders. However, users of the [DeFiPie](https://defipie.com/) app will also be able to earn returns from staking.Staking is entirely distinct from lending. Users don’t transfer their asset to any other entity. The governance rights associated with their asset is delegated to a validator node in the given PoS network. As a result, the validator node receives greater rewards for theiractivities in providing consensus and a portion of this reward is distributed to stakers.The market for PoS is over four times the size of the current DeFi market. Over $10 billion in USD valueis currently locked for staking in major PoS networks. Many of these staking networks currently pay nominal interest between 5% to 10% each year. These networks typically require an extremely high number of tokens to set up a validator node. The DeFiPie app allows users to tap into this large market without the stringent requirements to run a validator node.Through the DeFiPie app, users with a specified amount of PIE tokens will be able to create a pool where different users can combine their coins to stake. DeFiPie will initially support the leading PoS networks –Tezos (XTZ), Cosmos (ATOM), Polkadot (DOT), Cardano (ADA), Celo (cGLD), and Kusama (KSM). More PoS networks will be added in the future.Stakers will be subject to some of the lowest fees for staking services on the market. The fees will be the difference between the nominal yield rate and what the delegators receive. The staking service will be entirely non-custodial meaning that users will have full control over their assets at all times. Furthermore, users can withdraw their stake at any given time with no penalty.Users who choose to receive their staking rewards in PIE tokens will earn greater returns. These users will benefit from an additional 0.5% on top of the default rate. For comparison, not receiving payouts in PIE tokens takes away 0.5% from the default rate.",cryptocurrency

datascience,Lack of Hold-Out Set Leads to State Wasting $365k,"&gt;The last week has seen a flurry of emails exchanged with the SHPO and DOT of a state on the East Coast that were a mix of sad, bewildering, and frustration inducing. The scandal is still unfolding in real time, so I won’t out the specific state until I hear their response (though even the district archaeologists know what state it is at this point).  
&gt;  
&gt;Below you will find why the $365k-model is useless, and then a description of why — to my reading — this happened. The second part is definitely the most important, so feel free to skip ahead.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Seeds Of The Bitter Harvest**  
&gt;  
&gt;A few years back, a DOT got visited by some Good Idea Fairies, who instructed them to create a statewide predictive model for prehistoric archaeological sites. Naturally, they ended up partnering with one of the large engineering firms who has to pay for archaeological surveys all the time.  
&gt;  
&gt;A cynical person would wonder why some company that has to pay for surveys on a regular basis would be commissioned by their regulator to provide a model on where they don’t have to survey, but I prefer to read the situation more charitably.  
&gt;  
&gt;For the measly sum of $365,900.70 of taxpayer money, this firm agreed to provide the shiniest of all shiny models, complete with a GIS overlay that SHPO/DOT could make available to archaeologists.  
&gt;  
&gt;This model would later (and as of writing, still is) be required to be utilized on most DOT projects and all large projects that require cultural resource surveys.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Delivery**  
&gt;  
&gt;After working on this model from middle of 2013 to around the new year for 2015, the contracted consultant had managed to deliver a model and 7 volumes of documentation to the DOT.  
&gt;  
&gt;Unfortunately, no one seems to have read the documentation until now. The model likely spits out nonsense numbers. A very simplified discussion of why is below.  
&gt;  
&gt;The consulting company used all the unsurveyed land of this state as the negative data set.  
&gt;  
&gt;Note how known sites = 1 and unobserved background land = 0  
&gt;  
&gt;I hope this makes you say, “Wait. Isn’t that the very land we want the model to make predictions about?” Congratulations. You could have saved this state from a 1/3 of a million dollar mistake.  
&gt;  
&gt;The environmental background is not a negative data set  
&gt;  
&gt;Using the null data at all in the models (a mixture of regressions and Random Forest) is generally not appropriate anyways. And it certainly shouldn’t be used as the negative data. But even if the null portion of the data was in the independent variables instead of the dependent one, you can still wreak havoc with your models.  
&gt;  
&gt;The way they checked their work did not utilize best practices for handling data.  
&gt;  
&gt;Why didn’t the consultant’s data scientist realize they had goofed up at Step 1 before toiling away for a year and a half? It has to do with how they checked their work.  
&gt;  
&gt;Normally the gold standard is to hold back a randomly selected portion of your model. Then, once you’ve trained your model, you can see if it actually performs when given real-world data.  
&gt;  
&gt;That was not done here.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, there is a reason why. It’s because the data scientist did this type of validation within each model. Unfortunately, that’s not enough. We won’t get into the technical reasons of why, but you want nested layers of validation — you want to check your work both inside the model and outside.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, having used up the entire store of data by running the models, how did the consultant check their work? Basically, they used some arcane statistical methods. And they probably should have worked. But they didn’t.  
&gt;  
&gt;They treated the known sites as a product of random sampling.  
&gt;  
&gt;We all know that even within a project area, not all land is sampled at the same rate. Just to use shovel testing (because STPs are easy to count), let’s assume you have 100 acres of land. You consider 50 acres to be “high” probability and 50 acres to be “low” probability, and you test them at different intervals — 15 meters and 30 meters are common.  
&gt;  
&gt;This means that 80% of your testing is done on the high probability land — because you can fit \~16 shovel tests on an acre at 15 meter intervals vs \~4 at 30 meters. So you need to find 80% of your sites on the high probability portion just to establish that both areas have equal probability of producing sites.  
&gt;  
&gt;So. You have a bunch of known sites. But they weren’t discovered from a random sampling of the landscape. They were found by looking where we thought we’d find them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Intuitively, most archaeologists know this. Why does it matter here? It matters because the distribution of the independent variables for the known (positive) data set was used for these arcane statistical tests. And that distribution was biased in ways the data scientist didn’t know and had no way of accounting for.  
&gt;  
&gt;See, this is kinda the reason why we hold back a last tranche of data.  
&gt;  
&gt;But wait! We haven’t hit the scandalous part yet!  
&gt;  
&gt;I could delve deeper into the modeling and why it cut some corners, but some guy making a mathematical mistake isn’t what’s the big deal. No, it’s much worse than that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The question isn’t why the model was made incorrectly — it’s why that wasn’t noticed until the last gasps of 2020, when some random person (me) happened to be reading the documentation as part of a background review of models in use at different agencies.  
&gt;  
&gt;Where was this guy’s boss?  
&gt;  
&gt;You’d think that for $365,000, you’d not throw one guy into a room alone for a couple years and then let him hand over the finished product without looking it over.  
&gt;  
&gt;There clearly was no “second set of eyes” on this project. All the way back in early 2014, in the third volume of documentation delivered to the DOT, the fatal mistake had already been made (using null data as negative data).  
&gt;  
&gt;Did this project have no oversight? You can’t even write a fiction story that’s 100+ pages without an editor. Why did a highly technical GIS-and-machine learning model not merit the gaze of someone else, either colleague or superior, before charging a DOT hundreds of thousands of dollars?  
&gt;  
&gt;Where was the DOT’s due diligence?  
&gt;  
&gt;Upon being delivered the documentation, who at the DOT was reading it? My guess is either nobody or nobody who understood it.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is pure speculation on my part, but I’d be willing to guess that the documentation was read, but not thoroughly, and not by someone who felt they knew enough about the technical side that they felt they could comment.  
&gt;  
&gt;Given the basic nature of the biggest model-breaking error, anyone with an undergraduate statistics course under their belt should have been able to pick up on the problem. But as a friend pointed out, very few programs steer archaeologists into math classes, and so very few archaeologists are comfortable criticizing smart people about complex methodology.  
&gt;  
&gt;Why wasn’t this tested in the last half decade, since it’s used to guide fieldwork plans?  
&gt;  
&gt;The SHPO forwarded me a short white paper from 2017–2018 where they’d attempted to at summarize, if not evaluate, the model and real-world data.  
&gt;  
&gt;The thrust of their data suggested that they didn’t understand how to evaluate the model, and to their credit, the SHPO author and the intern paper it was an extension of, stated as such.  
&gt;  
&gt;I did manage to pull enough data out of that one paper to look at a sample of 133 reports for 2017 across three regions of that state to give us some idea, though, of the model’s predictive power. Note that the numbers below are my own calculations, since I have not seen nor been told of any quantitative attempt to evaluate the SHPO/DOT model.  
&gt;  
&gt;The sample showed that each probability tier held the following sites: Low: 11.76%, Med: 5.88%, High: 82.35%. This would lead to a naive estimate that one should expect the Low areas of these regions to contain around 11% of the sites. Most archaeologists stop here.  
&gt;  
&gt;But adjusting for the fact that the Low area is 67% of the land in these regions and was only about 39% of the land, we end up with a weighted average of Low: 34.16%, Med: 8.02%, High: 57.82%.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, I didn’t adjust for anything else — like more sampling per acre of the High area — since I didn’t have that information. But note how the expected number of sites in the Low areas went from 11% to 34%, and all I did was account for the under/over representation of each probability tier in their sample.  
&gt;  
&gt;The less intense sampling per acre for the Low area vs the High area will definitely push the expected sites in unsurveyed Low area higher. Note that as you approach 67% of sites expected in the Low area, you are doing only as well as a coin flip (since 67% of the total land in those regions is Low).  
&gt;  
&gt;And how about the Medium area, huh? That’s 23% of the land by area, and only expected to contain 8% of sites based on this sample? This is a great time to point out that probability tiers shouldn’t be named things like “Medium” because it could actually end up with the lowest probability.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The TL;DR Takeaway**  
&gt;  
&gt;This wasted $365k of taxpayer money. It shows a cavalier approach to quality control at both a major company and the DOT it sold this model to. It also shows that a broken model is currently used for large, significant projects. I hope that it has never played a role in route selection for eminent domain projects.  
&gt;  
&gt;And honestly, if you want a predictive model, get something for about 3–5% of the cost of this one. Keep it simple, so you can update it and test it yourself. Complex math does not perform better than simpler math, even without the raft of quality control issues with this model.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m currently awaiting the SHPO and DOT responses, as I informed them only late last week. I should note that I do not work in this state, nor have any plans to do so in the near future. I have not been paid or otherwise compensated to lay out this critique to the DOT and SHPO. My motivation is mainly that I am professionally embarrassed by the lack of numeracy/oversight that led to this model being used to guide policy.

cardano,Is staking on Binance the same as earning interest?,"So the way staking on Binance works is, you are required to lock up your ADA for 30, 60 or 90 days and earn more rewards based on the lockup period you choose. I'm aware that staking from your wallet isn't earning interest; rather it is rewards for supporting nodes. These, however, do not have lockup periods. The reason why I'm asking if staking on Binance would be considered interest is for religious reasons. Earning interest is not allowed but staking in its pure form (rewards for supporting the ecosystem) is fine, because there is a pretty clear difference.

Edit: Binance also refers to the rewards as ""standard annualized interest rates"" which also has me concerned",cryptocurrency
investing,Biden's campaign announced a broad plan to invest in clean energy and improve America's infrastructure. Who do you expect to be the winners (or losers) if such a plan is implemented?,"From his [campaign site](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/):

&gt;Biden will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment, with a plan to deploy those resources over his first term, setting us on an irreversible course to meet the ambitious climate progress that science demands.

&gt;Biden will make far-reaching investments in:

&gt;**Infrastructure**: Create millions of good, union jobs rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure – from roads and bridges to green spaces and water systems to electricity grids and universal broadband – to lay a new foundation for sustainable growth, compete in the global economy, withstand the impacts of climate change, and improve public health, including access to clean air and clean water.

&gt;**Auto Industry**: Create 1 million new jobs in the American auto industry, domestic auto supply chains, and auto infrastructure, from parts to materials to electric vehicle charging stations, positioning American auto workers and manufacturers to win the 21st century; and invest in U.S. auto workers to ensure their jobs are good jobs with a choice to join a union.

&gt;**Transit**: Provide every American city with 100,000 or more residents with high-quality, zero-emissions public transportation options through flexible federal investments with strong labor protections that create good, union jobs and meet the needs of these cities – ranging from light rail networks to improving existing transit and bus lines to installing infrastructure for pedestrians and bicyclists.

&gt;**Power Sector**: Move ambitiously to generate clean, American-made electricity to achieve a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035. This will enable us to meet the existential threat of climate change while creating millions of jobs with a choice to join a union.

&gt;**Buildings**: Upgrade 4 million buildings and weatherize 2 million homes over 4 years, creating at least 1 million good-paying jobs with a choice to join a union; and also spur the building retrofit and efficient-appliance manufacturing supply chain by funding direct cash rebates and low-cost financing to upgrade and electrify home appliances and install more efficient windows, which will cut residential energy bills.

&gt;**Housing**: Spur the construction of 1.5 million sustainable homes and housing units.

&gt;**Innovation**: Drive dramatic cost reductions in critical clean energy technologies, including battery storage, negative emissions technologies, the next generation of building materials, renewable hydrogen, and advanced nuclear – and rapidly commercialize them, ensuring that those new technologies are made in America.

&gt;**Agriculture and Conservation**: Create jobs in climate-smart agriculture, resilience, and conservation, including 250,000 jobs plugging abandoned oil and natural gas wells and reclaiming abandoned coal, hardrock, and uranium mines – providing good work with a choice to join or continue membership in a union in hard hit communities, including rural communities, reducing leakage of toxics, and preventing local environmental damage.

&gt;**Environmental Justice**: Ensure that environmental justice is a key consideration in where, how, and with whom we build – creating good, union, middle-class jobs in communities left behind, righting wrongs in communities that bear the brunt of pollution, and lifting up the best ideas from across our great nation – rural, urban, and tribal.

Obviously Biden will have to negotiate this plan with Congress, and it's an open question as to whether Democrats will hold the Senate (which could significantly change what an Infrastructure deal looks like). If we take this plan at face value for the moment, who do you see as some of the likely beneficiaries?",finance

I am 27, a teacher with not much saved towards retirement. I’ll be making 42,000 this year at a private school. $8000 in credit card debt that I’m paying down (I had to use it for a medical emergency and recovery don’t use it for anything else and won’t until it is paid off). I owe a good bit in federal student loans, but the monthly payment is completely manageable. And I’m 6 months from paying off my car. Low 700 CS

My husband (30) is an electrician set to make 50k a year with no debt. Lower credit score than me (his business, just general info).

We have quite a few financial goals for the next couple of years.
-paying off debts
-starting my retirement savings 
-starting a college fund for our 7 month old (more for xmas and birthdays for now)
-buying a house

My question is—would it make sense to try and find a financial advisor? It seems like mostly people with a lot of money or who are completely underwater use them. We are neither. Not rich, but managing. 

Secondly—where do we find one? Maybe that’s a silly question, but any help would be great!

EDIT: The consensus is clearly “NO” for reasons that make sense. We’ll keep chugging along as we are (though we might tighten up the budget—hopefully can knock out the CC and car note by summer!) Thank you for the advice!

CryptoCurrency,Issuance is a form of subsidizing decentralization. If an argument can be made that the financial incentives to operators (miners/stakers) are excessive or insufficient then an argument can be for the implementation and execution of a dynamic monetary policy.,"I could add that I don't think an arbitrarily picked issuance schedule determined during the genesis of a new highly complex system is likely to be efficient through its lifecycle. The certainty of stability sacrifices the possibility of efficiency.

With respect to projects that have a dynamic monetary policy: I don't see any evidence to suggest developers have been enriching their pockets by keeping issuance at the levels they are. Dev funds generally hold balances in their native tokens and that makes them stakeholders - diluting the monetary base of native tokens is against their self interest. There is a great misunderstanding that the one's who are adjusting issuance are the recipients of the new tokens. Is there any documented case of this happening on any of the top crytocurrencies?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Is there a golden rule or key salary point in which one should switch from Roth IRA/Roth 401(k) contributions to tax-deferred Traditional IRA/401(k) contributions instead?,"From what I've gathered, if you are in a low-income tax bracket currently (let's say 10-12% federally), Roth contributions are the way to go. You'll get taxed on this money now, but the investment will grow tax-free, and you won't get taxed on it once you take it out for retirement, as long as you are already 59 and a half years old. This is common knowledge. As your income and salary steadily increases, however, the Traditional IRA/401(k) seems to become a better option. The tax-deferred quality of these options will put more money in your pocket now to help compound later on in the future. But, you'll need to pay taxes on it once you take it out, which could be a significant portion depending on what tax bracket you are in upon retirement. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is the information that I have become familiar with in the past few years or so. However, after reading JL Collins' ""The Simple Path to Wealth,"" I am beginning to reconsider how long one should wait to convert their Roth accounts to Traditional accounts. The money that is spent on getting taxed first could be used for compounding year after year, which could grow one's nest egg even quicker. This almost has me thinking that even people in low-income tax brackets (the 10-12% federal level as mentioned earlier) may be well-advised to start with Traditional IRAs/Traditional 401(k)s to enjoy tax-deferment immediately. Of course, this will be taxed when they are at the retirement age, but by then, will the extra cash that is compounded over the next few decades outweigh the taxation amount at retirement?

Bitcoin,A Jaundiced View at your Investment Options as a Millenial/GenZ'er,"I made this comment in another thread, but I've gotten numerous DM's and a comment asking me to make it its own free-standing post, so Merry Christmas, it's reproduced below.

Also, please feel free to be critical down below if you wish.  Attack the premises, make your own conclusions, I don't mind.  This my view, on balance given the data.

I am a late 30's, you could assert ""older millenial"" who is a professional.  I've been in BTC in earnest since around 2015/2016.  I made small buys initially, and escalated as I made more and more thereafter.

I will outright state that this is the *only* real asset that you younger folks have that can afford you the type of exponential pseudo de-risked relatively predictable gains that exists anymore. Why? Bear with me.

Let's go through your options relative to every generation before.

1.) Cash and Cash Equivalents - we're printing money at a rate that is literally unprecedented. Discussed ad infinitum here, but sufficing to say, we've printed something like 25-33 percent of all dollars in circulation in history in the last year. Grandma and Mom never faced QE/MMT. You do. Let's see how long we can last without inflation starting to kick in in earnest for everything below. [I'll give it like um 3 seconds.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/many-americans-used-part-of-their-coronavirus-stimulus-check-to-trade-stocks.html)

2.) Stocks/Equities - when your dad started earning and investing (and by ""dad"", I'll say boomer), the P/E ratio was at its second lowest in history, of about 7 (circa 1978-82). [Go look it up.](https://www.macrotrends.net/2577/sp-500-pe-ratio-price-to-earnings-chart) That means that for any given company, he basically only had to pay 6-7 times whatever it earned. What about you? Well, not only are you currently at a ratio of like 35 (which means that you're paying 5x more than dad for the same fundamentals), you're supposed to accept that that's *totally awesome* because 10 years prior, it was the **highest ever** at 122. That's right, you were being asked when some of you started your jobs to invest in the same stock but 20 times more expensive than dad, and now that it's ""just 5 times more expensive"", you should consider that a deal. Uh, sure.

3.) Bonds - well, if not stocks, then what about bonds? When mama started her trek into the world of fixed income, if she passed on the lowest PE ratio ever (since, you know, she didn't want to overpay or something), she could just go grab a bond and earn SIXTEEN PERCENT of a safe return. Don't believe me? [Go look it up.](https://advisor.visualcapitalist.com/us-interest-rates/) In other words, she could literally just put 10K in the bank, and come next year, she's got 1600 more. People go bananas when you suggest that Bitcoin could go up 20 percent a year, but mama could get it basically FOR FREE. Oh, and if that wasn't enough (because hell, why would it be for the blessed generation), the fed slowly cut rates over time as you can see on that graph. Why does that matter? Because if she actually DID have some bonds, each year they cut rates, the existing bonds she had could be sold for a profit since, you know, they were from last year and are giving back 16 percent instead of like 15. And they did this all the way for 30 years so mama and her chicas could keep doing this over and over again. Well, how about you? See down at the weee corner of the graphic? Where it says ""all time low""? Yeah, that's you. You put something in bonds, you get 0.5%, possibly ZERO if the Chairman of the Fed is to be believed. But maybe you get some and the fed cuts just like for mama, so the bonds you have can make some money, right? Oh wait, going BELOW ZERO means that anyone buying bonds is *literally losing money buying them* \- that is, a rate of minus 0.5 percent means I buy a bond for 10000 dollars and each year they *take away 50 dollars*. Who tf would do that? Yeah, that's right, barely anyone except our strange Euro brethren - and it ain't havin the effect it had for mama - so no that isn't an option.

Edit:  A commenter argued that while the *nominal rate* was 16 percent in 1981, the *inflation adjusted rate* was much less.  Yes, that's true.  But we don't do *inflation adjust rates* for literally any other asset, particularly BTC - in fact, we literally argue that inflation is a major reason *why BTC goes up* in USD.  In addition, our notion of inflation being the CPI - and thus without the major contributions of healthcare, education, and housing which have literally been the things that have blown up in the last 30 years - is *highly highly misleading*.  I strongly suspect that with a more modern view of inflation - that is, readjusted for healthcare, education, and housing increases - our *inflation adjusted return* on 0.5% bonds is *even worse* than I'm stating relative to mama.

4.) Real Estate - my favorite. Everyone's favorite. ""They're not making any more of it"" - err, except for that massive high rise that's blocking my view of the nice park that just got built and that one over there, and that one too. Regardless, I'll admit that *certain markets* might be less overvalued, buuuut, [let's go to the graph again, shall we](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USSTHPI)? Since this is a repeating pattern, go look at papa's opportunity on the waaaay left over there, and then go look at your opportunity on the waaay right. It's almost like yet again, you're paying 4x more than papa. To be fair, that's a better deal than equities or bonds, but if you think that's a legitimate deal, I've got a baseball card here that I've just jacked up the price 3x for no particular reason that you should buy. Seriously. It's a steal, young millenial - just pay me in BTC, natch.

Edit:  An astute commenter mentioned that it's *land* that isn't being made anymore - yeah I know, but in practical terms, most people who argue its *land* that isn't made anymore will turn around and then offer you to buy *that* *condo over there.*  And there's no doubt that housing prices have risen on average over the last 30 years.  I strongly suspect land prices on average have as well, but I'm willing to look at counter data.

5.) Gold - aight, I'm not going to argue too hard against Gold. Well, except a little. Why? Well, [let's go to the graphs again](https://www.macrotrends.net/1333/historical-gold-prices-100-year-chart), because that's how we should roll. So yeah, Grandpa annihilates us on this metric (you're paying 5x his rate), but then again, dude went through WWII and was eating grass while dodging the Nazis in Caen or whatever it's called, so I'll cut him some slack. But mama? Wait, even SHE got a goddamn dip (see that 1980-1982 move). Admittedly she'd have had to ""endure a bear market"" but notice how just around the time YOU started making some cheese, you're already paying 1.1 to now 2x whatever it is they could have gotten. Again, this is better than everything else we've read, but it's still overvalued *in relative terms, particularly if you have BTC as an option.*

6.) Art/Fine Wine/Whiskey - Masterworks aside, if you've got enough to yolo into Picassos at Sotheby's, wtf are you doing here anyway? And if it's Wine or Whiskey, why aren't you sharing ffs? Drink that shit. I'll help.

7.) Bitcoin - clearly the best option. It's undervalued, misunderstood by everyone else, is basically a monetary base, and here's the massive kicker - the biggest guys literally CANNOT get in in earnest without spiking the price. ""Accredited investors"" can't just in aggregate airmail in a billion dollars without being fearful that the spot price will increase and they'll have to pay through the nose. Indeed, they literally can only get in once she gets to a market cap of trillions. However, the little guy? You? You don't move the price with your daily $1.50 ""no, ffs, I didn't drink a latte or eat avocado toast, you stereotyping jackasses, I put it in the one place that I have that you can't control with your shitty financial tomfoolery"" buys. She's literally designed to have small buys that, because she can compound exponentially, become big buys that cannot be diluted out because the Fed decided the Boomers needed one more bailout.

Oh, and one final demonstration of thievery - here's [your wages versus your productivity](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/10/03/us-wages-have-been-rising-faster-than-productivity-for-decades/?sh=7413bb7e7342) (and to an astute commenter below, yes, I've intentionally linked an article that disagrees with me to provide balance *and to make sure someone is actually looking at the graphs* \- [here's a link that gets you to the original source](https://www.google.com/search?q=EPI+wages+versus+productivity&amp;oq=EPI+wages+versus+productivity&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33i22i29i30.3821j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)).

Original Post: 

Apologies if this isn't the right subreddit for this, I didn't know where else to post...

A few weeks ago I ordered an expensive laptop from HP. It was ""delivered"" by FedEx, who claims that I both signed for it, and then they left it in the apartment office (we don't have one).

I started an investigation through FedEx two and a half weeks ago, but whenever I call for an update I get told they're ""still trying to contact the driver.""

HP said they would start an investigation with FedEx, but said as long as I get a police report and send it to them they would be able to send me another laptop or just give me a refund.

I did that and sent it in a week ago. I've tried waiting literal hours on hold trying to reach a sales rep through their customer service line they keep providing me with to check for updates, but never get through so my only option is to email and wait a few days for a response. Finally, after sending another email wherein I asked for any sort of update I was told that they're still investigating with FedEx.

If I'm being unreasonable, please let me know - maybe this is normal in this type of incident. But I'm not wealthy and I spent a large portion of my savings on this as I need it for my work. Now I not only can't do the work I need this for but I'm currently on the hook for the cost.

The bill for my credit card which I put this on has already been paid.

Can I/should I try to initiate a charge back with my credit card company and just find another company to order a laptop from? Or is it too late once the bill has been paid?

I've never done a chargeback before so I'm not sure what the process is here.",finance

defi,DeFiPie Liquidity Pool-as-a-Service –Providing Deep Liquidity to DeFi Protocols,"Adequate liquidity is essential to the successful operation of DeFi services. A lack of liquidity causes significant challenges to users. Prices in decentralized trading become extremely volatile. Interest rates available for loans fluctuate sharply. Lenders may be unable to withdraw their assets.Some DeFi protocols have addressed liquidity by allowing users to pool their liquidity. However, these liquidity pools remain distinct from lending and staking. DeFiPie will be the first to integrate liquidity pools, lending services, and staking services to maximisethe liquidity accessible to the user.Any investor will be able to deposit their idle assets into a liquidity pool and earn a reward on their allocated assets. Rewards will vary based on how the liquidity is utilized. There are several possible means by which the assets can deepen the liquidity of the integrated services:·Provide liquidity for loans.In this case, the asset allocator receives rewards in the form of lending interest.·Provide liquidity for decentralized trading.In this case, the asset allocator receives a share of the trading fees.·Facilitating swapsbetween assets. If a user deposits Ether but there is an oversupply of this asset while USDT is highly demanded, the Ether can be used to provide liquidity for the demand of USDT. The deposited ETH can be immediately swapped for USDT and loaned out.·Facilitate staking·Prevent  illiquidity  events.  Many  lenders  seeking  to  withdraw  their  assets simultaneously can oftentimes lead to insufficient assets for withdrawal. This has happened several times on the largest DeFi protocol Compound.When illiquidity events occur, the system should adjust interest rates to increase liquidity. However, this can take time to restore liquidity. With [DeFiPie](https://defipie.com/), the assets deposited by users can be used to fill the gaps in liquidity while the system is adjusting. Asset owners receive higher yield if their assets are used for these circumstances. This adds a layer of robustness to the DeFiPie liquidity.When a user invests in a DeFiPie liquidity pool, the system determines how the assets will be allocated. Figures can expect positive ROI but returns will fluctuate. For predetermined payouts, users can choose to invest in staking. However, the real returns of staking will be impacted by the volatility of the asset which is staked.Users receive a stand-in token for the assets invested in liquidity pools. The stand-in token is referred to as a p-token and will represent ownership of the capital allocated to a liquidity pool. For instance, those who allocate ETH will receive a p-ETH token while those that allocate USDT will receive a p-USDT token. Rewards will be calculated based on the number

&gt;Americans are likely to see prices jump across a variety of sectors next year, thanks in part to Covid-19 vaccines that will potentially turbocharge demand for such pandemic casualties as travel and tickets to sporting events.

&gt;With prices also climbing for some inputs such as copper and lumber, inflation could very well reach or surpass the Federal Reserve’s 2% target in some months. Financial markets are increasingly pricing in higher inflation in coming years, and debates over whether the central bank should start easing back its record monetary stimulus may intensify.

Finally I dug the information up online, and basically new employees will pay 4.4 percent of salary towards the FERs retirement! American electric power retirement, employee March and health insurance options were far superior, so I ended up turning down the job offer. Currently I’m working as an electric power dispatcher for a city. Our retirement multiplier is .02 x highest 3 year salary x years of service and we receive a 6% match on our 401k. Oh yeah, our health insurance is completely free for the employee. I currently make 105,000 a year. I should be around 130,000 within the next two years. I just want to clarify for gents looking at federal jobs. There are a lot better benefit packages. Don’t get sucked into the rumor mill that federal benefits are great! Federal benefits aren’t bad, but look at all your options because the federal government can not balance a check book. Your 4.4 % invested over 30 years into an IRA would leave you with a much bigger nest egg in retirement.",finance

Bitcoin,bitcoin and the law of thermodynamics,"is it a coincidence that the price action of bitcoin is accelerating with the amount of money printing? 

it seems to be reflecting the analogy that michael saylor discussed that bitcoin obeys the laws of thermodynamics and is a “pure closed system” with no energy leakage (inflation). in the universe, energy can’t be created or destroyed, it must flow somewhere else. value is the same: value can’t be created or destroyed it must flow somewhere else.

concerning the laws of thermodynamics, the fiat system leaks energy (value) in the form of inflation - and that energy (inflation) leakage flows into assets where the elite experience an increase in wealth in form of prices of real estate, rare art, stocks and bonds going up.

consequently your purchasing power (energy/value) decreases. so the flow of value/energy is flowing from the poor to the rich. 

so due to the astronomical money printing and low interest rates set by central banks, the amount of fiat liquidity has swelled and is flooding the markets in a tsunami of inflation (leaking energy).

all of that energy (inflated leaking value) needs to flow somewhere and bitcoin is sucking it all in when it traditionally went to other safe haven assets like real estate, rare art, stocks and bonds. 

bitcoin is like a black hole sucking up the flood of fiat and leaking value (inflation). but the miraculous part is that bitcoin then converts that energy/value into a cryptographically scarce number behind a wall of miner energy (proof of work).

bitcoin is the first pure closed system humanity has ever achieved, meaning that the increase in price is due to bitcoin absorbing all of the leaking energy (inflation) and then containing it in a closed system that won’t leak that energy (value) because that energy (value) is now cryptographically scarce.

this is how the flow of value is now more fair because if you participate in bitcoin, you don’t experience energy leakage (loss in value). the value/energy stays in the system amongst those who participate and does not leak/flow outside of the system to the benefit of another group. 

tldr: energy can’t be created or destroyed. it must flow somewhere else. value can’t be created or destroyed and must also flow somewhere else. the fiat system leaks energy/value through inflation and that value flows somewhere else like real estate, rare art, stocks and bonds. bitcoin doesn’t leak energy/value - in fact it can absorb excess energy like hyper inflation of an economy and then turn that excess energy/value into a cryptographically scarce number and secure that number/value/energy behind a wall of miner energy (proof of work).",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,"Ponzi scheme or Audit Crypto.com, BlockFi, Celsius","I watched friends invest in Bitcoinnect for over a year and constantly said it was likely a ponzi. It was one of the most obvious ones I have ever seen. However, not all are obvious. For example, Bernie Madoff ran one for decades after a very reputable carrier working for Nasdaq etc. The returns he faked were not outrageous, around 10% a year. Ponzi's can vary dramatically. 

I am not worried about the referral codes etc. I am worried because these programs pay interest rates that are way above market interest rates on deposits, but pretty normal on loans. To the best of my knowledge none of these companies has provided a third party audit that actually shows how much they have they are paying out on deposits compared to how much they are receiving in loan interest. The closest thing I have found is a ""audit"" of Celsius by Chainalysis showing how much Bitcoin was at certain wallets. That doesn't show if they are actually able to pay out depositors with the money they are collecting from lenders. 

That doesn't help me feel better and it shouldn't help you feel better. I want a real audit! These companies could certainly be making plenty of money from lenders to where they are able to cover interest to depositors. I just would like to see some proof. Bitcoin has had average annual returns over 100%, and with nothing I would consider proof it isn't a ponzi I don't feel comfortable risking that for another 6%. 

That being said I would love to earn another 6% so if anyone knows of some good audits that would be great.

personalfinance,2 Questions about my future?,"Some useful info. 31yr old make a little over 100k per year. I started late un my 401k so I only have about 50k.

1. I have some debt about 30k from student loans, vehicle, some credit cards, misc. I contribute 18% into my 401k or about $250 per week with employer match 4%. My question is I was going to drop down my 18% to 4% to pay off hopefully all of my debt because of the interest rates, some are 15-18% rates (I had bad credit rating when I was younger and made some poor decisions). Would it be more beneficial to do this or just continue 18% into 401k I thought about the X amount of dollars that wouldn't get compounded while I was paying off the debt.

2. After I pay off the debt I wanted to purchase a house, I was considering putting down the minimum amount down payment and investing the rest. It seems at the end of my mortgage a minimum down payment wouldnt add to much overall to what I owed and the money would be better off invested. Is this a good strategy?

Bitcoin,has anyone seen the chernobyl miniseries?,"here's an idea for a bitcoin meme i'd like to make, but don't have the skills to do:

There's a scene in the HBO miniseries chernobyl where this guy who was investigating the meltdown and cleanup goes to present what exactly happened - he's explaining why the reactor melted down.

He starts explaining how the reactor consists of a balance of different forces, some of which reduce the power output  and others increase it. This old man tells the court how the things which reduced the power output were all taken out (in attempt to get the output up), and then as the output started growing unpredictably,  what they thought was going to shut the reactor down actually caused it to blow up further.

If you swap out 'the power output' with inflation, and the nuclear engineers with 'the fed', i think you get a pretty decent metaphor here.

investing,The Case for REITs in 2021,"I have been investing and trading for a little over a year now, and I'm trying to make the case for REITs being a part of my portfolio in 2021. The Fed and the US Federal gov't are determined to keep the markets/economy propped up until some normalcy returns. The dividend yields on REITs look tasty, but I realize there is a slight risk with them. J. Powell/the Fed has stated they are committed to keeping interest rates low through 2021 and possibly through 2023. Does this not beckon stable returns on qualified dividends for REITs? Some REITs buy mortgage backed securities (MBS) from an agency like the US (Ex: Freddie Mac) at a \~2% int. rate and then see a higher return from the interest on the individual mortgages which may pay \~4% return. This is just an example, but I wanted to get someone's thoughts on this. If interest rates stay low enough, REITs could see a consistent cash flow for potentially the next 4 - 8 quarters?",finance
CryptoCurrency,How do Interest-paying accounts really work? Do we believe they are sound?,"I’m currently using Nexo and BlockFi to pay over 5% - which is great, because it means I can increase my crypto holdings without increasing exposure.  I also spread my risk by keeping a third of my coins in cold storage.  I think this is a great service, and could be yet another reason why crypto can be central to the financial services industry in the future.

I know all the “Not your keys, not your coins” points, and recognise that if these companies fold, it could be a long time before I get hold of my coins if ever.  However I also recognise that they are regulated companies who must be audited.

But I can’t help feeling that a 5% return is very high in this low interest rate world.  I don’t see how the companies’ business model allows them to pay this rate - unless they are just gambling their balance sheet on the continued increase in price, and funding the dividend payment from new customers’ crypto - essentially a form of Ponzi.  If that is the case, a price crash is likely to bring down all companies using this model, so spreading risk across them is illusory.

A price crash for me otherwise wouldn’t be an issue, because I’m hodling for the long term, but I am considering whether this risk is too high.

I’d still like to buy the house and go back to school if possible. 


I am a teacher in my late twenties. I have a gross income of ~40,000 a year. My monthly pay check is around 2200.00. 

My current home was bought ~4 years ago at 112k and is now selling around 145k. My payments are 750.00 a month (Including tax and insurance).

The house I’m interested in is 227k and my payments are estimated to be 1143.00 (Including tax and insurance). This is with a 10% down payment and paying off the PMI.

The new house is much bigger and I’m getting 10k instant equity because newer ones like it being built have a starting price of 240k.

My mom is staying with me for the foreseeable future and will pay rent of 400 a month, plus be buying groceries. I also have a potential roommate for the third bedroom who will pay 500 a month.

The total cost of my grad school will be around ~10k and I am planning on either setting up monthly payments through the school or getting financial aid.

personalfinance,20 year old looking for a new bank after moving cities that would benefit me more.,"I'm 20 years old I just moved to San Antonio, TX so I need a new bank. I have 2 that I have been having my eye on but I don't know which would be better for me. I just started working at a car dealership on the 14th of this month mainly commission and I will be averaging anywhere from $3,000 to $10,000 each month.

What I'm looking for is something easy, fee-free ATMs if I ever need to withdraw cash, high savings account rate, and that's about it actually.

I was told about Randolph Brooks Credit Union (RBFCU) and had some questions for anyone who has banked with them or does currently bank with them. I've seen that they have ""tiered dividend money market accounts"" I'm not really sure what that is but from what I can see on their website they look pretty decent with a 0.20% interest rate on the savings account I believe (I only looked at it for a few minutes due to me being at work).

I was also looking into Discover online banking since I already have a credit card with them, they have a 0.50% APY savings account, along with a 1% cash back debit card which I LOVE because I don't like to use my credit card for things I don't need to, I normally just use it to pay bills and necessities but not for spending so it would be great to earn some cashback for what I spend with debit.

I'm leaning toward Discover more because I love their services and have never had any trouble with them so I'm more comfortable going with somebody I'm familiar with plus the 1% cashback debit card would be really awesome for me along with the ability to freeze my debit AND credit card if I were to ever misplace or lose them.

There's also the possibility to just open up the other one later but for right now I don't want to have multiple banks until I start to get some money.",finance

personalfinance,Next financial steps (diversification of company RSUs?),"Hello,

I'm trying to learn a bit of financial savvy in regards to my financial next steps and felt I could use a bit of personal advice, because the general advice seems to not quite fit my situation.

My husband and I are reaching a point where our ""emergency funds"" are over our anticipated 6-8 months of expenses and I'd like to know what to do next with the savings moving forward. A couple of points:

* $75,000 in our emergency fund in a HYSA (although not quite ""high"" anymore..)
* No student debt, no major credit card debt, only ""debt"" is a small car loan at a very low interest rate 
* Already have a HSA that I invest, with employer contributing a match each year
* Both of us have 401ks and are currently contributing the max
* Have been working at a major tech company that gives RSUs as a part of my income for 6 years now (~6 years worth of RSU grants)

Ideally, I'd like to both diversify my investments by selling my RSUs when they become available to me to diversify away from my company (I started reading about this this year and (un?) fortunately, my stock has rose significantly since I started working, so I'd probably only sell new stock to avoid serious capital gains taxes) AND figure out what to do with the ~$2,250 my husband and I typically put toward our emergency fund each month now that it's basically funded.

I'm a little troubled by the idea that BTC is still mainly controlled by miners in china, furthermore it is still prone manipulation in the form of whales pumping and dumping in order to manipulate the price. These kinds of practices are heavily regulated on wall street. BTC has none such protections. This lends itself as an argument against BTC being a safe store of wealth.

Secondly, I feel the potential for government regulation is already high, and will only increase if the Fed latches onto the idea that this thing is still used by shady parties for shady business dealings.

Lastly, BTC is not the only game in town when it comes to digital payments. global banks are innovating and building their own solutions around streamlining global payments. Some of these solutions are based on tokenization, some are not. This lends itself as an argument against BTC being a global payment medium.

Those are my main concerns. I have significant skin in the BTC game, but i've been more and more hesitant to continue investing based on these possibilities. Curious who here agrees, disagrees, thinks i'm a complete moron (Likely many).

defi,DeFiPie Custom Lending Pools –Giving Users Power Over Interest Rates,"Current lending platforms such as Compound and Aave have algorithmically determined interest rates based on demand and supply. Users do not have the option to create their own pool with customised terms and rates. Users have no choice but to lend at the rates determined by the algorithm.   
 [DeFiPie](https://defipie.com/) allows users to set up lending pools where they regain control over interest rates and collateralization terms. Lending pools are distinct from liquidity pools in the manner that it requires its members to vote on matters such as rates and governance.   
 Any user with a sufficient amount of PIE tokens can start a lending pool for a specific asset and invite other network members to join the pool. Pools can be created for any of the assets supported by DeFiPie such as ETH, DAI, USDT, BAT, USDC, and SNX   
Pool members will have discretion over the following;  
·Lending and borrowing rates·Range of assets accepted as collateral  
·Rate of collateralization·Minimum number of PIE tokens required to become a pool admin  
·Minimum number of PIE tokens required to participate in the voting which determines the interest rate  
·Whether a higher interest rate is rewarded to those who decide to receive their rewards in PIE tokens  
·Frequency of interest rate reviews·Minimum membership duration·Penalty for leaving the pool early   


Pool admins can specify the minimum difference between lending and borrowing rates which will represent their margin as pool operators. Similar to liquidity pools, those who allocate capital will receive p-tokens and will receive rewards daily based on the number of p-tokens held.DeFiPie users will be able to monitor a list of custom pools with their respective lending rates in a dedicated section. It will be possible for users to switch pools at any given time if a better opportunity arises. However, some pools may have penalty fees for early withdrawal.DeFiPie’s goal is to give maximum control to the user. The freedom for users to easily switch between pools and maximise their rate of return is closely aligned with this goal",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,How to leverage a paid off house?,"Tl;dr: is there a better way to cash out on a paid off house to capitalize on current low interest rates outside of a cash out refinance or HELOC?
  
With the low mortgage rates right now, I'm curious to hear of different tools we could use to leverage The equity in our home to build more equity. We built our home out of pocket a few years ago and intend to build rental units. We served as our own contractor (though not licensed as we didn't use a bank). We looked into hiring a contractor to build the next unit and were quoted upwards of $300/sq ft for the construction (we already own the land outright and are able to clear and prep the lot ourselves). I understand material costs have gone up with covid and we live in a very expensive area, but that quote is insane. We were able to build our current home for about $110/sq ft doing it ourselves. 
  
We don't have the resources this time around to build completely out of pocket, plus capitalizing on the low interest rates is very attractive. Is a cash out refinance or HELOC our only options here to get cash-in-hand to build ourselves? The current value of our house is conservatively $275,000. We would probably need around $200,000 for building the next unit not using a contractor. 
  
Is there a way to ""sell"" our house to ourselves to cash in on the low interest? We've been in this house for 3 years it it matters for capital gains. The next unit would be built on a neighboring lot.

personalfinance,How can I contribute more to retirement?,"I need some guidance on the basics. 

I recently got hired at a job where I’ll be expected to make a minimum of 80k and upwards of 150k (sales job, uncapped commission). I am 28 and am way behind on retirement savings and have decided to elect 18% to my 401k where my employer matches 3%. 

I just started in October, so I know I didn’t meet any yearly limits, but what limitations do I have to save for retirement with a 401k? 

I also have a betterment retirement account (an IRA, I believe). 

Do I need to open an extra retirement account for even more savings past a certain limit?

Alternatively, I have about 27k in federal student loan debt. Should I instead pay off my federal student loans aggressively first? A mix of both? 

My thought process is that I’m tempted to work up a nice retirement savings first to allow something to grow over the next 30 years, while making nearly minimum payments on student loan debt, then focus on loans aggressively in about a year or two. 

I can live off of about 35-40k/ year (about 30k take home) for at least the next two years. Whatever more I make can go to savings, debts, investments, retirement. 

I also want to buy a (humble) home. I live in a high growth city where homes are appreciating 10% YoY.

personalfinance,Dad passed away-left us land with a loan on it-what to do?,"Long post here:

I need some advice about what I think is a pretty complicated situation.

My father passed away unexpectedly just over a week ago. My sister and I had planned to do a will for both him and my Mom this year, but it didn’t happen. His assets are 2.85 acres of land on which sits a very dilapidated, shack of a home built in the late 1940s. This house has not been cleaned in over a decade and has a significant issue with mold, rodent infestation, and dog use and abuse. At least one of the windows is broken, the front porch bending and unstable, the kitchen water drains into the backyard, the well that provides water to house constantly is having issues with rain water intrusion and making their water turn brown and unpotable. My parents were hoarders and didn’t have room in the 560 sq. foot house for all their tools, and small gadgets and dirty clothes. We just found out the washing machine had been broken for well over a year so my mom was trying to wash her clothes in the shower tub with very little success. 

My mother is very obese, in her mid-50s, and has received disability benefits for 30+ years due to a host of physical ailments and conditions that would almost assuredly prevent her from earning money from working.

My Dad took out a loan on the land (\~$10k) a few years ago and they are current on the payments ($410/month with over a 20% interest rate due to their very low credit). The property is deeded to my Father only and the loan was in his name only as well. In my state, intestate law states that the land will go to the surviving spouse and equal shares of the descendants (1/3 my Mom, 1/3 me, and 1/3 my sister).

We think we may have found a place for my Mother to live that she can afford with her monthly Social Security benefit payment close to us where we can help her get to her doctor appointments and help her mentally/physically with visiting her often. When my father was alive, they were both enablers and became very isolated, further exacerbating their physical issues, and their crippling depression.

My sister and I are planning to contribute financially to my mother and her new living arrangements around ($300/month), but we are looking for my mother to be as independent as possible as quickly as possible.

The current property is \~3 miles from a very popular lake used for recreation. The land is zoned Agricultural Residential 3 (AR3) and is surrounded by new development but it is still in a very rural area. The property appraised by the tax assessor’s office in 2020 was $32,650. I haven’t hired an agent yet but I do believe that is a bit lower than what the market could fetch.

My brother-in-law, a builder and an avid fisherman, believes that the acreage and proximity to the lake would bode well for rehabbing the home and operating as a rental property and source of income for both my Mother and our family.

This is a delicate situation because of the emotional aspects involved but we want to make the best decision for the future of my mother and this land has been in my family for at least 4 generations, so I don’t want to sell the land to just satisfy the loan if the value will continue to go up (as we expect).

Should we pay off the balance of the loan with agreement that we would continue to buy my Mother’s and Sister’s share of the land? We can’t buy both of their shares of the land right now but we can make payments every month.

Should we just continue to make the $410/month payment with the understanding that we (my wife and I) will control more equity in the land?

Should we sell it all and put the profit in a fund for my Mom’s living expenses for the next few years?

Should we rehab the home and look to subdivide the land?

Should we rehab the home to rent it out and try to put a few more smaller homes there and rent those out as well to generate income for my Mother to live on and improve her living arrangements with more care?

Is there any solution to this quagmire that I’m not already thinking about?

TL;DR My father died without a will and he had some land and a house that should be condemned and my family is trying to figure out what to do with it to benefit everyone.",finance

After closing the estate and having the life insurance money, I'll be sitting on approximately $80k. I also inherited a Roth IRA and tradition IRA, with combined assets of $125k, as well as a brokerage with $4k. I cannot contribute to the inherited IRAs but they still grow from interest. I did decide to open my own roth IRA and already contributed $6k in 2020 and plan to do another $6k in 2021, this will come from the $80k. 

So, come 2021, I'll still be sitting on about $74k in liquid assets, but I feel it should be invested somehow rather than sitting in a low interest savings account. I am currently 24 and have thought about owning a home by age 30-33ish. I want to get my masters within the next 6-7 years too.

Maybe I could keep it all in a high-yield savings account? Wouldn't earn much but it is safe. Contribute to a CD? Right now CD rates are really low, but maybe I could contribute to a CD over time as interest rates rise. Put it in the brokerage account that I inherited? This option is what I have been considering, but I do not know what to invest in from that point, stocks, bonds, something? I do not know.

My Father proposed that we buy the house, the invest the equity from her mortgage and use the returns to pay off the new loan. Roughly the numbers look like this: 

Existing Mortgage

* 200,000 Total Mortgage
* 100,000 Equity
* 100,000 Remaining
* 5% Interest Rate
* 1,200 Monthly Payment

Buy the house, close the existing mortgage.

New Mortgage

* 230,000 Current Value of House (New Mortgage)
* 46,000 Down payment
* 184,000 Remaining
* 2.3% Interest Rate
* 1,200 Monthly Payment (30 yr loan)

Invest the Equity from buying the house to pay off new Mortgage:

* 130,000 Equity invested in market with 8% return
* 223,551 Gain over 13 years (8% return)
* 33,532 Taxes on Gain (15%)
* 190,019 Total after Tax

1) Does this make sense and has anyone had experience doing something like this?

2) After the 13 years, what is the best way for my MIL to give us the gains?

Forex,"Waiting for the candlestick to close before opening a position could help you execute accurate decisions and become a profitable trader in the long term. Of course, there are some exceptions...","After a Meet&amp;Chat with a group of traders, I realized that two common problems traders have is that 1) they would open positions in candlesticks with no price action, and 2) they would randomly open a candle position that hasn't closed, based on past charting support/resistance data.

In my opinion, and for personal experience, you could open more accurate positions once a candlestick closes. This could be a great practice if you are non-stop watching the charts and emotionally weak.

What are the exceptions?

Let's say that you are waiting for a candlestick to be engulfed; in scenarios involving ""*green deleting red* ""or *""red deleting green""*, you should open the trade while before the candle closes.

Case 1:20-cv-10832 Document 4 Filed 12/22/20

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, Plaintiff, against RIPPLE LABS, INC., BRADLEY GARLINGHOUSE, and CHRISTIAN A. LARSEN, Defendants

20 Civ. 10832 ECF Case Complaint 

Jury Trial Demanded

Key Points

P. 2 (❡ 5): ...Over a years-long unregistered offering of securities (the “Offering”), Ripple was able to raise at least $1.38 billion by selling XRP without providing the type of financial and managerial information typically provided in registration statements and subsequent periodic and current filings. Ripple used this money to fund its operations without disclosing how it was doing so, or the full extent of its payments to others to assist in its efforts to develop a “use” for XRP and maintain XRP secondary trading markets

P. 2 (❡ 6): Meanwhile, Larsen—Ripple’s initial chief executive officer (“CEO”) and current chairman of the Board—and Garlinghouse—Ripple’s current CEO—orchestrated these unlawful sales and personally profited by approximately $600 million from their unregistered sales of XRP. 

P. 3 (❡ 9): By engaging in the conduct set forth in this Complaint, Defendants engaged in and are currently engaging in the unlawful offer and sale of securities in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) \[15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a) and 77e(c)\], and Larsen and Garlinghouse also aided and abetted Ripple’s violations of those provisions.

P. 6-7 (❡ 31): The definition of a “security” under the Securities Act includes a wide range of investment vehicles, including “investment contracts.” Investment contracts are instruments through which a person invests money in a common enterprise and reasonably expects profits or returns derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.

P. 12 (❡ 66-68): …\[I\]n 2013, Ripple was working on “multiple avenues''... Starting in at least 2015, however, Ripple decided that it would seek to make XRP a “universal \[digital\] asset” for banks and other financial institutions to effect money transfers. According to Ripple’s plans, to create acceptance for the universal digital asset, Ripple first had to create an active, liquid XRP secondary trading market…

P. 13 (❡ 71): Ripple’s objectives and its own financial reality thus compelled it to actively seek to offer and sell XRP as widely as possible, while controlling supply and demand in the resale market to manage and control liquidity for an imagined, future “use” case.

P. 29 (❡ 166): Defendants’ offers and sales of XRP in the Offering occurred into a market that they had largely created and which—consistent with their dual purposes of raising funds from their XRP sales and managing the liquidity of the XRP market—they played a significant role overseeing

P. 34 (❡ 206-207): At all relevant times during the Offering, XRP was an investment contract and therefore a security subject to the registration requirements of the federal securities laws.  Defendants understood and acknowledged in non-public communications that the principal reason for anyone to buy XRP was to speculate on it as an investment.

P. 37 (❡ 219): From the outset of the Offering, Defendants publicly promised significant, meaningful entrepreneurial efforts with respect to XRP.

P. 45 (❡ 264): Investors who purchased XRP in the Offering invested into a common enterprise with other XRP purchasers, as well as with Ripple.

P. 49 (❡ 289): Ripple also led investors to reasonably expect that they could reap a profit from their investment into XRP, derived from Ripple’s and its agents’ efforts into their common enterprise…

P. 60 (❡ 368): Ripple and its executives repeatedly publicly disclaimed that XRP was “currency” and tried to dissuade investors from thinking about XRP as “currency.” 

P. 69-70: Commission respectfully requests that the Court enter a Final Judgment…\[p\]ermanently enjoining Defendants...from...delivering XRP to any persons or taking any other steps to effect any unregistered offer or sale of XRP; ...to disgorge all ill-gotten gains obtained within the statute of limitations…; \[p\]rohibiting Defendants from participating in any offering of digital asset securities...; \[o\]rdering Defendants to pay civil money penalties...",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,"KYC, USDT, wallets and exchanges?","I want to discuss something that has not been yet discussed in my opinion as much as it should. Now I  may have misunderstood some things and be wrong, so please correct me where I need correcting (with sources, thank you).  Now amongst all this ""new paradigm!!"" euforia at ATH, I have some questions.

INTRO:

Basically the G7 has decided that crypto needs regulation. From what I've understood, every exchange and wallet needs to know in the future who they are sending funds to, when the transaction is 3000 usd or greater. 

Now, as we all know (but bury our collective heads in the sand), tether and bitfinex most likely manipulate the whole market with wash trading and circulating tether (not backed by anything as far as we know) and bitcoin back and forth. There are over 20billion tether in circulation right now, and they have been printing tether like the FED has been printing fiat this year. From a few billion to over 20. Bitfinex and tether are shady companies, not at all transparent about anything, with loads of money laundering allegations and ongoing lawsuits.

Now, most exchanges run on tether, and there isn't simply enough real usd in the market if anyone wanted to exchange their usdt to usd. We saw this in march when one exchange (was it bitmex?) had to halt trading so that bitcoin would not have gone to zero in their books, since there was no liquidity left. 

The market today is dependent on tether, the second largest stablecoin is USDC (which is waaaay better), and the amount of usdc is only fractions of what tether has in the market. In other words, other stablecoins are not a viable option at this point, there's not enough of them vs tether.  If tether and bitfinex get raided and shut down (they are under investigation from a number of u.s. agencies), markets would see another liquidity crunch, exchanges would go belly up, and defi pools would drain, basically halting trading since there would be no liquidity in DEXes on CEXes and all the prices would fall off a cliff like bitconnect. I don't know about you but I find this terrifying.

THE QUESTION:

Now, I have serious doubts that tether and bitfinex want to comply with the KYC regulations that the G7 are planning on implementing. So, how would this work? Is the tether ponzi coming to an end? Bitfinex, binance, huobi etc would have to report who they are sending money, and if you just look at the tether in/ouflows... well, it looks concerning. Just look at the flows on flipside's data cooperative. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Would this expose tether/bitfinex to law suits? Why? Why not?
*  Could this help the G7 officials to shut down /seize tether and/or bitfinex? Why? Why not?
*  Are exchanges like binance in trouble, since they have to report (and expose?) their tether in/outflows? Why? Why not? 
* Wouldn't tether and bitfinex want to try to manipulate she shat out of this market before they get caught?

As a sidenote, know this is a very unpopular opinion around here, but in my opinion regulation is good. Not too much regulation, but if crypto wants to be a viable business model, it needs to follow the rule of law and work together with institutions. There will always be a market for anarcho capitalist privacy coins etc, and don't get me wrong, privacy is good, but so are taxes. But that's another discussion.

is this the last pump by bitfinex and tether before they basically exit scam because of the upcoming KYC regulations by the G7, and before the crypto industry goes belly up for a while because of tether printer no longer able to go brrrrrr?",cryptocurrency
investing,China to leapfrog US as world's biggest economy by 2028 - think tank,"[Source REUTERS](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-economy-idUSKBN29000C)


China will overtake the United States to become the world's biggest economy in 2028, five years earlier than previously estimated due to the contrasting recoveries of the two countries from the COVID-19 pandemic, a think tank said.

""For some time, an overarching theme of global economics has been the economic and soft power struggle between the United States and China,"" the Centre for Economics and Business Research said in an annual report published on Saturday.

""The COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding economic fallout have certainly tipped this rivalry in China's favour.""

The CEBR said China's ""skilful management of the pandemic"", with its strict early lockdown, and hits to long-term growth in the West meant China's relative economic performance had improved.

China looked set for average economic growth of 5.7% a year from 2021-25 before slowing to 4.5% a year from 2026-30.

While the United States was likely to have a strong post-pandemic rebound in 2021, its growth would slow to 1.9% a year between 2022 and 2024, and then to 1.6% after that.

Japan would remain the world's third-biggest economy, in dollar terms, until the early 2030s when it would be overtaken by India, pushing Germany down from fourth to fifth.

The United Kingdom, currently the fifth-biggest economy by the CEBR's measure, would slip to sixth place from 2024.

However, despite a hit in 2021 from its exit from the European Union's single market, British GDP in dollars was forecast to be 23% higher than France's by 2035, helped by Britain's lead in the increasingly important digital economy.

Europe accounted for 19% of output in the top 10 global economies in 2020 but that will fall to 12% by 2035, or lower if there is an acrimonious split between the EU and Britain, the CEBR said.

It also said the pandemic's impact on the global economy was likely to show up in higher inflation, not slower growth.

""We see an economic cycle with rising interest rates in the mid-2020s,"" it said, posing a challenge for governments which have borrowed massively to fund their response to the COVID-19 crisis.

""But the underlying trends that have been accelerated by this point to a greener and more tech-based world as we move into the 2030s.""",finance
personalfinance,Accelerating mortgage payments to shed PMI,"My wife and I just bought our first home. We put 3% down and got 2.75% interest, and we're paying \~$180/month on PMI. Cashflow is not a problem for us (we both work in tech and are employed by companies that have thrived during the pandemic) and we are wondering if it would make sense to pay more each month in order to hit that 20% equity threshold and shed the PMI faster.

I'm guessing that given the low interest rates and (relatively) healthy stock market (I'd assume a \~6% return from an index fund YOY?) it would not make sense to do this, but I'd like to run the numbers myself - does anyone have a spreadsheet we could use to run the numbers?",finance
personalfinance,Is it better to put money into my mortgage or investing?,"So, we just bought a house and got a 2.5% interest rate. A part of me wants to pay down that mortgage more quickly than 30 years (i.e. if we add 25% of the original payment - or $500 - its done in about 18 years instead of 30). However, its only a 2.5% interest rate, so is it smarter to invest that extra $500 instead?

If it makes any difference, we are thinking of this house as a ""starter house"" and will likely be here for 5-10 years, but not 18-30.

Edit: while I completely agree that its smarter to invest the money than pay down the mortgage in the long-term, over 30 years, the foundation of my confusion is how to calculate the differences between stock market and mortgage interest in the middle-range of 5-10 years.",finance

I think if we do get a so called crash, some of that money may come in and cushion the blow.",finance
personalfinance,How should I allocate a lump sum toward debt in preparation for home buying?,"I’m thinking that the extra ~$2.5K I have built up right now should go toward paying off debt to boost my credit score and obtain better approved for home buying. I kept this money liquid in case I needed it for pandemic reasons, but I’m in a situation where this could be more useful saving interest on credit cards rather than sitting in a savings account accruing meager interest. 

Unfortunately, holding this money toward a house down payment to avoid mortgage insurance doesn’t seem possible right now. I have 5% (~$20K) down saved, yet the lowest I found to avoid PMI for a lender in my area is 10%. 

The question I have is, in the short-term, should I: (1) focus on lowering credit utilization across all cards to as close to 30% as possible, (2) focus on getting as many cards to a zero balance as possible, or (3) focus on paying balances with the highest interest rate?

Lately, I’ve been focusing on paying down the lowest balances, namely to keep momentum and  be able to cross it off my list. I have a 700 FICO score and I’m looking to buy a home in the next six months. I don’t use any of these cards actively and have been making minimum payment or more on certain ones to pay them down. 

* American Express $1,150 bal / $2,000 limit = ~58% utilization, 20% APR
* Chase $1,200 bal / $1,800 limit = ~67% utilization, 22.24% APR
* Discover Card $2,750 balance / $9,000 limit = ~30% utilization, 3.99% promo APR till April 2021
* USAA $2,300 balance / $2,800 limit = ~82% utilization, 17.99% APR

I ended up with a car loan that as of today is currently 10.5k dollars left to pay off with an interest rate of 22.86% and the car is currently worth $4,475. 

Now from everything I’ve read it seems like refinancing the auto loan isn’t possible as the car is under water so I was thinking my only hope of getting a lower interest rate would be to take out a personal loan now that my credit is better. What do you guys think?

stocks,The Option Greeks: What you Should Know,"The Greeks

Delta – An option’s delta is the rate of change of the price of the option with respect to its underlying security’s price. The delta of an option ranges in value from 0.0 – 1.00 for calls (0 to -1.00 for puts) and reflects the increase or decrease in the price of the option in response to a 1-point movement of the underlying asset price.  
Used to measure the change in value of a contract from a $1 change. Also is used to measure the probability of an Option Contract Expiring “ITM” (In-The-Money). For Example, a Delta of 0.40 can be seen as a 40% chance to Expire ITM.

Gamma – An option’s Gamma is a measure of the rate of change of its delta. The gamma of an option is expressed as a percentage and reflects the change in the delta in response to a 1-point movement of the underlying stock price.  
Measures the change in Delta from a 1$ movement in the underlying asset (stock, ETF, things like that). If the underlying moves an additional 1$ Then Delta would equal the Total of Delta + Gamma. After the First Dollar move, any additional moves in the same direction increases the value of Delta by the amount of Gamma.  
For Example, XYZ 100 12/31/20 Call for $1.00 and has a delta of .50 and a gamma of .05.  
The price of XYZ moves 1 dollar upwards so the new price of the contract becomes 1.50.  
The Price of XYZ moves 1 dollar upwards again so now we add both Delta AND Gamma to find the new value. (1.00 + 0.50 = 1.50) 1.50 + (.50 + .05) = 2.05 Value now.

Theta – An option’s theta is a measurement of the option’s time decay. The theta measures the rate at which the options lose their value, specifically the time value, as the expiration date draws nearer. Generally expressed as a negative number, the theta of an option reflects the amount by which the option’s value will decrease every day.  
For example, if your option contract is currently valued at 1.00 and you have a theta of -0.10, you will lose 0.10 worth of value off your contract every day. This number will change drastically throughout the day as will the other Greeks.

Vega – An option’s Vega is a measure of the impact of changes in the underlying volatility on the option price. Specifically, the Vega of an option expresses the change in the price of the option for every 1% change in the underlying volatility.  
Estimates the change in premium for each 1% change in the Implied Volatility (IV). There will be higher Vega on Contracts with more time. An increase in Vega increases the cost of the contract and vice versa.

Rho – Rho measures the change in Interest rates but is rarely used since Interest rates do not move much.

It is important to remember that these numbers associated with each Greek will likely change constantly throughout the life of the contract. There are other variables to consider like Implied Volatility, Volume, Open Interest, Days to Expiration (dte), the P/c Ratio, upcoming catalysts, and much more.

This is a very basic run down of the Greeks. You will not learn everything about options overnight. Enjoy!",finance

I had great credit, but because of a shitty deal with carmax, I ended up with an interest rate or 6.5% instead of the 4% I qualified for. Long story, fuck carmax.

personalfinance,Desperately need help/advice on how to get out of this hole.,"Very long post, short version is at the bottom

For the past 6 years, I have been living paycheck to paycheck, making just barely enough money to cover my bills, and I honestly haven't had enough money to shop for groceries in years. I have always had to go to a family member's house for dinner, or my roommates have had to pay for food. What I am asking for is advice on how to get ahead and pay off my debt so that I can actually have some quality of life for the first time since I started working at 18 years old (I'm 28 currently). For background, here is how I got into my situation:

At 18 years old, I shipped out to basic training in the Air Force, which I had wanted to do since I was 7-8 years old. 4 weeks into training, I was sent home on a medical discharge on a condition I wasn't aware that I had, so I went home to live with my dad and began working at Taco Bell until I could begin college. I started college for mechanical engineering, and quit my job at Taco Bell and started working at Pizza Hut because it was much closer to my school. I was quickly promoted to a shift manager at Pizza Hut, and really enjoyed the job, and shortly after being promoted they made me full time, so I could actually pay my bills and afford to drive to school. I wasn't happy with the major I was in, and changed majors a total of 2 times. I still didn't think I would happy with a career in the major I was in, so I finished my semester and did not go back, and continued to work full time as a manager at Pizza Hut.

Still enjoying my job, I was offered to train to be a General manage, and was thrilled. I loved my job, and was going to get paid a livable wage to do it. After a year and a half of training, I was still not offered my own store, so I was being paid $11 an hour to do a General manager's job, was constantly called on my days off to help talk the manager through problems, and basically had no time for a life, the job just kept getting worse. So, I started working at a bank as a teller, and within one month I was promoted to a full time desk job at $13 an hour. I continued to work full time at both jobs for 3 months to pay off my car, and 3 days after I paid off the car the engine went, and I had to buy a new one. I spent a few hundred on a car from a relative, and a few weeks later, that one died on me as well. After that, I purchased my first car from a dealer, and went down to only working at the bank. I loved the bank, and was hoping to be promoted there, but it was a small local bank with only 4 branches, and all of the employees had been there for 20+ years, so I had many years to wait before I would be able to advance.

I decided then to go to school for electrical lineman, which was in Texas, so I quit the bank, and took out a $20,000 loan from Sallie Mae (my first big mistake). A few weeks before graduating, I was having bad back pain, so I got an x-ray. I have two discs in my lower back disintegrating, bone spurs on multiple vertebra, and arthritis. The doctor told me a career as a lineman was not going to work for me. Also during school, I tried to trade in my car for a cheaper one, and the salesman asked for my keys and license. After showing me a few cars that would cost MORE every month, I said I wanted to leave. 3 more salesman talked to me, and wouldn't give me back my keys so I could leave. After being there for 8 hours, I told them the only way I'm leaving with a car is if its cheaper than my current payment, and they take my car for trade (they wanted me to leave it on the side of the road to be repossessed). They finally agreed, and after I signed the loan paperwork, I saw that they increased the loan amount by $4,000 without telling me, I'm assuming because they were mad that I was there for so long (this was my second large mistake).

I moved back home, and started back at Pizza Hut, and started and finished an online degree in Healthcare Administration. I looked for jobs in that field, but everywhere wanted a bachelor's degree, and every job I could have taken paid less than my $14 an hour pizza hut job. So, I started school AGAIN, for Radiologic Technology, and loved it. I finished one year, and during my summer clinicals, I couldn't work enough while doing clinical to pay my bills, and I was at risk of having my car repossessed. So, I dropped out of school with the intention of getting caught up on bills and continuing the year after. Pizza Hut couldn't get me ahead, I was just barely making it paycheck to paycheck, and then I had to start making payments on my $50,000 worth of student loans, so I was screwed. 

My dad finished his Respiratory therapy degree and got a job in Virginia, and rented a house. A few months later he bought a house and offered my girlfriend and I to take over his lease, as there were a lot more jobs around and it was a chance for me to start over and get a good job going. Then, COVID. Now, I live in a house with my girlfriend and between the rent and utilities, my stupid car payment, and student loans and credit card, I cannot make enough money to pay my bills. I work at Walmart full time on overnights stocking shelves for $11 an hour, and have a per diem job at a hospital as a patient registrar which pays $15 an hour, but they are only guaranteeing me 25 hours per month. I don't know what to do to get myself out of this mess. I did some quick math, and if I stay at walmart and the hospital, it will take me over 15 years to pay all my debt. I can't live this way for 15 years, I can't do anything with my girlfriend like dates, I can't afford food so she pays for that, and I can't even contribute to utilities. It will be months before I even catch up on my late bills, and I recently got a call saying the bank I got my car loan through is close to repossessing my car. 

I can't think of a way to get out of this hole, and I need help. Please, any advice I can get will be helpful. I know about the strategies to pay off debt like the snowball method, the problem is I can't find a job that will let me break even every month, let alone make extra payments on debt. I tried to talk to attorneys about bankruptcy, but they said it wouldn't help me because it would only get rid of my credit card debt which is $3000, and it would cost $1500 just to file. I could get rid of the car debt that way, but then I wouldn't have a way to get to work and I can't afford to buy another car. I tried debt consolidation loans, but everywhere says that my debt is too high and my income is too low. 

The short version:

debt: $400 car payment, $80 car insurance, $80 cell phone, $120 credit card, $400 Sallie Mae, $200 federal student loans, about $130 a month for gas, $500 for my half of rent, $200ish for utilities. So, a little over $2000 a month total. My income from Walmart is about $1300 a month after taxes, and my job at the hospital will only bring me about $400 a month guaranteed.

I've made a few bad financial mistakes and now I feel that my life is ruined. I am horribly depressed, and it's affecting my relationship, and if my girlfriend and I split I will be left to pay all the bills, which I can't do.",finance
financialindependence,Purchasing homes and property to rent out is a terrible wealth and cash flow strategy for your future; I want to explain why to everyone.,"TLDR provided :) 

First off I want to say that I’m not completely discouraging the purchase of a home. There are hundreds of reasons to buy a reasonable house besides just the money. 

A whole bunch of people think that this purchase and rental method is a smart move, but it involves extreme risk, for minimal reward. 

In addition to this, if anyone would like to see the full amortization breakdown and it’s comparison to typical bond rates in which I derived this data please shoot me a direct with your email and I can send you the excel document I created. This is also a useful tool for comparing or looking at any mortgage or estimating capital gain returns for anyone looking for an easy tool. 

First off I want to talk about home loans. Now I live in Seattle, and a 400-600k house is typically a decent three bed home in this market. I understand that some areas homes are incredibly cheap, but cheap areas exist because the work and rental market in the area has little to no demand, so keep that in mind. 

So for this scenario I’ll talk about a 450k loan with 50k down (although the down payment is irrelevant until we use it as beginning equity for a capital gains comparison) This loan will be at 2.5% over thirty years, the total cost of the home being 500K, and we’ll slash the real estate fees to make things simpler. This is a fantastic interest rate, you probably won’t get it. This will generate roughly a $1800 dollar mortgage payment for 30 years. In total you will pay roughly 200k in interest over the period. That’s 200k over 30 years you will be giving to the bank. What if you pay an additional $1,000 a month towards your mortgage? You still pay 150k in interest. So don’t think that saves you much. 

Home total net loss over 30= ($700,000) (principle and interest) 

Average yearly maintenance loss = ($7500) 

Average tax (1% property value) loss= Variable, but we’ll use the starting low, being a net loss of ($4500) a year for the whole period 

Total net loss over 30= ($700,000) + 30*(($7500)+($4500))= ($1,060,000)

Now let’s say you manage to rent this home for $3500 (nearly twice your mortgage) unfaltering for the 30 year period (which is impossible). Let’s also keep in mind that 500k homes don’t rent for $3500 a month, but I want to be as generous as absolutely possible. 

Net gain, rental over 30= $1,260,000

Total net gain, = (1,060,000) + 1,260,000= 200k 

But we can’t forget the most valuable piece of buying a home, and that’s the fact you own it, and it’s appreciating over the thirty year period. Typical home equity rates in the Seattle market increase by 3-5% a year, compounding we’re looking at about 100-200% increase in home equity value. 

Total net gain= 200k + (500k*200%) 

Total net gain over 30 years purchasing and renting a home with a absolute best case scenario = $1,700,000

Sounds great right? Why not take a loan on six homes and rent them out? Lots of geniuses did this before 08’ and there are more of them doing it now. These people don’t understand non-liquid assets like homes, and just how risky it is to overextend on the loans. If the market crashes, or demand is lost, you’re now paying for multiple mortgages with absolutely nothing to save you. All your savings will be gone in months, you’ll be forced to short sell to the bank, and you’ll lose your absolute ass. Let’s also mention how much time it takes to manage and get tenants, we’re talking thousands on thousands of hours of your time. 



So now let’s talk about liquid capital gains, or just the most basic low risk version of them. Typical mutual funds generate 5-15% a year, but we’re not going to compare this home rental strategy to mutuals, we are going to compare them to literally government T-Bonds. On average we’re looking at about 1.6% a year returns on these. Anyone that knows anything about investment can tell you that 1.6% a year is terrible. But that just goes to show how shit buying homes to rent out truly is. 

So what happens if you put the same amount of money that you would put into the home, into government T-Bonds? This is a liquid, little to no risk, no time asset. You just deposit your money every month, year, whatever, click out of your internet browser and go to bed. This is huge, you should always value your time as much as possible. 

So starting with 50k equity, if you put the same amount into T-Bonds every year as you would have the home, after thirty years you will have: 

Where $24,000= yearly cost of home mortgage
Where $12,000= yearly cost of tax and home maintenance; 
Where n= year since original investment

Y1= (50,000+$24,000n+$12,000n)*((1.016)^n)) 

Yn= (Yn-1 + $24,000n+$12,000n)*((1.016)^n)) 

If n=30, Total net value of investment value = $1,460,000. 

So when compared on paper to T-Bonds, the home rental option beats it by about 240k, but that is only under the most exceptional, unreadable, and perfect circumstances which again, are: 

1) The housing market continues at its current rate for the next 30 years 
2) There is never a month you pay a mortgage payment without rental income from the respective house 
3) You have a fixed interest rate at 2.5% 
4) You pay no real estate fees
5) it takes no personal work time to maintain the homes and tenants 

These five things are completely impossible, in other words, I’m comparing the absolute best housing scenario, with the absolute lowest return average investment scenario. This means that if you can pull a measly 1.6% a year from T-Bonds you will take on nearly no risk, and still make nearly the same amount of money you would buying and renting out homes. So don’t overextend on home loans, cause if things go to shit, so will your life. 

TLDR; Buying and renting out homes is a horrible, high risk wealth strategy, and some of the worst average return bonds and mutual funds will absolutely crush it with no effort over a 30YR period.",finance

personalfinance,Question about Refinancing,"Hi! If this isn’t allowed, I’m sorry.

I refinanced my home in June due to lower interest rate being available. My initial loan was $67,676, 4.500% interest, through company one. When I refinanced, my unpaid principal was $66,584 through company one. 

My mortgage broker is local, small town, and did my refinancing as well as when I bought my home.

After I refinanced, my interest rate went down to 3.125%. The unpaid principal balance after refinancing, before any payments, was $70,462. 

Is this normal? I’m just really confused as to why my initial loan amount was $67,676 and then the refinance amount went up almost $3,000. My broker is not any help. Any advice or information would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,What to do with money from selling my house?,"My SO and I are buying a home together. It's at the higher end of our limit, $450k. Apr is 2.6% so the
 new mortgage will be about $2400/mo includes taxes, insurance, pmi.  Our combined income after taxes is about $85k.  My home now is paid off so we haven't had to worry about paying a mortgage but in all honesty we haven't been budgeting like we should. I at least have a retirement account with matching funds taken out from my employer and I make sure I put the maximum in a Roth IRA, but my SO works for a small company that doesn't have retirement anything, and he hasn't been putting much away. 
I have a car payment but otherwise neither of us have any debt. 
I'm thinking my house will net about $230k after realtor and closing costs. 
There are additional factors such as this being my house, not his- I owned it before he moved in with me and he splits all bills with me but that's never included rent or mortgage. I want things to be equitable between us, but I also have been blessed with very giving parents who've gifted me with large chunks of money here and there throughout my life.

So my questions- What do the fine people of Reddit think we should do with this money? And what *could* we do with this money? Is there a way to invest the money and use dividends to partially pay the mortgage? My SO has considered starting a small side business if we had space for it, would doing that help with any part of this equation?

It's a lot to consider! I hope you all can help us out.

** Edit to reply to general comments**
A lot of comments about how we're buying too expensive. It is a bit higher than I'm personally comfortable with, but after down payment, the interest, taxes, insurance, pmi, etc comes out to $2400/month at the rate we have which is 2.6%. 
That is roughly half our combined monthly income after taxes. 
If I take all the money from my current house to pay down the new house, we're looking at $1200 monthly payments, which I could pay on my own or get a roommate if worse comes to worse. 
So I'm not worried about that. What I'm worried about is paying down a mortgage that has such a low interest rate when that money could be making 2-6x more in the current market.",finance
personalfinance,Major considerations when refinancing?,"Hi all. What are the major points to consider when looking at refinancing a home? My parents have a high interest rate, but I don’t know when refinancing is “worth it” (not a home owner myself). Some basic info:

Dad is 69, is the type to work until he passes/physically can’t. He makes over 100k at this time and has made it through COVID in an oil and gas role, so I see his income remaining stable for a couple of years (until health / age becomes more of a factor). Mom is 58, makes ~65k. 

Historically bad with debt (mostly due to 4 children... they have improved with paying off consumer debt since we’ve aged and moved out/provide for ourselves). However they do still have some CC debt between them. 

House info: Adjustable rate currently at 8.3%, can’t exceed 14.3%. $183k balance with 186 months left. We’ve tried to convince them to sell and downsize, but so far no luck. 

Dad also has a pension paying out. I believe it’s between 2-3k per month.

Does it make sense to refinance at their ages? What should we consider? When is refinancing “worth it”? Your opinion or good reads/references are appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,"Student loans, new job, buying a house, and cancer","Like a lot of people, 2020 was a roller coaster for me, and 2021 is also looking like it’s going to be an eventful year. I’m looking for some insight on my current situation and any alternative viewpoints that I haven’t thought of myself. 

My current situation: 29 yo, recently finished grad school, have a substantial amount of student loans that I need to determine how to pay off, started a new job in September, completed cancer treatment earlier this year, soon to be engaged, and hoping to buy a house in mid-to-late 2021. I live in a HCOL area. 

&amp;#x200B;

My Financial Situation:

Current Job: Income is production based, but will be between $450k-500k, conservatively. I’ll be eligible for their 401k with 100% match at my one-year anniversary at this job. 

&amp;#x200B;

Assets:

\-$48k cash (includes my emergency fund)

\-$6k in Roth (backdoor, as I was over the limit for this year)

\-$44k in a mix of stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs 

\-Car is paid in full and reliable

&amp;#x200B;

Liabilities:

Student loans with accrued interest (all in grace until February 2021):

\-Great Lakes Stafford: $145k; interest is 5-6%

\-Great Lakes Grad Plus: $97k; interest is 6-8%

\-Heartland: 16k; Interest is 3-5%

&amp;#x200B;

Average monthly expenses including rent, health insurance, disability insurance, utilities, groceries, etc.: $3500 this does not include student loan repayments. 

I have 3 credit cards, one of which was opened in the last 3 months (poor decision, I know, other two are \~6 years old each). Credit cards are paid in full each month. Credit score is \~750

&amp;#x200B;

For a full scope of things, my girlfriend’s current situation is roughly:

\-$200k income

\-$150k student loans

\-$180k in various stocks, mutual funds, ETFs. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, here are my dilemmas:

1: I had planned on aggressively paying back my student loans after graduation, with a goal of having them fully paid off within a year. However, the cancer diagnosis and treatment threw a wrench in that. The good news is that it was caught early, and after surgery, all my margins and nodes were clean (props to an awesome surgical team). However, I’m being scanned every 6 months for the next 2-3 years for possible recurrences. The recurrence rate is about 5% in that timeframe, with negligible recurrences after that. Now, I hate to be morbid, but if it does recur and things go poorly, I’d rather have federal student loans that would be forgiven at the time of my death and thus allow me to leave as many possible assets to my soon-to-be fiancé and family. This also means I don’t want to immediately refinance my student loans to a lower interest rate with a private company and lose the protections afforded to me by federal loans.

Additionally, in my mind it makes sense to pick a repayment plan that affords me the absolute lowest monthly payment. The idea here is that although this would theoretically cost more in the long run, I can change my payment plan or refinance once I’m hopefully in complete remission. This would free up the greatest amount of funds for further saving and investments.

2: We’d like to buy a house. Rent in our area is substantial and we’d like to begin building equity and diversifying our portfolio. We’re considering our budget to be in the 700k-1mm range. We plan on being able to place a down payment of 20% without dipping into our investments. However, cancer again brings me back to reality. I don’t qualify for life insurance this early after my treatment, and if shit hits the fan, that’s a huge liability to have on the table. Although my girlfriend could theoretically pay for this on her own (her income is \~$200k), she’d realistically need to sell in the event of my death. 

&amp;#x200B;

In a nutshell, does anyone have any recommendations or other viewpoints regarding my student loans? Are we crazy to be considering buying a house at this point in our lives? Thanks for any input.",finance

personalfinance,Looking for advice on what to do with proceeds from sale of home.,"My wife and I are in the process of purchasing a new home. We were not planning/saving for this purchase, but this home is our dream home, so we decided to go for it. We are buying the home for 450k with 5% down on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage with an interest rate of 2.625%. We will have to pay PMI, which is $71/month. This plus fees brings the APR to 2.767%. We are selling our current home, and expect to net 70k - 80k. We would need to contribute ~68k to make PMI drop off from the loan.

We currently max both our 401k’s and Roth IRAs. Our combined income is ~240k/year. No student loans. Two car loans, which in total are $1,000/month. No other debt. We are 31 and 33 years old, so our time horizon is long. 

My question is, what should we do with the proceeds from the sale of our current home? With the interest rate so low, is it financially responsible to invest the proceeds from the sale of our current home, even though we will be paying PMI?

If so, this would go into our taxable brokerage, because we already max our tax advantaged accounts. From what I’ve read on this subreddit, ETFs are better in taxable accounts. Which Schwab ETF would be best to invest the money in? SCHB? We have SWPPX/SWTSX (80%)/SWISX (20%) in our Roth IRAs.

cardano,"FUD, SEC: Who is Next? (discussion, with evidence)","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt are spreading lately about the SEC and ""who is next,"" in the wake of its filing against Ripple (XRP), [https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2020/comp-pr2020-338.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2020/comp-pr2020-338.pdf).  In particular, some of the FUD has been directed at Cardano (i.e., the Cardano foundation, Emurgo, and IOHK), and this particular FUD is what I'm addressing here.

I'd like to argue here that a close reading of the filing does not reveal anything that would place Cardano next in line, or in any line at all.

If you read the whole thing (all 71 pages), you'll see that the basis of the SEC filing and its request that Ripple (and its CEO and board chair) be prohibited ""from participating in any offering of digital asset securities"" is that the defendants acted together as a single, centralized managing entity, promising XRP holders that they ""could reap a profit from their investment into XRP, derived from Ripple’s and its agents’ efforts into their common enterprise.""  The SEC is also clearly pissed off that ""Larsen—Ripple’s initial chief executive officer (“CEO”) and current chairman of the Board—and Garlinghouse—Ripple’s current CEO—orchestrated...unlawful sales \[of XRP\] and personally profited by approximately $600 million,"" and that investors never got a full picture of what was going on behind the curtain.  (Quotes are all taken from the above-cited SEC filing.)

Stepping back a bit, I note that XLM (Stellar) is closer to XRP than Cardano, along several important axes.  Like XRP, it is open source, has open development team funded by a token reserve, has somewhat poorly defined governance, a lack of any consensus mechanism; all tokens were created at launch, and they cannot be mined.  The founder, Jeb McCaleb, of Mt. Gox fame, was also part of Ripple originally.

Despite these connections and commonalities, the dissimilarities between XRP and XLM are actually quite vast, with XLM distribution leaning heavily on air drops.  They burned of a lot of tokens a few years back.  There is also a foundation in play (rather than a company like Ripple), and somewhat decent transparency overall.

And Cardano is even more dissimilar than Stellar.

So my advice is:  Don't pay much attention to the wilder accusations we're seeing.  

But...do pay attention to the ones that cite evidence and talk specifics.  If I were to make predictions, I'd focus on crypto assets associated with entities that are already on the US feds' radar (XRP was, for example, fined by FinCEN in 2015), as well as on ones with a centralized, corporate governance model, and on ones with a historical lack of transparency with respect to their operations, as well as their source code, development teams, and so on.

The SEC's actions in this last case build on other actions against, for example, [Block.one](https://Block.one) (EOS).  It's not like they are being mysterious or acting out of character, either.  I have a guess about who they will go after next, and it's in the stablecoin arena.  Something like Tether.

...but not Cardano.

There has been endless commentary about markets this year, first discussing the unprecedented 37% drawdown, only to be followed by the equally unprecedented rocket rally to the new all time highs in the face of record unemployment.

It's super easy to point to the fact that the market completely disconnected from the economy, or that it's not remotely rational so long as QE infinity is going on. Truthfully, it's complex, and influenced by a shit ton of different factors. But I think the following two datasets show the picture almost perfectly.

* [Personal Consumption Expenditures](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCE#0) (IE, the fed's preferred inflation gauge)
* [Personal Income](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PI#0) (IE, how much money people are making)

If you look at these two charts, you'll note that inflation fell off a cliff during March / April (hence the whole negative oil prices thing). This was mostly a product of lockdowns literally preventing people from being able to spend their money on the broad majority of goods and services aside from basic staples.

At the same time, personal income **went up**. This is not a product of quantitative easing or anything Jay Powell did - it's a product of the fiscal stimulus that literally gave people who lost their job a temporary raise via unemployment assistance along with the $1200 stimulus checks almost everyone got below the 75k salary threshold.

Just think about these two items together. People had nowhere to spend their money, and simultaneously, they were making even more than they were before. The obvious answer here is that the $ gets plowed into the stock market, and most notably into single-name stocks since none of this $ would be able to be allocated to a 401k program.

# Rate Of Change, Comps, And Timing

With the above out of the way, another important item worth sharing is that markets care far more about the rate of change of various data points than they do about the current levels of said data. Take for example unemployment - if unemployment stays at a flat level (regardless of where it is), the markets will generally adjust to that level and price it in. The biggest item to watch isn't how many unemployed people there are, but rather how many more unemployed there are this week than there was the previous week. The same principle here can (and does) get applied broadly across most anything that has a time series available. The most obvious example is within corporate earnings releases, which typically display year over year comparisons for their financials.

The rate of change says far more about the future, which the markets are constantly trying to discount (across various time durations). As a result, you can take this one step further and look at the rate of change of the rate of change itself.  AKA, the second derivative of the rate of change. Simply by looking at this, you can often get a leg up on a lot of other people trying to interpret economic data.

Okay, so why am I boring people with this? Year over year comps matter a lot, and markets try to price these things in. But quite often, they also price things on a linear basis, and sometimes they are only pricing in what is 1 week ahead of them. Markets aren't efficient, and they often just extrapolate whatever is currently happening into the distant future. In short, we are facing a rather ridiculous data comparison, starting around the time of March 2021, and this may have some significant impacts on the market &amp; economy.

# Personal Income &amp; Personal Consumption Expenditures Look... Worrying?

If the macro conditions we saw in March saved the market from further failure, then we have to look at the comparisons and change of that macro data in the coming months. Comparing against this dataset becomes obviously difficult, and that can have a broad affect on a lot of things.

**Personal Income:** Personal income didn't just go up in March, it skyrocketed. The problem however, is that it was not a permanent growth in income, and we still have a LOT of people out of work or under-employed. The new stimulus bill looks to be relatively small here as well, and then additional stimulus that may come from the Biden administration will likely take a bit of time to be implemented.

* The big cautionary warning here is that due to the crazy comp in 2020 along with rapidly deteriorating income, we will very likely see the most negative YOY number for personal income we've ever seen in the data set.
* A lot of debt moratoriums will also be ending at the start of this year, although a good amount of this will depend on extensions which could come from further stimulus bills.
* The comps here are subject to changes in the labor market &amp; new stimulus measures. IE, if and when we see new stimulus passed, this will make that YOY comp look a lot ""less bad"". The question of course is how much?
* I'm not personally sure how much the YOY change of personal income matters to markets. Certain items trade a lot based on YOY comps. I can track changes in inflation pretty reliably with a forward view of approximately 2-3 months, but I don't fully know how markets will react to this. My gut would say that the dropoff in personal income is going to be most visible in equity inflows, especially from the retail crowd that charged into the markets back in April.

**Personal Consumption Expenditures:** Personal consumption hit a cliff and fell off in March. A lot of this was a product of job-loss and general caution reducing spending and increasing saving. But a lot more was likely a product of people literally not being able to spend their money on the things they would normally be doing (IE, traveling, going to restaurants, etc). This seeing a big drop can be beneficial for the economy as prices are lowered to accommodate for lost wages and income. Obviously, we don't ***normally*** see his fall at the same time income rises, but our current situation was obviously unprecedented.

* Similar to income, we will be facing an astronomically low comp. Oil went negative, what else do you need to know? As a result, once March hits, we will be seeing all the economists' inflation metrics screaming that inflation is running really hot.
* Many people have already noticed inflation in everyday items. But inflation is ""low"" right now because we're comping against last December's prices. To me, it actually says a lot that inflation #'s are as high as they are right now despite the fact that we're not even in the window where we would expect that # to surge.
* Fundamentally, there are a lot of valid reasons we may continue to see inflation. There have been a lot of supply and production restrictions as companies have gone bankrupt, supply chains have been reconfigured, and capacity has been broadly reduced. Of course, this still has the giant anchor of high unemployment counteracting some of these things.
* Lots of people misinterpret inflation as a sign of growth. Inflation ***can*** come from growth, but it also can come from a reduction in supply. The latter tends to be very negative for economies, and tends to be more of the ""stagflationary"" variety. The 1970's inflation regime came from both a generational boom in demand along with a lot of supply shocks of various forms. I still remain skeptical that we are heading into a secular inflation regime as we saw in the 70's, but that doesn't mean we can't have significant bursts of inflation over shorter time frames.
* Around this time, we will very likely see a bit of a re-opening burst of spending assuming the vaccine rollout goes well. This would just add more fuel to the fire here, although it would also be supportive of growth, which is a good thing.

**Putting it All Together...**

\*\*[**I put together the data here**](https://i.imgur.com/ROj6scS.png)\*\*, and people can see for themselves what these changes in personal income and personal consumption look like back to the 1990's. This includes a basic projection using the recent rate of change to show just how much personal income will drop off and how much consumption expenditures will rise.

So long story short, we are likely going to be entering a window after March where we will likely see record high comps for inflation metrics, and a record dropoff in personal income. Needless to say, this can *potentially* be a recipe for a lot of negative market reactions.

* The biggest risk is if bond yields on the long end continue to rise, which has the effect of tightening financial conditions, and making it more difficult for the fed to enact their policies since it would just spur further inflation and price instability. If this occurs a time where growth is really falling off, that could be a really big problem for equities, especially the high p/e long-duration stocks.
   * Keep in mind, the fed IS still doing lots of QE, which helps keep yields in check. They can also still do ***more.*** So yields rising is not a foregone conclusion despite the obvious inflation pickup we are seeing even now.
* The big thing worth mentioning is that it's difficult to know how much of this the market has already priced in. We can see that the market has already been pricing in inflationary exposures, but the big unknown for these things is how much more can it go? In my experience, while knowing the level of change is next to impossible, you can drastically reduce risk simply by being in the right exposures and out of the stuff that becomes riskier during these types of conditions.
* A default assumption that NEEDS to be considered is that authorities WILL react to the conditions at hand. It's literally their job whether you like it or not, and betting against that is a good way to get burned. With that said, the cover to provide aid is FAR lower than it was in 2020, and inflation will act as a constraint to the ability to provide stimulus.
* IF you're managing risk around this type of environment, I would personally suggest taking a second look at heavy overweighting towards growth stocks, or really anything that was the biggest beneficiary of the 2020 environment. Not only will they not be as much of a benificiary when we open back up, but the retail inflows will likely not be supporting further price appreciation.
   * This also opens up a potentially strong window of opportunity for value stocks to outperform during this window, although there is of course a lot more to consider here than just this factor alone.

# It's Not All Bad

Since the data here I'm sharing looks bad, I wanted to also state it's not necessarily doom and gloom. There are other reasons to be positive. In mentioning year over year comps, while income and consumption expenditures look worrying, other items like corporate earnings are going to be comping against super low levels.

Similarly, other economic measures related to growth that measure output will likely be the opposite of personal income, where even a low amount of growth will look great on a YOY level.

Realistically, so long as authorities can prevent shocks from sending the economy into a self-reinforcing downward cycle, I would expect the unemployment rate to slowly decrease, which creates a positive reinforcement in economic stability. The question is where that ability to prevent shocks via stimulus gets constrained by real interest rates or inflation crashing the party.

# TLDR:

* Year over year rate of change matters a lot for economic data, and markets often price on this
* Markets surged in 2020 due to personal incomes surging while personal consumption fell off a cliff, leaving markets as a natural place for a lot of money to flow into
* Since YOY rate of change matters, we are now going to be facing the complete opposite of the above bullepoint, where inflation will be surging off a very low base, while personal income will be crashing off a very high comp. This can potentially be quite negative for asset prices.
* The above two items will likely start this spring, and could represent an upcoming period of market risk
* There are other reasons to be optimistic, don't be a dumbass and yolo weekly put options based on this post.",finance

personalfinance,I thought I could afford a mortgage by now - but it seems I still cannot?,"I've wanted to buy a house for 9 years now but I either couldn't afford or didn't have enough credit.

Now I have 9 years of credit history with good scores, and I've saved up about $130k. I thought I was doing well because so far this year I've made $46k and I usually make about $40k or more a year. I've been here nearly 7 years. But the thing is I only make about $36k base pay. The rest is bonuses which I have to earn and can be anywhere from $0 to an extra $600, depending on how well I do for the month. Usually I make pretty close to the $600 bonus each month, but sometimes a little less. But I know I cannot apply that to the mortgage. Usually I also make another $50-80 a month in overtime, but of course I cannot add that either. So I'm just dealing with the little $36k gross.

I tried using a mortgage calculator as well as ""how much house can I afford calculator."" As well as going by the 25% of monthly net and 28% of monthly gross and I just don't see how I can afford anything.

There aren't any houses I could see myself living in for less than around $160-170k right now. Of course inventory is also pretty low right now as well. But the interest rate is low at least.

But even at $160k I just don't think I can afford it.

Also I wanted to add, I do also have a car payment of $205 each month, which I could pay off before buying. I don't have any other debt. Although I also have no retirement savings. So I don't have anything else really. So I don't think it would be wise at all to put more than half my savings into a down payment.

Should I wait until I have maybe $150k saved and try again? I just don't know because it seems the longer and harder I try to save I cannot keep up with the increases in housing. And it's not like I'm making a terrible salary for my area, factoring in the bonuses.",finance
personalfinance,Work before going to grad school?,"Hey guys, I am an aspiring teacher and am wondering what the best stops to take after my undergrad degree are. 

I graduate this May, and have the option of going to grad school to get my teaching degree. I am not sure if I can secure any scholarships and/or grants, but conservatively can expect to pay around 60k for the program, with tuition and housing. If I can get a teaching job, the district I am looking at is starting at 55k and goes up to 95k within 15 years of service (assuming all goes well)

I am wondering if its prudent to take this huge investment (debt will have high interest rate of around 7% with the US grad loans). My other option is to take the year, and work as a preschool teacher somewhere (for around 15 bucks an hour) and a waiter (around 20-25 bucks an hour), stay with my parents and save up. I have around 6k in the stock market right now, and want to be financially free (especially debt free) as soon as possible. I currently have around 30k in student debt.

stocks,Quick Stock Market News for Today | SP500 / NASDAQ / DOW JONES / ALIBABA [BABA] | [12-28],"**Do you want to know what happened in the stock market on Thursday? Let’s talk quickly about that and what were the latest news over the weekend**

**\~Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! I’ll try to keep this as short as possible this time so that everyone can enjoy the holiday period as much as possible. So, let’s start with the recap of Thursday, as we saw all 3 big indexes closing in the green with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/25nr29H) leading the way up .35%, but still lost ground for the week, down .14%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/zRsdNyJ) gaining .26% and finishing .38% up for the week and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/dr0WyrS) rising by .23% to close the short week of trading with a small gain of .1%.

We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/pbKmzP9) dropping by more than 7% again to bring the volatility index down to the previous levels before the 30% [spike](https://ibb.co/hMjhQhH) we saw on Monday, as it has [dropped](https://ibb.co/kgPCkvn) almost 7 points after that spike.

We had a pretty much even market with just over 100 new highs as most [companies](https://ibb.co/SJCrVzX) traded below average volume on the short day, with 10 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/YbSSMt3) of the SP closing in the green, with Real Estate, Utilities &amp; Technology leading the way while the Energy sector was the only one which lost ground Thursday, as Large-Cap growth companies were the [biggest](https://ibb.co/hYTsTLG) gainers, with small-caps finally underperforming after a great run in the past weeks.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/8MKCB9h) from Thursday, with most big tech Names gaining slightly, except Alibaba which plunged after China started the probe into the monopolistic practices of the company, while for the [week](https://ibb.co/f2NzK9d) we can see a pretty mixed stock market with big gains being made in the tech sector mostly, while big healthcare names, utilities and most of the Energy companies lost ground this week.

We also got a couple of economic numbers in the past few days, as holiday retail [sales](https://ibb.co/bB4XtGm) are estimated to be up 3% with online sales up almost 50% between the 11th of October and the 24th of December as e-commerce accounted for almost 20% of overall retail sales, up more than 6% since last year with big winners like Amazon, Wayfair an Etsy as well as big gains in the home improvement and home furniture sectors.

The other big number we received is more worrying, as investors have made a new high in margin debt, with over $700B in [margin](https://ibb.co/qYxdPtw) through November, I personally don’t use margin even when buying leveraged products to avoid too much volatility in my portfolio.

And one last report that we got from Reuters, is that they expect [China](https://ibb.co/LtKVg0T) to overtake the US and become the biggest economy by the end of the decade.

We only have a fed survey coming in [today](https://ibb.co/170H4tD), and this [week](https://ibb.co/Gsjqvf8) will be most of the same, with only some sprinkled numbers in the middle of the week, and not anything interesting to be reported as earnings go, before a closed day on New Year’s Day.

And in some other stock market news, we saw Alibaba increasing the stock [buyback](https://ibb.co/SXgfNW8) plan to $10B but this wasn’t enough to stop the bleeding for the company as this news came alongside the demands made by the regulators for [Ant](https://ibb.co/55zL5VK) Group to fix problems in some segments of their business before they can move on with the company going public.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [FUTURES US](https://ibb.co/1XWqjyW) / [FUTURES INTL](https://ibb.co/D5TJ4Cs) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way, after President Trump finally signed the [stimulus](https://ibb.co/55v9p8L) deal last night, finally ending this long messy situation.

Ripple,Xrp future. What i think is possible. Comments are most welcome.,"With Jed's sale coming to an end, what will happen is jed, chris and arthur, founders co-founders will be asked to give away their xrp holdings.

Go read David's tweets on twitter. He clearly mentions earlier xrp was being given away for firms to test until it had no value. Oncw it got a market value, it was tough for them to give it away to firms. They cud jst sell it and make profits.

What i see happening is-: the founders will be asked to either burn or give away their xrp to maybe imf and the fed
And the escrow again cud be burned or  transferred to imf and the fed, the monetary bodies for future use and growing the network.

Believe me, xrp being a security is out of the question. The litigation is all abt, the founders selling. This will definitely be a huge thing.

It also syncs up with the fact that david made couple of days ago, that xrp community cud get us to burn the escrow if they want.

The future is very bright, trust me. All dumpings from jed and ripple founders will cease and xrp will truly become a decentralized asset on the xrp ledger.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Pay off early or refinance loan?,"I financed a 2015 Nissan Sentra with my father as the co-signer. I have 15 months left with a $411 monthly payment. The current payoff amount is $6604.76. My Apr is 3.25. My father has requested I remove him from the loan so I have two options. 

1) refinance through a bank and hope for a smaller monthly payment but also probably extend my loan for 18months at the least and run the risk of a higher interest rate. 

2) take a $6000 federal student loan and just pay it off entirely in February and pay it off once I’m out of school in about 5 years. The interest rate is 4% fixed rate and payments are not due until Im completely done. (I’m in grad school but in a funded program so I haven’t needed to take any loans out) my current student loan debt is $19,000 total and I will not need to take anymore since I’m funded. 

I’m inclined to take option 2 since it would make my monthly Bills much smaller since I am unable to work because I’m in a full time program. 

Also my credit score is 698 on the Experian app, but I was just approved for a Wells Fargo credit card and in the report they pulled, Experian reported my score as 733. So I’m a bit confused where my credit score is.

On my w4, completed originally in 2019, I claimed 2 allowances as single with one job.  That is still my status.

My question is, why would I owe taxes? Who calculates what rate is applied from my w4? Is this a fault on my Hr, on me, or just the way IRS calculates?

I wonder if this has to do with a pay change also. My job switched me from salary to hourly early in the year which increased my pay by 2k due to overtime now paying.

Money is tight for me, so if I can figure out if I've  got this wrong that would be really helpful.

Additionally, I live with 3 adult family members. I pay more than half of the total household living expenses. One of them provides their own care/I wont claim, but for the other two, how would I go about adding them as dependents? I've looked online but I'm a bit confused as to the current rules for 2020 returns. If I can in fact claim them both or one would this significantly impact my owed taxes? I never claimed anyone prior to this or even was eligible since I didnt have enough taxable income.

Thank you for any help. I realize these questions might be simple to some but after googling I still couldn't  wrap my head around it so I'd  appreciate any help or explanation anyone can give.",finance

personalfinance,Car Loan Payoff Options,"Ok guys I'm sure I'm gonna get a lot of stern responses reminding me that I committed the ultimate personal finance sin, but I made my bed and I now need to lie in it. I didn't exactly cosign on a loan, rather I went through a local buy-here pay-here to acquire a vehicle in MY NAME for a friend who needed some help getting a car. I could get into all the details but I think it would just take too much time. Basically this friend of mine is about to be jobless and unable to pay the bill. I would like to just sell the car if I can, although it's got some problems that make it virtually worthless. Currently The balance owed on the car is about $3,600. I would like to pay off the car if I can and sell it and just take the loss on the remaining balance. I'm curious what sort of options I have to make this happen.

I currently have a good job with a steady income, I have a small emergency fund that I don't want to see disappear, and I have a pretty decent credit history with a score around 720. I was thinking about taking out a loan from my bank with an interest rate somewhere in the 10-15% range if I could, but I can't really decide if it's the greatest idea. All I know is that I'm really stressing about taking on the responsibility of the $300 monthly finance charge I currently have on the car (it's about a little over a year left on the loan). Should I just bite the bullet and pay it off monthly? Or would it be reasonable for me to try and get the car paid off and sell it? I'm sorry if this isn't the place to post this but I figure it's my best shot at reasonably moving forward with this mess i've made for myself.",finance
Bitcoin,The value of currency and its effects on production,"The value of currency

In a progressive healthy economy where production is constantly growing, all goods and services are represented by all the currency in the system. Therefore, the value of the total quantity of currency multiplied by velocity of circulation must always be equal to the value of the total quantity of goods and services bought which are represented by the gross domestic product, being the equivalent as the average price multiplied by the quantity of goods and services. 

https://preview.redd.it/0jswu88nly761.png?width=843&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40ffbb22c2a936633286925926a101edbaa7989f

Velocity indicates the number of transactions where the same amount of currency is being used, for example when someone uses 10$ to purchase some product and latter the seller spends the same dollars to buy another product, in this case velocity equals to 2. 

Back on the equation, being velocity constant and equal to one, the equation shows that the value of currency unit must vary exactly and inversely with the amount put into circulation. Keeping in a context, credit adds currency supply in an existing circulating amount which represents all goods and services, once the amount is incremented, more currency is chasing the same goods and services. Therefore, the value of the currency unit decreases. 

https://preview.redd.it/5ybx84hqly761.png?width=852&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7676273981ac30b85c3d1e86b70913ad51732e46

Suppose, for example, that the Central Bank lows interest rates and many corporations and individuals reconsider to borrow to purchase real state. The first effect of this expenditures will be to raise the prices of housing as the demand increased. Consequently, real estate businesses earn higher incomes and are willing to spend more in other goods and services. The same process repeats as the purchase-chain spreads among the economy and everyone benefits with higher incomes measured in terms of currency which now has a smaller subjective value in the eyes of each of them. 

Assumingly that production of goods and services has not incremented, its prices will have increased correspondingly. However, the state is not richer than before. Credit used in a non-productive way, creates fake demand in the sector involved distorting its prices. Other sectors and people not involved will basically see prices raising and their incomes will keep being the same but with less purchasing power. 

As you probably already know, this is how inflation expands through the economy and it is not an average standard of 2% as we are told. Depending on the consumer goods and services purchased you could be much more exposed. Unfortunately, saving your currency in a bank deposit account it’s not an option as the interest on deposits are provably much lower than the inflation you are bearing. Learning on investing is the only way out to preserve the value of your work, hence your capital. 

How inflation distorts production

A core concept on a free market capitalist society is the price system, a market build on prices is a democratic structure where prices indicates the most demanded products. Prices act as a signal of production. When people want more of an article and it is demanded over supply, their competitive bidding raises its price and because its more profitable to make that article, people in business expand production or even adapts for the product that offers better return. This increases supply reducing price and profit margin till reaches the price equilibrium with new demand. In the same way, if demand falls off for some products, its price and the profit making it decline disincentivizing its production.

This brilliant system builds a decentralized organization where millions of people are coordinated through prices and each one have the knowledge to allocate the optimal resources to produce in its own sector, like thousand of gears that transmit energy one to another with no power lose but friction.

In contrast, a central planned economy system which operates with a centralized authority that manages production, leads to a misallocation of resources ending up with a lack of production or an overproduction scenario. Both consequences spread among the economy creating an uncoordinated market structure with constant inefficiencies, following the mechanic analogy could be represented as many gears spinning by itself with no transmission power just a waste of energy and resources.

Back in the real state example described before. Once people are attracted with cheap credit making housing prices to raise, this incentive construction corporations to build as there is more profit to earn. Realize that borrowers basically get currency backed by nothing, there is no work behind but the promise to repay the credit. Borrowers have not contributed in society with the same value as the purchasing power is right now given to them and as far as commercial banks are willing to lend to build and purchase apartments, this is a self-reinforced growing bubble guided by fake demand misallocating capital and resources to finally produce an overvalued product. 

Hence inflation distorts the structure of production, it leads to an overexpansion of some industries at the expense of others. This situation resembles more like a central planned economy than a free market capitalist society.",cryptocurrency
defi,DeFiPie Use cases,"DeFiPie is a marketplace that aims to unify the current DeFi space, which is quite fragmented. It will provide a single gateway to crypto staking, liquidity mining, lending, yield farming, etc.

The platform is concerned with bringing interconnectivity and better UX to the highly disjointed DeFi space. It functions as a super app that provides users with easy access to a wide variety of DeFi services from a single interface. DeFiPie users will enjoy several interesting benefits, amongst which are:

Automatic lending on the platform’s P2P loan market.

A wide variety of assets like XTZ, ATOM, DOT, and ADA, which are available for staking

Effective matching of loans with DeFiPie’s advanced matching algorithm.

The ability to create lending, staking, and liquidity pools.

One of the announced blockchains that will join the DeFiPie ecosystem is TomoChain, a scalable proof-of-stake blockchain geared towards enterprises.

DeFiPie Use cases

Lending-as-a-Service (LaaS)

One very important aspect of most DeFi protocols is lending. Many protocols, however, offer automated lending solutions. This means that users have no control over their loan offers. With DeFiPie, both lenders and borrowers have the option to choose between automated, semi-automated, and manual lending options. This provides users the freedom to choose which service is most beneficial to them.

Users deciding to choose an automated DeFiPie lending option will receive loans at an automatically determined interest rate. The drawback to this option is that they might not get the best interest rate available. However, manual lending options furnish a user with total control over the lending process.

This allows them to determine important details like interest rate, loan timeline, loan-to-collateral ratio, amongst several others.

Staking-as-a-Service (SaaS)

Users with large holdings of PIE tokens have the option to create a staking pool on DeFiPie. This is where other interested users can merge their tokens for staking, subsequently, increasing the interest rates of all parties involved.

Stakers on DeFiPie pools also pay one of the lowest fees in the entire DeFi space. And what’s even more exciting is the fact that despite being in a staking pool, users still retain absolute control over their assets. Staking rewards paid in PIE tokens also attract higher rewards compared to those who are paid in other tokens.

Liquidity Pools-as-a-Service (LPaaS)

On DeFiPie, users have the option of investing their crypto in any liquidity pool of their choice. They subsequently earn rewards based on the number of assets they invested. All pool members also receive a share of trading fees. When a user places a certain amount of crypto assets in a liquidity pool, they immediately receive a corresponding amount of PIE tokens.

These tokens will help improve liquidity in the entire ecosystem. Users on the platform can also create their own liquidity pools easily. They will, however, have to determine important details like interest rates, collateral choice, and many more.

Custom lending pools

As earlier stated users with enough PIE tokens can create their decentralized lending pools. Users in this pool decide on the workings of the pool. This is unlike conventional DeFi protocols where mechanics are determined by algorithms. In this case, members decide on details such as PIE holdings required to become an admin or to receive voting rights, utility rates, lending rates, collateral, etc.

Collateralization Options on DeFiPie

Simply put, this means allowing users to earn rewards on their stand-in PIE tokens. Unlike conventional DeFi protocols, users will earn PIE on their assets. PIE earned this way can furthermore be used as loan collateral.

Yield farming

Users receive PIE tokens as incentives for each day that they are active on the system. In addition, actions carried out on the platform are rewarded with PIE. This helps to ensure a balance between supply and demand on the DeFiPie system.

Interested users can also farm PIE by simply locking up assets on DeFiPie.

Spouse and I currently have 170k in federal loans. Currently pay 4.5k a month in loan payments. Income coming in is ~14k a mo (sum of our paychecks after taxes) and our expenses including mentioned debt payment and rent and all that is ~10k a mo. 

By the end of next year, December 2021, we will have around 75k in 401k, ~80k in savings. What we pay in rent currently would be similar to a 15 year mortgage monthly payment for a house we can buy with down payment of 80k.

We want to buy a house and stop renting. Mortgage antics aside, my thought process is if the housing market starts to decline and drop, it's better to jump on a house that I can afford with the 80k as down payment. If the housing market stays strong and continues to rise, it's better to throw money at the federal loan and continue to rent and save until housing market is more opportune.

stocks,Strategy for 2021,"Starting to think about how I plan to approach investing in 2021 and a few things are swirling around in my head at this point:

1) Risk of an early January pullback.  Why?  Investors made more money in the markets in 2020 than ever before, which means huge tax bills, which is an incentive to wait until January to take profits in order to push those tax bills back a full year.  This means we might get a chance to buy some stocks at discounts in the New Year.

2) This year was highly, highly unusual and won't be repeated in 2021.  I think there is an increased likelihood we see a real rotation out of the high multiple growth stocks that led 2020 and into undervalued stocks.  The market leaders of 2020 will not necessarily be the leaders of 2021.  This is especially true of the FOMO/meme stocks.

3) Notwithstanding (2), there were certain themes that emerged strongly in 2020 that will carry through because they are dominant themes for the near future.  I think the top 3 are e-commerce, fintech, and genomics.  Some of the leaders in these areas have done very well in 2020 and might pull back or base early in 2021 so the valuations become more reasonable.  This is where we might get some good opportunities if (1) does in fact occur.

4) 2021 will be the year the world gets vaccinated for COVID, so it should be the year of the reopening stocks.  Travel/tourism, restaurants, brick-and-mortar retail, casinos have all come off their bottoms but have a long way to go.  As the world gets vaccinated and starts to get back to normal, people will be desperate to enjoy these things again.  Given (2), this is where we could find many of the market leaders in 2021.

5) Longer term risk to the markets when the Fed starts closing the spigot.  The markets will continue to climb as long as the Fed keeps propping it up, which is why we've had the longest bull market in history and are seeing crazy valuations.  So despite the risk of a pullback early in January, there is no reason the market won't continue up from there - until Fed liquidity starts to dry up.  That's when we could see the start of a real bear market.

3. I make 6 figure income
4. My house is in the process of selling, but won't close until January, and I'm buying a new house in MI that should close in March.
5. Before selling my house in CA, I was renting it out during this year (rental income) and renting my personal residence in a different county. (Rental income plus paying capital gains tax on house sale since I haven't lived in it for 2 of last 5 years)
6. I made repairs, and have paid up front moneys for the house in CA to sell.
7. I purchased a vacant land property in MI to build on, and when builders fell through, after spending thousands on blueprints and consultation fees, decided to just buy a finished home.
8. My wife has massive student loan debt, and I sold \~$50,000 of stock to pay off her highest interest loans.
9. I now file jointly since I married her last December. She makes 80k/yr but pays a lot in student loans (private, not federal) and interest.

Over this year and next, I feel like there are many ways I might miss out on tax breaks and end up owing far more than I'm responsible for.  Is this a good time to hire a CPA?

If I get the job, I'm going full ham on starting up a 401K or Roth IRA, and won't need to worry as much as if I take the internship.

If I take the internship, chances are likely that I'll need to subsist off of what money I still have stored up in the savings and checking account for food, etc. I don't have plans to start a Roth IRA until after I land a job, so I'm functioning with the aforementioned checking and savings accounts. I can stretch things out so that I won't starve in the internship, but I'm hoping to save as much money as possible during the internship.

My thinking is that if I funnel all of my money into the savings account right now, I can dole out a weekly amount to my checking account throughout the savings account while making a small amount of money from what money I have left in the savings account. This will also help with budgeting. That way it's not just ""lying around"" in the checking account.

So, this is a bit of a story but I’ll condense as much as possible.

I’m 24, been with my job for the Treasury Department for a few months now. I make $36k a year gross, and come this tax season I’ll be working ample overtime. So job security wise and income wise I’m doing fine.

As some may know Nissan fudged up a handful of vehicles of like 2013-2017’s CVT trans causing them to fail pre-100k miles. I’m at 97k and that bad boy is about to BUST. Fixing my trans was expected to be between $3,500-$5,000 by mechanics around my area. The cars KBB us $4,500-$5,500. So basically totaled.

I’ve gotten an average trade-in offer for $5k (they don’t even want to check my car as much as they want to sell me one so they can take my crapper to the auction). I also have $1,500 (or $2,100 after stimulus comes out) for added down payment.

I’m trying to purchase a newer car of 2018+, and I’ve only seen Hondas universally accepted as a top tier ride till it dies car. So that’s what I’m going with. I’ve seen many used 2018s with average 35k miles for ~$24,000. This was my original plan to finance but the payments come to about $370-$410 a month. So a lot.

However, my local federal credit Union, CinFed, has a service called “Flex Auto Loan” which is a lease plan but the title is under my name and I can sell/trade it any time as long as my debt is paid on the car’s remaining loan value. However, it’s still a lease at the end of the day. The real draw in is the cost being around $240-$280 a month for a brand new 2020 Honda Accord. The used value wasn’t much less coming in at like $210. It does have a 12k-18k annual mile cap depending on what I choose to pay.

For my situation right now it seems like a great idea for a short term plan. I’m moving to the Cincinnati/Covington area to be close to work and civilization. Rent will be roughly $800 along with ~$250 for utilities. Cincy is a very low cost of living area. I currently make $2,220 take home a month. So $400 a month max seems justifiable to me, but the leased car for ~$240 gives me extra breathing room for life costs and savings.

As a government employee I’m guaranteed a job and an annual pay scale increase. When my 3 years of payments are up I’ll be making close to $55k a year, and that’s only if I don’t move internally to even better paying positions. So my thinking is: use this lease “ownership” thing as a way to get by with a great, reliable car for cheap, and then when I’m more financially sound either refinance and pay off the last bit of the car, or get a different car to actually purchase in the long run.

personalfinance,"Moving out in a few years (TX), question about refinance and cashing out on it","Probably going to sell the house (230K left on a 30yr at 3.875) and move out of state in a few years so I am trying to refinance with this in mind-- please let me know if any of this sounds wrong as I've just learned about most of this today!

* Prioritizing lowering my monthly payment vs getting the lowest rate (and paying points to do so) because selling in a few years. So my new rate would be 2.675 with 0 points vs getting a rate like 2.25, but having to pay like 5K in points.
* broker said it may be in my interest to get a slightly higher rate (2.875) and take 20K out to pay off a car loan that I have, as it's better to increase my monthly cash flow and invest that money in the market for example. The interest rate on my car is 1.65 though so I feel weird about decreasing my equity and adding interest on existing debt though it would mean that I would have ~500 more in hand each month. 

The refi would be around 5.6K in closing costs (including the escrow). My monthly payments would be reduced by around 293 (PMI is also knocked off with the refi). So in 3 years I would definitely have made my closing costs back. 

Does this all sound right? Should I take the money out to pay off my car with this refi?",finance
Bitcoin,Some context (and caution) on what's driving Bitcoin right and what can come next.,"I'm not here to tell you to invest or not in Bitcoin, but rather talk about some of the reasons Bitcoin is getting stronger right now, and how it relates to the overall US economy.  My hope is that maybe people will stop treating Bitcoin growth as some vaguely magical thing that happens on wishes and dreams.  Speculative investing certainly makes that happen, but there are larger reasons for the current growth cycle: institutional investors.

First of all, I want to make clear that what I'm talking about is more related to institutional investors (II) than anyone else.  These are large entities or companies that look for ways to earn more money with the money they have, and on a scale well-beyond what a random person can do.

OK, some basic facts to get us started:

* The US dollar is strong ~right now~ this year, although falling falling in recent months.
* Interest rates are very low.
* Businesses are not expanding.
* The US economy and stock markets are both being propped up by the Fed and Congress.

Normally, when an II is sitting on a huge pile of cash, they invest it somewhere based on what's going on with the economy.  For (a simplified) example, they move money into stocks for gains when markets are doing well and into treasury bonds for interest when they aren't doing well.  

Now for various reasons, there just aren't many good places to park huge amounts of money:

* A strong US dollar normally means invest in foreign economies, but Covid has crushed most growth opportunities there.
* Interest rates being low means little incentive to simply loan the money out or invest in treasury bonds.
* Businesses aren't expanding, so even if interest rates were higher there simply isn't much demand.
* The US economy might look good on paper, but it's being driven by a rather narrow set of industries uniquely situation to benefit from a pandemic (mostly tech) and held up by Fed policy.  As post-vaccine life takes hold in the next 6+ months there's going to be major (but unclear) economic changes.

*In short, institutional investment in Bitcoin right now has less to do with Bitcoin being great, and more to do with trying to figure out where to park money until economies start returning to normal.*

So what does this mean for everyone else?  At the absolute minimum, I would expect Bitcoin to drop as the economy recovers and IIs have better (read: traditional) places to put their money.  They won't abandon it or anything, but large transactions (sells) will impact the price.  A few headlines of companies selling their stake in Bitcoin can easily trigger investor panic.  In particular, look for signs that any of the above points are changing.  If the US dollar weakens, interest rates increase, businesses start expanding, or the US economy stops being propped up by the Fed, Bitcoin is going to drop.",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,"I just wanted to discuss the vague concept of ""honesty"" in currency","I grew up with a dad who had a masters in business, and the credential to teach a micro or macroeconomics class. He was a GS13 in the Federal Government in the 70's-90's, and you might he looked quite a bit like ""D-FENS"" in Falling Down, even down to the horn rimmed glasses. But he wasn't a defense engineer like D-Fens, he was managerial and on the civilian side of government operations.

He imparted on me Fiat, why it can work, and it currently/then was working. Those $'s and $bonds are basically backed by the US Treasury, its government, its infrastructure, its economy, its people, its empire/imperialism. And this was why in spite of no longer being backed by gold reserves and effectively as good as gold, were now backed by those concepts.

To me it made perfect sense back then and I suppose under an ideal timeline to me it still makes sense.

Here's where both me and him got blind sided: Egregiously high levels of grift/corruption/theft/kleptocracy and a propaganda network to support it among Americans/knee cap their own country, that for me, and I think on some level him, and we're both very sad to say this, can undo even a very powerful country like The United States.

Something feels very wonky, and I see that pic of Steve  Mnuchin and his wife, with that sheet of $currency, something is very wrong. To me we basically have criminals running our country.

As I understand it, $'s are just not anywhere near as scarce, as they were 10 years ago. I dunno if we've felt the full force/brunt of inflation. $'s can printed off with as little effort as a keystroke basically.

Also: the face value of $1 use to be currently $20 value in silver, Morgan Silver Dollar, those use to be $1 in value.

I work for a living. I work hard, yet I don't make a good living.

My dad was a selfless public servant to this country, and now the Fox's have gotten in the henhouse, and are running the show. I don't want to be paid in their currency, especially for how hard I work vs how little I make.

Question: As a former patriotic American (I'm still patriotic, but every day seems worse than the last in this shithole), would I be correct to say that bitcoin is looking like a helluva lot ""more honest"" currency to be paid your wages in, than historically me taking $USD for my labor?

Whether you're poor or well off, for time spent sacrificing your labor to scratch out your meager existence for some business owner and his lackeys running the congress, their luxurious country club life...what is the argument I should accept their $USD and $US Treasury debt devaluation for my labor vs more or less being paid in bitcoin which they can't arbitrarily print off with a keystroke?

investing,The Fraying of the US Global Currency Reserve System,"Long but interesting article that takes a high level systemic look at what's happening in the financial system. It's sort of in the vein of a lot of the Fed-related doom and gloom you see on this sub, except with seemingly pretty good analysis.

https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/

I'm curious to hear what people think.

An excerpt that provides a pretty good summary:

&gt;Basically, the petrodollar system and the associated fiscal policy is fraying under its own inherent flaws over decades, which again gets back to the Triffin dilemma that to maintain a global reserve currency, you need to export an increasing amount of your valuable assets like gold reserves or your industrial base. That cost inherently makes these sorts of systems long-lasting but not permanent.

&gt;At first, having the global reserve currency is an exorbitant privilege, because the benefits of hegemonic power outweigh the costs of maintaining the system. Over time, however, the upside benefits stay relatively static, while the costs keep compounding over time, until the costs outweigh the benefits.

&gt;And from there, the value of the system depends on who you ask. Folks who are often on the higher end of the income spectrum who worked in finance, government, healthcare, or technology benefitted from this system, since they obtained many of the benefits of globalization and none of the drawbacks. Folks who are often on the lower end of the income spectrum, specifically those that make physical things, are the ones that benefitted least and gave the most up, since their jobs were outsourced and automated at a faster rate than other developed countries. But now with China also undermining the structure of the system, even the geopolitical/hegemonic benefits for the political class are subverted as well.

&gt;As the system frays, it’s easy to point to external nations as the cause of this fraying. When they begin pricing things outside of the dollar-based system, or employing mercantilist currency policies, or building pipelines, or deciding to do something with their dollar surpluses other than reinvest them in US Treasuries, it can seem as though they are undermining an otherwise sound system.

&gt;In reality, those external actions are a symptom of the more underlying flaws in the system: the fact that the United States is no longer big enough as a share of global GDP to supply enough dollars to fund global energy markets and global trade, the fact that the United States has to run persistent trade deficits to get dollars out into the system, and the fact that an all-fiat global currency system incentivizes mercantilist currency manipulation by many countries to generate trade surpluses against the US wherever possible.",finance

My parents have offered me a little deal as well; I give them a ""deposit"" of ~$7k, and they take a loan in THEIR names to buy the car, then I pay them the monthly payments. This way, the interest rate on the car loan is (in theory) significantly lower.

They didn’t mention that the whole thing would be that I would be delinquent and then they’d negotiate my debt to about 50% of what is owed and take a 22% cut so I’d still pay 72% but without that compounding interest.

I think that’s the facts that I have. I believe I can still cancel this as they haven’t dont anything for me, but not sure I should as this may be my best option. Just looking for some advice.

investing,"$GTBIF, the marijuana stock you should consider","Now, before we begin, it is worth mentioning that Mitch Mcconnell will block marijuana from being legalized for as long as he is alive. Not to worry, with an incoming democratic president, the executive branch will let marijuana legalization slowly flourish, even without full federal legalization. 

**Introduction:**
$GTBIF (Green Thumb Industries) is a US-based marijuana company founded in 2014 and currently operates in 11 states. [Many of its sales](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-cannabis-stocks-that-should-be-profitable-in-2021-2020-12-12) come from high-margin derivatives such as edibles, vapes, etc. that can’t be made at home. As part of its profile, it owns the luxury cannabis brand Beboe, which has been called the  “[Hermes of Cannabis]( https://www.entrepreneur.com/company/green-thumb-industries) ”. Remember: If you can’t afford a Berken for your wife, maybe you can afford this.




**Why GTBIF:**
What do we love when investing: Growth and Cash Flow


GTBIF has had 31.1% year over year [revenue growth]( https://investors.gtigrows.com/investors/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Green-Thumb-Industries-Reports-Revenue-of-157.1-Million-and-Positive-Net-Income-of-9.6-Million-or-0.04-Per-Share-for-Third-Quarter-2020/default.aspx) and generated 157$ million in revenue this year. [With New Jersey, a 1$ bn market]( https://mjbizdaily.com/new-jersey-voters-legalize-a-potential-billion-dollar-adult-use-market/) set to become a full recreational state in 2021 (where GTBIF already has existing medical dispensaries), and NY to follow soon after, this growth should continue and potentially even expand.
 

Now for cash flow, GTBIF recently reached positive earnings per share 0.04$, which is great to have for such a fast growing company in a flourishing market. It has succeeded where many other marijuana companies have failed: creating money and managing debt to bring value to shareholders. Their cash flow should only continue to grow in the near future.




**Dangers:**
The biggest danger that I foresee is possible competition from companies such as Curaleaf, Cresco labs, TerrAscend, Accreage Holdings, Canopy Growth, etc. 


In regards to its primary competitor Curaleaf, Green thumb has a stronger balance sheet. They both have similar cash on hand, but curaleaf has 580$ million in debt compared to green thumb’s 204$ million. Moreover, curaleaf has a higher market cap at 8.27 billion vs. green thumb’s 5.378 billion. I believe GTBIF is a better option. 


Most of those other companies are unprofitable and do not have a clear path to profitability. Over the long term, many can and probably will succeed, but I believe GTBIF has a head start and is in the best position.",finance

Bitcoin,what you are not told about inflation,"A core concept on a free market capitalist society is the price system, a market build on prices is a democratic structure where prices indicates the most demanded products. Prices act as a signal of production. When people want more of an article and it is demanded over supply, their competitive bidding raises its price and because its more profitable to make that article, people in business expand production or even adapts for the product that offers better return. This increases supply reducing price and profit margin till reaches the price equilibrium with new demand. In the same way, if demand falls off for some products, its price and the profit making it decline disincentivizing its production.

This brilliant system builds a decentralized organization where millions of people are coordinated through prices and each one have the knowledge to allocate the optimal resources to produce in its own sector, like thousand of gears that transmit energy one to another with no power lose but friction.

In contrast, a central planned economy system which operates with a centralized authority that manages production, leads to a misallocation of resources ending up with a lack of production or an overproduction scenario. Both consequences spread among the economy creating an uncoordinated market structure with constant inefficiencies, following the mechanic analogy could be represented as many gears spinning by itself with no transmission power just a waste of energy and resources.

Suppose, for example, that the Central Bank lows interest rates and many corporations and individuals reconsider to borrow to purchase real state. Once people are attracted with cheap credit making housing prices to raise, this incentivize construction corporations to build as there is more profit to earn. Realize that borrowers basically get currency backed by nothing, there is no work behind but the promise to repay the credit. Borrowers have not contributed in society with the same value as the purchasing power is right now given to them and as far as commercial banks are willing to lend to build and purchase apartments, this is a self-reinforced growing bubble guided by fake demand misallocating capital and resources to finally produce an overvalued product.

Hence inflation distorts the structure of production, it leads to an overexpansion of some industries at the expense of others. This situation resembles more like a central planned economy than a free market capitalist society.",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,US Taxpayers who have held Bitcoin &gt; 1 year: Just two days left to harvest tax gains.,"For people in the US who have will have total income (including realized investment gains) below $52,400 (single with standard deduction, $104,800 for married couples) in 2020 it can be tax advantageous to sell profitable Bitcoin that you've held for &gt;1 year and buy it back to trigger the taxes this year and bring you up to the threshold.  (Also the case for some people with very high incomes, see below. But it is not applicable to students under 24 being supported by others, see comments)

I believe this may be more applicable this year than most due to people being un/under-employed due to the pandemic. ... as well as the fact that everyone with Bitcoin held over 1 year should have plenty of gains right now.

Normally you want to postpone triggering gains to delay paying taxes, but if your income is low enough there is reason to do it eagerly:

The reason for this is that if your income, including gains is below $52,400 (single) your federal tax rate for capital assets held for &gt;1 year is 0%.  When you sell and rebuy the Bitcoin you increase your cost basis but won't pay any tax on the portion that is under the threshold.  If you go a little over, that isn't a problem-- you'll only be taxed at the 15% rate on the amount you were over the limit.

To be clear this does not apply to assets held for exactly one year or less.  You could apply the same logic to less than one year, but only to the extent that your entire income plus the gains is under the standard deduction.

When you do this, you move the cost basis up on your Bitcoins and later when you sell them again you'll have a smaller gain and pay less taxes (or a larger loss if the Bitcoin price falls, which can offset other gains-- effectively teleporting your 0-tax space into future years).

The primary risk/disadvantages that I aware of is that you might make some mistake moving coins or dealing with an exchange, that you'll pay trading fees and potentially the spread as well as market volatility risks, -- also you do restart the 1 year clock, so if Bitcoin jumps to $500,000 per coin in January and you decide to sell some of it in February, you'd pay the higher short term gains rate.  (Personally, I would be happy enough about the price that I wouldn't worry too much about the higher tax rate... :) ) If you otherwise had no Bitcoin sales this year, you'll hurt your privacy by having to identify Bitcoin on your tax forms. Also, If you are receiving an ACA subsidy the additional ""income"" might also reduce it.  I'm not well versed in the various subsidies people (esp. people with children) receive, so there may be additional considerations there.

If you sold assets at loss earlier in the year, e.g. from loss harvesting the huge stock market drop your net income may also be lower than you were assuming, so this might apply to you even if you had more income than the threshold.

I think the tax advantage is worth the trouble but your situation and preferences may be different. But don't kill yourself trying to optimize taxes: It's better to miss out on some tax optimization than it is to make some error that costs you money because you were in a hurry or felt time pressured to do something you didn't fully understand.

Depending on where you live state income taxes may also apply.  This [calculator](https://smartasset.com/investing/capital-gains-tax-calculator) appears accurate.

A similar situation can apply to very high incomes.  If your income this year is under $458,250 (single, married: $521,400, again assuming standard deduction) but you expect your income to be over that threshold during the next years, in other words if your long term gains will be taxed at the 20% (or 23.8%) rate in the future but you're within the 15% rate now then you may be better off taking the gains now at the 15% rate.  Though because of the alternative minimum tax, it's harder to make blanket statements about people with incomes near $500k.

[I previously posted about this earlier this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/g4cves/i_have_my_entire_net_worth_in_bitcoin/fnxyguh/). 

Similar can be done for short term losses-- realizing them eagerly and before they turn long term in order to offset gains and reduce taxes, though  I don't expect too many people have Bitcoin losses right now. :) Also the wash sale rule potentially creates complications for harvesting losses that require extra considerations.

The incoming Biden administration hasn't delivered a sufficiently clear message on their intended tax policy, but I think it is unlikely that the capital gains rates will go down for anyone and it's likely that they'll go up at least for people with the highest income in 2022-- so this might be a secondary reason to realize gains now.

Sadly for our UK friends, it appears that this practice may be expressly prohibited there.

[Yesterday](https://ibb.co/Cwnvhrv) there was almost a 50/50 split in advancing to declining stocks, with 177 new highs on decent volume, as more companies have started to trade below the 50-day SMA, which is a good thing as the trend was worrying with over 84% of companies above that moving average just recently.

We also saw 9 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/Km2fdpd) gaining yesterday with communications, consumer discretionary and technology all gaining over 1% for the day while the 2 sectors that lost ground and lagged the market were Energy and Materials.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gr6GrMj) that confirms those charts, as we can see big gains made in the big tech names with Amazon, Facebook and Google all gaining more than 2% for the day with Netflix and Microsoft also posting a 1% gain. We can also see the biggest losers coming in the Software-Application and Biotech sectors, probably because of tons of profit taking after huge-runups this year, while funds want to show investors that they own the big names, not those very volatile high-flying stocks of 2020, maybe that is one of the reasons for this rotation.

We also saw the total people through TSA [checkpoints](https://ibb.co/ByxKmYy) in the Christmas weekend rise to over 2.4M people, the busiest since March, but that is still down about 50% since last year. This are better news for the Airlines especially after Trump also finally signed the stimulus bill which does include funds for the Airlines.

While TrueCar also released some December [estimates](https://ibb.co/KL4K7X9) for auto sales, in which we can see a 4,7% increase year over year and a 32% increase over last month, as the industry is still continuing the rebound since the March lows. This is a good outlook for the industry so expect big OEM to start rising again after a pause in companies like Ford or GM since the end of November. Regarding this subject maybe Tesla can start selling even more cars, this after an Indian minister [reported](https://ibb.co/k2W2LML) Tesla will start operations in early 2021 in the country.

Alongside great sales numbers in the auto industry, we also received the Dallas FED manufacturing [Survey](https://ibb.co/Ssdf7Kd), which came in better than expected with production, new orders and capacity utilization all having big increases since the last report.

[Today](https://ibb.co/vdHr1wT) we get some numbers from the Redbook store sales and the SP Home Price Index, while we also await to see what the Republican [Senate](https://ibb.co/261v76w) will do after the House passed the $2000 stimulus proposal, as the leader of the Senate hasn’t yet announced anything.

In some other stock market news, we saw some highly volatile names make moves with [Nikola](https://ibb.co/M8xVsvm) popping after a JP Morgan analyst predicted a less drama filled 2021, I can’t imagine what he sees in the company, as they still don’t have any new breakthrough technology or really anything to show, just promises after promises. While we also saw [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/vkkLy38) dropping more than 11% for the 2nd straight day before regaining some of the losses after-hours, this happened after it was called a best short idea at Hedgeye on top of last week short reports, and meanwhile, we also saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vVZnw9c) fall 14% after the lockup period expired after the IPO, adding more than 30M shares to the small public float available until now.

We also saw JP Morgan [acquiring](https://ibb.co/WVq4jGp) a credit card rewards business; thus, betting travel will come back in the next years. The company will acquire the technology platforms, travel agency, gift card and points businesses from cxLoyalty Group, which is a privately held company. This will be a hit to Expedia, as JP Morgan had been using the credit card rewards program from them, but now will return the use the cxLoyalty platform like they did until 2018, as cxLoyalty has over 3.000 clients and market partners like Citigroup, Capital One and Mastercard and serve more than 70M consumers.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as both the [EU STOCKS](https://ibb.co/zFkGLYs) and the [US FUTURES](https://ibb.co/R2L0kRV) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way, as growth companies are [outperforming](https://ibb.co/gMFNd50) the value plays in this final month of 2020. As we also saw yesterday Goldman’s chief economist lifting the [outlook](https://ibb.co/rv12bH5) for the Q1 US GDP by 2% and a full year growth increase of .50% to see a GDP growth of 5.8% in 2021, which should be another bullish sign for the stock market.

Hello, 

I’m in a very awkward position and am really upset. About 2 years ago, I took out an auto loan for a vehicle and have made every payment on time and even did a few double payments when I could afford it but something isn’t adding up. The original loan was for $27k at a 2% interest rate. I felt for my first vehicle purchase that wasn’t a crappy vehicle from the Facebook marketplace it was a good rate. 2 years later and I’m thinking I owe no more than 19-20k dollars, I found out through a dealership I still owe $26k and I have been paying a Per Diem of $14.26. I’m horribly confused and honestly upset that the $670 I’ve been paying monthly has barely put a dent into my loan. If anyone has advice, I would greatly appreciate it.",finance

personalfinance,Grad school loans @ 7%,"I know someone who just finished grad school with 100k in loans.

The. Way I understand it (correct me if I’m wrong) the loan has been consolidated, there is no interest accruing due to a hold from the epidemic?

The contact at the college says the way to handle it is keep the payment as low as possible until the 20 year mark when loan forgiveness takes place?

Can it be re financed under a school loan program at a lower interest rate if necessary?

personalfinance,"Looking to buy a house, want to keep townhouse. Process for doing that with low interest rates?","So I currently own a townhouse that in the next 5 years my wife and I would like to move out of and into a house within the same city.

Our goal is to not have to sell our townhouse and be able to rent it. Is there a way to buy a second house in the same city with similar mortgage rates (not having to call it an investment property, so as to not have to pay higher interest rates?

Details are below:

- Townhouse appraised value: $335,000
Townhouse balance in 5 years: ~$220,000 (ish)

- If it matters the townhouse is listed in my name

- New house: would look for a place about $425,000 and would look to put down about 10%

- We would be able to rent our townhouse for roughly $1750 which is $150 higher than our Principal &amp; Interest, HOA, warranty, and escrow amounts combined. 

Some questions I have:

- Should I talk with a professional and if so who? a CPA, mortgage consultant, someone else? 

- Would it be better to use a larger bank (i.e Wells Fargo who are currently with) or a smaller company so so could communicate situations better?

- Are there ways to have two properties in the same city, with low mortgage rates (under 3%)?

- I don’t know how this would work (new to this), but what if my wife took the mortgage out in her name for the new house and I kept the mortgage in my name for the townhouse but we used different banks? How would that work?

If anyone has any ideas or experience, totally open to hearing those explanations. I have heard from a friend things like putting townhouse up as collateral and credit equity loan?? What are the pros/cons of that?

Since we purchased these etf's they've gone down in value, they aren't even keeping up with inflation in the slightest. I don't see bonds protecting your money during a correction in the charts (at least they appear to move in the same direction as equities), and with interest rates on bonds so low already it doesn't seem worth the risk of interest rates rising and creating worthless bonds, is it possible this is an outdated method?",finance
personalfinance,How to refinance in 2021,"Hi folks I'm looking to refinance my house soon. I haven't done it in a while, and typically I worked with a friend in the mortgage industry. I know that there are now lots of online ways to do this, but, I'm wondering how people who have done it recently got it done. 

Here are some specifics. We've lived here for 10 years. About 5 years ago we refinanced down to a 20 year and are currently at a rate of 3.85%.  We are very right-side up on this house having bought it in 2010 and the market in our area is going bananas. I think I'd like to cash out about $50k to finish up some final projects on this house: wiring, remodel a bathroom, paint the exterior, fix up the garage, etc... With that cashout we would still be below at least 50% of what the house is worth right now.  With interest rates like they are right now, it looks like I might be about to refinance another 20 year with the cash out and still drop my payments. I plan on being here for another 10 years at least. 

Also, of interest is that I was working freelance for a lot of 2019 and 2020 but have been in a full-time job for a few months now, which is why I think I should do this now, because I'm considering going back into the freelance world. My wife has been with the same company for 20 years. Credit is over 700 for both of us last time I checked. 

What are your recommendations for going about this? Things to watch out for?  Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,[GA] Wife and I want to buy our first home but are completely lost on the process (due to having lived outside the US for the longest time). Please help! Thank you!,"I have lived in Georgia for 2½  years and my wife and I are planning to purchase our first home. I make $50,000/year in IT and wife makes $20,000 - $32,000/year (the variation is due to unstable hours in retail).

My wife is a Permanent Resident (Green Card Holder) and only got her Employment Authorization this year, and for that reason, she has a work history of less than 2 years. On the other hand, our FICO score is considered good. 721 mine and 712 hers.

When inquiring about a home loan, our Credit Union informed that they could not take into account her salary due to the short period of employment history and that this would impact the amount of financing to be made available, since my salary would be the only one to be considered.

In addition — since we are first time homebuyers — I heard that we have a chance to get a house at 0% down payment; along with ""many"" other government programs. What programs are these?

I talked to some people who have already bought a house and even made another post here on Reddit about it and they suggested that I seek financing through smaller banks here in Georgia or independent loaning agencies, as these are more likely to help cases like ours .

I wonder if anyone would have any recommendations of small, trusted banks or independent brokers with fair interest rates that would be able to help us achieve our goal.

If you don't know any banks to recommend but have any suggestions, tips, experience to share, please do. We are looking to understand how this whole process works and all help is welcome.

I feel sure that there are other options out there that I'm just not aware of, and I'm a little concerned that I've been doing this research for weeks and nobody has mentioned the full slate of options available to me.

personalfinance,Best way to go about paying down our consumer debt early next year?,"Hi, r/personalfinance,

My wife and I made a goal this next year to get all our consumer debt paid off entirely. The majority of it is the residual debt from getting married last year. Financial picture below:

**Take Home** - ~$96,400/year gross (about $100K when accounting for overtime, bonuses, etc.)

**Rent** - $1,400/month

**Two Car Payments** - $685/month total

We have other things such as utilities, our phone bill, groceries, gas, etc. Our budget typically puts us at around $2K of a surplus if not a little more (obviously the holidays lent itself to that number being a little bit less, but I digress).

We have the following CC debts:

**Citi Card** - $4,500 - $68 min./month (we've been doing $100) | This was a balance transfer so it has no interest accruing right now (and won't until October of 2022). I cut this card earlier this year when I transferred the balance to ensure we didn't drive it up again.

**Discover Card** - $1,580 - $40 min./month (been doing $80) | This is the only one that's still active and retains a rolling balance here and there. This was as low as $400 earlier this year and has been as high as $2K. The limit is $12,000.

**Navy Federal** - $1,800 - $48 min./month | This is an older card from college that used to be about twice what it is. I also cut it up about a year ago so it's only being paid down.

**TOTAL CC DEBT** - $7,880

We've been paying these at or higher than the minimums without any trouble, but our goal for 2021/early 2022 is to buy a house and we want to start with $0 of consumer debt. The following is what we will be coming into within the next couple months:

**Stimulus** - $1,200 for being married (I know Congress has been going back and forth for $2K/person, but we're not holding our breath).

**Bonus** - $1,000 - $1,250

**Tax Refund** - ~$2,400. We've never adjusted withholdings/exemptions, so Uncle Sam takes all he wants interest-free. This is what we got last year and our tax accountant says we can expect around the same, give or take a hundred or two.

My wife and I are mulling over the best way to tackle this. We have ~$1,000 in an Everyday Savings account (we burned about $4,400 in savings this year due to a [pre-Covid] vacation and some emergencies). I thought the smartest thing may be to stash the incoming ~$4,600 into savings until all is accounted for (we anticipate having all the above funds by mid-March) and then allocating it accordingly. The CC balances would reflect January, February and March's payments and thus be less, too. My wife wants to take a more immediate approach by applying them to the CC balances as we receive them, to the highest interest cards. Some part of me wants to see a huge knockout blow to the Citi card come March and keep the ~$5K in savings God forbid we need it before then. But we have a white board in the kitchen and she said it'll also feel good to be able to constantly adjust the total as we pay them off.

Any tips or suggestions are much appreciated! I can also answer any questions about our financial situation as well, as I'm sure the above doesn't answer a whole ton by default.",finance

personalfinance,What can my friend do about his car issue?,"We live on Long Island, NY, if that matters. He's 34 with, as far as I know, a LOT of debt. Im not sure about how much because he never has given me a number, but he has told me he owes student loans from not finishing school, owes credit cards, car loan, etc.


He and I both got used cars a couple of years ago. Since he got the car (a Chevy Malibu, I believe)  he has had issues. The car made a loud noise when he drove under 30mph. Whatever that was got fixed by a friend for cheaper. But now he has another issue with the car and it is going to cost $3k (he hasn't told me the issue, just the amount).


The reason he came to me? He says his ONLY option is to get a brand new car. He says he needs someone to cosign the loan for him that has good credit. He'll be trading in the old car and the leftover of that loa , whatever it is, will be ""tacked onto"" the new loan. So say the new car is $20k and after trade in he still owes $5k, the total will be $25k (plus interest and fees).


I've told him I adamantly won't (and can't) do it since we are in the process of buying a house. I can't be tied to any new large purchases. Plus, I honestly don't trust his financial sense... at all. He's asking his siblings and friends to cosign and no one will... so he has no options if no one signs.


I told him getting a new car is a bad idea since they depreciate so quickly. On top of this, his interest rate will probably suck too. He's going to pay out the nose with this plan.

personalfinance,How do I raise credit score for buying a house in a year or two?,"I currently have a credit score of 710-730ish (depending on the month, credit scores are dumb).  I want to get a better credit score because I am going to buy a house in the near future, 1-2 years. 

Currently I have 1 credit card with a limit of 10k and that is pretty much the only thing on my credit report. I know not to use more than 30% of it and I never do. I've had this card for only about a year and before that I had 1 other card for 4 years. 

My car is paid off and I have never had a car loan. I just got my car like 9 months ago, so a low interest rate car loan is not really an option. I borrowed 4k from my parents to buy the car and paid it back in a like, 3 months. Which I now regret because it would have been nice to have the loan on my credit.  Plus I bet I could have gotten a 3-4% APR 1 year car loan, so cost would have been worth the return on the credit boost 

Should I get a personal loan for 6 or 1 yr months for 6k and just front load my roth ira? Is it worth paying the interest on a personal loan to raise my credit score from good to great? 

Should I just get another credit card? I do kind of want to get a visa, my amex is my main credit card and is annoyingly not accepted everywhere. 

Edit: How much will raising my credit score drop my morgage rate? 

Stats that might help your comments: 

23 years old. 50k income this year, 55-60 next year. home price 240k-265k. 55k for down payment and closing costs. 20kish car. Max money spent on a credit card normally per month is about $900. I paid a bunch of taxes on my credit card at one point and paid for school on it which got reimbursed so it experian recorded my max usage as 2800.",finance
stocks,ABNB investment thesis - tell me where I am wrong,"ABNB

**What I like:**

* As an upfront disclaimer, I’m focused on investing vs. trading. I'm thinking about ABNB as a long-term hold, like 10-15+ years (think Amazon), so I'm not too worried about Covid and if anything I think the pandemic has given people a greater appreciation of travel/holidays/experiences - i.e. there is a real and underlying growing market for travel/holidays/experiences outside of things like Covid. By the way, I realise referencing Amazon as a benchmark is asking for trouble, but Craigs sent out an interesting email on the 9th of December showing that if you'd invested $10k in Amazon at the IPO then that $10k would be worth c.$2.5m today. Why? Probably because they 'cornered the market', had a strong brand and were well supported/capitalized. Is AirBnb that much different? I think the main difference is that Amazon have much more diverse earnings stream and larger addressable market, but even 10% of that growth rate is still quite attractive
* ABNB have a large addressable market - $1.5T apparently. With \~$5-6b of revenue in 2021, that would be less than 1% of their SAM (serviceable addressable market) of $1.5T. I’m always a bit cautious/sceptical around calculations of SAM and TAM, but it is hard to disagree that it is a large market and that ABNB is probably taking market share and growing the pie
* A very strong brand - 91% of all traffic to ABNB is direct to their website or unpaid. 91% is pretty impressive and very powerful (again, Amazon?)
* Prospectus risks - having had some experience writing prospectuses, AirBnb's comments read more like standard boiler-plate disclosures. It is to be expected that their growth will slow by virtue of the law of large numbers, but none of the sub-points highlighted under risk section particularly worry me. For those actually interested in this post, best you read the risks section of the prospectus rather than me regurgitating them here. The two things that worry me most are (1) the unknown – what blows ABNB up? And (2) I’ve overpaid and hence my returns will be moderated to the point where this isn’t the best use of my capital in a relative sense.
* Competition - look, it's not something I know enough about to be confident, but I think that is par for the course with tech companies. Who knows what Joe in Petone, Peter in Mumbai and Muhammed in Miami are doing in their mothers' garages but AirBnb do appear to have built their brand fast and turned their company name from a noun to a verb. Nobody has ever said ""I'm Hiltoning it this weekend""… well maybe Paris does, but hardly a relatable reference point. I do think they'll face some competition around the edges (say, premium travel options, business, other) but the capital raised should help them invest to cement their position.
* Their growth is relatively cheap - no need to fund large buildings and fit-outs/rent. I think they also have an opportunity to broaden their experiences offer and become a portal for experiences outside of accommodation... i.e. restaurant bookings, tours, etc.
* Costs – without a huge amount of fixed overheads, the business does (and has shown that) it has the ability to moderate its cost base during periods of reduced demand.
* Aging population and the rise of the tech-savvy – richer, old people are going to do what they've always done and book hotels, but the next generations are savvy and familiar with AirBnb's offer and concept. AirBnb are swimming with the tide here. The prospectus notes, “While Airbnb is popular across people of all ages, we are particularly strong with younger travellers: as of September 30, 2020, the majority of our guests who have ever made a booking on Airbnb were between the ages of 18 and 34.” As the boomers roll-off, there’s going to be plenty of millennials, gen-X, gen-Y and gen-Z rolling into ABNB’s market. Only other comment I’d make here, is that those within the newer demographics are fickle and tend to hop on the latest bandwagon as it emerges. I guess the question I ask myself here is, what could that new bandwagon be? And, if I knew the answer to that I wouldn’t be writing this post! I am really struggling to see what could disintermediate or dissolve ABNB’s relevance, but the limitations of my creativity are a serious handicap here… maybe in time we’ll wake up, plug an IV in to get fed an optimal dose of nutrients, sit in a machine that moves our muscles and wear a VR helmet that connects us with everything. Sounds horrible to me… but in saying that, I didn’t like the sound of Instagram much either.
* Data - pretty cliché observation, but there's got to be value in their data and ways to monetise it. At the current valuation, any upside is probably already captured, so I haven’t attached a meaningful weighting to this.
* Heavily weighted towards leisure travel, which is unlikely to be disintermediated by Zoom etc.
* As a user – I have liked it. I have, and will, continue to use it over anything else when travelling internationally.

**What I’m unsure about:**  
The price I paid ($146)... and the fact that this IPO is effectively a massive transfer of wealth from existing shareholders who have funded the business to date (and taken real risk), to well-connected pigs that dine regularly at the trough with AirBnB's investment bankers… in saying that, the existing, pre-IPO weighted average share price was $6.77, so not much for them to complain about

* Tied to the above, valuation – NB: high probability I may have mucked up some numbers. When there’s so many zeroes floating around it’s hard to keep track. At today’s market cap of around $75b + $1b of debt the EV is around $76b. Assuming forecast revenue next year of around $5-6b, that’s a forward revenue multiple of 15x. Eye-watering, but not entirely ridiculous in a relative sense in the current market (not to be construed as a view that current market pricing is rational/reasonable). Assuming ABNB could, say, get to 5% market share of their SAM of $1.5T, this would equate to roughly $75b in revenue, or 1x today’s valuation. Rough numbers, but Amazon trades today at around 5-6x revenue. Time is of the essence here, but let’s say it takes ABNB 15 years to get to 5% market share and $75b revenue and trades at \~5x revenue. That’d be a 400% return over 15 years. The math being:
   * $75b EV today on $5b of revenue = 15x multiple
   * $5b of revenue today grows at \~20% p.a. over the next 15 years to $75b in revenue (for reference this is roughly equivalent to Boeing or Sony today - [https://fortune.com/global500/2020/search/](https://fortune.com/global500/2020/search/))
   * At $75b of revenue in 15 years it trades at 5x revenue (a leap of faith), so an EV of $375b
   * Annualised return (assuming no dividends, which are unlikely anyway) is only a 10-12%
   * This is somewhat scary as 20% revenue growth isn’t straight-forward and a 5x revenue multiple and 15 years may also be generous
   * I guess this shows how important entry price is and why this is my biggest concern and why selling out and rebuying if it goes down and/or DCA down are going to be so important
   * By the way, quite aware that this analysis is useful now in hindsight – but I probably wouldn’t have done it had I not invested. So, question I have is whether it’s better to sell and take my loss or go long… current sense is the former
* Competition - I think ABNB is a trusted global brand, but is at risk from regional competitors. What do I mean by this… as a user, when I travel overseas I’m going to use ABNB because I know it, but domestically I’ll look at bookabach, TradeMe etc before booking. So I think you have to moderate ABNB’s addressable market for regional/domestic competitors. It’s probably not going to blow ABNB up, but it could eat away at their domestic travel growth and market share.
* Growth strategy – for a company raising the amount of money it did, the growth strategy in the prospectus was pretty light and wishy-washy
* Slowing revenue growth - I don't like the fact it's slowing, but it’s still \~30%. In saying that, hard to see it growing consistently at 30%+ over the next 10+ years given y-o-y revenue growth to 2019 was ‘only’ 30%
* Business travel risk from increased usage of Zoom etc.
* Regulation – it’s a bit of catch all but I do worry that the business’ cost base expands with highly paid lawyers to manage the obligations within multiple jurisdictions
* More minor risks, but I’ll throw them out there for completeness:
* One-off bad hosting experiences that create apprehensive potential hosts - you know the ones which hit the headlines where the poor host is standing outside watching Jock and his mates punch holes in the walls. A minor risk in the scheme of things, but a flurry of \*\*\*\*ty news stories may turn people off from becoming hosts.
* I think there is a small risk that hosts try to disintermediate AirBnb and go direct or contract directly with repeat customers, whereby AirBnb don't get a cut - i.e. I went to 69 Knob Ave in Remuera last time, we had a good experience, I'll just contact Mrs. Knobette direct, but I think this is a very small risk and more domestic

**So, where am I at?**

* At the moment I’m probably hoping – and that isn’t a good investment strategy
* The rough valuation numbers above don’t fill me with a heap of confidence (I probably wouldn’t have done them had I not invested, so a lesson nonetheless) – I think an ABNB investor can/will make better than average returns, but assuming returns are 15-20% p.a. on a good day, they don’t really feel fair relative to the risk (still not bad, just not on a risk-adjusted basis). I think the only caveat/get-out-of-jail is that market pricing continues to go further away from fundamentals than it already is. Again, seems hopeful, but I’ve been proven wrong over the last 10 years and can’t see anything changing that in the near-term… but I guess that’s the point… it’s what you don’t see that undoes an investment, rather than what you can reasonably predict
* I haven’t bet the house (and thankfully so) – so I guess I’m still willing to gamble my $ on:
   * Covid/vaccine recovery pushing the share price up;
   * Higher/faster growth than expected; and/or
   * Higher multiples;
* I don’t think I’ll lose all my capital on this, but I’ll probably pop it in the bottom draw where I keep my more speculative investments and forget about it for a while (much like I’ve done with PEB, which has served me ok, albeit with plenty of dilution along the way)

stocks,Apple [AAPL] Stock Price Predictions | Buy or Sell AAPL? Apple [AAPL] Stock Price Target &amp; Analysis,"**Should you buy Apple stock or has the company run out of growth opportunities? What is my price prediction for Apple in the next years? Read until the end as I reveal my price target for Apple and also what I think will happen in the next couple of days, weeks &amp; months!**

**\~ Warning! Very Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone! So, let’s go over some of the latest news on Apple before moving on to some fundamental and technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years.

So, let’s start with the [news](https://postimg.cc/Xrkwk6rP) that Apple will cut the App Store commission in half for small app developers starting in the next days, this will affect developers who earn less than $1M annually from the App Store Sales. This is likely to lead to a small decline in commission revenues for Apple as around 98% of the app developers will qualify for this tax reduction from 30% to 15%, but all these small developers only contribute to about 5% of the estimated $50B in annual revenues from the App Store, so that would be only a $1.25B loss for the company, that is less than half a % of the company’s total net sales in the last fiscal year.

Also, these changes may lead to a potential long-term revenue boost, as it is likely this will lead to an increasing creation of apps which will generate more commissions in return.

Alongside this we also saw the company releasing the new MacBook’s with their first in-house [chip](https://postimg.cc/vc39NF7x), which promises faster video and imaging processing [times](https://postimg.cc/CR5Fmj5V), with both [CPU](https://postimg.cc/Y4yLdrMd) and [GPU](https://postimg.cc/xJz8gLsd) performance up to 2 times faster than the latest PC laptop chip using just a fraction of the power consumption, with both of the macbooks promising big improvements in [battery](https://postimg.cc/1fp6y1rz) life. Apple is also [expected](https://postimg.cc/GHrtJ8vc) to roll out even more in-house chips in future products, as they have started the 2-year breakup with Intel chips.

We also saw Morgan Stanley [upgrading](https://postimg.cc/bZ5qMsSS) their base case to $191 at the end of November, as they have cited record lead times, supply chain forecasts and carriers demand as they expect that the company will sell around 270M iPhone in fiscal year 2021, that’s 50M more than the consensus and almost 30M more than the previous estimate of Morgan Stanley, with an average selling price of 842$, 9% more than the base case, as people tend to chose the more expensive and high tech versions of the lineup in this new 5G cycle.

The 5G super-cycle, which I believe is on the way, and will continue in the next years, as 5G become more available worldwide, could still be the biggest thing coming right away for the company with 5G smartphones [expected](https://postimg.cc/LJptP88f) to surpass 4G sales by 2024, with the average sale price of the 5G phones also coming down, helping them become more popular. This will also be helped by the recent entry to the Indian [market](https://postimg.cc/7fV6BHNS), as India will probably become the world biggest country in the next decade, this could be a huge opportunity for Apple to start and take away market-share from their competitors like Samsung and Xiaomi which have the biggest market shares right now.

They also [released](https://postimg.cc/PpWhPy31) an update iPad Pro and an all-new iPad Air in September which will also boost sales in this work-from-home environment that will keep the demand very high for this kind of products, just like the Macs. Alongside the increasing demand from the Wearables, Home &amp; Accessories that include Air Pods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and many more products.

But the biggest reasons I believe Apple is poised for continued growth, is primarily due to its services business, as they start to offer more and more services like the Apple ONE [BUNDLE](https://postimg.cc/4777MD3s), which include up to 6 services from (Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, the new Apple Fitness+ and the iCloud service) for a pretty reasonable price in my opinion [starting](https://postimg.cc/BLkDnqzj) from 15$ up to 30$/month, this could be a great option for families and even individuals who use their services a lot.

The latest services, [Fitness+](https://postimg.cc/cKV4KrsG) just launched in the past days, and is a direct competitor to the likes of Peloton, as the service is available on the iPhone, iPad or even Apple TV. This also makes consumers buy the Apple Watch which syncs to the other devices to show you different information. The Fitness+ app just on its own is 8$/month or 80$/year which is less expensive than Peloton subscription which charges 13$ or even traditional gyms like Planet Fitness at 10$/month.

I think this will be the fastest growing sector for the company, as this aligns with the new macro trends, as the world is moving more and more to a digital approach to almost everything as consumer preferences, with more &amp; more younger people reaching the point in life when they use these services start to align to this increasing digital approach.

We also shouldn’t forget the Apple Card &amp; Apple Pay service among many others which also seem to gain from the move to digital &amp; contactless payments, as this has been accelerated due to the current situation in the past year.

And one last piece of [news](https://postimg.cc/k6BKCVTr), and the most recent one, is that Apple may have fast-tracked the Titan project. The Titan project is targeting a 2024 or 2025 push to develop an electric vehicle with advanced battery technologies, that will deliver significant increases in range at much lower costs than the current technologies while also offering self-driving capabilities.

It’s reported they will not use the same technology as Tesla Full-Self-Driving feature, but will use LIDAR sensors, similar to those that we can find in the latest iPhone 12 PRO.

I think Apple can go 2 ways with this project, they can either use the huge amount of cash the company has to buy another car-maker like Ford, GM or any other car manufacturer expect Tesla and Toyota which do have a big market cap, so that they can fast-track the potential manufacturing of cars, or they can enter into a partnership with big companies like Tesla, Volkswagen or any other car marker to either produce cars or license their technology to this other car-makers which would ultimately and probably have higher margin-returns than the effective manufacturing of cars. Apple’s current overall [gross margins](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) stand at 38% vs the 15% average of the world top 10 automakers by market cap, which is significantly lower.

But this Apple Car thing is so far out, and there are so many unknowns, I will not try to predict anything related to this until there is more clarity on the subject.

And last, before moving on to some predictions, here are some of the highlights that we heard from the latest investors conference meeting, as the CEO, Tim Cook [expressed](https://postimg.cc/TyhpLzgg) optimism ahead with the launch of many new products and services, especially the Home Pod Mini and the new 5G iPhones, as these new iPhones include new LIDAR scanners that greatly improve the camera capabilities, as the iPhone as seen very positive reviews. We also saw the Senior VP and CFO, Luca Maestri give us great [outlook](https://postimg.cc/DWDmqxPD) for the company as they expect the installed devices base to continue to growth despite already being at an all-time high as they have over 585M paid subscriptions on their platforms and expect this to surpass 600M by the end of 2020.

I also researched and found what products we can see in the near future, with the first half of [2021](https://postimg.cc/jCBQsXVM) bringing new iMacs, the AirPods3 and the iPad Pro, while in the [FALL](https://postimg.cc/8jVJKngg) event we will probably get the new iPhone 13 alongside the iPhone SE PLUS and the Watch Series 7 with more products coming [later](https://postimg.cc/GHc3s01t) in 2021 or that don’t have an estimated release date like the Air Pods Pro, the Air Tags and the iPad Mini 6.

So, before even starting, you should know that I am bull on Apple but I am willing to hear other opinions so don’t be afraid to leave a comment down below.

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the [company](https://postimg.cc/JHRDpPGQ), the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.

This are my 2025 projections for Apple, let’s take a closer look at them, each on their own.

So, in term of revenues, Apple has 5 big sources of income, which saw an overall increase of 6% despite lagging sales in the iPhone. The biggest revenue is by far the iPhone right now with over $137B in revenue in the fiscal year ending in September. I expect to see the iPhone sales increasing in the next years, especially in 2021, with the new 5G iPhone creating a super-cycle for the [company](https://postimg.cc/XGfBKT7J), as most iPhone users, including myself here, as I will upgrade from my iPhone X, will switch to this new product. The iPhone sales have decreased in the last couple of years by 14% and 3% as a result of the product not having big improvements, as well as iPhone usually starting to last longer than previous models, so I expect to see a 12% increase in sales next year and a gradual decrease in the growth of sales as more people upgrade, ending with just a 5% growth in iPhone [sales](https://postimg.cc/V0wfRpr7) in 2025.

The next revenues stream is from the Mac, which has seen an increase in the past 2years, with revenues topping $28B this year after the huge demand from the work from home consumers. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/1405tm2b) this trend to continue as they plan to continue to launch better products and I can see the company having a similar growth next year before starting to decline slightly until 2025, also ending with a 5% growth.

The iPad is currently the smallest revenue stream for Apple but has also seen an increase in demand in the past 2 years with a 13% average increase in revenues. I also expect the iPad to continue to grow in the next couple of years, especially with the learn-from-home environment for kids, and even after this period ends, the transformation for learning will implicate more digital usage. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/5XKtVsT0) the iPad to see some similar growth to the Macs, especially with the latest generation also bringing a new iPad air to the market.

The 4th revenue stream and the fastest growing in the past 2 years, with an average growth of 33% are the wearables, home &amp; accessories revenues. This have topped $30B this year, as Apple has also just launched the Apple Watch series 6 and also feature other great products like Apple TV, the Air Pods the Home Pod and the Home Pod mini alongside other third-party accessories.

I gave this [revenue](https://postimg.cc/v4C4JQ4T) stream a growth of 20% starting next year with a gradual decrease to around 8% by 2025, as I believe this will become more &amp; more popular as they start to offer more vertical integration.

And last, but by no means least, the revenue stream that I expect to grow the most and the fastest is the revenue from the services that Apple offers. This includes revenues from Apple Care, Advertising, Cloud Services, Payment Services like Apple Card &amp; Apple Pay and of course the digital content which includes fees from the App Store alongside subscription-based income including the new Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ alongside the already know Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+ and hopefully I don’t forget any others.

So, I [expect](https://postimg.cc/svV7mDWR) this to become the clear 2nd biggest revenue stream for Apple by 2025, as I expect this to grow more than 20% next year, mainly due to the Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ followed up by a slightly decreasing growth, ending with a 10% increase in revenues in 2025.

I think this are fairly conservative base case scenarios for the revenues, as I expect them to continue to increase the [other](https://postimg.cc/1VFFgkxJ) revenue streams and not have such a large percentage of the revenues coming from the iPhone sales as you can see in this chart.

In terms of expenses, I pretty much kept the same margins as in previous years, with a 68% expense ratio on product sales \[ [iPhone](https://postimg.cc/JDZ7jMnD) / [iPad](https://postimg.cc/Wd14CB9C) / [Mac](https://postimg.cc/q6GkZw2p) / [WHA](https://postimg.cc/211q9q8g) \] and 35% expense ratio on [SERVICES](https://postimg.cc/8sdLLrjH), as this are way more lucrative.

In the past 3 years, the products [gross margin](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) was 32.7%, so I actually imply bigger expenses for the manufacturing and sales of products, as this is mostly impacted by the company’s supplier’s ability to make up for and demand, while for the services revenue, the gross margins for the last 3 years has been 63.5% on average, but I expect this to be more in-line with the 66% margin in this past year. So, if services manage to grow to about half the revenues from the iPhone, this will effectively double the gross revenues, as every buck gained in the service revenues account for 2$ in the product sales.

So, I expect the total [revenues](https://postimg.cc/sMjByQ2n) for Apple to increase from $274B in 2020 to over $440B by 2025, increasing by approximately 10%/year, while I will keep the expense ratio pretty much in-line and have them increasing by 11%/year, this would bring the total gross income for Apple to $177B, increasing mainly due to the services revenues as I said earlier. This growth is just above the 4year [average](https://postimg.cc/Tp8g83mS), and below the 2018 levels, which we might see again with this 5G super-cycle and explosive growth in the services revenue.

I also think the company will continue to invest in both Capital Expenditure and Operating expenses.

I think the operating expenses will remain pretty much in line with the [previous](https://postimg.cc/2qBCfrnc) years, as this number has increased by 1% [annually](https://postimg.cc/Fd5JL9v8) both in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A. So, I will keep the exact percentages from previous years, as I expect the revenue to increase, thus I don’t see a big increase percentage wise. This would account for over $60B in operating expenses by 2025 and over $11B in Capital Expenditures by 2025, as I expect this to increase, mainly due to the possible EV developments or investments in self-driving capabilities alongside other manufacturing capabilities. You can see that the Capex [spending](https://postimg.cc/yDsRdpLy) has been decreasing in the past years with just over $8.8B in payments for business acquisitions and the other traditional Capex spending. Some people may use the cash generated by [investing](https://postimg.cc/Mn9nG6Mz) activities as Capex, but that is more unreliable. I also can see the Capex going back up, so I wanted to be safe and implied a 10% growth.

This money would account for over $73B in [expenses](https://postimg.cc/dZnY91K1) and would bring the profit for the company to almost $104B before interest and taxes.

Moving on, let’s see what interest income and expenses the [company](https://postimg.cc/cgy0x2ms) has had in the past few years. We can see a decrease in interest expense in the past few years as the company has been paying off debt, but they have also been generating less money in this department, with an overall decrease in this department of more than 50% in the past year, way less than the amount from 2018. So, for safety reasons, I used a 10% decline in both income and expenses [related](https://postimg.cc/QKgtZhZG) to interest, while increasing the other losses by 10%/year.

This would bring the company pre-tax income to just over $104B in 2025.

Let’s move on to taxes. I know the Federal income tax rate is 21% for the [company](https://postimg.cc/ykY39pq1), but the actual effective tax rate for the company was lower than 15% in the past year, mainly due to lower tax-rates on foreign earnings alongside tax-benefits and tax-settlements. The average effective tax rate has been just over 16% in the past 3 years, but with more and more of the revenues coming from outside the US, I think it’s safe to say that the company will have around a 15% effective tax rate by 2025, this obviously if nothing major changes in tax policy around the world.

So, Apple would [have](https://postimg.cc/Wqc3ytKw) $88.6B in income after tax by 2025 and with the current outstanding shares standing at just under 17B, so I don’t even account for the company probably continuing to do share buybacks, this would mean a $5.22 [future](https://postimg.cc/4YytCLwL) earnings/share. And with today’s price for Apple just around 136$, that would mean to [company](https://postimg.cc/RNf1qH44) is trading at just over 26 times forward price to earnings.

I don’t think Apple will ever trade at a discount again, with the current PE [standing](https://postimg.cc/RqwqHQ6s) at over 40, I believe this will eventually go down, probably to around 35, despite the increase in services revenue, which is highly valued by investors. I think we can see Apple trade somewhere near 35 [times](https://postimg.cc/5H98PKv2) P/E in 2025, especially if something big happens with the EV project, this could be even higher, just look at Tesla which trades at [insane](https://postimg.cc/sBZhxMk5) P/E. Of course, we also have to take into consideration the dividends that will be received from owning the stock, as Apple has started to pay dividends almost a decade ago and has 9 years of dividend growth, with a 10% annual rate of [growth](https://postimg.cc/CnbZMbD2) in the past 5 years. [Here](https://postimg.cc/7CLT1G8C) is the dividend growth history for the company, as I also went conservative on this [estimate](https://postimg.cc/Tp7LcjGr) and implied a 7% growth for the next 2 years, 6% for 2023 and 2024 and just 5% in 2025.

So [here](https://postimg.cc/R3PK21QQ) are my 3 price targets for the company, [including](https://postimg.cc/JHR8JXvv) dividends but not reinvested. My bear case scenario is that Apple will trade at almost 165$ which implies a [return](https://postimg.cc/jCYzWhd2) of over 21% by 2025, while my base case scenario would see Apple trading at 195$ with a return of capital of 43%. I will also make the bull case for Apple trading at 225$ by 2025 with dividends included, which would imply just over 65% in gains by then.

I think this is possible as Apple has also [continued](https://postimg.cc/fJj36jMt) to buy back shares of the company on a constant basis, as they continue to an impressive campaign with over $72B worth of common stock repurchased in 2020. They continue to buy back shares at a very fast pace, having repurchased over 1.3B shares in 2019 and 2018, while also issuing less stock every year.

So here is the full [spreadsheet](https://postimg.cc/Z995KrzL) that I have projected for Apple by 2025 and the breakdown of everything i estimated \[ [1](https://postimg.cc/jCT7qdZJ) / [2](https://postimg.cc/DmcbSkMp) \] , if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

Keep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just [look](https://postimg.cc/V50nHCSn) at the growth Apple has had in the last 5years. The company has increased in value by more 400% in just the past 5years and is over 100.000% up since it started trading. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against Apple?

The company also has pristine [financials](https://postimg.cc/LYcYMxqf), with more than $65B in total assets compared to total liabilities, and more than $38B in cash and cash equivalents.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Apple?

Let’s look at this [CHART](https://postimg.cc/7592T1c8), so starting with the stock split, Apple saw a correction within the September stock market pullback, in a buy the news &amp; sell the event, after a huge runup post-announcement of the stock split. The stock entered a consolidation period, and didn’t have any big catalysts, especially with new iPhone lineup not being included in the Q4 results due to the late launch. The stock found some levels of resistance near the $120 levels that it struggled to get past but acted also as support after breaking them just before the recent news of the possible EV developments or self-driving-features to be licensed to other car manufacturers. After that news the stock spiked and has now reached the previous highs made before the stock split and is facing some resistance, if the stock pushes over $140 I think we can officially say that it broke the resistance at those levels and is not just a fake-out. But I think it’s likely that the stock will consolidate between 122 and 135$ in the next weeks until the next iPhone sales and quarterly results are released, as the stock has entered overbought territory again with an RSI over 70, the first time since the stock split.

So, what would I do? Well, I own Apple stock, and I really believe this company will remain the biggest or one of the biggest in the future, so I would really add on any weakness that the stock shows before the next quarter earnings are released, as typically Q1 [earnings](https://postimg.cc/V5t0FPTF) are the best for the company due to increased holiday sales combined with the launch of new products. I think any entry below 130$ would be really nice to start and build a position or increase it if you already own the stock. As I believe Apple is one of the most stable stocks out there with large institutional [holders](https://postimg.cc/3kqG3XcK) like Vanguard, BlackRock and Berkshire owning over 900M shares each.

personalfinance,Steps to Prepare for a Mortgage,"Hello all,

As part of my plan for 2021, I want to start considering getting a mortgage (at least take the right steps), especially while rates are low. I also live alone.

Age: 24
Salary: $79k. (Income in 2019 was $63k)
Credit Score: 757 (with about 5 credit card inquiries this year)

Current Debt:

Federal Student Loans $42k — 4.25% Interest with Payment at $320/month
Private Student Loan $35k — 4.09% Interest with Payment at $278/month 
Car Lease — $300/month

Savings: About $10k


Current rent payments: $1,782


Here are the steps I’m thinking about:


-	Save $500 a month, half split between a down payment for a house and half split towards other stuff (emergency fund and student loans)

-	Reduce credit card applications.

-	Pay down my private student loan

My goal house would be between $150k-250k, with a mortgage payment around $1500/month. Where I live now houses start around $350k, for things besides mobile homes) so if I could move that would be great, but that depends on the job situation.


Thoughts? Anything I should improve? Look into? I don’t think a 20% down is a hard requirement anymore, especially if PMI is reasonable, but I still want to have a good emergency fund if big equipment fails (even though I plan on looking at later than 2018 instructions).",finance

investing,Cryptocurrencies as part of an investment portfolio?,"Hi,

this is going to be controversial but I need some feedback on my investing plan:

1. Convince me why I should or should hold any Cryptocurrency 
2. If ""yay crypto"" 
   1. what is your composition 
   2. ...and allocation
   3. How often do you rebalance the crypto?

My investing allocation is currently 60% stocks (low-cost ETFs ), 5% crypto, and the rest a mix of bonds (also ETF) and cash.

I know the crypto part is controversial. I am just holding ETH,  BTC, and LTC (33% each). But I am considering to diversify more in the next year.

In my opinion, a small percentage of in crypto 3-10% (depending on your risk appetite) is a totally legit way of diversifying your portfolio. Since the volatility is so high I tend to not pay too much attention and just rebalance once every two months or so.

The market capitalization of cryptos like Bitcoin or Etherium is quite high and financial institutions are participating in the market. It's recognized and regulated by federal institutions. So the risk is not that much. different than dealing in small-cap equities or junk bonds

thx for your feedback!

Do I ""expect to have no federal income tax liability in 2020""??? I've read something about making less than $12,000 in 2020 means that you expect to have no federal income tax liability.

personalfinance,Emergency fund investment in an ETF,"If i do not want to put my 20k stash of emergency fund in high yield savings accounts which provide so low interest rates that they hardly beat inflation, will it be a good idea to invest that much amount in an ETF such as VTI.

personalfinance,What is I am missing in this calculations for buying in cash vs 15-year mortgage,"My spouse and I (no kids) are planning to buy a house and we have \~210K cash savings (some of are currently in stocks for a while) which we can increase to \~260K by borrowing money which we can pay back in several months. Everyone keeps saying that with the current low interest rate (as low as 2%) it does not make sense to pay in cash for a house. We do not really know anything about personal finance, and we did some calculations to compare below two options of buying in cash vs 15-year mortgage assuming that we can spare 4K from our monthly income after the costs of living, and the stock savings increase by 8% every year (through an investment program like Vanguard).

1. Cash option: 260K paid for the house and we live in that house for 15 years. We obviously have no money in stocks to start with, and every month for 15 years (once we are done with paying back the borrowed 50K), we spend 500 bucks for the property taxes etc and invest 3.5K in stocks every month.
2. Mortgage option: We get 208K mortgage with 20% down-payment (260-52=208) and 2% interest rate, and we live in that house we purchased for 15 years. We put the remaining 158K we have after down-payment (210-52 = 158) in stock market. We pay 2K for the mortgage and property taxes every month for those 15 years, and we use the remaining 2K from our spare money every month to buy stocks.

In each of these two cases, we computed how much cash we would have 15 years from now, and interestingly, the first option results in 1.14M and the second option results in 1.16M, so close! It seems crazy to us to choose option 2 and stay in debt for 15 years and not really own the house just to make 20K more money, and so we would go with option 1. But my gut feeling says we may be missing something. Any ideas?",finance

MachineLearning,[D] Efficient way to cluster millions of face embeddings,"Hey,

I'm currently working on a face clustering system that gets incremental new input data.

I use the 128d face embeddings given by FaceNet. I already tested these Algorithms: Chinese Whispers, DBSCAN and HDBSCAN (doesn't seem to work at all for high dimensional data with over 50000 datapoints).

All of them take a very long time if they are fed with \~50000-60000 datapoints. What can I do to increase this speed?

I thought about reducing dimensionality, but after some tinkering it seemed that this reducing process cost more processing time than it actually saved.

Some other things I could try is to split the datapoints into smaller clustering groups (e.g. divided by male and female to get 2 half-as-big cluster groups), combining/averaging some or all individual items in a cluster to save datapoints or by just allowing e.g. 10 datapoints per cluster (again to save datapoints).

Since I get this data incrementally, I either have to repeat the whole clustering process (seems to be the case with DBSCAN, HDBSCAN and Chinese Whispers) which means this process needs to go as fast as possible since re-runs are costly, or by having an incremental clustering process that can work efficiently on huge datasets when added and run incrementally (so one incremental step doesn't take as long as a whole reclustering, otherwise this would be pointless), but I haven't found a algorithm yet that fullfills my requirements.

Can you lead me into the right direction? Also, it would be great if there would already exist a high performance algorithm available with a python api, since I'm not great at highly optimizing algorithms.

Thank you in advance!",technology
personalfinance,How much saved do you really need to buy your first property?,"Say you were to buy your first home with an FHA loan. What kind of interest rate would you typically see for someone with a high credit score and how does that correlate with what percent down?

You put 3.5% down but you have to pay say 7% in interest or something.. how does it scale with the change in x% or y%? Sorry for the horrible wording. Regardless, next you need z% in closing costs. And finally you need probably 3 months in expenses, maybe more depending on risk tolerance?

personalfinance,Thinking about refinancing my car... what would you do?,"Hello PF! 

I lost my job in March. Unemployment benefits are looking like they're going to run out soon. I need to get creative with how I'm going to squeeze some extra cash because we are currently just barely scraping by on those benefits and my husbands salary. I am actively searching and interviewing but no offers have come in. We've already cut back on ""luxuries"" like streaming services and gaming stuff. Our monthly spend includes mortgage (can't refinance right now or I'd be asking about that), food, utilities, gas, insurance, a minor credit card payment, and a couple of streaming services so we don't lose our ever loving minds.

That being said, I'm considering refinancing my car but I'm not sure if it's a good decision. When I bought the car, I was duped into taking an 8 year loan. Yes, I know it was stupid. You don't need to berate me about it. I've done that enough to myself, lol. Anyway, the ultimate goal is to pay it off ASAP. My plan is to start paying extra on the loan as soon as I've got a stable income again. We do have a credit card with a balance of $5k and an APR of 0% until April but I have the cash on hand to pay that off today. Just haven't done it yet because I'd rather have it in case I need it for an emergency since, you know, no job. Aside from that credit card, this is our only debt.

Facts:

* Payoff Amt: $13,900
* Current Interest Rate: 3.49%
* Current Monthly Payment: $455
* Months Left: 42
* Refinance Rate/Terms: 
   * 2.24% @ 37-60 months; OR 
   * 2.69% @ 61-72 months; OR 
   * 2.99% @ 73-84 months

Again, the plan is to pay the bare minimum until I'm back at work and then start paying at least what we were paying monthly anyway, which is $455, but hopefully as much as we can to pay it off before the end of the year.

personalfinance,Savings Breakdown,"EDIT: So I am about to start a new job, and with an increase in salary I want to increase my savings. I am 30, married, and we are expecting (10 weeks pregnant now). I have an idea how I want to save, broken out into categories, but wanted to throw my idea out here for discussion. I am fairly experienced at investing and we have no large debt (small credit card debt).

My thoughts are:
-use 50/30/20 rule: 20% of after tax paycheck into savings (maybe more)

-Categories: emergency fund, short/med term savings (3-5 years), retirement fund for wife + me, 529 for kid(s). 

-Goal to buy primary residence within 1 year and secondary rental within 3 years.

-Emergency fund is mostly already saved, and again we have minimal debt

-I have 2 different Roth 401Ks from previous jobs which I plan to roll over into new 401K with new job, or into IRA if 401K options suck. 

Caveat is my job is a W2 contract, so I have to pay my own health insurance, 401K contributions, etc.

Finally, my taxes are already complicated as hell, I get errors every year even with tax firm doing the same thing every year, so minimizing complications with a bunch of different accounts would also be a goal. 


Specific questions:

1. With interest rates low, MMA and bond returns suck right now. Any ideas on better returns (at least 2%) for 1 year, 3 year and 5 year goals? My thought is to keep 1yr savings in Ally MMA, and 3-5 year goals saving into a Bogle-esque 3 fund portfolio with index ETF for minimal risk but better returns than 0.5% with MMA. 

2. What criteria should I judge new 401K vs IRA? I will not get any matching, and I will go Roth either way. Contributions are limited for IRA to 6K/yr, I plan to contribute at least 12K up to 18K/yr. If the new 401K options suck, should I split 6K to 401K and 6K to IRA?

3. Any feedback or tips with 529 contributions? We will be in Virginia but I understand you can use any state's 529. 

4. Any tips for interviewing tax firms to handle my taxes? I understand it will take some up-front cost to figure past returns out and my current accounts (5+) to which I will add these new accounts.

personalfinance,Love it or list it,"Hello kind redditors, we have an interesting dilemma that I would love to get opinions on.

We have a home that’s currently worth about $535k. I’ve been making extra payments and we will have the home paid off in 6-7 years.  We refinanced earlier in 2020 and our interest rate is 2.57%. We are in our early 40’s and have good jobs (knock on wood).

The home is older, about 30 years, we’ve made a lot of upgrades since we moved in, but we will need a new roof in the next five years and probably some other major improvements.  We have two young kids, and we only have one guest bath.  I know that that should be enough, but it is likely my father who is getting older will come move in with us at some point in the next five to seven years.  Which will coincide with my kids being teenagers.  So a second guest bath would be really necessary.

In other words, we’ve got about $75k in things we would like to do to make this place perfect.  It’s a wonderful home, we love it.

Given how low interest rates are, we are thinking of potentially selling our home and getting something pricier.  We can afford to go up to $750k especially with how much equity we have in our current place and the extra payments I already make.  We have plenty of savings so if something unfortunate happens to our income, the higher mortgage will have almost no impact for a year or more.

Here’s our dilemma:  If we put the work into our current home, we probably won’t get most of that investment back as our home is at the top of the price point in our current neighborhood.  If we buy a home at these low rates, we are getting a lot for our money and probably won’t see these rates ever again.

So, do we love it and improve our house or do we list it, sell high (buy high), but at an unprecedented interest rate.",finance

The SP Home price [INDICES](https://ibb.co/W67RBYh) also came in better than expected with the National Index increasing by 1.4% M/M, as this is a leading measure of real estate prices, gaining 8.4% nationwide over year ago. 

These moves can also be seen in the latest Redfin report, as home sales [PRICES](https://ibb.co/CwR5H56) are up 14% year/year to over $320K with a great increase in pending [SALES](https://ibb.co/mJtrwV9) which are also up more than 34% since last year, as the number of active [LISTINGS](https://ibb.co/vVkfMMh) of home sales is down more than 30%, as buyers can’t snatch them up quick enough with such low [YIELDS](https://ibb.co/7j1kY3s), as this has led for the [AVERAGE](https://ibb.co/gzQq8Wb) sale price to list value to rise to 99.4% which Is up 1.5% since 2019. This should be good news for companies like Toll Brothers, Lennar, HD and LOW.

This was also accompanied by the great numbers in the us chain store sales [NUMBERS](https://ibb.co/4PykPcH), which rose by almost 9% y/y with December sales expected to rise almost 5% since last year and a .2% increase since last month.

While [TODAY](https://ibb.co/8N3YMPV) we start the day with MBA Mortgage applications, home sales and the Chicago PMI alongside advance reads on many other data points.

In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/q1J6Snv), we saw Apple cool of a little yesterday, losing more than 1% for the day while they also lost a lawsuit aimed of stopping Corellium using virtual iPhone for security researching in the operating system, while [INTEL](https://ibb.co/3vvXFGT) finally got a breather and recovered some of the recent loses, after an activist hedge fund manager pushed for strategic changes in the company as Intel is losing market share and top designers, with the company also [ISSUING](https://ibb.co/WgtwTrY) a statement that lifted spirits around the stock.

We also saw the [FAA](https://ibb.co/6rJ6bHd) introduce new rules for drones, this may have a big impact on companies like UPS, Walmart and Amazon, as all of them have started trials for drone-delivery, as this could lead to better margins for the companies.

The Fed also [EXTENDED](https://ibb.co/cxV3HkC) the main street lending programs until Jan. 8 with the approval of Mnuchin as they try to process a bunch of applications this month, this means we can get even more money put into the economy and eventually the stock markets which is good news.

And meanwhile, AstraZeneca’s vaccine was [APPROVED](https://ibb.co/y5QWbmh) for emergency use in the UK, this is another weapon to find this freaking illness, while JNJ will give us some results in early 2021 and Novavax just started their trial in the US.

Also, one last piece of data that I found recently shows that there was indeed a huge spike this [YEAR](https://ibb.co/JrKw01B) in the move to live streaming video and pre-recorded videos this year, as this has boosted companies like Peloton, Lululemon and others.

But this trend is seen slowing down in the next years with just a 4% [CAGR](https://ibb.co/HGhFJXS) in the equipment market, but that the exercise apps will see a big [GROWTH](https://ibb.co/02wm273) in the next years, so there are 2 different POV. I wouldn’t stay invested in companies like PTON right now, I’d rather take profits and move to other areas in the stock market. But don’t rush into companies like AMC which have diluted their stock a lot or have lots of debt… this will not recover so fast, with [AMC](https://ibb.co/gDR8S81) filling to share up to 50M shares.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/nbV49Bs) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way.

personalfinance,Mortgage from family vs bank,"I’m 29F, bf 31m (not married but could be common law). We both have credit scores between 750-790, combined income is about $150k, savings is around $200k. 

Thinking about buying out first house. Where we want to live will cost $400k min unfortunately. 

My parents are well off thanks to my mom’s job, and she is incredibly cautious with money and lives way below her means. She’s sitting on a ton of cash at the moment, and has offered to buy a house for us and we could pay her back (instead of getting a traditional mortgage.)

I’m wondering what the drawbacks of this would be. 

Obviously, we’d sign a contract or something and I have a great relationship with my family esp as it regards money so I’m not worried about that. In a worst case scenario where the housing market crashes or I couldn’t pay for some reason, she would still love me and wouldn’t be financially wrecked. Shes not the kind of person who would act like it’s “her” house and the house would be about 5 hours away from her. So not really worried about the interpersonal stuff mainly trying to understand from a personal finance perspective if this is a good idea. I’d imagine we’d strike a deal where we pay about market interest rates and all that. 

What am I not thinking of? Will it hurt me to not have experience with a mortgage when I go to buy a second home?

Edit: there are some resources on the internet about how to do this logistically. Paperwork you need to file with a lawyer in order for this to count as a mortgage loan and not a “gift”, minimum interest rates the IRS requires, etc. So we’d follow that guidance with a lawyer. The resources online are more geared toward the family-member doing the lending (I.e. don’t loan to your kid if you’re not prepared to evict them for failing to make payments.) so yeah, more focused on any potential personal finance downsides for me or things I’m not thinking of.

defi,The Ingenious Mechanism in DeFi,"DeFi is a very rough division of finance in these three structures: transaction, interest rate, and positive securities/negative securities.

There are two most important things in a discipline. One is the basic concept. The discussion of every basic concept may take hundreds of years. And the formation of every concept has to go through thousands of tempers. The second is that this concept must promote the formation of the theoretical commanding height in this field. If this theory is equal to common sense, then this subject is meaningless.

When Satoshi Nakamoto designed the blockchain architecture, he had the functions of computing, storage, communication and related technologies. At that time, the digital currency had to solve the double-spending problem, that is, “once money is used, it can’t be used twice”. In fact, both zero-knowledge proof and homomorphic encryption have been discussed, but they cannot solve the double-spending problem. Decentralization is not only distributed, it doesn’t mean to whom the work should be allocated, but to let everyone consciously upload something and automatically combine it.

In retrospect, the structure of Bitcoin is a bit inefficient: it is very redundant in terms of computing, information storage, and communication. Redundancy refers to multiple computers repeatedly performing the same calculations and storing the same data. Redundant architecture will make it difficult to complete matching transactions (that is, asset pricing will be very difficult), because it is difficult to solve just by function or voting.

From a market perspective, matchmaking transactions are the ultimate in information interaction in the modern economy. Transactions are not suitable for matching on the chain. In other words, once the matching transaction is feasible on the chain, the advantage of the off-chain exchange will be greater. This is an issue of comparative advantage.

What types of traders are there in the micro-market structure of matched trading? The first is an insider trader, the second is an information trader, the third is a market maker, the fourth is a value trader, and the fifth is a noise trader. Here I will focus on information traders. An information trader means that the information obtained by the owner has an advantage, and he has to discount the price of the asset based on the information he has at all times. For example, every time he receives new information, he will tell you how much the price has changed. These information owners have the most extreme desires for transactions and requirements for computing, storage and communications, and they are also the main providers of exchange transactions and liquidity.

For example, high-frequency traders on American exchanges are accurate to the nanosecond level, and they have to continue trading outside when the exchange is closed. Because they feel that information is constantly changing, and they have information advantages, they must price their assets all the time. For such people, exchanges with advantages in computing, storage, and communications are more suitable for them. For instance, which asset has value on Uniswap will also be moved to a centralized exchange, because information traders want to profit from this, they have greater advantages here, and are more willing to provide more transactions and liquidity.

Since there is no advantage in pricing on the blockchain, price calculation should be formed off-chain. The blockchain system is not to make you more efficient, but to make you more credible. Assuming there is a price sequence off the chain, how to generate this price sequence on the chain and keep it true?

The first is that the verification and generation of data must be decentralized. The second is to ensure that these two prices won’t deviate. The third is that the generation mechanism cannot be influenced by others. The fourth is that there will be a delay in the generation of all price sequences, unless you have a price in each block, where the delay refers to the latest effective price and the calling price, and the block interval of completing the transaction.

When you call off-chain data to on-chain, the first thing there will be is the price deviation. And this deviation is the possibility of arbitrage by off-chain copyable transactions. At the same time, the delay will indirectly affect the price deviation, because the corresponding prices at different times are necessarily different. At present, DeFi’s oracle does not make risk management on these two points. In fact, when you operate on Uniswap, the market maker bears the risk of price fluctuations and the risk of arbitrage by others. The question is how big is this risk and can the fees charged by the market maker cover this risk? At present, the model of this type of oracle is still at a relatively crude stage.

The formation of the external equilibrium price is an NP problem (non-polynomial time problem). What Uniswap does is a P calculation (this type refers to polynomial time problems). So in this case, when the market price fluctuates, it will definitely be arbitrage by others. If you guarantee that gains can cover losses, you can form an equilibrium; then you also need to ensure that the equilibrium is stable, and you cannot start to deviate because of disturbances, and if you cannot cover losses, the market maker will withdraw.

When off-chain information is uploaded to the chain, there will definitely be a price deviation, so how to optimize this price deviation? Because minimizing price deviation is very difficult, we thought that price deviation must be less than or equal to the cost of arbitrage. Therefore, the mechanism of the NEST oracle machine includes two-way options, price chains, and Beta coefficients. The Beta coefficient is to fight against self-deal attacks. The price chain means that the information flow can exist forever. Two-way options are a quotation mechanism. There is a verification period, which is mainly used to combat blockage attacks. Otherwise, it can be as short as possible in theory. , And converge to the equilibrium price.

There are two costs that the oracle will include, one is gas cost, and the other is hedging cost. Chainlink is used first and then verified, NEST is verified first and then used. But there are two problems with the former. The first is that it will definitely have an asymmetric node when the time comes. It will definitely encounter the problem of centralization. Once you mortgage assets, there must be a centralized object to be the executor of punishment. The second is the mismatch in the scale of downstream risk and collateral assets. It is impossible for one million dollars to support a one trillion dollars project. Even if there is no motivation for evil, downstream users will worry about the risk of evil.

Our society requires completeness. For example, the law supports “use first and then verify” (penalty) mechanism. But the blockchain cannot be handled in the traditional way. We have to verify before use, and control the risk of error before use. What is the cost of verification mechanism in NEST? After the verifier is arbitraged, he has to provide a double quote, that is, the verification cost is Beta coefficient \* two-way option (Beta=2); the cost of arbitrage is equal to gas cost + hedging cost + Beta coefficient \* two-way option.

So, what is the cost of arbitrage? After our statistics on the price deviation of NEST, we found that the cost of arbitrage is about 4/1000. This statistical arbitrage is not an absolute arbitrage, but a calculated probability of a fixed price under market price fluctuations. According to the current volatility of Ethernet, the probability of being arbitrage is about 7%. Among the 100 quotations, there are about 2–3 after the actual detection.

Congestion attacks are the first variable. The so-called congestion attack is to jam a block with transactions so that other people’s transactions cannot be packaged. The oracle needs to verify 25 blocks to prevent such attacks. The entire Ethereum community gradually becomes conscious that, whenever dust attacks and congestion attacks are initiated, miners know that you are malicious and will choose not to pack them for you. The miner’s choice of packing is an imperfect correction to the system, which is undefined in the protocol.

Secondly, the verification period and volatility determine the cost of two-way options. Any verification mechanism cannot bypass the verification cycle and volatility. When this volatility rises, the price deviation of NEST will become very large. For example, on March 2nd, it reached a volatility of three-thousandths. Three-thousandths of volatility is equivalent to forty to fifty times of A shares. Under this volatility, normal investors don’t know how to predict and control it, and they are often at a loss. At this time, the design of financial products should be based on the flow of information on the chain instead of staring at the off-chain.

In fact, the mechanism of two-way option + price chain + Beta coefficient can be used in traditional finance. It puts the smartest information traders and arbitrageurs together for pricing. If you bring the smartest people together, you don’t need so many people to participate in pricing.

The second variable is delay. The delay is reduced by the incentive mechanism in the NEST system. If the NEST price does not change, and every block quote becomes two block quotes, it means that your income has doubled. No matter how the congestion is, as long as the NEST price doesn’t fall too much, someone will quote anyhow, because the rate of return is high.

There will be a layer of risk protection when market makers quote NEST prices for trading. This risk protection can ensure that the market maker will not lose the final expected profit during the transaction. Because this price will fluctuate, and no matter how it fluctuates, market makers may be arbitraged by others. If the oracle puts this price compensation in, and doesn’t lose money when the two parties conduct long-term transactions, then both parties are suitable. If the market maker does not use this risk function for protection, the transaction price will have a large deviation and will continue to lose money until it exits.

defi,Crypto as non-cooperative game: understand DeFi’s unique value proposition,"Some of the most cited reasons as to why DeFi would disrupt the existing financial establishment are largely predicated on two premises, *permissionlessness* and *composability.*

It is true that public blockchains guarantee universal access, and because every application shares the same digital ledger, they can interact with each other to achieve 1 plus 1 is greater than 2 effects. This, however, does not mean that these same features cannot be achieved off-chain. In fact, most of the benefits that composability and permissionlessness render could be brought about if banks and monetary policymakers decided to deregulate, while taking the business out of their hands would most likely lead to regulatory backlashes.

In other words, these are things that are certainly possible but currently restrained by regulations. If blockchains truly represent a paradigm shift, then what it can bring to the world should not be something that is already possible but something that simply cannot be accomplished without it.

So what is something that crypto, and crypto only, enables?

Blockchains stipulate a shift in the relationship between market participants that was unavailable from previous technological innovations such as computers or the Internet. Blockchains, for the first time ever, turn human society from a cooperative game into a noncooperative one, i.e. people no longer need to enter a collaborative relationship in order to exchange value.

## A non-cooperative game

In a traditional market structure, participants are forced to cooperate due to information asymmetry.

What this means is that investors looking to buy stocks would, under normal circumstances, not purchase directly from the stock issuing company because they may not know the paperwork and processes involved in procuring such stocks. Instead, investors can invest through a broker, and that broker can subsequently purchase these stocks on a stock exchange for them. This process involves at least two intermediaries, namely the broker and the stock exchange — and to complete such a value exchange, investors have to trust both.

Information asymmetry is inherent in traditional finance due to siloed accounting systems and centralized, hierarchical controls. The costs of overcoming such asymmetry necessitate trust, which in turn, leads to cooperation. To maximize profits, parties involved need to collaborate, and most of the time such trust is not built overnight. During repeated conversations and collaborations, ones especially marked by great uncertainty at the initial stage, market participants can slowly understand who to trust over a long, tedious process.

This entire undertaking is lengthy, which is why a few intermediaries end up dominating the market because investors tend to prefer convenience and choose household names — if Goldman Sachs is trusted by millions of others, then I can simply trust it as well.

Blockchains do not require such cooperation, because there is no information asymmetry to begin with. On a blockchain, the information is transparent and accessible to everyone via a global ledger, which continuously updates itself to record activities across the globe.

In this new environment, participants who want to place their bids do not need to have private knowledge of which broker can route the best order or which exchange lists what assets. Instead, they are faced with a public, global competition in the form of gas fees, which can be arguably more challenging due to the inflexibility of algorithmic rules. If the rules state that up to 1MB data can be recorded on the Bitcoin chain every \~10 minutes, then to play in this game means to outcompete everyone else and become one of the transactions that take up the 1MB.

The role of an intermediary is obsolete in this case, since a broker can at most provide as much information as anyone else accessing the same blockchain. And the winning strategy for investors will no longer be finding the most trustworthy intermediary but playing by the rules so well that they can outperform others even with the same set of information.

## Decentralized Network vs. Open Finance

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mnjiab2f2e861.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57c302319b5a4f3ea613079019988cdfb5fe1f46

On the left of the spectrum are centralized financial services providers such as exchanges, lending facilities, and asset managers. What they do best is to form trusted relationships with clients during their years of existence and provide a convenient one-stop shop for people seeking financial exposure to cryptocurrencies.

On the far right are decentralized networks, which refer to blockchain projects that are designed with the non-cooperative mindset. They introduce market participants to this global competition ordered completely by algorithms and supported by community consensus.

Everything in between is Open Finance. These projects probably leverage some aspects of blockchains as an universally accessible settlement layer, hence the word “Open” in their name. Their other foot, however, is still in the old-segment cooperative games. Some examples of this last category include order book-based DEXes with matching engines running on centralized servers. DEX aggregators that run algorithms on centralized servers, or oracles, which rely on trusted nodes. What these projects have in common is that they all use designated servers/oracles to complete some parts of the transactions, which in turn rely heavily on a centralized team’s ability to execute.

Decentralized networks show very different characteristics from these Open Finance products. In the beginning, a decentralized network usually cannot be used for anything. This is because it takes a long time for these networks to build up a sufficiently stable and meaningful supply for the demand side to come in. Despite the slow progress, however, decentralized networks can grow into a very different species, and we can probably only see a vague silhouette of them at the current stage.

In comparison, Open Finance products can demonstrate strong growth from the early days because there are intermediaries stepping in to secure the supply and demand. We actually see a lot of these attempts in crypto today — some projects are able to provide high quality of services from day 1 because their teams are heavily involved in marketing and operations and introduce centralized servers.

However, this is how business is done in the previous paradigm, where it was unfathomable to have an anonymous developer building a product in which people would be willing to pour millions of dollars. In a non-cooperative economy, on the other hand, 7 billion people on the planet can collaborate and trade according to algorithmic rules without trusting each other at all. The society will operate at a much higher efficiency at a global scale.

&gt;*We often hear that we shouldn’t enforce decentralization for the sake of it and adoption is more important.* ***However, once we let centralization creep in even just to the slightest, we are back to the intermediary model from the old world.***

People’s trust in Huobi is fundamentally different from people’s trust in Bitcoin. Huobi’s trust lies in its brand, which would be diminished if it did evil things. But crypto is supposed to be the place where you cannot be evil, and a team’s willingness and capabilities to execute should have a minimum long term effect on the product it builds.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9p9bs5jh2e861.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8f137c23ec7269cef2cbc37cb4ea116dcbeea48

These distinctions between decentralized networks and Open Finance may sound vague and irrelevant for now, but will eventually have real economic consequences. For example, they will become one of the most important factors in determining a project’s valuation.

If DeFi’s only value proposition is that it moves finance from a centralized ledger to a permissionless and composable one, then it will only be valued at the same level as the tech sector. However, true Decentralized Networks do not have a valuation model yet, because the ways financial and human resources are organized around them are so novel that the market has not come up with a good way to wrap its head around it.

As such, these projects usually require VCs to be as patient and resourceful as possible. “Patient” because VCs are best positioned to support projects that genuinely belong to the new paradigm but likely struggle at the early stages with no clear path to profitability. “Resourceful” because these projects need more than fundings to grow both their products and community consensus.

We are excited to invest in projects that can truly form “on-chain closed loop,” i.e. crypto-native projects that have their entire value creation cycle on-chain without introducing any off-chain factors. Because these are projects that best exemplify what is so disruptive about blockchains, and stay true to their decentralized origin. And the first step in this right direction is to not benchmark crypto projects against products from the internet and the Wall Street worlds.

Bitcoin,Reviewing Central Bank Policy In 2020 With Fed Watch,,cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,"School Report, Banking vs Crypto.","What are your thoughts?  Wall of text incoming. Had to write a paper with a annotated sources.

&amp;#x200B;

  

In recent years research suggests that the current iteration of banking is stuck in history, it is unsanitary, and perhaps unwilling to evolve and is slowing the modernization of our world. Banking as we know it will either need to adapt or others will take its place because, in today’s society, we need the ability to access our funds at any time, be able to complete transactions within minutes and not days, and to make global transfers within minutes and not weeks while ensuring the exchange is hygienically plague free.

With recent worldwide events, we have found that the banks are not able to fully service their customer because of governmental and environmental sanctions from the Corona Virus and other contaminations that may come about. We look to the future for solutions on how to hold and spend currencies without the requirement of the proximity of fiat changing hands, or third-party establishments providing a service while taking unnecessary cuts from our wallets.  Banks let archaic computer systems run our financial communities with very little effort in maintaining the business, almost making a passive income. Some believe the solution is already here, though still in its infancy, blockchain will free us of many of these third-party providers.

To understand what blockchain is, you must first define it. Blockchain is still a relatively new technology and being innovated at a rapid pace. According to Steven Norton from the wall street journal “a blockchain is a data structure that makes it possible to create a digital ledger of transactions and share it among a distributed network of computers. It uses cryptography to allow each participant on the network to manipulate the ledger securely without the need for a central authority.” (Norton, 2016)

A ledger of transactions that is open for the world to see, yet one of the most secure networks in the world with a singular chain known as Bitcoin using a top of 146 million tera-hashes at the current time this paper was written. This is one of a hundred underlying platforms that are available to the world through blockchain. 

This is important because of how it is used for business. From the book Blockchain for Business*“*Blockchain matters because no business operates in isolation. By implementing business processes that leverage the collective knowledge of the group, processes can be orders of magnitude more cost-efficient.” ( (ARUN, 2019)) 

To simplify what was said this means that no longer will a core group of individuals control how you bank, what your business can or cannot access. It will open doors that were closed to you because of simple choices that were made in the past and over complex regulations and rules. 

For example, with the legalization of marijuana in some states, while federally it is still against the law. This provides complexities to banks, do they serve the customer, and the customers cash, or do they serve the federal government that holds the chains and regulations. At this time majority of the Banks still serve the slow to adopt federal government. 

For example, according to CNBC, in 2014, SinglePoint, a mobile app payment company, had placed Point of Sale or POS terminals in legal Medical Marijuana dispensaries. Which then the consumer could pay with their credit cards. 

“Everything was going great,” the store owner Ralston said. Then the bank decided to shut them down, with no warning, no latitude, or space for business adaptation. The reason the bank cited for such a drastic and uncompromising decision. “They didn’t want to risk it.” (Criteo, 2017)

With the examples of how and why the Banks are losing faith with people of the world this is where Blockchain will come in. It will step in and provide where the current Banking system refuses to. 

According to Banking Dive, with Covid-19, our population is currently getting comfortable with doing everything remotely, digitally, with no requirement of the bank branches. ""I think everything that's happened over (since February) or so is probably accelerating a trend that’s already happening, which is the reliance on traditional bank branches will continue to go away,"" Chime CEO Chris Britt (Criteo, 2020)

The Balance lists off many benefits to cryptocurrency that could change or replace banks, such as immutability. For example, if you are selling your used car, you want to get paid before handing over the car. The real current options are cash, wire transfers, or a cashier’s check. However, cash is dangerous and dirty, Wire transfers are labor-intensive, and cashier’s checks can be faked and can cost money to get. Instead, we could wait for a few block verifications to verify the sender and at that point there is no way for them to recall that transaction. (Pritchard, 2020)

A list of other options that the blockchain excels at while banking is slow and expensive is Money Transfers, Swipe Fees, Title Details, Smart Contracts, Reduced Fraud, and the possibility of Public Ledgers that anyone can look at and verify if they have your wallet address. 

Banking is a well-defined tradition of being slow to adapt to technology due to many different reasons. Such as: non-agile systems, the mindset of their leaders, as well as regulatory concerns. With the rapid development of technology, they have leaps and bounds to catch up. If they do not they will be left in the dust with many old “unstoppable” industries such as movie rentals, like Blockbuster.

Many new companies are ready to take their place, according to a paper at CNN, ""We believe that Bitcoin has the potential to be a more ubiquitous currency in the future,"" Square's Chief Financial Officer, Amrita Ahuja, [said in a statement](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/2020-bitcoin-investment). ""As it grows in adoption, we intend to learn and participate in a disciplined way."" (Effron, 2020)

Many companies are buying up this blockchain as a store of currency instead of leaving it in a bank for rainy days. For example, Square invested in almost 1 percent of the company’s assets in the second quarter of 2020. Which at that time went by 4,709 Bitcoins, or a price of 50 million dollars. At that time Bitcoin was worth around 8 Thousand dollars each. Today it is worth 27 Thousand Dollars per coin, tripling that bet if they have not bought anymore.

Not only wanting to hold Bitcoin, in 2018 Square expanded its Cash App to support the top cryptocurrencies, even for users without bank accounts. After the success of Cash App, it launched Square Crypto to help develop the space. (Effron, 2020))

JPMorgan believes “That more will come into the space now that the dam has been broken. With Square’s Cash App facilitating $858 Million worth of Bitcoin Purchases in Q2. We believe that millennials, or the younger cohorts of the US retail investors universe, have been using the Cash App as an alternative vehicle to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to add to their bitcoin holdings,"" said JPMorgan strategists. (Khatri 2020)

Since these opening plays, a few well-known companies have heavily dived down the Bitcoin hole. Such as: GrayScale, PayPal, MicroStrategy. Others who now will accept it such as Microsoft, Overstock, Home Depot, Starbucks, Whole Foods, New Egg. (Tuwiner, 2020)Even as everyday useable credit cards from Crypto.com and Binance.

Our currencies have gone through a few changes already, from being a gold-backed standard and then leaving it on April 20, 1933. (Richardson 2013) We have gone from Cash to Checks, to Debit and Credit cards. The new iteration of financial freedom is upon us. Allowing us greater freedoms to be our money, getting paid directly to hardware and software that we own and control, and connect with people around the world. This gives us the choice. The choice of trusting third party institutions such as Square, PayPal, and GrayScale if we desire. To make available these services on a global scale, not just those that are lucky enough to live in the first world, but anyone that has a phone/computer, power, and some sort of internet, even if it is not connected immediately. This allows us the ability to send unlimited amounts of money throughout the world for a few dollars and a few minutes. Giving us more of what is the most precious asset, time.

personalfinance,How can I refinance my Solar panel loan?,"I got solar panels on my house over a year ago and it has been great. I only have a power bill this month because I've been working from home and running my desktop computer 8 hours a day more than usual.

The issue is that I looked back at my loan and had barely paid off any of the principal. I then realized the 3.5% interest was compounded daily! I should have realized this before signing for the loan but I was dumb and missed it. 

I am trying to figure out the best way out of this situation. I called Chase Bank but they only give out loans for businesses or if you have collateral since the pandemic. Even though I've been with them for something like 15 years. I can call my mortgage company to see if I can add the solar cost but they are a bank I only chose because my company offered to pay the signing costs if I went with them. Then are online only and not amazing as my mortgage has already been sold once.

 Is there another way to get a better loan? I could sell stocks and pay off the $12k directly but with an interest rate so low (if compounded normally), I'd rather not. I also have student loans with a much higher interest rate that I am still paying off too. 

Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance

investing,Warning About Bitcoin,"This post will probably be downvoted to oblivion by all the people drinking the crypto kool aid, but I am going to share it anyways in hopes that some smart investors listen to my advice.

For the sake of this post, I will be discussing the US market but the same could be said about any country with a privately owned central banking system (aka most of the world). Also, I am going to do my best to cover topics and points at a high level so I don’t have to write a novel. This is by no means a comprehensive analysis, just a quick summary.

We are currently in a massive bubble due to the economy being artificially inflated by massive amounts of printing. Many Bitcoin investors are putting their capital into this BTC for that exact reason, as BTC is limited in supply to 21 million coins.

The problem is BTC doesn’t have any real world value. BTC will never be allowed to be accepted at retailers in the US for many reasons. The most important, however, is that the Federal Reserve would never allow another currency to compete against its own. Even if the USD is completed inflated into nothing, they will come out with their own CBDC (central bank digital currency) and back it with precious metals or their own blockchain. BTC can be taxed or regulated to discourage legitimate investors from touching the asset, or it could be outright banned leaving very few people who will to continue to keep their wealth in the coin.

As an example, let’s pretend I live in the US and I invest “Red Dollars” which is a digital currency on a blockchain. Let’s also assume this currency takes off and everyone starts to use it to buy their groceries, ect. (which isn’t possible because again it’s a digital only currency and digital transactions are controlled primarily by the credit card companies, banks, and government regulations). But for this example let’s just pretend it’s true. Are you honestly blind enough to believe the Federal Reserve would allow it’s own system of control to be replaced? Don’t be foolish. There is of course way too much volatility as well in the price for retailers to accept it.

This is the same bubble as in 2017. People back then were saying the same clickbait titles of $200,00 price predictions and X investor is buying and FOMO and lambos. (note: notice how no one is talking about it’s real world use, just how much money they can make..)

John McAfee even said he would even eat his own dick on national TV if BTC wasn’t worth $1M by 2020.

Yes the blockchain is a great idea and will be used in future innovation. Yes the only value of BTC is the hope someone will pay more for it then you did. This is known as a Ponzi scheme. There is no real world value. Proponents say it is “digital gold” and it’s a way to “store wealth”. Yes that’s possible as long as everyone continues to leave their fiat dollars invested in it and people don’t make mass withdrawals, because again, there is no real world use and there never will be.

Finally, just so we are clear, I am against the fiat system. We can make the world a lot better place by once again backing our currency with precious metals which would eliminate inflation and remove us from the debt based system we are currently in.

I have $27,000 in a standard savings account, and another $10,000 in checking, that I saved up working before going to graduate school.

I currently make $24,000/yr, expected to continue for the next 3-4 years. My rent ($1000/mo, and it will only go up), utilities, and other fixed expenses leave me with a small net positive saved each month, but maybe only $100-300. 

I have \~$26,000 in federal student loans, with about $7k unsubsidized, at an interest rate of \~6.5%, and the remainder in subsidized loans at a rate of \~4.5-5% on average. My loans are currently in forbearance due to grad school (and of course additionally due to Covid). Before Grad School, I was paying $430/month on student loans.

I have \*zero\* retirement savings. I drive a 20 year old car that may need replacing in the next 3-5 years.

I know I shouldn't have my money sitting in a savings account, losing value, and I know I should probably pay off at least the unsubsidized portion of my loans, because a 6.5% interest rate is larger than any expected return on investment....However, I'm perhaps stupidly at this point, holding out hope that Federal Student Loan forgiveness is passed in some capacity (I had full Pell Grant throughout college, making me likely qualified in the event that some form of forgiveness is passed).

So let's say that I hold out hope, or maybe I pay off the $7k unsubsidized...that leaves with with $10k in checking, and $20k in standard savings. What should I do with the 20k? 

1. Should I open an IRA and contribute some fixed amount?
2. Should I front load the IRA with something like $10,000?
3. Or should I open an IRA and make fixed contributions, but put 10-15k in a high yield savings account instead of the IRA? What are the pros/cons of this approach?

I don't know much at all about what the best options for saving are. I sincerely fear an economic collapse, and I don't know enough about how that would affect an IRA, if I could lose all of my savings, while retaining my student debt....which is why I sometimes consider just paying the entire $26,000 in loans, so that in the event of an economic catastrophe, I will at least be debt free, with $10k on hand.

Any advice at all is appreciated. Thanks!",finance

XRP,"Fact Checking Claims About XRP, Ripple and the SEC lawsuit","There’s been a lot of misinformation floating around social media (namely Twitter and Reddit) about XRP and Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit. I’ve posted a lot of this information in various replies in this subreddit but I thought it would be helpful to bring it all together for those people looking for clarity on a lot of the claims out there fueling fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). I’m going to keep the points about XRP and Ripple. I’m not going to address the claims against Chris Larsen or Brad Garlinghouse because whether those two are slapped with fines for price manipulation it doesn’t really matter for the rest of us. Alright, let’s fact check some FUD claims!

**FUD Claim #1: Ripple will run out of money without being able to sell their XRP**

This is a good example of why not to trust some random dude on Twitter. The short of it is that there's no chance their funds will dry up anytime soon.

Ripple would've known that not settling would stop them from selling XRP, at least in the US. If they knew their coffers would dry up they would've settled rather than geared up for a pricey, years long battle with the SEC.

Ripple has serious venture capital money. [Many loaded companies and people](https://ripple.com/company/) are invested in Ripple (e.g., SBI, Santander). Their funds aren't drying up anytime soon.

A hefty portion of their business currently involves selling enterprise software to businesses and FIs. This includes those [300+ customers of Ripplenet](https://itsblockchain.com/ripple-partners/), whether or not they're using ODL.

[They recently stopped programmatic sales for periods of time and even bought back some XRP](https://ripple.com/insights/q3-2020-xrp-markets-report/). [They also donated tens of millions to charity in recent years](https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/03/28/ripple-donates-29-million-xrp-american-public-school/). I can’t imagine a scenario where they would do so without swimming in cash. 

So no. They almost certainly don't *need* to sell XRP to stay afloat. They have a giant war chest. This is an absolute non-issue IMO.

**FUD Claim #2: SEC can’t lose—they have an airtight case and a 95% conviction rate after all.**

First, the conviction rate: after some searching I only found a source citing a [90–95% conviction rate for the Department of Justice](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/18/09/12377579/gordon-johnson-with-90-95-conviction-rate-the-dojs-tesl) (DOJ), which is independent from the SEC. If someone has the number for the SEC, please share it and a source below.

Second, the filing is an anomaly for several reasons.

1. [The former chair of the SEC, Joseph Grundfest, has criticized the suit](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/89164/former-sec-commissioner-says-ripple-lawsuit-will-cause-multi-billion-dollar-losses-to-innocent-third-parties). I’ll share some key parts of the very good article about it:

&gt;In a letter to Clayton obtained by The Block, former SEC commissioner [Joseph Grundfest](https://law.stanford.edu/directory/joseph-a-grundfest/) said: ""no pressing reason compels immediate enforcement action."" \[...\]""The views of a soon-incoming Administration and Congress as to the regulation of transactions similar to those at issue can differ substantially from current perspectives,"" Grundfest wrote. \[...\]""I am aware of no instance in which the simple announcement of a Commission enforcement proceeding has, absent allegations of fraud, misrepresentation, or omission, caused multi-billion-dollar losses to innocent third parties. Creating precedent, and imposing losses, of this sort raises public policy concerns that would benefit from the views of an incoming administration.""

Note: in the past week or so, [the SEC Chair, six Division Directors, the SEC’s Chief Economist, and the General Counsel have all left](https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1343973275018403841).

For what it’s worth, Jay Clayton leaves for [a highly desirable post as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/06/27/jay-clayton-sec-sdny/), for which he has been criticized as unqualified, with some suggesting there may be a “political objective” behind the move. This has lead some to speculate that Ripple’s and Brad’s support for Biden and Harris as well as their criticism of Trump may have motivated the lawsuit against Ripple. But, I won’t delve into that any further.

\[Continuing on with the Grundfest letter...\]

&gt;He went on to say that XRP and ether should be subject to the same treatment given that the agency has not illustrated a ""material distinction between the operation of Ether and of XRP that is relevant to the application of the federal securities laws.""""Imposing securities law obligations on XRP while leaving Ether untouched raises fundamental fairness questions about the exercise of Commission discretion.""

In short, Grundfest believes the filing (a) wasn’t substantiated, (b) was untimely, and (c) unfairly disadvantages XRP relative to ETH and other cryptocurrencies... his arguments are exactly what we’ve heard from Ripple.

For what it’s worth, Grundfest isn’t some salty Democrat—he was appointed to the SEC by Reagan—or seem to have a personal vendetta against Jay Clayton—here’s [a video of an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJsUryEHXUw&amp;ab_channel=stanfordlawschool) they did together in April.

2) The SEC’s claim that XRP is a security contradicts the claims of other branches of the U.S. government that it is a currency. In 2015, those departments struck a settlement deal with Ripple for failing to implement necessary currency controls including anti-money laundering (AML) protocols. [In the DOJ’s own words](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/ripple-labs-inc-resolves-criminal-investigation) (emphasis added):

&gt;The agreement will resolve allegations that Ripple and its subsidiary failed to follow the law while engaging in the exchange of **virtual currency** and that the entities failed to establish and maintain an appropriate anti-money laundering program.Ripple Labs Inc. is headquartered in San Francisco, California, and developed and sold **virtual currency known as “XRP.”** As of 2015, the currency of the Ripple network, XRP, is the second-largest **digital currency** by market capitalization.The agreement formalizes the steps Ripple and its subsidiary must take to bring its **virtual currency** operation within the existing regulatory framework for **money services businesses**.

So now, it’s worth asking yourself: how can the government treat XRP as both a currency *and* a security? Pair that with the SEC’s suggestions that BTC and ETH are *not* securities.

3) XRP has been declared a currency by the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Japan, Singapore, UAE and others. [Here’s what the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority had to say about it](https://tokenist.com/uk-financial-conduct-authority-fca-does-not-consider-ripples-xrp-to-be-a-security/):

&gt;“Tokens may have mixed features that may overlap with the above categories, or change over time. For example, Ether can be used as a means of ‘payment’ (exchange token) on the Ethereum platform, and can also be used to run applications (utility token). XRP has similar features.”

So if you’re keeping track: The former chair of the SEC disagrees with it’s decision to file this case, which also runs in opposition to the DOJ’s viewpoint about XRP being a currency—a perspective supported by several G20 countries and one not opposed by any other.

**FUD Claim # 3: XRP Can’t Survive with US exchanges delisting XRP**

Let’s be clear: some US exchanges aren’t *delisting* XRP, they’re halting trading. Moreover, about 90% of XRP trading volume happens outside of US exchanges. And some exchanges may keep trading going after all, [as Uphold has confirmed](https://twitter.com/JpThieriot/status/1344294953833402368). (I highly recommend reading the CEO’s tweet thread on this, it was a masterpiece.) So US trading may decline, but those who want to trade XRP can still do it through Uphold.

**FUD Claim #4: Vitalik said XRP is a shitcoin, so he must be right**

Vitalik—the centralized God of decentralization—had some choice words about XRP after Brad echoed the idea about China being able to control BTC and ETH. I’m not going to get into an argument about hash rate or how independent Chinese miners are, but if you think Brad’s claims are purely unsubstantiated, [consider this](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-intelligence-chief-raises-concerns-with-sec-over-chinas-crypto-dominance%3A-report-2020):

&gt;According to the [Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-spy-chief-seeks-sec-scrutiny-of-chinese-dominance-in-cryptocurrency) on Tuesday, John Ratcliffe wrote to SEC Chairman Jay Clayton earlier in November in an effort to push the agency to bring in rules that would allow U.S. businesses to be more competitive.Ratcliffe is said to have raised the fact that over half of the global cryptocurrency mining power is based in China, and that the People’s Bank of China is already developing its national digital currency.Ratcliffe is also said to have attached a copy of a letter sent Clayton by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) in the summer stating the need for “clearer articulation of policy” and formal guidance on digital currencies.

This report seems to suggest two things: (1) US Intelligence services are concerned with China’s control over BTC and ETH, (2) SEC needs to develop guidelines to not disadvantage domestic crypto projects. This is simply what Brad has been saying all along...

All this is to say that there’s some impetus to take a closer look at BTC and ETH from a regulatory perspective and concern that China may possess undue control over those cryptos. These are not ideas someone like Vitalik wants attention drawn to, hence his lashing out at XRP. If he really believed it was a shitcoin, he’d like have said it anytime over the last several years. He did it out of defensiveness and anger. Don’t take that as an objective, cerebral analysis. He’s simply trying to defend his own interests.

**FUD Claim #5:** **This is way worse than Block.One... Ripple had an** ***ongoing*** **ICO**

This FUD claim seems very desperate to me. To put things in perspective, the SEC is accusing Ripple of selling **$1.3 billion worth of security tokens over seven years** while communicating with the SEC about their actions. By contrast, [Block.One sold $4.1 billion over one year through an ICO](https://www.coindesk.com/eos-maker-block-one-settles-with-sec-over-unregistered-securities-sale). Some others have said “Ripple’s situation is worse because they’re going to court,” which is an awful argument. Ripple is going to court *by choice* because they feel confident enough in winning the case. I don’t think Block.One had a case to defend, they had no choice but to settle. Ripple has been asking regulators for regulatory clarity, [even quite publicly](https://ripple.com/insights/open-letter-to-congress/), for years. And, as I’ve outlined, there’s a pretty strong precedent for XRP to not be considered a security. They’re in a much better position to defend their case than Block.One was.

For what it’s worth, Block.One settled and paid a $24 million dollar fine and today EOS is listed on pretty every major exchange.

**Conclusions**

I hope this helps some people take stock of the situation regarding the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple and alleviate some uncertainty and anxiety. There has been a lot of horseshit information floating around about Ripple and XRP and I hope this clears the air for a lot of those people genuinely trying to evaluate the situation. If you’re a troll just looking for an argument, go fuck yourself, I’ve spent enough of my day putting this post together.

To me, there are a lot of reasons to be optimistic about a favorable long-term outcome with XRP being deemed not a security and that XRP can weather the storm, if not return to normal in the foreseeable future. But, you must do your own research when evaluating this situation, which is why I’ve tried to include a healthy number of sources supporting my points.

To anyone feeling uncertain during this time: don’t make financial decisions based on what some random Twitter or Reddit idiot says. There are a lot of people speaking with great confidence but little knowledge about XRP and Ripple. For example, I saw one moron declaring that XRP is “definitely” going to $.06. I can’t promise that it won’t, but anyone speaking with such great confidence and no comment history to back up even a most basic knowledge of technical or fundamental analysis isn’t worth listening to. (If you want technical analysis and have no one to get it from, I myself follow our very own [Haraldo](https://twitter.com/haraldoxrp) (aka Harry) and [Credible Crypto](https://twitter.com/crediblecrypto)... simply suggestions for interesting viewpoints IMO) .

If anyone has additionally valuable information to add (e.g., stats on SEC conviction rate, another FUD busting point) please comment below and I’ll try to update the post when I can. All the best!

Bitcoin,Loan with BTC as collateral?,"Serious replies.

Context:I am a OG Hodler, class of 2012/2013 ish. I was fortunate enough to almost perfectly time the market back in 2017 and cashed out part of my BTC but had to pay significant capital gain taxes. Back in 2017, BTC ""universe"" was far different that it is today.

Since I am a qualified investor and considered wealthy by my bank (+ they know I have significant BTC holdings), is there an actual way to take loans with BTC as collaterals instead of selling and thus paying \~25%\* capital gain taxes.

I've looked into BlockFy but their limit + interest rates are not competitive at all.

computing,Best Graphical Computer User Interface,"I am hoping this is the right place to put this, as it isn't aligned with any particular architecture or OS.

What do people think is the 'Best' Graphical Computer User Interface?

'Best' would mean most efficient (least mouse/key strokes), most intuitive (i.e. not just a blank screen), 

There seem to be, at the moment, three major streams --

* Gnome-based (i.e. Ubuntu, Fedora)
* Windows based (i.e. Windows 7/10 (obviously), Linux Mint, Ubuntu Mate, KDE)
* macOS based (i.e. macOS, Elementary OS, Budgie)

I have used many, many different operating systems, many command-line based, many GUI based. Over the last three decades, I have used versions of Windows, Linux and macOS. 

Right now, I am leaning towards a macOS style system, with a dock along the bottom, a relatively clean desktop with a few icons for Home, PC, etc, a menubar across the top and one point to click for the rest of the Apps. I find that I can install Mate and/or Cinnamon and then configure it to look like this relatively easily if I install Plank, Docky or Cairo.

The reason I favour this is that it allows me access to my most used apps with only one click (on the dock), while other apps and configuration is only two or three clicks away at most.

 I think the most insightful responses will come from people who have used a number of different OSs and their UIs. If you have only ever used one system (i.e. Gnome or macOS or Windows 7/10), I don't think you will have the breadth of experience to give a useful response.

personalfinance,Advice on student loan refinancing while in graduate school,"Hi all! I'm wondering if anyone knows of a way that I can refinance my personal student loans while I'm in grad school?

I'm currently in a Masters program, and probably will be for about another year and a half. Needless to say I have quite a few separate loans from my Bachelor's degree; each with various but equally high APR.

I tried a few months ago to refinance them through a particular bank that was going to give me a generous APR, but even after stipulating initially that I was still in school, getting a Masters degree, they later down the line claimed I was ineligible because of this.

I have my loans cosigned with my parents and my father was offering to fully take on the loans in his name so I can take advantage of the lower interest rate. I have little doubt that, in my current field, that once I'm done with my education I'll be able to pay them and him back, but I still hate to see it happen.

Any advice for moving forward?",finance
personalfinance,Should I cash a savings bond?,"My grandfather gave me a $5000 I-Series savings bond in 2000. It’s worth roughly $16,200 right now with an interest rate of 4.6%. 

I haven’t had a job this whole year, graduated with a BA in June and have been using my savings and some money from parents to pay rent and food while I’ve been looking for a job. I haven’t found one yet, and am still looking. My unemployment requests were denied and I was not eligible for the previous stimulus check and if the new one passes I won’t be eligible for it either.

The past month and this coming one my partner who I live with has paid my part of the rent, she has a good job but also has loans she needs to pay off and has been using all of her paychecks to cover our living expenses. My parents have been able to help me since their unemployment ran out in November. 

I have a credit card that has been pretty much maxed out that I’ve been making the minimums on for almost this whole year.

My plan was to cash this savings bond, take 6,000 of it to pay off my credit card and then keep the remaining to pay for my portion of living expenses for the next few months until I hopefully find a job to start living off of. With the remaining I was planning on putting it into a automated investing account - I had about 1.5k in a Sofi one in the past and I saw it was making pretty good returns. I also thought that since it’s an investing account I can take more out in the future if I need to help cover more expenses. 

Is this a smart move? I don’t know a whole lot about automated investing accounts. I also think that the interest rate on my loan is pretty high, much higher than ones issued nowadays. But it is an I series bond so it fluctuates. An estimation I saw was that at maturity in 2030 it would be worth $26,000. Should I hold onto the bond and let it accrue interest until maturity whole trying to find any other way to pay the bills? 

Any help or advice is appreciated in this, I hope everyone is staying safe and has a very happy holiday season. Thank you all in advance",finance

Let's say my interest rate is 10.8%, so everyday it is 0.03%. Fidelity/IBKR will charge me $3 everyday. after day one, I owe them $10003; after two days, do I owe them $10006 (simple interest) or $10006.009 (compounding)? 


Is my cash balance -$11080 after a year? ($10k principal + $1080 interest, simple interest, no compounding)


Is my cash balance -$12160 after two years? but if it's compounding yearly, it would be negative $12276.64 (==$11080*1.108).

CryptoCurrency,"As a US resident, I just got the notification from Binance that I have 2 weeks to withdraw funds before account is locked","So as the title says I got the notification when I logged into binance yesterday.

binance image link: https://imgur.com/KwREjFs

Granted I always use a vpn when surfing the web, I believe the way they were able to obviously tell I was a US resident is back in 2017 when I did KYC.

So I have a few questions:

A) I wanted to know if I make a new Binance account and **dont** do KYC and assuming I use a VPN set to be in a country that can legally use the complete (non US) version of Binance, what is the risk Im looking at with Binance finding out that Im spoofing my location with a VPN. And in the event that they do find out Im using a vpn, will my account be locked and funds seized permanently?

And I actually went ahead and made a non-KYC binance account with a vpn, and after depositing a small amount of btc, I was able to successfully trade. I just am a bit hesitant to move a large amount of funds there to trade in case after awhile they lock my account.



B) I just made an account on FTX, while using a vpn of course (nordVPN to be exact) and then deposited a small amount of btc but when I went to place my order, FTX said I couldnt trade since I was a US resident. This is especially odd because when I was browsing FTX settings, I clicked on the kyc just to see what it would say, and I noticed that it auto-populated the ""country of residency"" field as Sweden (which is the country that I chose my vpn to reflect)

here is the image of what Im talking about: https://imgur.com/p1izntD

How is it even possible that the vpn spoofed my location successfully so FTX thought my country of residence was Sweden in the kyc form, but when I attempted to actually execute a trade it could all of a sudden tell that I was from a ""prohibited jurisdiction""??


image link of what Im talking about: https://imgur.com/ELHqRx1

Im surprised how FTX was able to detect that I was using a VPN, while Binance wasnt able to detect it. Is there any workaround to this since it seems like vpns dont work on FTX?

What are the latest market movements in the auto industry? Pot get legalized in Mexico while FuboTv Plunges yet again. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning!

First of all, I wanted to wish everyone a happy new year and hopefully things get better in 2021, and this also brings us at least the great returns that we had in 2020 in the stock market!

So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes finish the last full trading day of the year in the green, with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/0cvjjHN) leading the way, up .24% and closing at a new record high, while both the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/QFyd2f6) and the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/B67fT1g) were up just over .1% for the day.

We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/b6Nqf9Z) barely drop yesterday closing just below 23, and with the Georgia runoff election just days away, we can see this going higher if the Democrats win both seats.

We saw almost 70% of the companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/g9CHK9Q) with most of them trading way below average volume as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/LzXDF2P) finished in the green, with Energy &amp; Materials closing the day up more than 1.3% while the biggest loser was the Communications sector, falling almost 0.7%, as we saw the small-cap stocks regain some momentum, [leading](https://ibb.co/yQCFtTZ) the way after they had 2 very bad days to start the week, while the only group that was losing ground yesterday was the large-cap growth sector.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/x5bN7Lk) from yesterday that pretty much sums up the other charts as we can see most big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and even Apple losing ground for the day, while the biggest gainers were companies like Tesla &amp; TSM alongside the industrial sector and companies like Disney and Mastercard.

Yesterday we also got the investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/7QPXjPV), which for me personally came in pretty mixed, as I use this as a contrarian indicator. This last week we saw 2.5% more investors moving to the bull’s camp, while we also saw almost a 5% increase in bears, as investors become more divided. I think the market is still a little to over bullish and I would avoid to add more money right now, but I wouldn’t get of the stock market either. I think this is a good moment to stay put and wait for more developments overall, but there might still be some good opportunities around in the market and I wouldn’t avoid getting into those.

We also got a lot of economic data yesterday, with a survey for business uncertainty for [December](https://ibb.co/87FMyQ6) showing increasing uncertainty for sales growth but a with a small decline in employment growth expectations.

Meanwhile another number that confirms the investor sentiment survey is the Investor Confidence [Index](https://ibb.co/5952C9Z) which rose by more than 13 points in November, as investors increased the risk appetite for their portfolios.

Alongside this we also saw the November pending home [SALES](https://ibb.co/F8WBXnh) decrease by more than 2.5% month over month, but are still up more than 16% since a year ago, with this monthly decrease mostly coming due to the shortage of inventory.

The Chicago [PMI](https://ibb.co/QF40My3) also came in way better than expected and 59.5 vs 57 expected and up from the 58.2 in the previous month with the biggest movement coming from the employment indicator as it rose to a one year high but is still in contraction territory since 2019.

We also saw the wholesale [inventories](https://ibb.co/fkWmNmc) decrease in November’s advance read while the [retail](https://ibb.co/BBKNrb5) inventories saw an increase of .7%, pretty much in-line with expectations while the trade [balance](https://ibb.co/CKSR070) also saw a surprise decline in the deficit to more than of $84B, $4B worse than the last revision.

[Today](https://ibb.co/D14JGZc) we get initial and continuing jobless claims numbers, alongside the money supply and the FED Balance sheet to end us off for the year.

In some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/GkZgGM1), we saw Fubo sink more than 14% again yesterday after another investing firm announced they have shorted the stock, pointing to the insane valuations of more than $13.000/subscriber.

We also saw a [research](https://ibb.co/QMF5fnG) that indicated some changes in the market share of car companies with Hyundai/Kia having the biggest gains alongside GM, while Nissan saw the biggest decline in market share, mostly due to selling larger &amp; pricier SUVs with cars continuing to see a decline in sales, while the larger vehicles have started to rebound slightly, as all car makers are [bringing](https://ibb.co/kJGkXtz) more &amp; more SUVs and Trucks to the market.

Lockheed Martin also was [awarded](https://ibb.co/bWS5G6j) a new Navy contract worth more than $900M as this might help the company start to get back on track while Mexico will become the world largest legal cannabis market as the Mexican Senate passed a bill in November which is [expected](https://ibb.co/VW3Lqtn) to receive approval in the lower house by February. This is great news for companies in the sector like ACB, Canopy Growth and the future merged company Tilray &amp; Aphria.

Also, one of the biggest active ETFs with over $15B in assets, the [ARK](https://ibb.co/80WJFdW) Innovation ETF saw it’s first daily withdrawal since November, as this hasn’t experienced weekly outflows since early in 2020, this might have been driven by profit taking as this ETF has surged more than 140% this year and also just the ex-dividend date on the 29th, as people expect for the ETF to have a hard time in duplicating the results of this year, which saw it rise on the back of Tesla and Roku with both of them seeing massive increases, with Tesla having more than 7x-ing this year, as that is the biggest holding in the ETF, but who knows we have to wait and see as [TESLA](https://ibb.co/ZzGQgqX) may hit 500K deliveries this year.

And one last piece of [news](https://ibb.co/9bQhB4B) is that Apple did a big purge in their App Store, removing almost 40K game apps as this was the deadline for the developers to submit a government issued license number that enabled users to make in-app purchases. I don’t really think this will have a major impact for the revenues but we will soon find out.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mvv7tjX) seem to be pointing at a mixed open, with the Nasdaq and the SP500 pointing at a good open while the Dow is slightly down, and with no connection to this, in the UK, the [BREXIT](https://ibb.co/Rh1DYyG) chapter is finally about to close.

personalfinance,Refinancing a loan,"Hello everyone

I bought a used car with a ~5 percent interest rate about 6 months ago and it is on a 5 year payment plan. (Haven’t missed a payment)

My credit score is about to increase a from low 700s to 730-740 in the next 2 months.

personalfinance,Questions about the APTC tax credit and my situation. Please help me understand this completely. Super confused??,"So, i desperately need health insurance and i called an insurance broker to help me figure it out.

Here's my information so there's no confusion. I'm 27, and live with my family. In the state of florida. They currently support me. For arguments sake and so i can get insurance i was planning on them NOT claiming me as a dependant.  I know it gets more complicated then that. Also, they're both on social security for being elderly and each get around 1k a month. I currently am unemployed living with them making zero dollars.

HOWEVER i pPLAN to get a job and make money. The broker told me i should put around 13500(and she did put this and got me insurance and a tax credit under this) so i would be eligible for a good credit. If i end up making more, then i'll owe money back. I asked her if i should purposely try to make less for that year. She said no, because regardless i'll be making plenty more and the difference won't be massive (so for example if i have the opportunity to make 20k or end up making 20k i can just ""amend"" my application i guess and then owe the difference on taxes or something?)

Here's where i'm confused. These amounts, the 13k a year being eligible for a tax credit, what are the exact amounts and cutoffs? I originally put that i'd expect to make ZERO dollars and the application said i wasn't eligible for an APTC tax credit i guess? Why? I Thought it was based off how much below the federal poverty line you were. Isn't zero dollars way below? Is there a minimum amount you have to make a year to be eligible for a credit? If so, what is it?

Also, if i end up not getting a job and make zero dollars that means i'll owe EVERYTHING back? Will this just be constantly taken out of my income taxes every year or will it be taken out of my paycheck? Or do they only do that if it exceeds a certain amount? If i don't get a job and make zero and then owe it can i still apply the next year and do the same thing and if i don't get a job still just owe the thousands for that and it'll just very slowly be taken out of my income taxes over tens of years? Or what?

Also are these incomes GROSS and does that mean my amount on my checks before any taxes taken out? So if she put 13200 on my application expected that would mean before any taxes are taken out? And also, is this EXPECTED income for 2021? So i'm telling the goverment or healthcare. gov website that i'll be expecting to make that much?

Lastly, when i do my taxes, i'm assuming it'll be in 2022 for the year of 2021 (this coming year.correct?) (i also use turbotax, free edition) on what part of the application in turbotax will it ask about this insurance thing? How will it be worded? Will it straight up say did you apply for insurance on the marketplace and get a tax credit? I don't want to miss that part on my application as this is the first time i'll be doing this.

EDIT- ALSO, if i put self employed and do ""craigslist gig work"" to make the money, and i put this on my tax return, is that still considered self employed? Since it's not uber where they make you do a (what's it called 1095? the gig worker tax form) if i don't do tax forms and can't show proof i made that money, would i be screwed? If i was paid cash for my work it's still work and i can still pay my taxes on the money i made on my return right? The agent i spoke to told me (the one who signed me up) that if i didn't find a job i can put self employed and just make the money through craigslist.

Many thanks!

P.S- not asking for advice on fraud, just curious because i don't understand how this works as nothing explains it. I didn't lie on my application as i do predict i'll get a job and make that much. But i am curious what happens if i don't, or can't, because of covid. So not fraud advice or asking for that.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also confused on the ""good faith"" exception and what this means in regards to insurance. So if i guess i'll make 13k in a year in good faith and TRY to get a job but only make 5k in 2021 due to covid, then i DON'T have to pay back the tax credit, right,..?",finance
personalfinance,Start saving for my 6MO son - What would be the best way?,"Since Christmas has just pasted my 6 month old son has generously received a couple of checks from the rest of the family. This has sparked a fire under me that I really need to set up a proper savings for him. Here is what has been going through my mind so far:

-The easy way would be just to open a Savings Account under his name but the interest rates are basically nothing.

-CDs are an option but not sure if they are still worth it in today's market. Also if I decide to put away money every month for him, having that money just sit in a savings account and waiting to open another CD seems tedious and not efficient. 

-529 Index Fund is an idea but I want him to have a the freedom to use the money saved up to buy his first car like my father did for me. Would the penalty for not using the funds for education be worth it?

-Dividend Stocks are on the top of the list of possibilities but not sure if it's the right move.

I am probably missing other good investing ideas for him or maybe I am just overthinking this? Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated!

EDIT: Thank you all for responding and giving me your examples of what you have done with your kids! It seems investing in a low cost index fund is the way to go with the amount of years his money will sit in there and without it being locked into education.",finance

Due to the fact that all the cards carry a high balance what timeframe would be ideal to pay the balence. I tend to hear after the statement date but before the due date which will allow the payment to reflect on credit history without incurring additional interest for that paid off amount but I'm not 100% sure because my last method was just to throw a little over the minimum (+50 a month) at each card but that's not working in the slightest.",finance

Bitcoin,How do you think the US government will fight bitcoin?,"I don't know how many of you are aware of it, but former FED chairman Bernanke spoke positively about Bitcoin several years ago, but I believe he did that as he was trying to pop the bubble in the metals market. A Representative has spoken in the House about ""nipping this in the bud"" about bitcoin, I think it was about two years ago. I believe Trump doesn't like Bitcoin, perhaps because he was told not to, or just because he's older and doesn't understand it. I think the attack on XRP was actually an attempt to attack Bitcoin- which obviously failed spectacularly. Now there is word there are further regulations about transferring amounts over 3 thousand USD and 10k triggering tax reports. 

Companies might just ban Americans from using their wallets or services to buy bitcoin, so I'm not trying to create fear obviously even if I could it wouldn't affect the price.. But I am curious if there is anyone willing to get in depth about this. Obviously Americans getting shut out would be a headwind for bitcoin. Currently, everything is just annoying, since I believe most Americans holding it are either small investors holding it for gain rather than looking to use it to buy a car or large institutions who can easily deal with the red tape. In the short run the Democrats taking power might be more favorable to BTC but in the long run they all take their marching orders from the same people. 

It is believed by many that the US has toppled governments to keep the US dollar standard, a former FED chair Paul Volker admitted that the US would intervene in the gold market along with friendly countries when making financial moves which could be seen as weakening the dollar. They certainly could lose, but I doubt the old guard will take this lying down, and I don't believe what is in the works right now is anything but an irritant. If the market cap of BTC goes from nearly 500 billion into the trillions, then it starts to go from something they laughed at to a legitimate threat (the gold market is worth 12 trillion for reference). I would expect serious measures to be taken to stop that. What I can't imagine is the US trying to ban ownership of bitcoin, especially not now at a time when it is at all time highs. It would seem too cynical and just anti-tech. Plus it isn't a threat to them....yet..... What do you expect them to do?",cryptocurrency

My interest rate is currently 4.88% with.

**COVID-19 Modification 2.75% interest 360 months (My payments would be $50 LOWER per month)**

Would taking either of these have some sort of negative effect on my credit score, or financial life in general? The lower interest rate seems suspiciously good, and if there are no negative effects besides a longer loan term, that feels like the obvious choice.

I could borrow enough from family with no additional interest for a lump sum payment if that's the best option. However, I'm trying to start a freelancing career, and using that money to stay solvent long enough for me to get my feet on the ground would be preferable.

Everyone is different and need to decide which strategy suits their risk tolerance the best.
As a young investor my goal is to maximise growth, having an ultra concentrated strategy has by fair been the better for growth for me by far this year. Diversification leads to average returns, it seems in this crazy market anyway

I hold only TSLA 45%, TTCF 25%, AMD 15%, NIO 5%,
5% cash

However TSLA has grown so much, surely will need to take some profit eventually. AMD has been more stable but all growth stocks seems to be majorly overvalued.

The general consensus is bullish for 2021, low interest rates, more QE potentially as the fed said they’re continue to use all tools within their means. Is anyone worried about next year? Or which signs are you looking out for in the market in case there’s a crash?
Potential hike in interest rates could be the catalyst for a crash?

I know UTMA/UGMAs are often recommended, but I want to see if my strategy is ok too.  I'm smart enough with money, but not super smart with investment terms.

My daughter is 1.5, her dad and I are unmarried but make a combined $150k or so. We have very little debt other than a mortgage, savings are ok, retirement is ok. She is and will be an only child. We're in our mid-30s. We don't want to do a 529 because quite frankly we don't know what college will look like in 17 years or if she'll want any sort of higher ed, and don't want to lose money in a 529 if that's the case.

So my thought is taking about $4000 and investing it in the following Vanguard ETFs:

40% BND

30% VTI

24% VXUS

6% VNQ

And then more or less letting it sit there, adding birthday/holiday money to it as needed.  Then when she's 18 she can use this money as she needs. Can her dad and I open a joint account in our names? Should we open one in her name? Is there a better option that can be ELI5? She won't qualify for federal aid/FAFSA assuming our incomes do not drastically decrease, so we're not really worried about impacts there.",finance

investing,2021 Market Outlook,"Hello investors, hope you all had great holidays!

It's been awhile since I last posted one due to a project at my full-time job. I've made it my new year's resolution to continue improving this forum to be more informative and helpful for everyone so please feel free to leave any feedbacks!

As we enter the new year, I believe it is important to keep things in a broader perspective. That means we need to keep a bigger picture of where we are now and where we are heading, per the Mosaic theory as I mentioned previously in #2 of this post.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/ju7zbi/investing\_philosophy\_plz\_read\_this/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=ios\_app&amp;utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/ju7zbi/investing_philosophy_plz_read_this/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

As Howard Marks states in his book ""Mastering the Market Cycle: Getting the Odds on Your Side"", if we can understand where we are in the broader market cycle, we can position ourselves in better odds to win.

After all, our goal is to invest for the best risk/reward scenarios, whether it means buying stocks, purchase a house, shorting treasuries, or doing a combination of different things. As long as we take care of the downside, the upside will take care of itself.

That is why it is critical to understand what's going on around us right now.

Below are some headlines and graphs that will put things into perspective.

(Images are not allowed here so please check the original post if you're interested in the graphs)

Corporate profits improving

📷

Negative correlation between debt amounts and corporate yield, either corporate yield has to go up (which means corporate spread widening, or a correction/recession) or the amount of debt has to come down. I believe that it is more likely that the corporate spread will go up as it is much likely for companies to face distress than for them to reduce the amount of leverage in a short period of time.

Please note this post about how I argued it's more likely for the corporate spread to widen than to narrow.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/k53sd5/market\_commentary\_headed\_for\_another\_december/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/k53sd5/market_commentary_headed_for_another_december/)

Large volumes of IG corporate bond issuance

Large volumes of HY corporate bond issuance

Relatively tight IG spreads

Relatively tight HY spreads

Low corporate yield

📷

Rising amount of companies with covenant-lite loans. Higher amount of CLOs (collateralized loan obligations), which are similar to the collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) seen in 2008. For now, it seems to me that they're bundling a bunch of cov-lite and distressed loans into tranches and selling them to raise money. Don't focus on this too much if you are not familiar with the security but keep this in mind for later.

Not surprisingly, energy, cyclicals, and transportations are all struggling compared to the strengths in the tech sector.

Higher leverage globally and in US

Investors using record amount of margins to invest.

Stocks close record high

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

Based on the preceding information, it is pretty clear to see that we have the following list of observations.

1. More debt, including both IG and HY, are being issued across all sectors, all countries, and all types of institutions, even at the individual levels.
2. Corporate spreads are compressed, for that matter all rates including munis, ABS, CLOs, loans, and short-term rates (don't get hung up on any unfamiliar names or security types, as the point is that we are seeing both record amounts of leverage when the yields are at the lowest point. Normally, they go the opposite directions).
3. Risk assets (stocks, real estate, loans, bitcoin?) are trending up.
4. Economic conditions are improving as indicated by rising corporate profits.

This is all happening when COVID cases and deaths are surging to record highs and a lot of the countries have imposed restrictions.

If you were asked in April when the US was just going into a lockdown phase where we would be in late 2020, would you have guessed all of it? Specifically the point about surging COVID cases and deaths in conjunction with a record-high stock market and tight corporate spreads? Personally, I am amazed at all of these as they mostly defy the traditional econ 101 or finance 101 schools of thought. Remember all those PhD economists, market forecasters, and investors arguing for the worst stock market, crazy levels of inflation, and rising bond yields? They all got it wrong. How?

This leads me to the topic for today's post.

While the markets have surprised everyone, the list of observations isn't actually all that surprising considering the magnitude of the monetary and fiscal policies.

We have seen an unprecedented (probably the most used word in 2020) amount of actions from both the Fed and the gov't.

Source: https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2020-11/56746-MBR.pdf

Just these two graphs show the extent of the stimulus provided to the country.

Most of you are probably familiar with the story up until this point, as they have been mentioned numerous times in news articles.

The next part is where I think it will get a bit interesting.

**My personal opinion on stocks is that we will see a broader market rally for the long term (2-5 years) with a few corrections in between.**

It is the Fed that usually causes a recession or a depression even.

📷

If you look closely, most, if not all, recessions were just after when the Fed raised rates. Obviously controlling the rates is not the only maneuver that the Fed pulled over the years but it does indicate the Fed's willingness to turn hawkish (raising rates and tightening monetary policy).

Remember 2018 Christmas market meltdown? That was also caused by the Fed being too hawkish than the market could handle. JPowell immediately changed his stance based on the market reaction and turned dovish instead.

But why would Fed try to kill the economy with tighter monetary policy? It's because of the fear of inflation. Inflation can get out of hand in no time and their role is to prevent that from happening.

The point I'm trying to make is that all we need to focus on at the moment is the Fed action and the government policy in order to see where the market is heading for the next 2-5 years. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that their policies are so significant and so powerful that they are almost single-handedly driving the economic recovery and the markets.

We don't need to worry about the Fed turning hawkish as the Fed has explicitly promised us we won't get any balance sheet contraction or rate hikes for the next 2-3 years until we have beaten the inflation target on average.

We also don't need to worry about the government reducing its deficit as they have also promised to spend for the country, and worry about the deficits later.

To summarize, we've got a few forces in action.

1. Favorable Fed and government policies -&gt; Positive to the risk-assets
2. Signs of excess: EV bubble, bitcoin, risk assets rally, margin investing record highs, market sentiment at the highest, put to call volume ratio at the lowest, and so on. -&gt; Negative to the risk-assets
3. Vaccine coming up -&gt; Positive to the risk-assets

My personal feeling is that we will certainly see a few quick, out-of-nowhere corrections in the risk markets (stock markets) in the short-term due to the signs of excess I have observed. But the monetary and fiscal policies are too powerful to fight against.

Therefore, I have positioned myself for shares in stocks, as opposed to call options or bull spreads (as they are too short-term), short treasuries, long gold, long cleantech, and a good amount of cash (20-30% cash). I will be observing the markets from the sidelines for a bit and decide when to pounce.

As always, please feel free to share your ideas or opinions.

I hope everyone has a great New Year's Eve and look forward to a great 2021!

personalfinance,Feeling serious FOMO around first time home purchase. Help calculate?,"Recently ended a 6 year long term relationship and after being on my own I have developed a serious case of FOMO around home ownership. In the relationship I was comfortable with renting and slowly saving as we worked towards marriage and eventually home purchase. I was happy to stay renting because I felt our income was strong (both had approx the same income) and I wanted to fully experience all the stages of life and relationship and enjoy them fully without any rush (marriage, saving, home buying together etc.). 

However now that the relationship ended I feel like suddenly I am behind. What am I waiting for now? Before there were milestones to reach before being ready for home purchase and no concerns about finances, but now my living expenses are double, household income is half and the current real estate market in my area is rapidly rising. I know a HUGE part of the current real estate market is due to COVID, interest rate plunge, and lack of supply, but Phoenix real estate was growing quickly even before this due to migrants from CA and other HCOL areas. This only seems to be accelerating. 

I am age 30 living in Phoenix AZ, and I have been renting in AZ since 2008. I have moved to all different parts of Phoenix throughout that time (almost ever year) so renting was appropriate for me. My concern is that the more I wait to purchase a home the more I am going to lose out on increasing home value. I am worried that my savings rate is going to be outpaced by real estate growth and all the time spent saving will be wasted, and I will be in a worse position 3-4 years down the line. Everyone around me that purchased a home in the past 5-6 years (even the last 2 years) is bright eyed and bushy tailed without a concern in the world, because their asset has skyrocketed in value.

From what I understand, lower interest rates are more beneficial than low home prices over a 30 year lengths of time (depending on the interest rate and home price/rate of increase of home price). I feel that waiting I may end up with increased interest rates and I am concerned that home values will not significantly drop due to how hot Phoenix is and has been. There are lots of people coming in from CA and other HCOL areas that I am worried I may be priced out by the time I am ""ready"". I know there is no guarantee and nobody has a crystal ball, but all indicators point to more competition and increased demand in Phoenix. 

I just think about someone in my position 4 years ago. If they waited 3-4 more years to save a proper down payment they would definitely be in a worse spot than they are now assuming they purchased 4 years ago with a less than ideal down payment. That's what I feel like will be my future if I wait and is what's giving me FOMO. 

How can I convince myself that saving a full down payment and purchasing a home ""the right way"" will be better than buying today? I understand there are people willing to be house poor and that is not me and not something I ever wanted. But when the playing field is set with over leveraged competition I feel like I am not playing at the same level by trying to have strong down payment etc. I feel like they are going to come out ahead of me even if they are paying PMI, don't have full emergency savings, retirement etc. because they were SMART to purchase a home at the right time in spite of those things. Maybe they will enter retirement with less income but they will also have a fully paid off home/no mortgage.

Current overview of my situation:

30, Phoenix AZ. Income $84k gross

Base rent: $1500 + utilities (this is on the low end. Current market I would expect this home to rent for $1700) I expect a small increase in rent at lease renewal or no increase due to good landlord/tenant relationship.

22% going into retirement (401k+Roth IRA) currently valued at $80k. I finished school/started my career a little later than most in 2017 at age 27, but don't carry any student loan debt.

Emergency fund fully funded @ 6mo of expenses

About $10k in stocks investments

In addition I currently have $27k saved for down payment (would be about 10% down if I purchased today) and saving $800/mo. I might be able to increase this to $1000-1200 if I cut in other areas. I am still re calibrating my budget following the break up.

Would like to eventually purchase a home that is approximately the same as the one I am renting. Currently valued at $297k. 3 years ago was valued at $205k (these are according to Zillow).

At my savings rate I would have about 3.5 years until I would have 20% down at the CURRENT value of the home. If it continues to rise that would be extended further. 

I have no debts and have  a fully paid off vehicle worth $25k that I have recently now considered selling to accelerate my down payment fund. This was an affordable dream car that I purchased cash about a year ago. I have another vehicle that is worth about $3k that would take care of my transportation needs (though I love the other car). 

How can I calculate the repercussions of waiting vs buying now with marginal down payment/PMI with an assumed market increase/increase in interest rates? I feel like I cant convince myself until I prove it with the numbers. 

I should add that I am concerned a lot of this FOMO is driven by the emotional instability I am feeling due to the end of my relationship which was about a month ago. I'm not sure how much that is clouding my judgement and I am still very much grieving. Also, I am not emotionally invested in purchasing a home. I am satisfied with the rental I am in now. I am concerned I am doing my future self a financial disservice by waiting until Phoenix becomes the next CA and I am forced to purchase a home far from my workplace. Short commute is probably my #2 criteria for a home after the safety of the neighborhood. I have never in anything I have done to this point concerned myself with what my peers were doing or let that drive my decisions. I've always been confident in my path and doing things at my own pace, but for some reason this has me in a bit of a panic. Please help me level my head a little bit.",finance

Best Buy is a seriously undervalued stock at the moment. This is a fundamental investment idea and full disclosure I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL TRADER.

Alright let’s get down to it. 

The below information is a comparison between the Nine Months Ending of November 2, 2019 and October 31, 2020. BBY pulled back from a 52 Week high of $124.89 to right around $99.79 today. This has happened despite a rather substantial increase in many metrics. These metrics are a culmination of both domestic and international stores. However, BBY is ceasing all operations in Mexico hopefully by early fiscal 2022. They will remain in Canada (which will now be their only international business segment). 

· Retained earnings increased 23.2%

· Diluted EPS increased from 2.96 to 3.74

· Revenue increased from 1.3% to 6.6%

· SG&amp;A as % of Revenue DECREASED from 20.1% to 18.3%

· Domestic online revenue grew roughly 174%

​

Below is a breakdown of their business segments and how their sales increased:

· Computing and Mobile Phones: The 21.5% comparable sales gain was driven primarily by computing and tablets, partially offset by declines in mobile phones.

· Consumer Electronics: The 21.1% comparable sales gain was driven primarily by home theater and digital imaging. 

· Appliances: The 39.3% comparable sales gain was driven by large and small appliances.

· Entertainment: The 17.5% comparable sales gain was driven primarily by gaming, virtual reality and drones, partially offset by declines in movies.

· Services: The 12.7% comparable sales gain was primarily due to our warranty and support services.

​

Below is some general information about BBY and a few quotes from their latest quarterly report:

General Info:

· BBY increased ALL employees pay to a minimum of $15 an hour

o This is huge because it is statistically proven that the amount of pay employees receive directly effects their performance, and therefore BBY’s performance.

o I realize it’s not huge, but when you are struggling that is a huge deal

· They issued $650 million in new notes due Oct 1, 2030 at 1.95%. They are using this to pay off $650 million debt coming due March 15, 2021 at 5.50% - Huge savings for them

· They donated 40 million to their foundation to help reach their goal of 100 Teen Tech Centers

o This helps underserved kids to have access to technology

Quotes: Very important info here!

· “On February 23, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a $3.0 billion share repurchase program. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under the February 2019 authorization. On March 21, 2020, we announced the suspension of all share repurchases to conserve liquidity in light of COVID-19-related uncertainties. We resumed repurchases in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.” 

o “As of October 31, 2020, $1.9 billion of the $3.0 billion share repurchase authorization was available.”

· “Our better-than-expected sales resulted in significant operating income rate expansion and earnings growth of 33% over the same period last year.”

------- And here is the best one -------

· “Historically, we have generated a large proportion of our revenue and earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.”

o Their sales and revenue have increased substantially AND their MOST profitable quarter is yet to be reported. 

​

So, what does all this mean?

The buybacks alone should increase the stock 5%. 

They are raking in money hand over fist, despite their most profitable quarter not being reported. 

They are getting the fuck out of Mexico (it wasn’t profitable this year and barely profitable in years prior)

They took advantage of the current interest rates and are restructuring their debt, smart.

They are investing in their employees by paying them more AND helping them with COVID related hardships

TLDR:

BBY has drastically increased their revenue due to a huge increase in sales while managing to actually reduce their costs as a % of revenue. Their most profitable quarter (4th quarter) is yet to be reported and I know they will perform.
