personalfinance,37 years old with high income and almost no retirement and significant student loans. What is the best type of retirement/investment account?,"I am a 37 year old physician recently finished with residency and now earning between 450 to 550k yearly. 
Employer has 403b and 457b accounts, both of which are maxed out at 19k annually.
Employer also contributes to 401a account at 6% of annual income. 

No credit card debt. Approximately 350k in student loans (mostly federal subsidized and unsubsidized). Participating in Loan Forgiveness program.

Mortgage for 460k taken out two years ago. 

My plan is to aggressively pay down debt but I want to contribute about 4k monthly to supplement my retirement planning since I am starting so late.

 As I understand it, my income precludes me from investing into a Traditional or Roth IRA. Is this correct?

That leaves me with a traditional brokerage account. My question is how best to invest it in order to be tax efficient.

I have a reasonably high tolerance for risk. My 457b and 403b are split between Vanguard total stock market and S&amp;P 500 indexed mutual funds.

My plan was to continue this investment strategy with my brokerage account. 

My questions are:

Are there better options to optimize my growth?
How are standard brokerage accounts taxed?
Are there better investment vehicles that are more tax efficient?",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off Car Loan with New Credit Card?,"Current car loan through sucky buy here pay here dealer:
Remaining balance: 6900
Monthly payments: 375.30 (paid biweekly 187.65)
Interest rate: 19.89%

Just opened my first credit card:
Credit Limit: 15,000
Interest rate: 6.99%

In my mind it makes sense to pay off the car with the credit card (car becomes mine fully, interest rate much lower, could probably make lower monthly payments)
Is there any downsides to paying off the car, or what am I missing?

I think I want to pay the car off so that I can own it fully, and if it allows me to make smaller monthly payments that would help my finances while I am trying to get a better paying job.

Currently making 27k per year, other expenses include insurance 300/month, phone 80/month, student loans 600/month, plus gas/groceries.",finance
personalfinance,"""Inheritance"" with ""rules"" attached","It isn't quite an inheritance, but I received $5,000 from my grandparents and can use it however I'd like, however, they'll give me 10% of what's left at the end of the year for up to 10 years (maximum $500 per year). So if I have a ""full"" balance every year for 10 years instead of spending it all, I'll net $10k instead of $5k. 

I'm trying to find the best use of this money. 

**Current Debt:** Student loans total just over $30k and with varying interest rates from 3.5% - 4.6% (every year was a different interest rate). The average interest rate is \~4%. No car payment or mortgage. 

**Current situation:** I bring home $3k per month, post taxes. I support my partner, since her parents recently abandoned her and she doesn't have a paying job because she's in her last year of school and needs to do an unpaid internship to graduate. My monthly expenses are around $2,800 and includes rent, utilities, groceries, car + renters insurance, student loan payments, cell phone, and dog expenses (all for both me and my partner). 

**My thoughts:** Since my company doesn't have a retirement plan yet (in the works and will be some time 2019), I've considered throwing it in an IRA. I've thought about how my loan interest over the next 10 years might accumulate more than $5k, so it might not be worth keeping a ""full"" balance every year. I also know I need to have at least a 3-month emergency fund, preferably 6 months though and right now I don't even have 1 month's worth (only about $1,500 in savings).

What do you think is the best use of the money? Throw it all into savings? Into an IRA? All at student loans? Some combination of the 3?

personalfinance,Forward-projecting budgeting app?,"TL;DR is there a mint-like software that integrates future projections (including the ability to add future assumptions such as a raise or buying a car in two years) EDIT: 1a. Oooh, I just found Tiller. Autodownloads and populates google sheets daily with transaction data &amp; auto-categorizes. Could allow me to do everything I want all within google sheets while maintaining the flexibility google sheets brings. 1b. PocketSmith seems to be a flagship software that also does some of this. Not thrilled with the interface so far, but it technically seems to satisfy my requirements, albeit at a significant cost for all the bells and whistles.

I use Mint and so far it's my favorite of budgeting apps, because it allows you to look at the month coming up (project expenses and income), and then monitor as you progress through the month. In my opinion (or at least how I approach it) it works a but like a 'set and forget' envelope system (with alerts obviously), which is perfect for me.

I'd love to find an app or desktop software however that takes the simplicity and syncing capability of Mint and allows you to project into the future by making assumptions of future income and expenses, setting pay-off dates for debt, etc. I know mint does the latter, but it's an inflexible goal - you can't do varying amounts for specific months if you anticipate changes to the budget.

I do this already with a Google spreadsheet, but it's a hassle to keep going back and forth between Mint and the Spreadsheet every month to get things aligned. I'd love for all of that (forward projection + month-to-month envelope budgeting) to be under one roof. 

Basically in my spreadsheet I start with cash on hand, then go through with anticipated income and expenses including debt service, then another portion that projects debt balances based on the projected payment and applicable interest rate. I then take that out about two years and make various assumptions about future expenses and income to allow me to better plan for it. This is incredibly helpful, because for example I can immediately see exactly how paying $100 extra on a bill each month might make it pay off faster, but then also dramatically reduce available cash on hand in the short term for an anticipated expense. Being able to see all those impacts at once allows me to make a more customized game plan - plus seeing the big $$ in the future helps keep me motivated to stay on budget, and figure out how to maximize it. The problem with my spreadsheet is just keeping it updated and accurate to reality without the syncing of Mint. It would be amazing to see how spending money on something today would impact something 10 months down the road, more or less in real-time like Mint.

So. Any ideas or apps you have used that implement forward projection like I'm talking about? Anyone wanna build an app?",finance

btc,What would it take to set up a small remittance company using cryptocurrency?,"Looking to brainstorm a bit here as I think this is a significant real world use case that could easily be adapted to existing technology and integrated with existing institutions. My view of this, as someone that lives in a first world country, would be that it could function similar to that of a bitcoin atm meets localbitcoins, only with more services for those not technically savvy. A person would hand fiat over to an operator who would buy the crypto for them (thinking BCH, ETH or even LTC as the regular BTC blockchain's 10 min minimum transaction time can hamstring using it). Then they would either send the crypto to a wallet that the person sending the remittance would control for a nominal mining fee, or if the person sending remittance doesn't have one they could choose to send it to another office (in a minimalist set up could even just be a person) on the other end actually in-country who could pay out the crypto in local fiat, possibly converting amounts to dollars first then to local.

The way that I would see it working would be to profit more on volume than over individual transactions, as Western Union and the like already charge 3% plus possibly a sending fee on some places. This would be more along the lines of a custom mining fee (for speed) which for certain cryptos is still pretty nominal. That and possibly a very small fee for changing crypto to fiat, very small like maybe a dollar or if it gets up and running 10 cents. To encourage crypto adoption could also point out that if they want the crypto directly they could always make their own wallets, or possible get on a local exchange...

Now, this is all purely conjecture now, what I am most wondering is what I haven't thought of so far. I am.guessing would.need some sort of money or wire transfer permit to be even accepting money in the first world country, problem is I don't even know at what level it would be needed, local, state, federal or even a combination of 2+! Also, if this is even feasibly legal on certain countries, which ones may have a ban on them such as possibly China. Lastly, if there are any flaws in this plan that I haven't anticipated, and which might not make it better than existing systems of payment. With crypto prices falling across the board and hash rate rising this seems like a great time to try to set this up and start people actually using cryptocurrency for some thing important right now.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Easy tip to boost your credit score over time,"I've had account with my bank since I was 17.  At 19, I added a ""Line of credit"" to my checking account.....basically, it's just beefed up Overdraft protection.  If I overdraw my account, it gets charged to the Line of credit.  I've never needed it, never paid a cent for it or had to do anything to maintain it.   The thing is, it's now considered my oldest credit account, and over time the bank has increased the available credit I have for the account.  I used a simulator to see what would happen if I closed it, and it was a 32 point hit to my credit score.   If your bank offers it without a fee, take it.

personalfinance,[CAN] Mortgage Renewal ; Aggressive Payment ; Two Different Choices Help,"We are in Canada where the mortgage renews every 5 years. My original amortization was 30 years and now it is up for its first renewal. I have been trying to pay off the mortgage aggressively. Because of aggressive payments I have a choice from the bank to get the new amortization for 19 years or keep it at 25 years. The interest rate doesn't change on either.

My question was - as I am trying to pay it off aggressively, would keeping the 25 yrs and put extra payments in help more towards paying off the principal or would having 19 yr amortization and paying extra payments pay more towards principal. Of course the payments will be slightly higher for 19 yrs than 25. Let's say hypothetically my budget allows 3000$ monthly to go in mortgage &amp; extra payments.

I think keeping 25 yrs and continue paying off aggressively will help with that. What are your thoughts? Thank you!",finance

My mom used to receive SSDI until the beginning of 2018. It was suspended. She had an excess amount in her bank and the Social Security Administration assumed she had enough money. Truth is, she wanted to buy a house and wasn't aware how and what to do with the loan. 

Fast Forward. The social security administration told her she needs to then either get a house with that loan she got or give the loan back or clear her debt. She cleared her outstanding debt with that loan.

personalfinance,New Year: Begin Contributing to a Roth 401k instead of existing Pre Tax 401k,"Hi all: My question is simple. I am 24, single, currently have some debt (low interest, car loan and federal student loans) that I expect to pay off in the next two years. I work for one of the largest professional services firms as a consultant and have been very successful (12.5% raise last year, expecting a 23% raise on average this year for my rank promotion)

When I started, I elected to tax pretax contributions to my 401k. I am not sure why I did, probably an error on my part. I always wanted to lock in this tax bracket (22%) because I don't see a future path where my retirement and future brackets are not higher.

 My question is: if I switch to roth 401k contributions as of 1/1/2019, do I have to rollover or handle my traditional 401k any differently? My employers matching works for either plan, but I'm wondering if it is sensible to have both? Basically: can I just leave it alone and start contributing to the Roth? I will likely switch back to the traditional at some point as my brackets become higher.

personalfinance,Looking For Financial Help Regarding Saving and Credit Overages,"Hey all, this is my first time to this subreddit. I'll try to explain my situation as clearly as I can, and get my questions through.  


I own two Credit Cards with BMO (Canada), one is a cashback and another is an air miles. The Interest rate for both is 22% I believed. My Air Miles card has a limit of $2000, and I finally managed to get that card under it's limit (it is now at $1950 I believe). However, my other card (the Cash Back one) has a limit at $3000 but currently there is a good $3500 on there. My initial plan was to put little payments every pay to try and bring it down below the limit until tax returns come in and use majority if not all of that money to put back on the card, but it seems that money gets added to the card due to overages faster than I can pay it off so waiting until tax returns might not be the best idea. Does anybody have any advice in this situation? Thank you.  


My other question is: Is there any type of bank account I can get to put money into easily, but have to go through a process to take out? I really want to save my money, and put away some every paycheck. However, it is waaaay too easy for me to just move money from my Savings to Checking on my banking app, or just spending out of my Savings too. So initially I thought about getting a safe, because I hate carrying cash around, to deposit my money into periodically to help me save money but I am not too keen on keeping loose cash at home if even in a safe. If there were at least a digital account I could monitor, but not spend or easily move my money out of, that would be perfect. Thanks again and have a happy new year!",finance

personalfinance,Should I go for an apartment or remain in campus housing based off of my financial situation?,"21 Male in my third year at college, on time to graduate Spring 2020.

I live in a campus apartment, meaning I take out a student loan and that pays the university a lump sum for my housing. Issue is, since it's campus housing, I have to leave during winter and summer breaks, disallowing me the ability to remain in Chicago and work. Instead, I have to come home to my mother's and work where the hourly wages are lower. 

I would like to get an apartment so that I don't have to take out a loan, use some of my savings and some of my income to pay for rent and keep my job year-round in the city until I graduate.

My current financial situation:

I have a Discover It Student Card with a $2,300 CL ($135 on the card).

I have a Citi ThankYou Preferred Card with a $2,600 CL ($381 on the card). 

I have an American Express Blue Cash Everyday Card with a $4,000 CL ($0 on the card).

Only school-related debt is a Parent PLUS Loan amounting to $12,000 and one Federal Direct Loan at about $2,500

Discover says my FICO is 739. (Member for a  year and a half).
Citi says my FICO is 703. (Member for about 6-7 months)
American Express says my FICO is 723. (Brand new card).

Gross annual income is $15,500.
Grants/Scholarships annually amount to $17,000.
Student loans annually amount to 14,000. (But as I previously mentioned, I pay the vast majority of this off yearly). 

I currently have $7,000 in a 2.25% interest bearing savings accounts.

I live in Chicago, where cost of living is fairly high but I can find a monthly rent (divided amongst others) of about $600.

personalfinance,Roth IRA Questions + Student Debt vs Retirement saving,"2 related questions (and yes I read the sidebar):

I started a new job in the bay area, I'm 33, single (live with girlfriend), and make $115k. I have 15k in the bank, 15k total across two 401ks from previous jobs. I also have 90k in student debt: 35k at 7.6%, the rest about 3-4%, all federal PLUS loans. Have been on IBR/REPAYE for about 5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Question 1: I want to start a Roth IRA instead of use my new job 401k, my employer doesn't match. Should I just open a Vanguard Retirement Account and rollover my previous 2 401ks into it, then put the max into it every year? Is it that simple? Should I choose my own funds or use their roboadviser, and what are the details for that? 

&amp;#x200B;

Question 2: This is the bigger one. How aggressively to pay down my student debt. I figure everyone here will tell me to pay it down before anything else, or at least the 35k portion. Right now I pay the IBR minimum which basically covers interest, and am aiming for it to be forgiven + tax bomb in 20 years.

My plan is to put 10k aside for emergency fund. I will probably save about 15k per year at my current job and location - 6k to roth IRA, 4k extra towards the 35k loan, and 5k towards a down payment for a house (I plan on leaving the bay area in 2-3 years to build a home in the middle of nowhere and work remote).

investing,Why the American Economy will not enter a recession,"The typical bear case as to why the American economy is actually in poor shape right now is Americans have low savings and high debt. The Fed making rates zero essentially secured America's demise. Bears feel that this debt combined with low savings is inevitably going to implode and leave many Americans poor. Schiff even believes that Americans will then blame Trump and Republicans for Obama's mistakes and go full socialist leaving America even more troubled.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is why the economy is in great shape right now. We'll start with the argument of ""high debt"".

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, debt is high. Aggregate household debt grew for the 16th consecutive quarter. If we look at debt per household in 2000 it was about $50,000. In 2011 it was about $70,000. Today it is about $140,000. Comparably, median household income (which is consistently rising as well) is about $62,000. So does this mean Americans are simply living beyond their standards?

No. Debt per household  throughout history is more than income per household. In 2005 median household income was about $45,000 while debt was $70,000. In 2010 debt was $74,000 while income was $49,000. Debt relative to GDP has also consistently declined since the 2008 recession.

&amp;#x200B;

In regards to the savings rate, the savings rate is about half of what is was at its peak in 2012. Part of this drop is due to big purchases  treated as cash outlays including even if financed. If you buy a car, while you are not saving your money, you now own an asset (yes depreciating but still some store of value). Either way, savings are falling. There isn't much to be worried however. It is not an alarming statistic when you factor in economic growth, increasing employment, household income increases, etc. Rates are about the same  in 2003 and aren't at an unusual rate. Likewise, you want an economy with savings, but you also want to encourage consumer spending. I would be a bit troubled if the savings rate was unusually high, but the rates now are hardly troubling.

&amp;#x200B;

Some economists use the comparison: ""would you rather be someone with high savings and low debt or someone that spends their paycheck and has debt with lots of assets?"" This is a vast simplification of a complex concept. If we look at the economy throughout history there is no correlation between growing economy and decreasing consumer debt or growing economy and growing savings.

The American economy is very healthy and will continue to flourish.",finance

personalfinance,Looking for general financial advice. Budgeting/ Investing/ Car Buying,"Hi, my wife and I are 23.

Just finished paying off our 2017 Camry and the only debt we have is $1000 of interest free money that we plan to pay off next month. Fortunately the Army is paying for our continuing education. I am currently putting roughly $200 per month into the TSP( Roth IRA w/5% match). Credit score in the 790s.

We need to buy a second vehicle. Currently have only about 3k in savings since we have been trying to quickly pay off our first car. Our plan is to save up about 7-10k as an emergency fund, then start to car shop. After reading around this sub, it seems like the best decision for us is to buy new if we can get a promotional low interest rate, or buy a 1-2 year old vehicle with a standard interest rate of around 4%. We are looking to get a Toyota Tacoma. I have owned older cars all of my life and I feel like it costs a lot of money to maintain them, I would rather have a newer car, pay it off, and drive it for 15-20 years. What is the best way to go about buying a vehicle tailored to our situation in your opinion?

Second topic, after purchasing our vehicle, we will still have a decent sized budget surplus. Again I have looked around this sub and have decided on three different options. 1. Start putting money into a mutual fund. Not sure exactly how to go about starting that, USAA always advertises it and seems like an easy way to do it. 2. Open a HYSA. My wife is not too keen on the idea of mutual funds and the “stock market” due to the stigma of risk within it. I looked a little into it and it seems like a safe option to have a liquid asset that grows a little slower. If this is a good option for us, what are some recommended banks? Are there any new account bonuses that I am not aware of?
3. Dump all of our excess money into car loan to avoid interest. I know this depends on the interest rate, but it would not be above 4-5%. 

I realize the correct answer is probably some combination of these 3 options, although I would think it would be a good idea to have most of my money in one spot for a higher rate of compound.

personalfinance,Paying Estimated Taxes on Windfall,"Hello,

I play daily fantasy sports and I did very well this year, gaining over 6 figures in profit and will need to pay 6 figures in taxes come April 15th. With the estimated taxes due January 15th I wanted to get a few questions covered up. I plan on hiring a CPA for tax season, I'd just like to avoid it for the estimated payment.

Context:

* DFS winnings are taxed as ""other income"" with 1099-MISC

* I worked as an actuary for 10 months of the year, and quit to focus on DFS full time. My total comp will be about $80k for those 10 months, but I won't know my taxes until late January.

* 2017 my federal tax was $13,300



Questions:

* The rule for minimum Estimated Tax that I've seen is that the ""minimum"" amount of taxes you should be paying in during the year is smaller of (a) 110% of last year's tax (since I made over $150k) or (b) 90% of this year's tax. Does this mean I can just pay $15,000 (110% of last year's tax + buffer), even though I know my tax burden come April 15th will be in the 6 figures?

* I haven't been profitable for 3 of the last 5 years (and I was employed this year), so I'm assuming I won't need to pay a self-employment tax.

* If I pay the estimated tax closer to what I really owe and I'm off by more than $10k, there will be no problem getting that back in my return, correct?

Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,2019 Withholding Estimator (spreadsheet),"I made a Google spreadsheet that allows you to anticipate what your federal income tax withholding will be based on your W-4 Single or Married option, paycheck frequency, paycheck size (after removing pre-tax amounts), and the W-4 allowances number you choose.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ncaCEhab4iLEE8JXdXHtMTigjE8OVBU5SRWRJhfWdVs/

It implements the 2019 IRS Publication 15 formulas (as best I predict).

You can use this online, save a copy to your Google drive, or download your own copy for offline use. I've pinned this in my user profile, so find it there if you need it in future. It's also linked from the sidebar wiki Tools page. 

---

**User Hints**

You can use a formula like ""=75000/26"" in the first cell if you have income 75000 and are paid biweekly, to quickly enter your per paycheck amount.
Accurate results will be returned if you use the amount of your pay that really is subject to income tax, so don't include pre-tax amounts like health insurance premiums or traditional retirement plan contributions that escape taxation.

In the upper right you'll find how much would be withheld across full year if the settings you enter were in place for a full year. If you want to know how much more will be withheld for rest of year, multiply the per-paycheck amount you see highlighted by the number of remaining paychecks in the year.

If you're married and both you and your spouse work, examine if Married settings are able to withhold enough. If not, consider trying ""Single 2"" for both of you as a baseline, as that uses withholding brackets half the size of married brackets, and your combined withholding at two jobs would match your actual tax more closely.

If you have a child, you can account for the $2000 tax credit by adding allowances based on your individual tax brackets. If individually you're in 10% or 12% bracket, consider adding 4 allowances per child, since 4 * $4200 * 12% is about 2000. If individually you're in 22% or 24% bracket, consider adding 2 allowances per child, since 2 * $4200 * 24% is about 2000. That would give you the value of your tax credit spread out across the year in your take-home pay.",finance

David Einhorn closed out 2018 with his biggest annual loss ever for the 22-year-old Greenlight Capital.

The firm’s main hedge fund fell 9 percent in December, extending this year’s decline to 34 percent, according to an investor update viewed by Bloomberg.

Greenlight posted some of the industry’s best returns in its early years, but has stumbled since losing more than 20 percent in 2015.


Other value-investing managers have also struggled, as a decade of historically low interest rates and the rise of passive investing and quant trading pushed growth stocks past their inexpensive brethren. Three Bays Capital and SPO Partners &amp; Co., which sought to make wagers on undervalued stocks, closed in 2018. Einhorn has repeatedly expressed his frustration with the poor performance this year, while remaining steadfast in his commitment to value investing.

Waning Returns
Greenlight's performance hit its peak in 1997, the year after inception


Source: Bloomberg reporting

Greenlight, which posted gains only in May and October, underperformed both the broader market and its peers in 2018. The S&amp;P 500 Index dropped 4.4 percent, including dividends, while the HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index, an early indicator of industry performance, fell 7 percent through Dec. 28. A spokesperson for the New York-based firm declined to comment.

Shrinking Pocketbook
At the start of the year, Greenlight managed $6.3 billion in assets, according to a regulatory filing. By May, the firm was down to $5.5 billion. With redemptions and losses, it may start 2019 with less than $5 billion under management.

Greenlight’s largest holdings as of Sept. 30 included homebuilder Green Brick Partners Inc., insurer Brighthouse Financial Inc. and aircraft leasing firm AerCap Holdings NV, which each declined more than 25 percent during the fourth quarter.

Einhorn has been a steady critic of Tesla Inc. and a prominent short-seller of the stock. In November, he told investors the third quarter “will be as good as it gets” for the electric-car maker, which slid in December but was up 26 percent over the last three months of the year.",finance
personalfinance,Salary: Do you understand Compa-ratio and how it affects you? Do you want to? Then step inside.,"**Reference: I was an auditor at one point.  The below is my personal assessment of Compa-ratio ""for the 80%"".  You will likely see and hear different information than the below at some point, because Compa-ratio is used and implemented differently based on the needs or assumptions of each organization.**

&amp;#x200B;

If you're on the lower level of salary you may never have heard of this tool.  But it's almost a sure bet that you're subject to it.  In order for you to have any leverage as you move to different jobs, it's critical you at least understand *what* this is and what effect it has on you.

&amp;#x200B;

In simple terms: **Compa-ratio is a ratio (from 0.0 to 1.0) of pay in a range for a given position, based on the market value of that position as determined by the company**.

&amp;#x200B;

When I say ""market value"", it's literally like a store.  What's the most common ""price"" you'd expect to pay if you had to replace that person?  Much of this comes from the public sector, who is required to publish their salaries.  Some of it is assumptive.  Some of it is a ""nod-nod-wink-wink"" between companies (read up on the Apple/Google salary collusion: [https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-tech-jobs-settlement-20150903-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-tech-jobs-settlement-20150903-story.html)).  Some of it is based on cost-of-living, which is state by state.

&amp;#x200B;

This ""price"" will change by state, because of course, it's easier to find certain types of jobs than others based on the state, because many states have concentrations of a given type (Detroit was heavily concentrated with auto workers, for example, but Seattle is/was not).  In situations where a position is saturated (i.e. fast food workers) and there's no shortage, the price is obviously lower.  This is why for certain jobs it actually makes better sense to consider relocating to a different state where the demand is high but the talent pool is low.  

&amp;#x200B;

In my current field, this is the case; I can easily find work in my field paying what I want in states like North Dakota, Idaho, Nevada, etc., but nearly impossible in states like Pennsylvania,  Florida and Texas.  It's not that the jobs aren't there, they just don't pay what they should, due to saturation of the talent pool.  In California, I once had a company offer 2.5x what I would normally make (basically, more than you'd pay some CEOs!), if I was willing to relocate vs. working remote.  I refused, because I hate California and their terrible tax system.  But I digress.

&amp;#x200B;

So let's use a real-world example.  And I'm going to focus on annual (i.e. not hourly) pay, as it's easier to understand the numbers, but it applies regardless.  Say you're fresh out of college, no work history, but you got your bachelor's and you're ready to work in a state where minimum wage is about $9/hour.  You find a cashier job at the local department store and you apply.  They offer you $23k/year (just over $11/hour).  Freeze that moment.

&amp;#x200B;

What they offered you is **not** the highest they could offer you.  In actuality, it's closer to the *lowest* they can justify paying you, based on what you bring to the table.  If someone else who had experience working at department stores applied, they'd likely get a higher offer.  If someone who had no degree and no experience applied, they'd likely get lower.  

&amp;#x200B;

Why?

&amp;#x200B;

The intent of Compa-ratio, at least in some companies, is to try to use data to accomplish four main objectives.

1. Determine the amount of money that is most likely to keep a person from leaving, assuming a given role.  This is the *higher end* of the ratio.
2. Determine the minimum amount of money that they're willing to pay for a given role.  This is the *lower* end of the ratio.
3. Determine a fair rate from which to start and be able to adjust upward or downward, based on a person's fit for the role.  This is the *median* of the ratio.
4. Determine raise potential, if any, based on where the person is at any time in the range and the target for 100%/1.0 of Compa-ratio.

So in the example I gave, assuming the fair market value for that exact role in the state is $22k/year, the actual pay range for that position might be something like $19k - $27k.  Everyone with the same role then has a different salary within this range.  SO if you accepted $23k/year, you'd be at a **.5 Compa-ratio** \- the middle rate between the two.

&amp;#x200B;

In the company's mind, this opens you up to multiple (usually small) raises until you got to the 27k, which means less of a glass ceiling than if they offered you, say, $25k.  To you, it feels low, and it should - because it's designed to be low to begin with, but provide raise potential over time as you prove you're worth the money.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, if you're in the middle of a Compa-ratio, you might get raises of 5% or so for a few years before it starts to go down, because you've got room to grow.  If you're at the upper end of the Compa-ratio, you might get raises of 2% or so, because you're just too close to the max to pay more.  Lower end, you might get ""huge"" raises.  The company's goal is to keep you away from the 1.0 Compa-ratio, because they know that once you hit that, they no longer can justify paying you more, and you have a risk of leaving, unless your role is *re-priced.*  TO avoid this, smart companies will usually re-assess the ranges every year to make sure they're not underpricing a given role and keep your momentum towards 1.0 without actually letting you reach it.

&amp;#x200B;

How does minimum wage play into this?  Sort of like musical chairs, actually.  A lower minimum wage results in a lower base salary for ranges, which (in theory) results in businesses being able to create more ranges within a set of lower-skilled labor roles.  When the minimum wage goes up, these ranges usually aren't bumped up, they're eliminated completely along with the roles where people were paid at the lower end of the spectrum.  Any position that's currently paying less than $30k, should be considered at risk to get cut at some point if more states start adopting $15/hour minimum wages or the Feds do.

&amp;#x200B;

Think math: if I have 50 positions with pay ranges of $20k - $40k with 40 of those people making at least $30k, and minimum wage goes from $9/hour to $15/hour, not only do you need to get everyone over the $31-$32k/year threshold so you meet the minimum, you also have to bump everyone else due to the median having changed and the potential to get too close to the highest part of the range (which creates a risk of not being able to give any more raises, thus increasing the risk they leave).  So the cost isn't just getting those underpaid good, but also increasing everyone so it's fair, including part-time workers.  

&amp;#x200B;

It can add up quick - and it's mostly because of how Compa-ratio works.  It was never built to handle significant increases in minimum wage in a short time, but rather a graduated, steady increase that's reassessed annually.  The businesses' default response is to increase the price of their product (assuming they're a for-profit) and/or cut lower level, ""non-essential"" roles.

&amp;#x200B;

You've likely heard people tell you to negotiate your salary.  If you're in position to do so, then I agree.  The hard part is to make sure you have enough leverage to negotiate when you're up against Compa-ratio.  Fresh out of college, you probably don't unless it's a position in such demand that the company will flex a bit - and they won't tell you that straightaway.  You'd just have to know based on the industry or learning track that there aren't many other people available that can do what you know how to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately though, you may need to settle for a middle or lower Compa-ratio without realizing you're at that point.  **Don't be afraid to ask at the point of the interview with HR if they use Compa-ratio and where the offer sits in the range**.  If you consider it low, ask for more, but be reasonable based on your experience.  Know also that HR usually has a bit of pull to approve an increase to an offer by a small percent - usually up to 5% or so of the original offer, as long as it's still within the Compa-ratio range.  So in the example above, you might be able to get them to go up to $24k without too much heartburn.

&amp;#x200B;

Long term - and this isn't easy - you have to train yourself to settle for less than you think you should be paid until your worth is increased, so you can get more leverage to negotiate for more.  At some point, with enough experience in a strong field, you'll be able to literally ask for a specific salary and know you'll get it.  It may put you super high on Compa-ratio and limit raise potential, but if you use that as a stepping stone for promotions, you may end up in a higher range that puts raise potential back on the table.  Or, be willing to potentially uproot and move to another state where they specifically need what you have to offer, and are willing to pay better for it.

&amp;#x200B;

In closing, my observation is that Compa-ratios miss something huge: value.  What's the *value* of this person to my organization and how can I maximize that value?  Not value as compared to fair market value. Value based on the individual's results. In a value-based system, the range wouldn't be directly tied to any one role, only the starting pay.  The maximum potential pay would then be a median of the organizational pay; which means that as people deliver value to the organization, they earn raises.  As they earn raises, the median increases.  As the median increases, the maximum potential increases.  The percentage of raise is then adjusted based on the value the individual brought, which is directly tied to results delivered as assessed - thus encouraging people to show up every day and work as hard as they can. But that's just me.

personalfinance,Some tips if you are saving for a home in 2019,"If you are planning to save for a home this year I thought I'd share a little advice:    

&amp;#x200B;

First it is a good idea to talk to a mortgage guy and go through the preapproval process before budgeting.  Have them run some hypothetical numbers for you so you know roughly what you need to save for down payment and closing costs and what payments will look like.  

&amp;#x200B;

Note here that it may make sense to put less down to buy a home sooner/ keep some savings on hand for an emergency fund.  Everyone hates PMI but if you buy a home today and pay 5% interest rate and next year they are at 6% your effective rate with mortgage insurance will likely be below the 1% rate difference.  And it comes off when you get to 20% equity.  I'm not saying 6% in 2020.  I do see many folks wait longer to buy a home than they should because they think they need to put 20% down.  If the payment is comfortable with PMI and you love the house buy the house with less down.  And if it is going to take x amount of time to get 20% down you should be able to pay the mortgage down in a similar amount of time and get the PMI removed.  Everyone's situation is different and if the PMI pushes the payment too high for your budget obviously don't do this but PMI is just effectively a higher interest rate for putting less than 20% down.  It isn't some terrible evil thing that must be avoided at all costs.  

&amp;#x200B;

You also want to plan for moving expenses, the cost of an inspection, and any projects you plan to do to the new home.  

&amp;#x200B;

And if you are working with a good mortgage guy/gal and your credit is below 760 ask him/her if he/she has any advice to improve the credit score while you save.  Having even a slightly higher score can make a surprising difference on your mortgage payment.

personalfinance,Medical resident. Invest vs Paying loans?,"Hi all. I'm currently a medical resident. I have about 300k in student debt. Interest rate for the loan is about 6.8%; interest accumulates about $800 give or take. And I already invested into Roth IRA. I have to pay back about $170/mo for student loans. And I have been paying additional $500 each month. So the amount I have been paying back hasn't touched the principal yet.

So I was wondering if I should be just saving that $500 and investing it somewhere or should I make higher payment (like total of $800-900 each month to cover the loans plus make a tiny tiny dent on the principal)?

personalfinance,Raiding retirement savings to pay off mountain of high-interest credit card debt? A less bad idea for US federal employees than most?,"Debt load between my wife and I: &gt;$70,000, mostly 18-21% APR, some at 13% and a bit as low as 0% APR promotional rate

&amp;#x200B;

State of our retirement savings: just over $100k between the two of us in a TSP (Thrift Savings Plan, the 401(k) equivalent for federal employees)

&amp;#x200B;

Budgeting has not made a significant dent on this debt, and the APR is killing us. We are both 33 y/o and have one kid and would like to have more, but don't know how under our current debt loads, especially in a high cost of living area in which child care is pricey. (Yes, we are aware that we have made bad choices and have reconciled ourselves to this clear and obvious fact.) Without going into too much detail, our best option to get money out of this TSP is a financial hardship emergency withdrawal, for which there is a tax penalty (though we wouldn't pay it at this point until 2020, of course, which helps considerably). Another penalty is that the individual who withdrew the funds couldn't contribute to his or her TSP account (and benefit from agency matching funds, which go dollar for dollar up to 5%) for 6 months.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan was to withdraw roughly $27,000 from my account, use it to pay off a chunk of the high-interest loans, and hope that doing so would open up opportunities for low-APR balance transfers and then see where that gets us before considering withdrawing from my wife's account. (We are not currently in a position in which we are able to open more credit cards with low APRs, for obvious reasons.) To a large extent, this is an effort to wipe the slate clean financially and start over with better habits, while acknowledging that the result of this is that I'll most likely have to work significantly later in life as a result. Advantages on my side include the government pensions we'll eventually be able to tap into, and to a lesser degree, the fact that my house has almost certainly appreciated in value considerably in the six years I've owned it, so a home equity loan might not be out of the question once our credit scores climb out of the low 600s or so.

***Edited again on Jan 2 because we found out today that my wife's income will be going up by \~$12k at the beginning of Feb--some offsetting expenses, don't want to get overly optimistic about the effects, but still, hey, good news is good news!***

* My wife and I are currently making TSP contributions up to the matching max of 5%.
* The expectation is that, by paying off some debts, we would redirect money currently going to servicing their monthly payments and instead concentrate those payments on other debts, thereby hopefully getting into more of a positive spiral. So, in other words, if I paid off a credit card that is currently absorbing nearly $400/month, I could then use that $400 to pay off another card on top of minimum payments.
* Our combined income **as of early Feb will be** roughly $205k (yes, too high to be in this much debt, but here we are. It started when we made less, which is hardly an excuse). In good news, my wife and I both have a decent chance of promotions at work  in 2019 which would be effective respectively as early as spring or Aug and amount to $10-12k before taxes; nothing we can count on, but something to hope for at least.
* Our budget is much more strict now than it used to be, which has been sufficient to avoid new debt but not enough to make a meaningful dent on our existing debt.

personalfinance,Re-establishing credit question...Credit cards--how many do you have and how are you using them?,"*Sorry in advance if this is a silly question or has been asked before.*

I have been rebuilding my credit score for after not having any credit for 7 years (no loans, credit cards, utilities in my name--nothing that reported to a credit bureau positively. I had no collections during that time either.)  Applying for a car loan and having trouble for having ""no"" credit in 2016 was a wake up call, so after getting a co-signer and making payments on that, my no credit gradually climbed to Poor. 
I finally began getting credit cards offers, and got an unsecured Capital One card with a $500 limit, no annual fee. Don't know the interest rate because I have no intention of paying it.  I used it for a year or so, a few times a month, and paid it off in full each time. My credit score increased gradually and I applied for and got another card through Amex.  I have a corporate card with them that I can transfer rewards from to this card, and good cash back rewards in the places I spend most of my monthly budget (groceries and gas). That limit is $6,000.
My question is this: how do I use these cards to best keep my credit score (720) moving in the upward direction? Should I care about utilization very much...ie shoot for a % used on the statement date, let it get reported, and pay it off on the due date?  
Off hand, I am thinking about transferring all monthly subscription charges to the CO $600 limit card (currently linked to my checking account), and using the Amex for everything else. Paying both off in full on the due date. It just seems like the easiest for me, plus I get whatever amex bonuses I can, interest on the money in the bank for the month, and reporting to the credit agencies that I am using the cards.  I am worried that my % utilization might look high depending on the dates the credit card companies reporting to the credit card agencies.

If it matters, I have no plans to take out any loans in the near/mid term future. I'm about a year ahead of my car loan in payments, and have built up an emergency fund that would pay almost all of it off today but having lived for years without an emergency fund, I'll never do it again (if I can help it). I'd just like my emergency fund to be padded with a solid credit score (never thought I'd see the day That was my financial goal!!!!)",finance

We lived with my grandfather at first and he didn’t support her going to college, was an alcoholic so he kicked us out in addition to other reason. So my mom was going to school full time studying biology, working nearly 30 hours a week and raising a 13 year old. She was lucky if she had two days in a week where she got more than 5 hours sleep in a night.

Obviously she still couldn’t afford all her bills so we were forced to have food stamp and Obamacare. One think that did stick with me was once we were shopping at the grocery one Christmas Eve and we bought lobster. It was probably our first time having anything lavish since moving to America but it was Christmas. A guy behind us in line saw we were laying with a food stamp card and went off on us saying how we’re taking advantage of the system saying we shouldn’t be having that, if we can’t pay with our own money. I was obviously embarrass and it didn’t help the fact I didn’t even get a present. Anyway I’m getting sidetracked but guy forever stuck in my head and when I was a senior trying to decide what to study in college that guy’s comment made me know what I wanted to do. 

Four years later my mom eventually graduated and got a job with the health department and another job working part time. As soon as we got settled financially she actually got off food stamp and obviously her job came with insurance. We were still eligible for food stamp I think even last year we were because they check income for two years ago. However, despite being eligible my mom decided to work a second job than munch of the government to get her bills paid. While in my community there were people living on government programs before we got to America and if I go back there now they are still probably on it. They stay home don’t work, with the hope of the government paying everything for them. To me that’s a problem, I’m disgusted by it look how hard my mom worked to get out of that situation but there are people who actually make no attempt to get out because it’s free. Honestly I don’t even blame them haha. 

Now I’m a second year Economics major and I just wanted to share what my solution is. Nothing outside the box haha, probably won’t cause a movement or anything but just wanted to share. I feel that government assisted programs should be federalized and not run by states then they should all be centralized into one program, because honestly if you need one your probably need the others. Now I feel these programs should also come with assistance finding a job or investing in human capitals. They can be encouraged to go to school where they can find a career. Now I’m not saying they should pay for school or anything but they should be helped with enrolling and I know some people might think that’s extra expenses but it’s gonna be cheaper than having people leeching of these programs forever. If school is not for them they can learn a trade, in many trades you get paid while learning. Or get some certification of some kind, get a CDL truck drivers are in high demand, a couple weeks you can have your CDL and if you can handle the road and willing to do overtime you can easily make 100K. If a person refuses to do these because maybe they have a degree but got laid, or just has another job in mine they should have a limit of how long they are giving assistance for.  If it’s obvious that they are making no efforts to get a job then take away these programs from them. I feel that a lot more people would stop staying home collecting welfare and become more productive members of society and the money spent on these programs can be spent in other programs. 

Like I said nothing too complicated but just wanted to share let me know what you think of it if there’s anything you disagree about.",finance
personalfinance,How do feds determine the fixed rate on Ibonds?,"Hello,

personalfinance,How to understand compound interest by going through my student loans with real numbers,"Let's do a fun thing. Going to do some math with my student loans payments to see how much I'm wasting on interest. 

No idea if this is like a common trend for this subreddit, but I decided to look over my loan statement today while organizing life, and wanted to share my thought processes and calculations while going through. I'm also going to use real numbers and dates because whatever.

So let's start with my account in mint.com since that's where I actually started today while making sure my accounts were all linked up correctly. This is what I saw when I checked my loans section:

    5 Year Student Loan: -$27,746.65

Makes sense I guess. I have autopay set to pay about 1k every month. And it's been going since I refinanced after college 2 years ago. I even put most of my tax refunds to this loan. But it feels like it's taking _forever_ to go down. I started with like $50k after school, so I wonder how much I've been wasting on interest and whatnot. This means I'll have to find and dig through those loan statements that I have set to skip my email inbox usually.

Let's start with the info presented on the most recent statement:

    DECEMBER 10, 2018
    -----------------
    BEGINNING PRINCIPAL: $49,279.21 
    DATE LAST PAYMENT RECEIVED: 12/04/2018
    CURRENT PRINCIPAL BALANCE: $27,746.65 
    TOTAL PRINCIPAL PAID: $21,547.38
    MONTHLY PAYMENT AMOUNT: $946.48 
    TOTAL INTEREST PAID: $4,503.74
    AMOUNT PAST DUE: $.00 
    TOTAL AMOUNT PAID: $26,051.12
    INTEREST RATE: 5.375% 
    PRINCIPAL PAID SINCE LAST STATEMENT: $874.56
    OUTSTANDING ACCRUED INTEREST: $24.51 
    INTEREST PAID SINCE LAST STATEMENT: $126.44
    TOTAL PMNTS RCVD SINCE LAST STATEMENT: $1,001.00

That's a lot of stuff. I really only want to see how much I've paid in interest compared to what I've paid towards the actual principal. Luckily these statements are nice enough to tell me that:

    TOTAL PRINCIPAL PAID: $21,547.38
    TOTAL INTEREST PAID: $4,503.74

-

    4503.74 / 21547.38 = .209...

So I've paid 21% of my money just to interest? That seems ridiculous. It says right in that same statement that my interest rate is `5.375%`, so how is this happening? Probably that stupid stuff they always say about accrued interest or whatever. So let's try to do some math things to help my brain understand. Pretty sure I did this when I first set up my loans, but it's been a few years, so time to refresh my knowledge of how interest works.

The quickest way for me tell what's happening is that I can see an `OUTSTANDING ACCRUED INTEREST` field at `$24.51`. That number should be pretty easy to figure out, since it's so small over such a short time frame. My payment date was December 4th and this statement is from December 10th. So that's 6 days of interest. I also found a small line item in the middle of the 3 page statement that says 

&gt; Interest Calculation: Interest accrues daily based on your outstanding balance and the number of days between payments

I don't really know what the `number of days between payments` thing really means but `Interest accrues daily` makes sense. I remember some youtube video once talking about how the more often you take interest, the more money you'll make. One of those [Mathologer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dhHrg-KbJ0) or [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuA2EAgAegE) videos probably. I don't see the word `compound` anywhere on the statement, but I'll just assume it's compounding the interest, because honestly what bank on earth wouldn't.

So let's multiply the current balance by the daily interest `(.05375/365)` then multiply by 6 days. : `27,746.65*(.05375/365)*6=24.5158`

Seems good to me, it's probably off by a bit since I'm just multiplying directly instead of using that fancy interest formula, but these numbers are small enough that I don't really care, and it proves that I understand what most of the numbers mean now.

Alright, I've noticed that I'm paying way more in interest than I'd expect, and I've refreshed myself on how interest works. My question now is, will I continue to be paying this much forever? By the end of the loan, how much will I have spent on just interest? I doubt it'll actually still be 20%, but now I'm curious. Also, at this point I've gotten tired of doing my own math so I'll just go over to a [loan calculator](https://www.calculator.net/loan-calculator.html) to do everything for me, especially since I figured out what the numbers actually mean and know how to plug them in now. [Here is the calculator filled out for my case](https://www.calculator.net/loan-calculator.html?cloanamount=49279.21&amp;cloanterm=4.6465&amp;cloantermmonth=0&amp;cinterestrate=5.375&amp;ccompound=daily&amp;cpayback=month&amp;x=66&amp;y=11#amortized-result). I am paying $1000/m on the loans not $939, and idk how to make this calculator take that into account, so I'll just cheat and change the `loan term` to a number that forces the monthly payment to be $1000 (thanks [binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)).

Cool, so now that everything is filled out ([image](https://imgur.com/a/oh6Vmrj)), I can see that once I make my final payment the total percentage I'll have paid towards interest is actually just 12%. That's interesting, makes sense though since as I get closer and closer to the end of the loan more and more of the payment will be towards the principal. 

Just for a last round of fun, let's throw that [Amortization Schedule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization_schedule.asp) they gave me into a spreadsheet and visualize some things. Specifically, I want a graph to show me how much [total interest will I will being paying over time](https://imgur.com/a/66ncDEZ) and [what percentage is that of my total payment](https://imgur.com/a/M3SbIeZ). Interestingly this is showing my total to be 13%, not 12%, but whatever. From those graphs I can see that my total interest being paid is increasing at a smaller and smaller rate as time progresses, which is at least something to look forward to.

---

The main conclusion for myself is to remember that the `interest rate` is **not** the total interest I'll be paying once my loan is paid off. I know that mentally, but emotionally, or using [system 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#Two_systems) or whatever, it can be an easy trap to fall into. 

2nd conclusion: Amortization Schedules are a lot less scary and more useful than I thought. Basically just shows you every step of the calculations. Now that I understand what they are, I think I'll go take another look at those retirement plans I just kinda picked at random for work.

Final conclusion: student loans are dumb.",finance
gaming,The first time I played Journey and why it’s a beautiful game,"When I first played journey I went into it without knowing anything about the game other than what it looked like. Soon after I started I met an NPC who I thought was really quirky, I was really surprised at how well the AI for the other scarfed traveler was able to communicate with me through simple chirps. It was strange how they could communicate complicated thoughts  such as “follow me”, “watch out for that giant monster eel thing” or even a sense of closeness and also loss. Later on as the game came to a close I was delighted to find out that the quirky AI was not an AI at all and was actually another player seamlessly paired with me for the duration of my play through. I quickly got on PSN to send a message and a friend request to my new friend but when they messaged back I was shocked to see the response was written entirely in Japanese. I tried to pursue a conversation with them, using things like google translate, but it was obvious that our words weren’t being conveyed correctly and the whole thing was so difficult and overly complicated. All I could think about was how much easier it was to communicate in a game without words. I have to admit I cried, it’s upsetting that something like that stopped me from talking to this person when I had just spent several hours with them enjoying their company. It’s beautiful that journey has such a simple solution to such a complicated problem.",technology
personalfinance,"23 years old and finally got a decent job. should i pay off my student loans, invest, or keep saving","Im 23 years old and got a new job about 5 months ago. Im making about 42k, but work occasional part time jobs so it could be a couple thousand more. I still live with my parents and due to my income last year, i havent had to start paying off my student loans. Currently my only expenses are my car and insurance payments which together are about $600/ month.

Since I started my job I have bought a few things I've wanted but could never afford, such as a new car (0% interest). i basically have everything i really wanted to buy so have been saving. I just hit 10k in savings. I have a 401k taking 3% of my income, with a company matching most of it. i dont have any other investments. I owe about 30k in student loans, and have no other debts besides my car, which im paying no interest on so im not conserned about that. Im not sure what my student loan interest rate is.

I live 50 min away from work, and I would like to move out in the somewhat near future, but dont really want to spent 700/month in rent when i dont have to. My idea is to try to purchase a multi family home and rent out half, or purchase a house, fix it up a bit and sell it. this way i can move out, while investing my money.

So my question is, Is this a good idea? My other thought was to take most of that 10k and put it straight towards my students loans. Should i keep saving for a house, try other investments, or take out a chunk of my loans? 

Thanks in advance",finance

* * *

Tesla disappointed investors Tuesday, saying it delivered less vehicles than expected during the fourth quarter despite efforts to ramp up production.

Its shares fell by about 5 percent in premarket trading.

Tesla previously gave investors hope that its production rates would improve, saying that the number of labor hours to build the Model 3 fell by more than 30 percent from the second to the third quarter. The company also told investors in late October that it took less time to build than the Model S sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle — another first for the company.

""We will focus even further on cost improvements while continuing to increase our production rate"" during the fourth quarter, the company said at the time.

CEO Elon Musk announced Oct. 23 that the company planned to limit certain options on its higher-end Model S sedans and Model X SUVs to streamline production. The company also announced plans during the fourth quarter to start selling a $45,000 version of the Model 3, before raising the price $46,000. It has yet to produce the base Model 3, which it has promised for a price of $35,000 before incentives.

The fourth quarter marked an end to a $7,500 federal tax credit that Tesla was able to use to lure buyers in the past. That was cut in half to $3,750 starting Jan. 1.",finance

For debt I have a student loan of $1200 (started at $6k 3 years ago and I’m paid ahead by 3 years) at a fixed 4.410% interest rate. I have a Zales credit card that I have a balance of $530 that will be paid off by March. I have a used car that I recently got (my old car was going to cost more to fix than it was worth) that I owe $14,000 on over 66 months with a fixed 4.210% interest rate. I have a Ulta MasterCard (which earns 1 point at Ulta for every $3 I spend outside Ulta) which I use solely for gas. I have a target red card which I only use twice a month for toilet paper and paper towels (they are cheaper there than at the grocery store). I have a credit card through my bank that I only use for groceries. This credit card is also my emergency credit card if god forbid something happened (which hasn’t yet) 

Here is where my money goes. 

Rent: $640

My husband and I share a joint savings (trying to save for a down payment on a house) which I put about $100-150 in every month and he currently puts $50 a month into, that has a balance around $3500. 

My plan is that once my Zales card (which we used for our wedding rings) is paid off that I won’t be anything else on it for the time being. I will use that extra $200 a month and split it between my student loans and car payment. Once my student loans are paid off I will use that extra money towards extra on my car payment and put more away in savings.

It appears I did not file my 2016 taxes locally, but I did for federal and state. I am now being fined by the state of Ohio for what I owed in 2016 both state and locally. I have been living out of my van and have not been the best about keeping up with my mail.

CryptoCurrency,$1.1 Million Bitcoin Lawsuit Alleging Craig Wright Is Satoshi Continues,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/mx5bhhtr11821.png

[https://cryptoiq.co/1-1-million-bitcoin-lawsuit-alleging-craig-wright-is-satoshi-continues/](https://cryptoiq.co/1-1-million-bitcoin-lawsuit-alleging-craig-wright-is-satoshi-continues/)

 

A $1.1 million Bitcoin lawsuit  against Craig Wright in the United States District Court for the  Southern District of Florida continues, with the latest ruling handed  down on Dec. 27. 

The plaintiff is the Estate  of Dave Kleiman, and it alleges Kleiman and Wright mined 1.1 million  Bitcoins together during the early days of Bitcoin, and when Kleiman  died, Wright laundered the money into his own accounts and did not give  anything to Kleiman’s heirs. The lawsuit further alleges that Craig  Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto, which has been on and off a heated debate in  the crypto space. 

[In the latest order](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6309656/68/kleiman-v-wright/),  the court dismisses two counts against Wright, while Wright must  respond to the other seven counts by Jan. 10. Count three, which was  dismissed, is an allegation that Wright misappropriated trade secrets  belonging to Kleiman related to smart contracts and blockchain  technology. Count four says the theft of trade secrets violates the  federal defense of trade secrets act, and this count was also dismissed.

**Estate Of Dave Kleiman Asks For $11.4 billion Judgement**

The [remaining counts which have not been dismissed](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6309656/24/kleiman-v-wright/)  are far more serious. Count one demands $11.427 billion or the return  of the Bitcoins and forked assets, like Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, etc.  

Count two alleges that the  theft of the Bitcoins is unjust enrichment. Count five alleges that  Wright breached his fiduciary duty to Kleiman. Count six alleges that  Wright did not pay for Kleiman’s share of their joint company. Count  seven alleges that Wright committed fraud while taking Kleiman’s assets  and intellectual property, including the forging of contracts and  signatures. Count eight alleges that Wright committed fraud against Dave  Kleiman’s children and tried to use them to cover up the fraud. Count  nine asks for a permanent injunction against Wright to return all stolen  Bitcoin and intellectual property.

A jury trial is scheduled  for June 10 in which these standing allegations and claims will be  decided. Wright tried to have the case dismissed [with a motion in April 2018](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6309656/12/kleiman-v-wright/),  offering reasons why the court does not have jurisdiction to rule on  this case. However, the judge has decided in the most recent order that  it does have jurisdiction, and the case will proceed. 

**Evidence In The Case Alleges Craig Wright Is Satoshi**

The most intriguing part of this case is the evidence presented that Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto in the defendant’s [amended complaint](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6309656/24/kleiman-v-wright/).  Apparently, Wright and Kleiman met in 2003 and communicated about  various technological topics for years after that. In 2008, they  co-authored a paper on the mechanics of overwriting hard drive data. 

In March 2008, Wright  emailed Kleiman and said “I need your help editing a paper I am going to  release later this year. I have been working on a new form of  electronic money. Bit cash, Bitcoin … \[y\]ou are always there for me  Dave. I want you to be part of it all.”

In late 2008, Wright sent  another email to Kleiman, saying “I need your help. You edited my paper,  and now I need to have you aid me build this idea.” On Jan. 12, 2009,  only nine days after Bitcoin launched on Jan. 3, Wright and Kleiman sent  each other Bitcoin transactions, making them some of the earliest  Bitcoin users. 

The lawsuit alleges that  Kleiman and Wright mined 1.1 million Bitcoins together, and these are  all identifiable and stored in Wright’s wallets. Wright indicated that  he has this tremendous amount of Bitcoins during a speech in which he  said he had [more money than the country Rwanda, where he was speaking.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqOtKCUfP1M)

In May 2016, Wright claimed to be Satoshi in a series of blog posts. The best evidence that Wright is Satoshi was [a blog post from early Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen](http://gavinandresen.ninja/satoshi).  In the post, Andresen claims that Wright signed a message with  cryptographic keys that only Satoshi could possess. Ultimately Wright  never released these sign messages to the public, leaving the claim in  doubt, and Wright is now commonly referred to as faketoshi.

As this case enters the  trial period, it will certainly shed light on the true nature of Craig  Wright’s early involvement in Bitcoin, and whether he really is Satoshi  Nakamoto.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Defaulted on Federal student loans and I've been told they are at a collections agency but I can't find out who so I can pay them,"My wife has about $30K in federal student loans. She was paying on them for a while but then she went into forbearance and then defaulted on them. We have not made an actual payment towards her federal student loans in a couple of years now but we have not received anything letters or anything about it. Eventually the government just started taking our entire federal tax return to cover interest. My wife tried to find out how to start paying on the debt again and she's logged into studentloans.gov but we can't find anywhere to actually make payments.

A while back she called and was told that her loans had gone into collections and that agency would reach out to her for setting up payments but that was over a year ago and we still have not gotten anything from anyone.

Is there any way to find out what collections agency has her federal student loan debt?

personalfinance,HS Personal Finance Teacher with Question - Does compound interest really matter?,"I've taught for many years and have a project in which students explore the huge difference that interest, time, and contributions can make financially.  I've had them use compound interest calculators to determine these amounts.

I also talk about savings vs. investing, and how they're for different purposes (emergency funds vs. building wealth).

But it got me thinking -- what **investment** actually creates compound interest? (CDs and MM accts are considered 'Savings Tools' and not investments for the purpose of my class, plus have typically abysmal interest rates for wealth creation). This questioning all started when I had a student ask, based on a scenario from the project, what kind of investment or savings tool provided something like an 8% compound interest rate of return. We specifically discussed that stocks don't provide compound interest - just capital gains earned at the time of sale (and then determining rate of return at that time).

Compound interest is an important vocab term to teach, but I don't know that it's worth actually exploring when I could spend more time on other PF concepts (i.e. more insurance! taxes! we have a lot to talk about in this class). 

So I wanted to check in with you experts. Am I totally off base here? I'll still teach the value of time, interest, contributions (especially in consideration with debt) but in terms of exploring the use of **compound** interest with investments, I am uncertain.

We have 3 months expenses in savings plus a little.  My husband’s job is secure so we’ll only lose half our income making that stretch to 6 mo. plus we can tighten the purse strings). We add to this account monthly for maintenance and emergencies. 

I have $200/month to play with that I have been putting on the house principle as it has the largest debt &amp; highest rate.  I plan to snowball other debt payments into each other as they are paid off.  (Three years into my 10 year plan to be debt free). 

Advice please: Should I put that $200 extra on the vehicle principle even though it has a lower interest rate (1% difference) to pay it off in two years and thus free up $426/mo. (1 year early) or keep on pounding away at the biggest principle as it will save the most in the long run?

(up for tenure in a place where they’re trying to get rid of tenure - of course I’ll do all I can to keep my job - will have one year notice if I need to find a new job but I’m in my mid-40’s, have kids,  and anchored by hubby’s job so new job will be a challenge).

Edit-additional question:  Thanks for all the great feedback. I will pay off the car and start reducing spending.  But, you have lead me to an additional question.  I thought I was good having 3 months in savings but now I’m uncertain.  In addition to the extra $200, I am paying an extra $400/mo. on the home loan so we can pay it off before it becomes a variable rate.  (15 yr fixed/15 yr variable) Should I stop that extra payment as well and put it towards savings? I worry that the changing house payment would really impact us down the road. We owe $105k.  Don’t know max interest rate off top of my head if there even is such a thing.  Other debts are student loans at $8k (1.8% interest) and $60k.

personalfinance,Paying off student loans via windfall - consolidate first or strategically pay off certain loans before consolidating?,"This is in the US. My wife and I received a windfall take-home sum of $120,000. We currently have just north of $200k in debt from 6 student loans at various fixed interest rates. Ignoring the debt-snowball method and assessing from purely an interest standpoint, which of these three scenarios are likely to yield most favorable results?

1.) Consolidate ALL loans and then pay off 60% of the consolidated loan.

2.) Pay off as many individual loans as possible prior to consolidating. We can afford to pay off the 4 smallest loans entirely as well as most of the 5th smallest.

3.) Pay off the loans with the highest interest rates first (5.80%, 5.59%, 5.34% partially) and 3a.) consolidate remaining 3b.) not consolidate at all.

Loans are as follows:  
$71k @ 5.80%  
$77k @ 5.34%  
$18k @ 5.59%  
$20k @ 5.06%  
$14k @ 5.00%  
$8k @ 4.375%

We’re in a position to consolidate to a 5 year loan. While the monthly payment amount is a concern, the priority is to minimize interest payments. I’m curious if loan consolidators will give the most preferential interest rate for a larger principle, smaller principle, least amount of loans, or loans with the least amount of interest.

personalfinance,Advice of Possibly Refinancing Student Loans,"Hi!

So my current situation, I've been out of college for almost 2 years now. I have 54k in Parent Plus Loans under my Dad and about 37K under my name only. All are Federal loans, none are currently private. I try my best to pay above the standard each month but I fairly recently moved 8 hours away so money has been tighter than normal.  My dad doesn't help pay for the loans he cosigned, he simply has some under his name. The loan's under the parent plus loans range in interest from 7.9% to 6.8%. The loans in my name are mostly 3.6% with one exception at 6.6%. The ones under my name alone I'm not particularly worried about but the one's in my Dad's name I have several concerns. I believe the best course of action is to get the student loan's in my Dad's name refinanced but I'm not sure if they can be refinance by him alone, co-signed refinance (if that's a thing), or simply refinance it in my name. I have a credit score of around 680 but it'll go up over the next few weeks once I pay off credit cards. I make about 55k a year and have a very stable job. There is also likely a raise in the next few months so my income should increase. I currently also have a car loan with about 22k left on it. I recently got married and she has 17k in student debt and makes 39k a year. I'm not sure if that will affect things. My parent's never went to college and this is new to all of us.

I've been trying to read and do my research to figure this all out on my own, but there's so much information it's hard to sort though. Currently, I'm making about 15k a year and am in an income based repayment plan for my student loans (roughly 25k) that has my monthly payments at $0 a month for the foresee-able future until my income changes. It's taken me a seriously long time to get my ducks in a row and try to make my financial situation improve, but I'm finding getting on track to be harder than I expected. I don't have any credit cards, my credit is at best average due to no real credit history aside from student loans and I haven't been quoted at all a good interest rate, and I do have a small portion of my income going into a retirement account through my employer. At this moment, I have a savings and checking account through the same bank and essentially live paycheck to paycheck with little extra. Moving isn't a current option to lower my rent, and I'm already living with a room mate. I've been trying to look at getting a line of credit, investing, or possibly even going back to school to finish my degree in hopes of a better job, but I don't know the best step financially at this point.

I don't know where to go from here. Past itemizing and keeping better records of what I spend to build up a nest egg, what other steps can I take from here to get on the right path? I feel like I can't start paying off my student loans because that would set precedent that I can and take me off of my current plan, but going back to school would build up more debt unless I pay it all out of pocket. I'm even afraid getting a better job would mess me up farther because of my student loans and the payment I would be required to make. A line of credit would build my credit, but the only offers I've received have a stupid high interest rate of something to the tune of %24. I do have two small things in collections I plan to pay off, but I have no major capital to use to try to work myself into a better position. I have been considering investing small amounts to try to build up some money for the future, but I'm not sure this is the most logical first step. Does anyone know what the first step I should take should be? There's so many options I'm at a loss as to where to start. Thank you in advance, and thank you to everyone who posts here.

personalfinance,Wondering if I should actually drop my student loans or just pay them,"Hi all, so I probably have a rather simple question. I have around $5500 of [Federal Subsidized Student Loans](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized) taken out for this year. As it (happily) turns out, I actually took out too large of a loan for this academic year. I have around $2300 in excess.     
        
My question: Should I cancel $2300 worth of my student loans? Or should I just use that $2300 to pay them down? The only reason I was considering using the money to pay the loans down, rather than just cancelling (which seems safer), was because I thought maybe paying them would help my credit. I don't know though. It's also worth noting that since they are Federal Subsidized Loans, (to my understanding) I don't start paying interest on them until I'm 6 months out of school. I'm only a sophomore in college so I guess I could technically just keep them, and use the excess money to pay for next year.      
         
So I figure my options are: 1) cancel $2300 worth of the loan, 2)use the $2300 to just pay the loan down, or 3) just keep the money for next year. What do ya'll think I should do?

Our max home purchase price would be $215k so we'd stay around $1400 a month.

personalfinance,Help! I consolidated CC debt for less monthly $ and lower interest %.,"Hello PF! I've posted on here before and creep the page often, the advice is always awesome! So I want some thoughts.

Anyway,

I'm usually pretty tight shipped about my finances but we all makes mistakes, I worry about my credit like a newborn baby, so its always been great. 

However, 
I took out a $3500 personal loan to consolidate two of my CC that got maxed out. (Usualy I keep a steady little &lt;33% C/D ratio)  I like to use my cards. It was job loss/change and some other woeful spending that got me in the maxed card/min monthly payment cycle, its the only negatively affecting thing on my score, which I've juggled for about 6 months.

I finally educated myself on consolidating loans and explored options thru credit companies/things like credit karma. But every place wanted secured loan (my car) or unsecured at 30% interest. I finally called my Credit Union and even with the ding on my credit, offered money in seconds. (I have a great relationship plus great repayment history.)

So damage done: 3 year note with 11% interest, and monthly payment saves me 20 bucks a month than what my CC payments were and with over 20% interest. (I'll probably still pay the average amount to pay off faster)

I know it's a higherish interest rate and its essentially just moving debt around as opposed to paying it off but presented my options for my life, credit, budget, finance health, etc this was the best fit. I feel like I started 2019 on a good note.

No, I wont allow myself down that road again. I have a 3rd CC that I barely touch, so it's not a habitual problem I'm in, this is all uncharted for me. A big fear in life is being homeless/desistute by my own actions so my anxiety skyrockets when it comes to finances. Usually, I'm the person my friends ask what to do financially and never thought I'd be in this position. Yet here I am. I have the usual American debt: car, cc, student loans and here soon, a mortgage. My budget and debt was always doable until these past few months and I want my ducks in a row for the best possible credit when it comes time to buy my home (summer of 2019). 

So my questions are: 

A) With my (payment pending) completely free credit lines and credit on the rise, what power/tools do I have to use against the credit companies? Expand credit line? Argue lower interest rate? Tell them peace out, cancel the cards and take the credit hit for new cards/company? 

B) What better ways can I manage my credit for a higher score? I'm 23, currently renting but working a deal to buy the duplex I'm in when the lease is up (Owned by family friend) and make around 40k/yr. My highest score ever was lower 700s. My parents have a golden 800 something and for the life of me, even when my credit was its healthiest, I was struggling to find ways to increase the score. 

C) Open ended for anyone: What are some tools to help resist the slippery slope of CC debt? I realize my situation is not super upside down and my budget allows for me to fix this with proper discipline. But for anyone else struggling or the future, I can reference this post.

Thank you, thank you, thank you so much to anyone in advanced and sorry for the lengthy post. I'm just trying to start my year off right.",finance

personalfinance,Pay Off a PMI or Invest in Rental Property?,"Hello All!

I'm a 58 year old high school teacher. I bought a home 4 years ago but only put 10% down and wound up with private mortgage insurance (PMI) which raised my $700 monthly mortgage to $900. I didn't think too much of this at the time because I own a rental home that nets $500/month after deducting for taxes, insurance, property management fees, and another mortgage.

According to the mortgage holder for my primary residence, I will either need to pay $19,000 (which I have) to pay off 20% of the principal in order to get rid of the PMI OR I could wait for another year and a half at which time I will have owned my home for five years and the PMI will be dropped.

The area I live in has an acute shortage of apartments and rental units. I found a condo which could begin generating a 20% return on investment as soon as the unit has a tenant. 

So here's my question. Should I invest in a 2nd rental property and just wait for another year and a half to get rid of the PMI or should I fork over $19,000 to get rid of the PMI now?

I also thought about refinancing but with interest rates up, I doubt if I'd get a better interest rate than what I have now.",finance

personalfinance,Backdoor Roth IRA Conversion Mechanics,"Hi all, I've received a bunch of helpful info from the community in the past, and have a couple quick questions here around the mechanics of setting up the backdoor Roth IRA, as I'll be doing it for the first time in 2019. 

In short:

1. When I go to transfer the funds to my Roth IRA after depositing 6,000 in my Traditional IRA, I have the ability to elect NOT TO HAVE federal taxes withheld, or TO HAVE taxes withheld. What is the implication here, and which is typically used for backdoor Roth conversions?

2. Do I need to first acquire shares before transferring the funds, or can I do the conversion from my ""core position"" (without purchasing any shares until the $$ shows up in the Roth IRA)?

personalfinance,"My parents made a series of terrible decisions, now want to unload $90k of debt onto me. Not sure how to proceed","Going to avoid too much detail, since it won't help me find a way out, and it is frustrating to recount, but a barebones description:

29/M/NYC/making just over 100k/year

My parents took out ~$56k in student loans for two years of my college education of 2007-2009. They initially said they would pay it off for multiple reasons which I will not get into.

Now, they've brought me the news that they never paid it off, and in fact didn't make any payments at all for two years. For reasons, they decided to consolidate this debt along with some other things at an interest rate of 8%, this was maybe 2010. 

I've been asking about this debt for years, but since it was repackaged into this debt consolidation loan, they were always evasive on what exactly was still owed for my education.

Fast forward to this week, they've finally broken it down for me, largely out of an inability to pay it off.

My portion of the debt is approximately $90k, and I am in absolute shock and have no idea how to move forward, so here I am.

A few questions:

1) Given the student loan was repackaged, is there is no way for me to write off any of the interest accrued?

2) I cannot borrow money from friends or family, so I will need to apply for a personal loan. Where should I begin? What kind of interest rate can I expect with a good credit score? How do I present the reason for the loan?

3) What else can I do aside from cutting spending to bare essentials and paying this down as fast as possible?

I am a little bit at a loss here, as they never let on how serious this had become. I still haven't even told my wife, I thought I was literally two months away from being debt-free from my other student loans for the rest of my education. Now I feel angry and horrified at the reality of what they did for the past near decade with this debt.

Thank you in advance

EDIT:

Additional details

- no, I am not *legally* on the hook as they are not in my name

- One was parent PLUS, the others I don't even remember and cannot figure out b/c they repackaged into this consolidated debt

- I have to pay this off, they cannot and my dad is already nearing ""retirement""

EDIT2:

- it was bundled with a sibling's student loans, they are in the same boat I am (though for a slightly higher amount due to price differences in school)

- Yes, I understand this is their foul-up, but the alternatives are just as horrifying. Do they declare bankruptcy? Neither of them has many working years left. If this doesn't get sorted, I'll still be on the hook when the problem is magnified by loss-of-work and their social security check just goes towards the interest on this insurmountable debt in a couple years.

- I'm equal parts sad and angry, which is why I have not had any further discussions with them on details. I am still quite emotional, and am trying to find the most dispassionate way forward

EDIT3:

Thank you all for your answers. A lot to chew on, and obviously didn't expect some silver bullet to come out of this, but the sanity check has been very helpful in establishing the next step rather than fretting over analysis paralysis.

Long Time Lurker but extremely invested in stretching out my $$$ for the past few months, I hope to do all that I can while sustaining my lifestyle as I work in demanding/stressful field.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently living in NYC - high cost of living but I have a near ideal situation at home with decent job.

&amp;#x200B;

As of now:

27 years old - in graduate school (about $25K/year going PT in university, have $12K paid for by my employer)

Caveat is that I have to maintain my FT status at my job, so school PT, work FT, sleep/survival in between.

&amp;#x200B;

Savings: $75K (having worked &amp; currently employed as a nurse for the past 4-5 years)

Emergency Fund Accumulated: About $15K

&amp;#x200B;

Paid off all debt, about $2k/month, $3-$4k if factoring in cost of graduate school across year, $12.5K/12 = (+\~$1.1k)

Rent - $1200 \[includes utilities\]

Commuting Expenses - $100-$300

Food - $500-750

Car Insurance - $150

Monthly School Cost - $1100-$1200 \[books\]

Maxed out on Retirement Savings - I put about 18% away per paycheck though TransAmerica.

Currently the Funds I have through TransAmerica

I have a few questions regarding the actual transAmerica retirement platform, mainly there is voluntary contribution and Roth contribution, I wanted to know if this is the same or different than a Traditional and Roth IRA. Again, I contribute about 12% to the ""voluntary contribution"" and 6% to ""Roth contribution"". I am guessing it is entirely different due to the fact that I contribute $18k to it.

Employer Match - Last year was my first year that I was eligible to match with my employer's contribution (3%).

&amp;#x200B;

As of right now, I feel like I have a huge chunk in my savings, hoping to find ways to A. create and diversify portfolio.

I am a bit unsure how to proceed as of right now, I am sorry but I have gleaned over countless stickies, and maybe I am missing something as to what to do...or maybe HOW to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

A. Walk into a bank and talk to an advisor?; Open IRA this way? Is there an online way to create IRA?

B. How do I even begin to invest? Is there an online portal, maybe open vanguard account? Is this any different from what my retirement fund is? I've followed the flowchart algorithm but it stops after maxing out retirement funds.

personalfinance,"AMR sent my bill to collections even though I have complete coverage, was never sent a bill, and my secondary insurance was never billed. What are my options to fix my credit?","Long story short, I got horrible food poisoning in November of 2017 and had to take an ambulance ride to the hospital. I was so dehydrated from the vomiting that I was passing out and hallucinating. I was taken in my underwear and had no identification or insurance information with me at the time. My primary insurance (which sucks) covered about half of the bill, but there was over $750 left on the bill which should have gone to my secondary insurance. Fast forward to today and I have a massive hit on my credit score due to this being sent to collections. I called the primary insurance company and received an EOB that shows exactly how much was covered by them. I then called AMR and they told me to call the collection agency and that they would bill the insurance. I wanted to ask here if anyone has any recommendations on how I can repair my credit after having my insurance cover the bill. So far I've read that I can petition the reporting agencies like Equifax and Transunion or write a letter to the collection agency explaining that it wasn't my fault. Overall my credit was very good (around 750), but this has severely hurt it, leaving me with a score around 650 now. I'm applying for a personal loan to consolidate two of my credit cards and I want the lowest interest rate possible. Any and all suggestions would be awesome. Thanks!

I've been doing some budgeting and looking into my bills and found that my worst credit card is with USAA, which happens to be the first credit card I got (after joining, SCRA doesn't apply).

So I called USAA and asked if they could lower my rate. They said the interest rate is locked to the date I opened the account... no wonder it's 18.90%, it was my first credit card after all. I asked them if it was possible to open a new CC and transfer the balance and they said they couldn't (wouldn't?) transfer balances within their company. Finally, I asked them if there is anything at all that could be done and they said... no. 

So am I really stuck with this card until the balance is paid off? I've been trying to be aggressive while paying it off but... the expenses of a house have been setting me back. I already opened up 1 CC to transfer some of the balance 8 months ago for a 0% APR for 21 months.

Just looking for what my best option should be for this case... I have 3 CC total. USAA @ 18.90, Chase @ 4.00, and Citi at 0% for now.

personalfinance,"21 years old, college dropout. Freelancer. Need a plan to help pay off student loans, and general debt.","Okay, so long story short, I attended college for a couple years and accrued $16,500 in loans, of which $13,500 are subsidized, with those bills coming in I am assuming this summer, most likely June/July. $3000 of that is unsubsidized, so the 5% interest has already started accruing, roughly about $90 total. The interest rate for all of the student loans in total is roughly 5%.

Unfortunately, due to a lot of very idiotic decisions and investing way more than I could lose in cryptocurrencies in 2018, I'm $3000 in credit card debt. 

I make my money mostly off of freelancing photography and videography in various fields, of which I make around like $2000 a month as of now. I don't have any bills to pay as I still live with my parents, but they're broke af (taxi driver dad and mom works at a daycare) so I want to be able to start helping around as soon as I can. 

Obviously, I want to be able to pay off my student loans as soon as possible, however I believe as of summer when payments are due, I only have to pay like $120 to pay the minimum balance. Thought that was worth mentioning. 

I'm working on taking myself a lot more seriously in terms of my freelancing, so I hope to be making more money soon, as I've been making around $2000 without really dedicating to it until just around now, after dropping out. Assuming things are going bad, I am assuming I can pay off $1300ish a month towards all debt.

Ideally, I'd want to have all of my student loans paid off by the end of 2020, and my credit card debt paid off as soon as I possibly can. 

Also, I'm really uneducated on all this, but I was wondering if taking out a loan to combine all of my debts into one was a good idea or not.  The APR on my credit card is 17%, and once again the interest rate on my loans is 5%.

personalfinance,Am I calculating my federal withholding correctly?,"Hey PF, I recently decided to sit down and finally understand how my paycheck works as far as tax withholding calculations and such. It's always seemed like a blackbox to me, and figuring it out has been a rewarding experience. However, I don't think my HR is correctly incorporating my S-1 federal withholding allowance. 

My gross income per paycheck is $2,238.49 and I pay $39.50 in pre-tax benefits. According to the latest IRS Notice 1036, the formula to figure out federal withholding for filing single receiving a biweekly paycheck is:

*174.70 + (2,238.49 - 39.50 - 1664)\*22% = $292.40*

My HR is withholding $292.49 for Federal withholding, so I believe this to be an accurate representation of how they are calculating this withholding. But if my understanding of how allowances work is correct, then the equation should incorporate a $161.50 deduction:

*174.70 + (2,238.49 - 161.50 - 39.50 - 1664)\*22% = $256.87*

When I went and talked to my HR department they said they did not disagree with my math, but that they would not look into the issue because they are inputting the information correctly into their accounting software and are unable to fix the any problems that may be happening on the backend. This of course was an extremely unsatisfying answer. The difference of $35.53 per paycheck doesn't seem like much, but it's $923.78 annually.

However they did say that I can specify the amount I want withheld, and they can override the calculation with the hard number. I just want to make sure my understanding of how to calculate this number is correct before I specify an amount. Last thing I want to do is end up underpaying by nearly $1K and getting penalized because I was too cocky.

* My car payment is &gt;$100 per month more than my credit card payment which could then be used to work towards the next debt.  
* Once paid off, I could look into selling the Traverse and downgrading to a much cheaper car that I could purchase for appx $5,000 in cash and I could use the difference to put towards my other debt

Bitcoin was a true surprise and by the time the 'elite' became aware of its growing traction, too much of it was in the hands of the 'undesireables' (those who believe in it being a tool to break the hold of the 'elite' those with anarchistic (to some degree of other) mindsets

XRP/Ripple really is the 'elites' answer to it, and whilst it needs to be public to gain trust and traction, they want to control the majority of it via banks etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So a psyops campaign began.

&amp;#x200B;

HODL (from its inception on bitcointalk) was no accidental misspelling, it was purposeful and other users latched on to it via social engineering techniques - it was there to encourage people to gather and hold all the available bitcoin up

&amp;#x200B;

BTC Maximilists  - pushed on by the psyops campaign to encourage the 'vision of satoshi'  to bring those new to crypto with the anarchistic tendencies to BTC BCH etc etc

XRP hate - also fed by the campaign to discourage the undesirable from holding XRP

Once critical mass is in place, replace the binding of value of oil and  gold from usd to XRP and drop all value of BTC and other coins further impoverishing those they don't want.

personalfinance,Savings for Kids,"How are y'all investing the money you get for your kid(s)? We opened a 529 for my son when he was a year old but now we have 2 kids and a good chunk of change that I'm still deciding what to do with.

The only reason I am concerned about dumping all the money into a 529 is that if we end up not using it, the money would be subject to federal income tax plus a 10% federal penalty tax which would likely equate to 30% penalty for withdrawing it.

cybersecurity,I Am Looking For Your Cybersecurity Horror Stories,"Greetings. I have a request for all the cybersecurity pros out there. I am looking for your horror stories for my podcast, Security In Five. 

Being in the industry for 20 years I know behind the scenes how things really work, the decisions that are made and not made and the reasons why. I also know how most breaches occur from internal failures from negligence, Naïvety , or pure ignorance. Now, I am looking for yours.

The stories I am looking for are ones that I can spin into an educational message but also reveal reality. 

Here are some examples of stories -

\- Arguing with the Chief Architecture Officer that internally across 3,000+ databases, active directory and hundreds of internal web applications in a Fortune 100 company has zero SSL deployed. The reason, the CAO said it caused too much overhead on performance and they were behind the firewall. 

   \- Arguing with a Director on a project who came up with an idea, that almost went forward, to send all the internal Active Directory passwords to a 3rd party company in case the Siteminder Federation authentication broke, the users could login directly at the 3rd party with their internal credentials. Nightly feed to the client, all internal accounts, clear passwords. (this one actually made it to a project decision step)

   \- Simply discovering a breach, covering it up internally and telling no one during the fix. 

&amp;#x200B;

Those are the reality shocks I'd like to hear. Fully, 100% anonymous. No names, no companies or descriptions that would identify the company. Any names of people submitted I'll change anyway. 

Send them to [bblogger@protonmail.com](mailto:bblogger@protonmail.com) and maybe if they are legit sounding enough I'll get enough to do an episode series on them.

The truth hurts sometimes and the real behind the scenes stories need to be heard.

Thanks.

personalfinance,Keep investing in 403b or open Roth IRA?,"I'm in my thirties and have a 403b fund where I put 10% of my paycheck. I make about $60k/yr pre-tax.

I have about 10% of that in a fixed account with a 4% interest rate, which was grandfathered into our retirement plan.  The rest is divided amongst large, mid and small cap funds.  I try to pick decent ones with a low expense ratio.

I already have a 3 month emergency fund.  I carry no debt beyond mortgages.  I own two houses - one with about $10k balance and one at $16k, though both will need money put into them to fix them up.

personalfinance,Parents who would like to help their 3 Adult Children with their Massive Student Debt,"Because my Mother is not as adept with Reddit she has asked me to post this.  My mother and father are both retired and had rather successful careers in the government.  They now find themselves in a position where their only remaining debt is the student loans they co-signed for my siblings and I.

&amp;#x200B;

Between the 3 children we have close to $370k in student debt and what is problematic is the interest rates are all variable and range from 5.5%-6.16%.  My two younger siblings cannot afford to pay any of the principle and I am paying about $900 a month for my loans which in half a decade has taken me from \~120k to 103k principle.  My parents would like to help us get out from under this debt.

&amp;#x200B;

The first option my mother approached was their TST which is all IRA.  While they have about $500k they would be subject to about $200k in taxes and a 10% Penalty.  So we have all but ruled out this option.

&amp;#x200B;

The next option is that their house is paid off and is valued at $485k.  They are thinking of refinancing the house at a fixed rate and using the money to pay off our student loans in full.  They are worried that the closing costs would be too high to make this worth it.

Full disclosure, I'm not in camp buy-and-hold. If you are, you might not care about any of the below. That is fine, you don't need to explain to me the merits of your strategy, I understand it.


I try to buy or sell based on my interpretation of the fundamental value of the asset and whether the current price is cheap or expensive. The below charts are how I go about determining that. I am fully in camp index fund though - mainly because I don't feel like I have time to research individual commodities, governments or companies and so I focus on macro trends, which is what these charts focus on.


I mainly look to make moves for 2-10 year periods, maybe making 2-4 transactions a year to rebalance or increase exposure, so I'm fine with most of these charts even though they only update monthly or quarterly. If you're a day trader, this stuff won't help you much.

personalfinance,In Need of Tax Advice if Possible/Willing!,"Hi there! I’m so so sorry if this post is too long I just felt like I had to explain everything. 

 I figured this might be a good place to ask some questions about my tax situation. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated but if it’s not appropriate please let me know. 

My questions are here at the top and backstory/details underneath. 
*My questions: 

1. How many withholdings should I have so that I either receive a refund or completely don’t owe taxes or receive a refund? I know that I should probably base it off the IRS calculator but for some reason that doesn’t seem accurate to me. 

2.Any additional tax advice for my situation? 

*A little backstory: I’m 21, full time student with 2 part time jobs. My gross annual income in 2017 was about 13k, 2018 was about 14k (I got the 2nd job in Nov 2018). Income will definitely be higher this year- approx 18k if I keep both jobs. I’m about 25k in debt including CCs and student loans. No other debt. Still living at home (so my mom claims me as a dependent). I also have a Roth IRA and an investment account. In 2018, I paid on student loan interest, tuition, and made contributions to the above accounts (if any of this helps at all)*

I started working at one job in January 2017. When completing all the tax-related paperwork, my store manager told me that I should list myself as tax exempt (I think 0 withholdings?) because I was still a full time student. Without really questioning it, I just took her advice and said okay (this was my first “real” job &amp; I figured my store manager knew best-big mistake). The next year (2018), I began to become more aware of my finances and discovered Dave. I think I also entered a new tax bracket last year so I decided to use the IRS withholdings calculator. I don’t remember exactly but I think that it suggested that I add 1 or 2 withholdings. I asked my store leader about this. She still told me that I should be tax exempt. So naively, I left my withholdings as-is (at 0). When tax season came around last year, my mom’s preparer filed a 2017 return for me and I ended up owing somewhere around $500 in taxes including federal and state. Which I really hated. Any advice?",finance

personalfinance,[IL] Was heavily abusing substances and neglected to file taxes for a few years. What should I be doing now to prepare to fix this in the coming months?,"I want to gather as much information online about this before calling the IRS. Thanks for any help you can provide.

Background - fresh out of college I was hired into a well-paying but very high demand job. I thought it would be a good idea to get an adderall prescription to help me perform (it wasn't). Things were fine for a few years, but long story short, I ended up eventually addicted - there was a period of about 2.5 years where I was pulling all nighters playing video games and doing poorly at work while taking adderall 24/7. Eventually resulted in me losing my job, and I stayed unemployed for about 8 months.

During this time I didn't file 3 years worth of state taxes and 1 year worth of federal taxes. Yeah not good.

I'm 26 now, employed, and clean for about a year. I have no other debt and about $11k in cash + $70k in retirement savings that I could draw if totally necessary (would rather not obviously). I really want to fix this tax situation and put all of this shit in the past for good.

**What I have done to prepare so far:**

1. I know I will need old W-2s, and I read I can get these from the IRS website after signing up for an account, so I've done that.

2. Attempted to research on my own all that I can.

That's about it.

**Some questions:**

1. What kinds of penalties should I expect from the feds? I had pretty standard withholding and was making about $95k during the years I did not file. I've googled this but it's not totally clear from my research.

2. What kinds of penalties should I expect from the state of Illinois? I've googled this but it's not totally clear from my research.

3. Will the IRS website give me all the documents I will need to file? Or will I need to look elsewhere?

4. What other recommendations do folks have to deal with this? Any types of programs, etc. I should look into to help resolve this? Will I need a lawyer?

financialindependence,"How are you monitoring/controlling your income in terms of ACA (""Obamacare"") subsidy cliffs?","**TL;DR: As a FIRE person, how do you make sure you don't go over one of the ACA subsidy cliffs, given that you can't perfectly predict your dividend income, sideline work you might want to do, and other unpredictable sources of income?**

----

Obviously, this only applies to those who use or may use a subsidy from the ACA Healthcare Marketplace [*If you're not from the U.S., turn away now, this may make you feel unwell.*]. Given that the ACA is one of the great boons to FIRE people in the U.S., I think exploring this issue merited posting this financial management question here as its own post rather than just on the daily discussion thread.

I'm well aware of the subsidy ""cliffs"" associated with the ACA. If you're not familiar with that idea, it's basically that you can get a big tax subsidy to help pay for your health insurance, but after you make over a certain amount of money, even by one penny, thousands of dollars in subsidy go away. Doing one Fiverr task for $5 could be a net loss of $4k that year [Edit: Actually, if you're a 64 year old couple, could be a loss of [more than $20,000](https://www.weeklystandard.com/john-mccormack/watch-out-for-obamacares-subsidy-cliff-earn-1-more-in-wages-and-you-could-pay-20-000-more-for-insurance-778743)].

I searched for ""ACA cliff"" on this subreddit and only found one [other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8etut4/can_we_talk_about_the_aca_subsidy_cliff/) about it, from 8 months ago, but it strikes me as almost a key concern for pre-65 American FIRErs (who are not fully living off Roth withdrawals/Medicaid or who are so leanFIRE that they can live under a Medicaid expansion state's income cutoff). 

I prefer to use ""cliffs"" and not just ""cliff"" because it seems to me that in addition to the dramatic 400% Federal Poverty Level cliff, there are also smaller cliffs at 150%, 200%, and 250% FPL, at least according to the table found [here](https://rootofgood.com/affordable-care-act-subsidy/).

I don't want to only repost this same question. What I'd like to do is to make sure I understand exactly how my investment income and other possible income could come in in 2019 so that I can plan whether we are likely to surpass one of these cliff amounts *well before then* so I can try to avoid it. 

For example, I recently did a bank bonus deal and had to pause and wonder if the small amount of money from that deal could be what put me over an ACA cliff. A shame we have to think that way, but that's the reality currently.

One of my main areas of not understanding this is dividends in my taxable brokerage account. How can I know how much to expect each year? Being fairly new to investing, I haven't thought about these significantly before. 

Are there any other ""gotcha income"" relevant to FIRE or semi-FIRE people that could sneak up on you and push you over an ACA cliff?",finance
personalfinance,What to do about a Nelnet student loan interest rate of 7.25%?,"I logged into my federal student loan portal at Nelnet to check my loan and payment status, interested in finding out how much of $920/month payment goes to capital. 

I found that the interest rate is 7.25%, which is apparently a fair bit higher than the interest rates Nelnet has advertised going back a number of years. I don't honestly remember how high the interest rate was when I got the loan, but I didn't think it was *that* high. 

The upshot of this is that only about $150 of that $920/month goes to capital. With about $127,000 left on the loan, it's essentially never going to be repaid at that rate. What would you do in my place? Am I overpaying? How do I get one of these loans refinanced (should I go through Nelnet or somewhere else)?

personalfinance,Renting Out First Home(s),"I am curious to understand what's possible here.

My wife and I bought our first home 2 years ago. We originally had not planned to move for years. While we enjoy the house, it is only 3 bed 1 bed ranch. A nice dry walkout that could be finished. Even opportunity to build up. But at $250k... and on a road parallel to a highway, it's hard to say we'd ever see money back on it. Could it ever sell for $400k? A house down the road that had been modernized did. But not a sure thing.

Still, we have a beautiful 5 acre property. Behind us is 100+ acres of forested land that will not be developed. It's hard to know for sure if our house/property is really capped at started home level or could be more.

But why take the risk if we can maybe find what we want.

It's hard though... We want 5+ acres, would need privacy and being further from road noise. Plus, we have mountain views and want to replicate that. Let's just say it can be hard to find all this. Especially at a decent price point (for us, under $500k given joint $200k income).

We also have a 0.5 acre lot adjacent to ours with a mobile home. We don't rent it. I had planned to build a small / tall home that takes advantages of spectacular views. Maybe AirBnB (folks in our area do similar for $200 - 250 per might) and offset cost as much as we can.

Heck, if cost effective, maybe sell that for gain...

The home was a no brainer to buy but not quite sure if worth investing in further or should buy closer to what we want.

If we do... then what?

How feasible is it to get a second mortgage? We are looking at a house that checks nearly every box for $400k. It is a VERY rare find. I suspect it could be years to find something similar. 8 acres, longer driveway, cul de sac (i.e. quiet) and mountain views. It doesn't have a second lot but that's tax savings (well maybe more acreage and larger home is an offset).

Do we sell current home and adjacent lot?

Do we hold on to the adjacent lot and rent that?

Do we keep both and rent both?

It is unfortunate interest rates have come back up. My wife and I just purchased a new car this summer too (used $15k so nothing crazy but doesn't help credit score).

We have good joint income. We have potential to rent. Can we swing that? How can is that done? How risky is that?

If we sell... Sell first? Buy first? We only put 5% down so are currently underwater. Heck, we will be in same situation again.

Any and all help appreciated.

It's tough being an area with unique properties and a desire for acreage that meets very specific criteria. It makes house hunting like finding a unicorn.

We don't even NEED to buy now. But I sincerely fear we don't find something similar again, period.

Our house was in a family for 40 years. The house looking at now, built by those living in it now 30 years ago. Most of the homes in the area, especially with acreage simply don't come on the market, period. They stay in families for year. Or it is something with too much acreage and such a large/nice home it's selling for $1M+.",finance

Auto Insurance: $80 (current rate)

Gas: $100

Food: $300 (not eating out)

Total Cost (w/o rent): $1325

Remaining (monthly, before rent): $1550

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Conclusion\*\*

So I’ll have roughly $1550 before rent each month, but that should take care of most expenses besides rent and entertainment. 

&amp;#x200B;

How much could I realistically spend on rent if I want to save for a house? There are some nice large apartments outside the city for $700-850, but the ones I really love are roughly $950-1200 downtown and they only have &lt;=700sqft. 

&amp;#x200B;

How much can I spend on entertainment each month realistically? I like to golf, and do yoga, but those costs weren’t calculated in because I can reduce them each month. I’d also like to finally take a vacation, I haven’t been on a real on in four years.  

&amp;#x200B;

I know getting the credit card paid off is probably the highest priority, but will I be able to do that and save for the $150k house and buy in 2.5 years? Keep in mind, I’m guaranteed to get some decent raises over that 2.5 years. My plan is to not alter my life style much over the 2.5 years and apply my extra cash to paying off debts or saving, which is why I really want to get things figured out for when I first get there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I’ll have to budge on something, I’m guessing it will be rent (renting a lower cost place outside the city) and something else, but I’d like to get your input. Thank you all for taking the time to go over this with me.

btc,I am an idiot and I got scammed.,"I like to think I'm a veteran.  I've been in Crypto since 2012.  I've seen some shit, but today I got scammed, and I want to help others see that even self-proclaimed ""crypto veterans"" like my dumbass can fuck up and make scammers money.

&amp;#x200B;

My buddy came over today to bullshit.  He brought me a couple beers, and we decided to order some vape cartridges for him.  I fire up my Tails laptop to place an order from a reliable champion of the free market and guerrilla fighter of the drug war.  It's about .2 BTC.  I work on my third beer as he talks my ear off.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a Monero guy.  I like my privacy.  This vendor only accepts BTC, so I just fire up my phone Monero wallet, and rather than type the address into my phone, I use a QR code like I've done probably 100 times.  Search with DuckDuckGo for ""bitcoin qr generator"" and click one of the top links telling myself, ""make sure to verify the address before you send this.""  Well, he just keeps chatting away, even after my, ""hang on man, I've got to pay attention to this"".  The beers have me looking up and chatting back with him every few seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

I send the money to the QR address, see it went through on [xmr.to](https://xmr.to) (a XMR to BTC service) and the site still shows my transaction as unfunded.

&amp;#x200B;

I pasted my clipboard BTC address into a blockchain explorer, and sure enough, it's definitely got a confirmation.  I keep waiting, and then it occurs to me... the fucking QR code generator site fed me their BTC address, also replacing what was on my clipboard with their BTC address, and I had fell for their scam.  A review of that address TX history shows a couple other people a day fall for this scam site too.  It was only $800ish, but fuck me it still hurts.

Bitcoin,Others watching stockmarkets wondering if a big down trend has started and how BTC will react?,"The more I see the current trend evolve the more I wonder if the stockmarkets have started a down turn.
We are living in a debt bubble and although I fear the results of it popping one day it will happen.
I'm pretty convinced btc will react counter wise (like gold) but it will have to prove this since it never lived through a market crash or recession.

If the comming market crash will spill over to the bondmarkets it could become a fiat crisis.
Just imagine the fed starting QE with a rate that will make the previous QE just an exercise.
The alternative would be doing nothing, somehow I won't see that happening.

The scary part I guess will be the speed of these movements.
Once big money starts flowing I expect insane volatility...
In the stock markets we have all kinds of breaks to halt trading but what will happen with btc?
Can they stop exchanges, what will that do for otc or black market prices?
Will bank accounts be blocked to prevent capital to move into btc or other safe havens?

Most expect this btc down turn to last longer but that is without these external factors being taken into account.

personalfinance,CC debt or more Student Loan debt?,"I finish grad school in May and start my job in the end of September (not by choice, thats how my industry works). I've budgeted money to last through that that time, but in the off chance I need funds, which I cannot imagine being more than $5k, is it better to take out more student loans or to take on credit card debt? I know student loans have significantly lower interest rates, but if I opened a card with a lot of perks and began immediately paying it off once I have income I feel like the interest rate difference wont be that significant and the perks could more than outweigh the difference.

And just in case it matters, I have no current CC debt and a good credit score. Student loan debt is my only debt other than a small car loan. Loan debt is about 1/3 of national average for those graduating in my field.

Tl;DR: Possibly need \~$5k in funds for bridge financing between grad school and work. Is it better to take on more student loans or CC debt with its perks?",finance

personalfinance,Is holding out for Public Student Loan Forgiveness a terrible idea?,"Hi there,

I currently hold about $25k in student loan debt from a master's degree (average interest rate is about 6%).  I work for a public university and thus qualify for the Public Student Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program.  After the attention that this program has received lately, I should add that I have submitted all my paperwork on this and my loans DO qualify for this program.

For those that don't know, the deal is that if I make 120 qualifying payments on these loans while employed at this position (or for another public employer), the remaining balance would disappear.  Since the standard repayment plan is 10 years (120 payments), that doesn't do you a whole lot of good, so I'm currently on an income driven repayment plan.  Currently my monthly payment is about $175, which is almost entirely interest.  I believe the ""standard"" payment was somewhere in the neighborhood of $400/month.

To date, I have made 26 qualifying payments on these loans and thus have 94 remaining (March 2025, but who's counting).

I guess my overarching question is: Is what I'm doing a good idea or a terrible idea?

At the end of the day the risks are either:

1. I don't keep my same (or similar employer) for the next 94 months (but I like my job and have no plans of leaving), or
2. Political forces make the PSLF go away in the next 94 months

If I don't end of getting the loans forgiven for either of the two reasons above, I'm will have paid a ton more in interest than I needed to and I'll feel like an idiot.

In the grand scheme of things, I could pay the standard repayment amount now if I wanted to, but with three small kids and still paying off wife's student loans as well, having that extra amount every month is helpful.

I realize a lot of this is trying to look into a crystal ball and predict the politics of this country for the next 6 years (ha!), but I'm just curious what others thing?

Thank you.

personalfinance,Army Officer vs Federal Agent vs Local LEO: Best financial decision for early retirement?,"Hello all, not sure where to post this thread, but currently stuck in a dilemma of career options and would appreciate some advice in which you guys deem the smartest option for optimal income and quality life along with why

Backstory: Im currently a Second Lieutenant in the Army National Guard(Commissioned 2018) that is currently on active orders for training. I am currently 24 years of age with NO wife/kids.I have 3 years in the guard as an enlisted combat Engineer whilst conducting ROTC. I am one who believes in retiring early (43-50 as goal). Was wondering if you guys with insight can advise which path seems to make much sense to indulge in a 20-25 year career in. Things such as career/ social life balance, stress, body longevity,quality life,comfortable financial living, &amp; passion for bodybuilding continued means alot to me. Along with downright the smartest option is things to take into consideration.

Note: Please take the pros/cons with a grain of salt, as i have not been in other career paths to know much of anything other than the financial incentives via research.

**Option 1:**

Army Active Duty Field Artillery. Switch to active duty,fight to finish my 19 years remaining, and retire at the age of 43-44 with pension as an Lieutenant Colonel as Goal. Pension fights inflation, so according to a calculator i utilized, can retire with 90k by the time my year of retirement come (subject to change, modern days it 48-50k for those who did a 20 year career).Healthcare. Over the years would be able to save for a home fully buying one for 250-300k in cash and 90k vehicle as retirement gift (worked the math out, as a dave ramsey follower). I will live off of BAH(untaxed housing income army gives to live off post) for apartments.whilst saving good chunk for the home with my base pay cash.

Cons:of course is no over time pay for long days, potential rocky family life(if ever decide to want, 24 currently and not planning on it till after 30 or at all). Consistent moving. Body degrading due to extra physical requirements along with my bodybuilding.

**Option 2**: Customs &amp; BorderProtection,(CBP): Currently on hold since on active orders.Only Have polygraph left to do. I will retire at 50 with this option.

Pro: Double over time pay Up-to $45,000. Can transition into any other federal agency with my retirement time still counting towards the total amount. Will not moving excessively i dont believe (single so not a problem even if). Least physically demanding. Can easily max that double over time pay to its cap, as working long hours is nothing new to me as a [Soldier](https://Soldier.Degree).

Cons:restarting a whole new career, as I am not getting younger. Federal pension is not known for being the best out of the options from the research I've done. Hard to find alot of information on cbp specifically.(40-50k pension)

**Option 3:** Local Law Enforcement: Can conduct LAPD's expedited process(Im all the way from New Jersey) or conduct my final step of polygraph for Baltimore County that I am also on hold for because of my current active orders.Any department really. Would retire at 50-51 due to their 25 year requirement.

Pros: Unlimited overtime to maximize financial income capability, so areas that are in need is what i target. 50-60% Pension of whatever I maxed out in total overtime and such, varies

Con: restarting a whole new career, as I am not getting younger. No perks worth of having a Degree from a decently recognized University.

Additionally, I've changed professional jobs lately which upon leaving I had about 17k in a 401k at my previous employer.  

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas on the best way to attack this debt?  My thoughts after reading around include: 

1) Spending that windfall on the highest interest rate loans until I have about 12k in available cash in various accounts (for 6 months of emergency savings) since the market clearly isn't going to be making spectacular returns any time soon; 

2) Aggressively paying down the next loan with the highest rate with whatever I would have been paying toward the other loans that were paid off.

However, wondering if I should consider the following:

3) Refinancing loans (after I cut several of them down);

4) Is there any reason out there to take a payout from my previous 401k and pay it toward my student loans?  I'm inclined to let it sit or eventually role it over into an IRA since taking a buyout would mean taking early deductions and paying taxes on it.

5) Any good templates out there that can help with planning out how long the remaining loans will take to payoff?

personalfinance,Student Loans or Roth IRA?,"Trying to determine how I should be paying down my student loans and whether I should be setting aside any money for retirement.

I’m not clear on what this is, TBH. I have about $2K/month to pay toward loans/retirement. Is it fairly clear/obvious that paying down my higher interest loans (&gt;6%) will be the prudent choice? Or do I need to get a better understanding of the terms of the 401K? I’m not even sure what question to ask. By my calculation, if I pay all $2K toward my loans each month, it would take about 4 years to pay off. I also have 29 (of 120) qualifying payments towards PSLF but left my qualifying non-profit job for a higher salary. I’m in some trouble with only $10K saved for retirement at age 34 so am anxious to get started. Any advice would be much appreciated.

personalfinance,Should I invest in bonds?,"Hi there, seeing that the market is quite turbulent recently, I have been thinking about investing in bonds rather than stocks. However, I am not clear on how bond values change. Would appreciate some clarifications.

With stocks, your holdings generally rise in value when earnings are strong and the market is doing well, this is quite easy to understand. But with bonds, how do they rise in value? Since interest rates are rising, that should mean future bonds are generally going to be offering higher yields, and therefore the bonds I buy now should theoretically decrease in value with each interest rate hike, am I right? In this case, it seems only logical to forever hold out for ever higher interest rates? But surely I should be doing something with my idle cash?

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: I should add that I'm looking to purchase bond ETFs e.g. BND and BNDX. Many of you mentioned that by holding bonds until maturity, fluctuating market values will not affect my return.

She has a car payment which should be paid off on a few months with aggressive payments, no cc debt, and, here we go..., 100k in student loans! (It’s ridiculous, we know). And they are federal so no forgiveness. Her credit score isn’t great. Mine is excellent. She makes about 40k a year. She doesn’t have anything saved (she just got this higher paying job). 

We currently rent a house in a less-great area (we’ve had gunshots outside our house in the middle of the night - rare occasion but shouldn’t happen!), but overall tolerable for just us. We don’t want our future kids to live in this area. Rent is cheap at $500. 

We plan on being married in the next year and plan on having at least one spawn shortly after. Having a child is somewhat time-dependent since she is 29. 

We really like a house that is $155k, in a much safer place. A 30yr mortgage would be roughly $1000 per month, including pmi, home owners insurance, and hoa.  I’d like to purchase before our marriage since my credit is so good. I could probably sling this payment now, especially if I didn’t have my truck payment. 

I am considering throwing 4 grand from my savings at the truck to reduce that debt, then have it paid off by the end of the year.  I could also use that 4 grand on a down payment on the house. 

Should we pursue this house or spend the next 2-3 years hardcore saving and trying to eliminate her debt? Really concerned about her not being able to get pregnant. The way I see it: regardless we are going to have to kill her debt. It would definitely be easier to kill her debt while living in our current situation. On the other hand, time is ticking on her eggs, but it would be much easier financially to raise a child without having to worry about student loan payments. Renting anywhere else isn’t going to be any cheaper or safer than the $1000 mortgage payment. 

I think in typing this I may have answered my question. The thought of not having a child and having them in a safe, good home, depresses us much more than paying a student loan debt. Tell me I’m crazy though, would love some feedback.

I know closing accounts is going to ding my credit score, and while I'm not looking to do anything too credit intensive, I may be moving soon, so keeping that intact isn't necessarily a waste. So, I'm contemplating applying for a new CC with a better interest rate, so that I can hopefully close the accounts with fees, transfer a crappy interest accruing balance or two to something lower, and still have a decent debt to available ratio. 

Looking at my situation does it look like I'd have a good chance of getting approved for a good CC? I'm not sure what the equation of balances and inquiries is that makes it a waste of time, and I don't want to just end up with more inquiries on file and nothing to show for it.",finance

 I just got a call from the dealership(on 2 Jan) saying I actually need to pay Nevada tax on the vehicle since the Nevada DMV flagged it(when I asked how the Nevada DMV since it was registered in Florida and not Nevada the dealership got quiet and said it just needed to be paid since I am stationed here). They said I need to come pay them.

My question is since my contract has been finalized for so long and I can’t change the loan since it has been to long do I actually need to pay them the $3k they say I owe? I have called the Nevada taxation department and they said tax is do wherever you acquire a product but couldn’t give me an actual legal reference.",finance
personalfinance,Should I take a Loan from my parents to help pay off credit card/tax debt?,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are offering to help me pay off my credit card debt and possibly some tax debt. Here's my situation:

&amp;#x200B;

 I am an 1099 independent contractor. The last two years have been hard and I've had months where I've made very little money. Things are hopefully headed in the right direction (I expect to make significantly more money this year than the past two years, I will make around 100k this year if I meet my sales quotas) but I've had several months where I've needed to rely on my credit card to get through the month. Additionally, I wasn't able to put away money like normal for my taxes and I've had to back pay through an IRS payment plan. I have never missed a payment on anything, but my credit is suffering due to high utilization. I basically break even at the end of the month after living expenses, gas, etc. I keep my spending outside of work and living expenses pretty low, manage to save a bit in a Roth IRA every month, and have 2 other credit cards with a $0 balance that I use maybe once a year and immediately pay off.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I'm looking at 2 credit cards that are basically maxed out - one around $6k with an APR of 14%, and one around $3.5k with an APR of 25%. I owe the IRS about $2,300 that I've been paying monthly for 2017 taxes, I have not been able to put away money for my 2018 taxes either so I know this problem will persist until I can pay off the other debts and begin saving that money for taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are offering to help me pay this debt down and essentially consolidate this debt through a loan from them. I will pay them back with interest, but at a much lower rate than I am paying on these. These are my questions:

* If I take this loan, how should I go about paying these off? Just pay all three off in full immediately? Will this affect my credit score differently than if I were to pay them off in several increments?
* Taxes - what sort of tax implication does taking a loan from my parents carry?
* Other debts - I have a small student loan at 3.61% interest and an auto loan at 1.59% - Im considering these as my lower priority due to lower interest rates, but I do pay about $300/month on these combined. Parents have offered to help with these as well but I don't want to them to spend that much more money on me. Thoughts?

Any help is appreciated. Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,Pay debt or taxes,"I really tried to see if anyone asked this question but can't seem to find anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short. I owe 50000 in federal student loans (mostly at 6%). I am in my second year of self-employment (it will be my first full year). I am used to living off of 47000 at my previous job but if I continue to make what i'm making now and I increase the momentum, I can/will make close to 100,000 this year. Let's say that projection is correct. I would owe 30,000 in taxes. Would it be better to live super tight and pay off my loans and don't save for taxes and owe the government or to take it slow. Perhaps I am really asking, how fucked would I be if I chose not to pay my taxes in order to pay off my student loans?",finance

personalfinance,"[18][USA] Looking to make money, save, pay for college, and get my life on track early.","Hi guys, I recently turned 18 and am looking to save money for college. Currently, I have 1400 saved, which will be 2000 by the end of the month. I am with Wells Fargo however I've heard they're not the best and I'm looking to join another bank, preferably a credit union. I will qualify for Navy federal/USAA via family members but I'd have to convince them to vouch for me, and I am unsure if I should go with those two or try something local. Thoughts on this?

As for my income, I work about 20-30 hours a week for 8.50/hour. There is optional 401k but it requires a 6 month employment period which means I do not qualify. However, I believe I can start a Roth ira on my own(?) but I do not feel like that would be the best investment since I don't add much and the money I would be able to contribute would be minuscule. I was thinking about dumping all of my money into a 6 month CD just to have some guaranteed growth before college, but similar to before it'd be 20-50 dollars max, so basically nothing.


 For side gigs, I've thought of running a local business filing tax for the upcoming season, though I have no certifications and the only experience I have with filing is by paper and TurboTax programs. I would also like to run a writing/editorial outlet but I have no idea how I would get my feet into the water. Advice on starting up things like these would be appreciated. 

Finally, college starts for me next fall and I've got some issues in deciding what I should do. There's a college near me that I would be able to attend but it's not the most reputable, but it would cut down cost by a massive amount since I wouldn't have to pay for boarding or food plans. I would much prefer to leave my current living arrangement and get into the city where my other colleges are. I've compared financial aid calcs for all of my choices and I'd only save 2k by going to a closer college, and while I know it's not much in the long run, that's a ton of money. Plus, I know I'd lose out on networking by not being in a big city. 

As for how I plan on paying, HOPE and Pell grants cover a decent amount of my tuition, but I'll be on my own for the most part. I've applied for scholarships, but no luck so far. I've also been donating plasma for about $80 a week and I'll probably try to donate sperm in college. Other than that I'm lost and need financial guidance because the huge price tag on education is very daunting as someone who's been poor most of their life.",finance
personalfinance,Make Extra Payments Toward Student Loans or Mortgage?,"My wife and I have been making extra principle payments towards her student loans ever since we bought our first house a little over a year ago. Her loans' interest rates varied between ~3% and ~8%. We paid off the loans with the highest interest rates first and worked our way down. As of today, all of her remaining loans have an interest rate of 3.8% or less.  Our Mortgage interest rate is 4.125%. Our equity is also below 20%, so we pay about $50 per month for PMI.

Should we continue to pay off her student loans, or make extra principle payments towards our mortgage since it's a higher interest rate and accrues over a much longer period?

We're leaning towards paying off the student loans first since it's one of the only types of debt you can't get rid of if SHTF, but I also think it might be worth getting to 20% equity in our house first so we can drop the PMI payments. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!",finance

politics,Discussion Thread: 2019 Statewide Elections,"#Introduction

Happy New Year /r/Politics!

The 2018 midterm election may have only been a couple of months ago, but in this country, elections happen all the time. While the vast majority of states synchronize their state legislative and gubernatorial elections with regularly scheduled federal elections (either midterms or presidential), 5 states hold such elections in odd-numbered years. 

This year, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey and Virginia will be holding statewide elections. With the exception of Virginia, all of these states are not considered competitive on a presidential level, but state politics is considerably more competitive, and both parties are expected to invest heavily in these races. Below you'll find a chart showing primary, general, and registration deadlines:

^(**Mississippi also has a primary runoff scheduled for 8/27.)

^(***For the primary election only, New Jersey also has a change of party registration deadline on 4/10 if you are registered with a party that you do not want to cast a ballot in the primary for.)

***

#Description of Races

Many of these races are deemed competitive. Below are brief previews of these contests:

##Kentucky 

Kentucky is a solidly red state at the federal level, with no Democratic presidential candidate having carried it since Bill Clinton in 1996. Much of the state has shifted to the Republicans owing to traditional allegiance to the coal mining industry, despite once having a double digit Democratic registration advantage. 

Nevertheless, state level Democrats have done remarkably well in this state even as 2010 began a gradual realignment, and state Democrats are again targeting the Governor's race as incumbent Republican Governor Matt Bevin has suffered from low approval ratings. Leading Democratic candidates include current Attorney General Andy Beshear, who is the son of the Governor immediately preceding Bevin, and Rocky Adkins, former Speaker of the Kentucky House. For his part, Governor Bevin has kept mum on whether he intends to seek reelection, which has led to no serious GOP candidates seeking the nomination. All other row offices are also up for election, including Attorney General should Beshear win the Democratic nomination for Governor.

##Louisiana

Louisiana is also a solidly red state at the presidential level, yet has been receptive in the past to electing Democrats. In 2015, now-Governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, pulled a decisive margin over then-Senator David Vitter, attacking the Senator on his part in the DC Madam scandal from 2007. 

Governor Edwards has had decent approval ratings, leaving a number of high profile Republicans to sit the race out, including House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, state Attorney General Jeff Landry, and US Senator John Kennedy. Still, this is a very red state trending towards further Republican consolidation, and Congressman John Abraham is the first federal representative to join the race.

##Mississippi

Mississippi has not voted for a Democrat for president since 1976, and Democratic fortunes have eroded since the 2010 realignment, which saw Democratic majorities in the state legislature evaporate. Nevertheless, Democrats have landed what they hope to be a top tier candidate for this open seat race (incumbent Governor Phil Bryant is ineligible to seek a third term).

Democratic state Attorney General Jim Hood was at one point dubbed the last statewide elected Democrat in the Deep South, a distinction he held from 2011 until the election of Louisianan Governor John Bel Edwards in 2015. In his prior reelection bids, he has won at least 55% of the vote. Mississippi is home to the largest, by percentage, black population in the US, and Magnolia State Democrats are looking to the upset win by Senator Doug Jones in neighboring Alabama as inspiration for possibly winning the Governor's race for the first time since 2004.

Despite Hood's popularity, Republicans remain confident that the seat will remain under their control. A unique provision of Mississippi law holds that the winner of the gubernatorial election must win not only a majority of the popular vote, but also a majority of the state's house districts, or else the race is decided by the state House from the top two vote getters (a similar provision exists in Vermont, where the state legislature decides the winner if no gubernatorial candidate attains a majority of the popular vote). Prominent Republicans such as Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeve have also already announced for the race.

##New Jersey

New Jersey will hold elections for its General Assembly, with its state Senate having been elected in 2017. Democrats hold a supermajority in the chamber, and have been on the upswing in the state, having won all but one of its federal congressional districts in the 2018 election. It's not expected that this election will endanger the Democratic majority in the state, although demographic trends in the state held Democrats to only a single pickup in 2017.

##Virginia

Virginia will hold elections for both its House of Delegates and State Senate. In 2017, Democrats defied expectations, picking up 15 seats in the HoD and coming within [literally a coin toss](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/04/politics/virginia-house-drawing/index.html) of tie-ing the even numbered chamber while electing the first trans person to a legislative seat in the country. Democrats hope to expand those gains this year in an attempt to flip the narrow 2 seat Republican majority.

In the state Senate, Republicans again hold a narrow 1 seat majority (in the event of a tie, the Lieutenant Governor, a Democrat, would cast the tie-breaking vote). The State Senate was not up for election in 2017, so Democrats believe there are a number of Republican seats where the political demographics have shifted. 

Further complicating these elections is the possibility of newly drawn maps for part of the House of Delegates. 11 districts had been found by a 3 judge panel federal court to constitute a racial gerrymander, and a special election expert has been called upon to redraw them. The case is pending before the Supreme Court. 

***

If you live in any of these states, please make the effort to cast your vote. The 2018 midterm election showed that, no matter whether you are voting to Make America Great Again or to #Resist, your voice matters in the process. Even if you are not in a state holding statewide elections, numerous other states are holding local, judicial and other elections all the time. Be sure to also check that your voter registration is [current](https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/). Democracy isn't a spectator sport.

I’m in the military (I mention this because I know certain cards waive their annual fees for military) and I’m 20y/o. I have no credit at the moment. The only bill I have is my phone bill, which is attached to my debit card. I have a little over 1 months expenses in an emergency fund, and I’m working to build that to 3. I plan on using a credit card to “piggyback” (as Tim Ferriss calls it) on my not optional expenses/ things I would purchase anyways (such as my phone bill, the occasional eating out which I have in my budget, etc). This way I can build my credit and earn either points or cash back on the purchases I already make every day. I have checking and savings accounts at both chase and navy federal. Here are my three questions:

1) Overall what card can I get which would maximize my benefits? 

2) How does paying my balance go? Do I pay it all as a lump sum at the end of the month or can I go to an app somewhere and “pay off” whatever I just bought to ensure It’s done?

3) What other things should I consider when opening a credit card? I want to be sure to close all loop holes so whoever I get my card from can’t charge me for bs that I shouldn’t even be charged for.

Forex,Demo. Trading news/events-,"The picture is EURUSD 1 minute chart from today. Demo trade testing event-based trading. You can call it news trading or sentiment-based trading. Times in the picture are on my timezone. Non-farm payroll today. First decision: whether to trade NFP proactively or reactively. Proactively means making an educated guess about news (is it better or worse than expected, or as expected), reactively means trading after the news came out. I decided to trade reactively, because NFP is big news, which causes a lot of volatility, meaning that stop losses might not get filled. Proactive trading is better suited for lower volatility events.  


Market expected 177K, previous was 176K. NPF was very strong: 312K. At the same time, average hourly earnings upped the expectations: 0.4% vs 0.3%. The unemployment rate was a little bit worse than expected, but not too bad at 3.9% vs 3.7%. NFP was so strong that it was time go short EURUSD. It took 9 mins to get my order filled. NFP came 15:30 (my timezone) and I got my order filled at 15:39. After price had moved favorably I decided to move stop loss to breakeven. 16:45 there was final services PMI, which was a little bit better than expected: 54.4 vs 53.5. I decided to stay short. And moved S/L to a small profit.  


17:15 Powell speaks. I saw this as a risk event and Powell's speech might potentially reverse bearish EURUSD move. As you can see on the picture I decided to close my position little bit before Powell's speech. Powell talked about downsize risks, Chinese weakness, and that inflation isn't too strong. Fed can adjust policy if needed. This sounds more dovish than expected, and I tried to go long EURUSD. However, I didn't get my orders filled and I decided that I won't try to get them filled for too long.  I risked 2% and made a gain of 1.57%. Risk:reward is not the best, but I don't see this as a problem.   


What do you think about this kind of trading? I find this much more interesting than technical trading (not saying technicals don't work – I'm just not into them!). Can this kind of trading work?

personalfinance,Refinance car loan?,"A few months ago, my husband purchased a new truck. We financed with the dealership who use PNC, and were given a 4.74% interest rate over 72 months. Originally the loan terms were for something like 36 months but I preferred the longer term, believing that we would just pay extra toward the principal each month but we would have a more manageable monthly minimum if ""life happened"" (e.g. lost a job, major medical emergency, etc.). So far, this is what we've been doing - or so I thought.

Since the truck is my husband's, the account and everything was under his name, and we discussed how we would manage and maintain the loan. He set up the auto-pay for the minimum and then at the end of each month, we'd take whatever ""extra"" money we had and would make an additional payment. We believed these payments were going toward the principal only, but I finally logged on to the account because I wanted some info for my records, and I discovered that the payments were being put toward both interest and principal. I was pretty shocked at this, and nowhere does it look like we are able to make an additional payment toward the principal only. Additionally, the more we overpay, the later the next due date gets bumped out (next payment isn't due til this April) though this may not be important. I have never had a loan like this, and don't know where I should have looked for this. It does seem that we can start mailing in our payments and have the extra applied toward principal, but I'm unclear on the factuality of that.

I had purchased my own car a few years ago and financed with the dealer who used Chase, whose online interface was much more transparent and easily allowed me to make principal-only payments, so I know this is not an unreasonable expectation.

So - has anyone else had an auto loan with PNC and had this issue? Is there simply some mechanic I've overlooked? Should we look into refinancing with a different lender? (Thinking USAA as we already bank there, but open to suggestions.)

&amp;#x200B;

Edit to update: Learned we are able to make principal-only payments via mail, over the phone (incurs a $10 charge, though), or in person. We are going to look into refinancing as (1) we may actually get a better rate and (2) I value being able to make principal-only payments online (literally will save me the cost of stamps and gas/time of going in person). There is no prepayment penalty. So for anyone else considering starting an auto loan with PNC, just be aware of this practice. Also this info was not readily available online; I learned it through chatting with customer service.",finance

personalfinance,[USA] I want to put savings to work with CDs and would appreciate insight into strategy.,"Some background info: My wife and I have no major debt. No student loans, no car payment, no mortgage. Credit cards get paid off monthly. We have $20k in savings. Do to our circumstances with school and work we can't commit to purchasing a house for 4-5 years. In the interim I want to save fairly aggressively towards the down payment while maintaining a high degree of liquidity.  

What research I've done points me towards using CDs. The common wisdom seems to be using a ladder structure. My initial train of thought was to start a 4-rung (3mo, 6mo, 9mo, 1yr) ladder with $1,000 in each rung for the consecutive month. That would account for $12,000 from savings to seed the investment and would maintain a fair degree of liquidity. Principal and interest would be reinvested along with an additional $1,000 per month starting in the 4th month in 1 year CD's. Following that strategy I would have money available every month if I needed it beyond the $8,000 left in savings.

~~As I've spent more time thinking on it seems like rolling over short -term 3 month CDs would yield a higher return. Despite lower interest rates, the compounding effect could see returns above 9% for the year assuming interest rates don't fluctuate like crazy. My current thinking is to take that same $12,000 and purchase $4,000 worth of CDs each month for 3 months and, as each CD matures, roll over principal and interest plus $1,000 per month from there on out.~~  

This is where you all come in. Does the short term strategy make sense or am I missing something basic? It seems too good, too easy to be true. Or maybe there is some other vehicle for this money entirely that you think I should have a look at. Anyhow, I appreciate your help.

I am looking for advice on how to tackle my student loans. Currently, I have $43,500 in student loans that I need to start thinking about.


I will be graduating this coming May however I will be attending graduate school in the fall to pursue a doctoral degree in chemistry. My graduate school tuition is waived and I will be receiving a stipend between $25,000 and $30,000 depending on the school I choose. I am able to defer all of my student loans, however there are some that will still occur interest while in deferment. I also have about $2000 I can put toward one of my loans today.


[Here is a spread sheet detailing my loans with their balance and interest rate](https://imgur.com/a/66wMX5Q)


I am currently paying the interest on both the Sallie Mae loans however I am not for the Discover and the unsubsidized FAFSA loans. The balances in the spread sheet reflect today's totals. 


I live comfortably off of around $17,000/year with a $5,000 emergency fund and do not plan on changing my spending habits once I begin graduate school. The cost of living everywhere I applied to is comparable to where I live now. This means I will have some extra income I could put towards my student loans in the coming year. I do not believe there is a penalty for paying my loans off early, but I am also not on a payment plan yet. 


My questions are:


- What order should I focus on for loan repayment? 


- What loans do I defer while in graduate school? Alternatively, do I choose not to defer the loans and begin a payment plan? My thoughts on this is if I defer them, I have a 'safety net' or sorts while I am in graduate school where if money is tight, I can choose not to make a payment one month. 


- Should I put my extra income from my stipend towards my loans? I would like to begin paying off my loans in graduate school but I am unsure of how much I should be putting towards my loans vs how much I should spend getting my life together. I am thinking about starting a family towards the end of my graduate school career (5-7 years from now) and I know children are expensive (The programs I applied to have great maternity leave options).

I've seen it suggested on here to open one but virtually never use it (less than $20 a month), and to not worry about interest rates assuming you'll stay on top of paying it off. I'm not sure why, but this feels odd to me and potentially irresponsible. Is this good advice? Is it worth starting a line of credit and never using it? Will that actually result in good credit?

I hit a financial rough patch the 2-3 months before my first deployment (left country in February of 2016), so i missed 2 payments in a row (Jan/Feb). When we got in country and i started making way more money than i was used to, my first instinct was to start paying off my car loan ASAP, especially since while you're deployed your interest rates go down to 4% or something like that. So i started making double and triple payments at least once a month and sometimes twice a month. That went on from March to November-ish.

personalfinance,Sister Needs Credit Card Debt Consolidated,"Hi Reddit,

I need help finding a good credit card debt consolidation service for my sister.

Long story short, my sister had started a business with her now-ex and has pulled out of it.. However, it was very poorly managed and was done under her name for basically the whole duration. Because of this, my sister had assumed all the debt, maxing out all seven of her credit cards. Her total debt is more than $100k. Though there seems to be an agreement of some sort to have the ex pay her back as he's still working the business and basically he was the one that ran up the debt, I don't anticipate that money coming back any time soon.

In any case, my dad and I want to find a way to help her consolidate all the credit card debt so that rather than paying 17%+ interest on all seven of her cards, she can hopefully pay a lower interest rate on just the lump sum of her debt. I still need to do some more research into how exactly this will work out and what bank/creditor/agency we'd be working with, so if anybody here knows anything, I would appreciate the help.

personalfinance,Citibank Fraud Issues,"So on Wednesday (Jan 2), I received a check from my former landlord for my deposit funds. Citi was closed so I deposited it via ATM. The check was under $5,000 and from J.P. Morgan Chase, so I knew all the funds wouldn't be available for a few days (federal regulation blah blah), and I did have other funds in my account. 

The following day (Jan 3), I went to use my debit card and the transaction was declined. I knew I had funds in my account so I called Citi, thinking they put a block on my account because they assumed a transaction I'd made or attempted to make was fraudulent. During this time I attempted to log into my account on my phone but was unable to log in.

When I finally spoke with someone, I was told they think the check I deposited may be fake, so they put a block on my account and told me I wouldn't be able to access it until Jan 10. They told me I need to have my landlord call their bank (J.P. Morgan Chase) and have them call Citi to verify that the check was real. When I told my landlord this, she refused and said that I should have Citi call them. I was quite confused, so I went to a branch.

The personal banker spoke with the fraud department as well, but they told her that J.P. Morgan Chase alerted Citi that the funds were not available in my landlord's account to cover that check. As soon as funds were available I would have access to my account. Or, come Jan 10, the check would bounce and I would have access to my account.

I spoke with my former landlord and was assured that the funds were in their account, so I called Citi again. The person I spoke with just repeated that there was a fraud alert on my account and there was nothing she could do. None of my questions were answered. So I went back to the branch. 

The personal banker checked my account and saw that more of the funds from the check were available, and told me that the only way that could've happened is if it came from the issuing account and that the alert should've been lifted since funds are coming through. The funds did not appear out of thin air, and I could withdraw them from the branch tellers, but I couldn't use my card or access my information myself. The banker called the fraud department back and tried to get the alert lifted so I'd have access to my account, but was simply told that I would have to request the block be lifted on Jan 10 and it was their policy to keep my account blocked until then, even though the check is good and nothing fraudulent is happening. 

No one in branch could lift the block; the only ones capable are the fraud department. I tried to escalate it to a supervisor at the fraud department but apparently, none of them were available and I was told I'd get a call back in the next 24-48 hours. However, I was assured that the supervisor would tell me the same thing because.

The personal banker was just as confused as I was, and so was her manager, so I just took the available funds out of my account, and will most likely continue to do so as funds become available.

My questions to you are:

1. What the fuck? Has anything similar to this happened to anyone else?
2. Would you cancel your account with an institution that did this? Is this standard? No one I've spoken to about this has experienced anything like it. I very much do not feel comfortable with a bank trying to hold my money and information hostage from me.  
3. Are there banks that are better about their fraud prevention/protection?",finance

personalfinance,Am I missing something trying to contribute to an IRA?,"Hey All, 

Could you help me out? I feel as though I am missing something huge and contributing to an IRA (per the Prime Directive) has turned into a gigantic pain in the ass. 

Here are the facts: 

\- I am currently contributing 8% of my pay, pre tax, to my employer 401k plan. The plan is serviced by Vanguard. 

\- My employer offers an effective 2%  match contribution as long as I contribute 4% to the plan (net 6% of gross pay as it is pre tax) 

\- I have a traditional IRA (also through Vanguard) that I have rolled over previous plans into when I changed jobs. This is currently invested into an S&amp;P 500 index fund. I am not currently contributing to this fund. 

\- I live in WA state; therefore, I do not pay state income tax 

\- I would like to only contribute to my 401k to get the match (therefore lowering my contribution from 8% to 4%). The reason is that my traditional IRA is out performing my 401k plan year over year with lower fees. I would like to contribute the remaining 4% ""left over money"" into my IRA instead to get close to maxing it out. 

Issue: 

\- After speaking with Vanguard via phone, they informed me the only way to contribute to an IRA is via a direct deposit from my employer into the IRA. The money would be taxed at my current rate. I would then need to file my taxes at end of year. Any and all direct deposit contributions would be ""written off"" of my income, and result in a larger refund. 

The above issue sound like some bullshit; isnt this effectively giving the Federal Government an interest free loan (via taxes on IRA contribution) for a year then getting a refund? Refunds are taxed as well, correct? Isnt the point of an IRA that pre tax money goes into the account, the money is invested, then taxed at withdraw time in retirement?

I know I am likely not understanding. I am still new to personal finance and trying to get the basics down right now (like contributing to an IRA). Any insight or advice you could give would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if I am missing something huge or if this is covered in the WIKI.

My husband has a history of mental illness including anxiety, depression and schizophrenia. One of the side effects of his medication apparently is being predisposed to alcohol/drug/gambling dependency. 

He has had this for over 3 years and seemed to be doing well, however over the last 6 months or so he has started to gamble more and more, and has racked up thousands of pounds of debt. This is split over an overdraft, credit cards, pay day loans. He also has debt from before we got together and last year got a CCJ relating to some of this. 

I found this out in dribs and drabs from Christmas Eve up to today. 

He has agreed for me to have total control of all financial accounts and tomorrow I am going to find out the total of everything owed and put it together in a plan. 

With regards to the medical aspect I will be talking to his doctors as he’s been given bad advice and this has all spiralled however I am in shock with regards to the debt and will take any advice on board. 

I have a pretty solid plan in place (get a list of all debts, find highest interests to pay as priority, negotiate interest down etc., take all bank accounts off him etc) but I’ve never been in this situation before and it’s terrifying because we weren’t doing great financially before and it’s come out of nowhere. 

Thanks in advance. 

Edit:

So I’ve gone through credit score, bank account and emails and have a list of all debts.


Guarantor Loan £3500 - amount to settle now is approx £3570 - If paid over agreed 60 month period would be repaying over £8000 (approx £150 a month).

Pay day loans- about 5. These range from £120 to about £500. All but two have been frozen at a fixed amount with agreed small repayments.

Credit cards - 2. One at £200 and one at £1200. High APR on both. 

Other debtors chasing - 4. Small payment plans agreed with all at £5/£10 a month, and we negotiated over £1000 off the total due yesterday down.  

There’s also a united utilities bill on hold from 2014 whilst they investigate a query. 


We have £1000 in savings from our recent wedding - this was money given to us towards something in particular. 

My current plan is to pay off the two pay day loans that have not agreed to freeze interest/payment plan this month from the £1000 we were gifted. 

From that point on we will minimum pay everything except the guarantor Loan which we will throw every penny at. I’ve looked at taking out a loan myself at a much lower interest rate but I’m not sure I’d be accepted as I also have 3 credit cards (0% on 2, the other I pay off in full each month). One payday loan also only has one payment left this month and then it’s cleared. 

I’ve set a very strict budget and have downloaded our bank statements and analysed our spend. 

If there’s anything else I should be doing or if I’m approaching this all wrong please help me. 


Edit 2: I should probably add that I found out through looking at the emails that this is more an ongoing problem of budgeting than a gambling one. The gambling was under £1k over the year. We are approx £15k in debt just on his side, so I think it was more of a last ditch attempt to get out of a hole on his part. Looking at his emails he’s been relying on pay day loans for over a decade and they seem to have just spiralled. I’m confident we can clear them once and for all and my husband seems like a new person now it’s all out in the open.",finance

I've already started putting most of my extra investment cash into a high interest rate savings account  (2.4% apy). And looking at precious metals again. But not sure on how to balance my 401k so I don't lose $500 a day in value due to sudden market fluctuations. 

Any advice appreciated. 

Edit: I am currently 44 years old, am vested in my 401k, and have a company match up to 6% ( I contribute 7% starting this year). 

I am looking at my future investment mix, not what I have done over the last 5 years. Going forward I hope to balance out my domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and bonds. Right now I believe I am under invested in bond funds (at about 6%) and unsure on foreign securities (10% developing market, 4-8% in established foreign markets).

The link the bot posted suggests I should have between 34-44% of my portfolio in bonds, and that sounds far more conservative than I would like. I have pretty high tolerance for risk, and given a few unfortunate life events will not likely be able to retire until I am between 65 and 70. 

I do not have anywhere near 6 months of expenses saved, and am aggressively paying off my debts. I understand that I should focus more on debt repayment, but I also have a few unique factors in my life that necessitate building up an emergency fund. My investments outside of my 401k is done with my 'play' money, and don't amount to much (no more than I would be willing to spend on entertainment).",finance
personalfinance,"Questions about Budget, Debt and Investments","Hey there! 

This is my first time posting in this subreddit. I have been thinking about money a lot these past few months and found this subreddit very helpful. I would love some advice on my overall financial situation, my preliminary budget, debt as well as potentially investing some money in the future. 

Apologies for the wall of text.

I am 30 years old, live in Berlin, Germany, and will start my career as an IT-consultant in February 2019. My net income will be 2,300€ a month or 27,600€ a year. Additionally, I will get a Christmas bonus of around 1000€ and probably make around 2000€ from a side hustle of mine. At the same time, I accumulated around 48,000€ in mostly study-related debt over the past 10 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Premilinary monthly budget**:  

|Living expenses|450€|
|:-|:-|
|Food|400€|
|Mobility|100€|
|Gym &amp; Beauty|100€|
|Insurance|100€|
|Traveling/vacation|180€|
|Big-ticket items|250€|
|Emergency fund|250€|
|Miscellaneous|150€|
|Rest|320€|

&amp;#x200B;

I will briefly elaborate on my projected expenses:

* **Living expenses**: this one is pretty straightforward and includes rent, utilities, internet, mandatory license fees for public broadcast as well as a Netflix account. I share a nice two-room apartment with my girlfriend and will pay slightly more than her due to my higher income.
* **Food**: 400€ a month for food is just a projected number and will hopefully be less in reality. On workdays, I will get lunch from one the many food places close to my office, for an average of around 5-6€. In the evening and on weekends we usually cook some affordable stuff at home, lots of rice, potatoes, veggies etc. I/we might go for dinner 2-3 times a month. But this is probably one place where I could save quite some money.
* **Gym &amp; Beauty**: this includes the monthly fee for my gym, a haircut, a beard trim as well as toiletries.
* **Mobility**: I will get a monthly ticket for public transport and plan on purchasing a bike to save money during the summer months. My work place is around 30 minutes by bike from my apartment. We also have a few showers at work. I don´t have, need or want a car, so that will save me a lot of money compared to living in a more rural area.
* **Insurance**: I currently only have liability insurance (48€ a year). My health insurance is paid for with a percentage of my gross income. Therefore, I currently only spend around 4€ on insurance a month. However, I plan on getting some more insurances (dental, disability) which will increase my monthly expenses for insurance. But I don´t think that I will really spend 100€ on insurance a month, this is just a generous estimate.
* **Traveling/vacation**: I don´t really plan on saving 180€ for traveling/vacation every month for years, but we have been planning a trip to the US for the summer of 2019.
* **Big-ticket items**: there are a few ""big-ticket ""items"" that I have to or want to purchase. First of all, I need some more business clothes for my job, dress shirts, decent pants, dress shoes etc. I might also need a second suit eventually. Secondly, we only moved into our apartment in the summer of 2018 and still need a few pieces of furniture such as a wardrobe. Last but not least, I would like to buy a bike this year. It´s great to have a bike in the city, and it might also save some money on public transport. The latter two can wait a bit though. I will reduce the amount of money once I bought my the business clothes.
* **Emergency Fund**: I will contribute 250€ a month to my emergency fund, which currently holds 500€. In the short term, I would like to have an emergency fund of 4500€, which is 3-4 months of living expenses. I should be able to achieve this within about a year. After 3 or 4 years, I would like to have 9000€ to cover living expenses for 6-9 months and/or some unexpected expenses.

If this budget is somewhat realistic, I will have at least 320€ left each month. This money will go towards paying off debt. Any money that is left over at the end of the month will go towards my emergency fund (until I have at least 4500€ saved up) or towards debt. The same goes for any additional income such as the Christmas bonus or from side hustles.

&amp;#x200B;

**Debt**

I currently have approximately 48,000€ in mostly study-related debt that I plan to pay off in the next five years. Overall, I have three separate loans:

* **Debt 1**: 22,000€ (3,14% interest)
* **Debt 2**: 10,000€ (0% interest)
* **Debt 3**: 16,000€ (3% interest)

My plan on paying back my debt: 

I will have to contribute 215€ a month from April 2019 towards my student loan of 22,000€ with a current interest rate of 3,14%. I am able to adjust my monthly payments twice a year.

I will also have to contribute 105€ a month from February 2019 towards a government loan of 10,000€ with no interest. These are special, subsidised loans for students from low-income families. I have 25 years to pay the money. One is able to make additional payments anytime, however, with a zero interest rate, I feel like there is no point to contribute more than the minimum payment of 105€ a month for the time being.

Furthermore, I owe 16,000€ to an uncle of mine with a fixed interest rate of 3%. My plan was to pay off this debt first because I don´t debt to potentially impact our relationship. He will only accept one big payment a year. Therefore, I will put aside 300€ a month starting in October 2019. I would also put any additional money towards paying off this debt as soon as possible. This way, I should be able to pay it off within 3-4 years.

&amp;#x200B;

What I would like to know from you guys:

1. Is my preliminary monthly budget somewhat realistic in your opinion? Does anything stand out to you? Are some of the estimates too high or too low? I am really curious about your opinion.
2. Should I contribute more money towards my emergency fund every month until I hit a number that will keep me afloat for 2-3 months? Uncertain about this one.
3. What do you think of my debt situation? Does it make sense to pay my uncle first, then pay the big debt with the high interest and focus on the no interest debt last? Also: do I need to step up my game and contribute more towards paying off my debt? How should I prioritize between my emergency budget and paying off debt? I am really interested in how you balance between emergency fund and debt.
4. Last but not least: when should I start thinking about making some investments? Do I need to pay off all my debt before I do that? Or should I consider some investments when the first debt is gone? Or even now? Eventually, I would like to invest some money in ETFs and stocks.

personalfinance,Advice on which liability to pay off first,"Back in November, my partner and I were fortunate Enough to purchase a second home, and convert our condo into a rental. In the process, we took out a HELOC in the amount of 28K with a 5.25% interest rate and a 15 year time horizon to help reduce our mortgage payment. The monthly payment for the HELOC is approximately $225/month.

Besides this liability, the only other liability on my balance sheet is a car payment. I still owe roughly 8K on my car, with 3 years left on the loan at 2%. That monthly payment is about $200 per month.

Conventional wisdom has always told me to pay off the higher interest rate liabilities first. I'm in a position to aggressively pay toward the two debts, but given the difference in principal and how close the monthly payment amounts are, I'm leaning toward paying off my car first. I figure I can take that additional cash flow and start applying that $200 toward the HELOC (or to begin rebuilding my savings).

Is this smart? Is there anything I'm missing as I consider this? I'd love to hear any perspective to help me with my strategy.

personalfinance,Has anyone here prepaid a loan from Upstart? How did it work?,"In a piece mail I got from them they tout that there are no prepayment penalties, so I figured I'd apply to refinance some CC debt. However, on the page right before you accept the loan they have this line: ""If you pay off early, you will not have to pay a penalty. You will not be entitled to a refund of part of the finance charge."" The 'finance charge' is listed earlier with the origination fee plus the total interest you'd pay if you only ever made the minimum payment.

&amp;#x200B;

So which is it? When you get the loan is it your debt the amount you applied for that then accrues interest based on its balance over time? Or is it your debt immediately the loan + future interest where prepayment doesn't reduce the total interest? If it's the latter I'd rather just keep my high CC interest rate and pay it off faster than the loan they offered me.

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know if you have first-hand experience with Upstart's loan structure. I worry because a CarMax Salesman once told me ""there's no prepay penalties on our loans"" only to later find out they front loaded 3 months of interest in the manner I describe above.

I am bullish on Netflix and Amazon and
bearish on FB and Apple. First three are not trade war stock still they are not fully immune. 
Important thing to look next week is the meeting netween US and  China.
If meeting goes good (less chance) buy long call DTE march 1 for amazon and Netflix.
If meeting goes bad buy more apple put Feb 15 DTE

Other Important points:
Border wall shutdown: No solution within next week. When it is solved stock will temporarily go up.   (+)
China trade war and slowing economy: Most probably will not change until trump gone. Trumps position is weakening and china will exploit that to buy time. But trump will not risk economy by imposing more tax. What they gonna do is to make a face saving deal and keep things like it for now. (+)
Feds became dovish (+)


Within next 3 months general stocks remain same or move up. Don't go down much. 
In this earning cycle (Q1) all tech and china stock report bad earning most likely.  

Possible things on the table: 
Trump impeachment: New government will be stable and china trade war will stop. That is positive. If trump is impeached (he will not be) than it will be problem as violence and unrest may result. If he lost 2020 election (which he will) it is good for stock market in a long run.

personalfinance,Better to do a low interest rate loan or a higher interest rate line of credit?,"My current car drinks gas and is expensive to maintain.

I'm in pharmacy school with 3 years left, I work enough and have a good enough job that I am able to make 30k a year while still in school. Let's say once I finish school I can't find a job... My current job will pay $50,000 a year if I go full time so I am not worried about finishing school and getting stuck with this loan that I can't afford. 

Trade in value of my car is 6000 and the car I'm looking at brand new is 20k before I haggle it down, with a 5 year warranty so I won't have to put any money in to it for repairs. Only gas and oil, which this car will burn literally half the gas of my current car. My repairs for my current car are about $1500 a year.

So it makes financial sense for me to get rid of my current luxury big gas guzzling car and get this econobox until I finish school.

If I finance the car and stretch the loan over 8 years (to get the lowest possible monthly payment) I'm paying about $200 a month. Then once I finish school I will just pay it off once I start working. The interest rate for financing is 1.99%

I can also put it on a line of credit and I'll only have to make interest payments of about $70 a month, but I won't knock down any of the principle obviously. So I'll pay less now while I'm in school but I will have to pay back more once I finish. The interest on my loc is 5%.

I get about $4000 a year back in income tax and I plan on just throwing it at the car.

One thing I noticed is that since I’m on IBR, my required payment for each loan of varying interest rates is less than it would be if I were on a standard plan. This allows me to avalanche more money toward the higher interest rate loans each monthZ 

Another idea I had, and not completely sure how this works, is to make all payments through automatic payment since I think it is applied to a lower interest rate (0.25% less), though I’m not sure if this actually works or makes a meaningful difference.

personalfinance,0% APR Credit Card to Pay for Grad School and Not Have Interest?,"My tuition amount for Spring 2019 is a little over $6k. After getting a letter grade of 'B' or higher, my company reimburses up to $5,250 per calendar year (which I know is the federal maximum before it has to be treated as income). So the way I see it, I could take a loan out for this amount and pay most of it off with the reimbursement, or I can open a credit card and put the loan amount on their to not have any interest for however long the initial 0% interest is good for. Another part is that the college charges a 2% fee (approx. $125 for this semester) to pay your tuition with a credit card. Now if I was to get a card such as the Chase Freedom Unlimited, there's a 0% APR offer for 15 months and also a $150 bonus after $500 in purchases in three months. This would cover the fee for using a credit card, also provide me with another $25, and then give me no interest for over a year even though I plan to have this paid off within 6-9 months. I have a credit score of 800 so I don't have any worries about being approved and the only debt I have is about $4k left of my undergrad loan (which was over $20k two years ago). Does this plan make sense to avoid the high interest rate of graduate loans (6% or more)?

TL;DR: Need to pay $6k for tuition by the end of January. I can get a graduate loan and pay interest until my company reimburses me for most of it or get a credit card to avoid the interest and save money.",finance

**Job situation:** I stress constantly about finding a job. I contact people on linkedin everyday and ask for advice and I try to build a network. We will live in Seattle, my hometown. I have a BA in economics and she has a master's in economics. Neither of us has work experience. I'm taking online courses in analytics and I hope to land a job as some sort of data analyst or BI person. I am also looking at saas sales but I don't really want to go that route if I don't have to. My wife is extremely good at math, but like I said, she has no experience. My father-in-law has a small business and I'm working with his data trying to get some experience and have something to put on my resume. So far I'm still pretty lost as to what to do but I'm trying to figure it out. Like I said, I stress constantly.

**Budget situation:** I've been planning our budget around my wife not working and me making \~$50,000 annually. After taxes and health insurance this would make us.....poor. The take-home would be about $2,900 monthly. We won't have a car, so we could afford about $1000 in rent, which is impossible to find in Seattle. I saw one place that's suitable for $1100. But still, that's 40% of the budget.

Once my wife starts working, we will have to pay between 1800 and 2400 in childcare costs monthly. Hopefully she gets something good. We'd still like to stay within this shoestring budget and live in a small space regardless. 

Here is a sample budget. What do you all think?

Monthly Income	 $2,900.00 	100%

Rent	 	         $1,160.00 	40%

Transportation	$145.00   	5%

Food	 	        $377.00 	       13%

Saving	 	       $290.00 	      10%

Bills	 	              $290.00 	     10%

Medical needs	 $145.00 	5%

Entertainment	 $145.00 	5%

Student Loans	 $290.00 	10%

Clothing	                  $58.00 	       2%

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR &amp; questions**

I'm starting a new life with my wife and young child and our situation will be uncertain for a while. I stress a lot about money and the uncertainty of it. We are pretty much dead-set on Seattle, my hometown where I have a huge family and friend network. We won't have a car and we have a minimalist/frugal lifestyle. I'm hoping for general advice, and maybe just a little reassurance.

* Is a rent budget of 40% justifiable if there are no car expenses involved?
* Should we stay in Brazil longer and save more money, but further postpone starting our careers? Should our goal be higher than 18k?
* After we are settled, should I put a chunk of what remains of the 18k toward my federal student loans totaling 28k?
* Any other advice for someone in my position?

Thanks everyone!

personalfinance,High interest savings account (deposited for at least 5 yrs) or a long term (also 5 year) CD?,"Citizens Access seems to be a pretty good place to go for opening either a high interest savings account, or a CD. Of course the high interest savings account has a slightly lower interest rate compared to the CD (by about 1%), but I assume it has more flexibility as to deposits / withdrawals compared to the CD? 

I'm wondering which option is better? I don't plan to touch the money frequently (maybe once a year make a withdraw to throw at the principals of my mortgage, other than that just regular deposits). 

Also, is Citizens Access a good choice? What does the general internet population prefer? Thanks!",finance
robotics,Adding a stupid amount of sensors to Raspberry Pi,"**So some background on the project.**  
I started to get into model railways a few years ago and back then as a poor Uni student I din't have the funds to fork out for all the different components for a fully controllable DCC . I have also got fed up with items costing more just because it is for model railway.  
At the start of last year (2018 for those playing at home) I started drawing up plans for a large railway layout however I wanted to use this as a learning experience to get into electronics doing something other than a few little Arduino projects.  
TL;DR i don't like DCC and want to build my own system.

**What I am looking to do**

I am looking at using sensors in the track to eventually be used to ""block"" the trains so like in real life a train cant enter an occupied section of track. each block will have a sensor on the start and finish to detect if a train has entered or has left the block. I am not sure what sensor to use here i will need to add around 200 of these to the layout.

Now for the lights. my plan was to use shift registers which was good when I thought that I was only using red and green lights however now I need red green and orange in only two positions (the signal housing).  
So I need to look into how to control a very large amount of RGB LEDs \~350

Servos! this is something that i think i have under control. The servos will control the points on the layout that can switch the train from one track to another. I am using a few PCA9685 ICs already wired up to a PCB so its all good to go. I'm all happy to hear of an alternative that can control up to 30 servos.

Power this is something that I absolutely suck at. what is the best way to power 300+ LEDs and 30 plus servos given that they may not all be on all at once or in the case of servos may have anywhere from 1 - 30 servos moving at once. What I am currently using in small scale is LM2596 DC-DC power converters.

I have done small proof of concept projects but I am realising I will start to run into issues when going large scale  
I need a way to do the following

TL;DR i need to control

* 300 RGB LEDs of very few GPIO Pins
* 196 Sensors (most likely IR sensors I am open to other options)
* 30 servos
* Supply power to everything.

**Additional Info**  
I'm currently using Raspberry Pi's and Python this expands into using multiple Pi's and send instructions across the network.  
I want to avoid using DCC as a personal preference and a personal challenge.

**Addition Factors/ Challenges**  
I need to find a way to track the train. i was thinking of putting a raspberry pi in each train (to give each train an ip address and to control speed, lights, status/stats page etc)  
I was thinking of giving the train some sort of rfid chip and then maybe readers in the track. given I have 54 blocks and 30 switches I'm guessing this would become very elaborate (even more so then I'm am making it now) tips are appreciated.

I am happy to take suggestions or look into Ideas this project is in the early stages and i want to see how far i can take it. at this stage i know i can do points i just need help with the other %90 of the project.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 7th, 2019.

# **Stock market comeback is now in the hands of China-US trade talks  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/04/stock-market-comeback-is-now-in-the-hands-of-china-us-trade-talks.html)**
*****
&gt; Trade talks between the U.S.and China will dominate the market's focus in the week ahead, while investors are also watching to see whether other companies join the ranks of Apple and warn about an earnings miss.
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who sent stocks sharply higher Friday, speaks again Thursday at an Economics Club of Washington D.C. luncheon. He is expected to deliver the same dovish message about flexibility when it comes to policy and patience when it comes to raising interest rates.
*****
&gt; Apple blamed a revenue miss in big part on a sudden drop off in iPhone sales in China in November. The hit was seen as a sign that not only are trade tensions hitting China's economy, but the U.S. economy and corporations could feel the pinch. Apple's comments came the day before a stunning drop in ISM manufacturing data which also was blamed in part on trade friction.
*****
&gt; ""What the market needs next week and the week after is positive guidance from companies. What are companies telling us? What are their customers telling us?"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. ""If we could move from a stellar earnings to a more moderate earnings backdrop, the market will accept that but if guidance is weak and companies are lowering revenue growth, that will affect the market.""
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 surged over 3.3 percent Friday to 2,531, and was up 1.7 percent for the week. The S&amp;P was up more than 7.5 percent from its Dec. 24 low close.
*****
&gt; China and the United States will hold vice ministerial level trade talks in Beijing on Monday and Tuesday and are expected to hold another round of meetings the following week.
*****
&gt; ""China is going to be absolutely the big thing,"" said Julian Emanuel, chief equities and derivatives strategist at BTIG. China cut reserve requirements Friday to encourage more bank lending, its latest policy move aimed at ending a slowdown.
*****
&gt; Economists expect U.S. growth to slow slightly, to the 2-2.5 percent range in the fist half but markets have been reacting to the prospect of an even slower economy. The ISM data for December was particularly discouraging because of a steep drop in new orders.
*****
&gt; ""The question is are we likely to have warnings? Given the economic data that we've seen, particularly the slowdown in the new orders component, we probably are likely to get warnings and the question is, is it baked into stock prices? We think, for the most part, it is,"" said Emanuel.
*****
&gt; Markets will also remain heavily focused on data after the weak ISM survey was followed by a surprisingly strong December jobs report with 312,000 nonfarm payrolls added. The employment report showed a strong labor market, with wage growth of 0.4 percent and a pickup in participation by more than 400,000 workers.
*****
&gt; ""What this market needed was a strong data release, an unequivocally strong data release,"" said Krosby. ""It was an injection to positive data in a market that has been worried about an economy that is potentially stalling,""
*****
&gt; Krosby said the market needs to build on its gains and the positive sentiment around the strong data. ""This has been a market that had all of the signatures of the bear claws death by 1,000 cuts. No data release was seen as positive. Everything was seen as negative. If we could turn that psychology around and build on it, but we are waiting to see if there are sellers who were waiting to get out. We need to see if they're still there.""
*****
&gt; Data releases in the comign week include Services ISM Monday and international trade data, out Tuesday morning, but the data the markets are waiting for will be Friday's CPI inflation report.
*****
&gt; During his appearance Friday, Powell indicated that inflation was not a concern for the Fed and the economy is still in good shape despite concerns. He also said the Fed was paying attention to the market, which is reflecting a weaker outlook than the data suggests.
*****
&gt; Powell also indicated the Fed can be ""patient"" and it will be flexible and willing to change policy if it sees changes in conditions. That comforted markets and sent stocks higher. Powell had said the Fed's balance sheet reduction program was on 'auto pilot' when he spoke in December, and that spooked some investors who wanted to see the Fed willing to modify its policy in the face of the market's sell off.
*****
&gt; ""Certainly, the market feels better about the fact that the Fed is moving towards its view on the hiking cycle. which is that it's largely over. From that perspective it decreases the possibility that the Fed is going to hike too far like it did in 2004 and 2006. It did in 2000 and it did in 1974, triggering broader stock market downturns and recessions,"" said Emanuel.
*****
&gt; ""That's makes people feel better and from our point of view that it makes it more likely that the technical bear market we've seen…is the likelihood that this going to be a shorter, shallower non-recessionary bear market,"" said Emanuel. The S&amp;P 500 has briefly visited a bear market, falling 20 percent from its all-time high on an intraday basis.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the rally on the Fed was important since it had been a concern for the market.He expects the Fed to stay on hold this year and also announce that it will stop the roll off of its balance sheet by mid year.
*****
&gt; ""This reinforces the view the bulk of this bear market decline is behind us, and there's at least an expectation that communication between the U.S. and China is poised to improve rather than become more acrimonious over the course of the next few weeks,"" he said.

# Why January is still the most important month

&gt; Devised by Yale Hirsch in 1972, the January Barometer (JB) has registered ten major errors since 1950 for an 85.5% accuracy ratio. This indicator adheres to propensity that as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year. Of the ten major errors Vietnam affected 1966 and 1968. 1982 saw the start of a major bull market in August. Two January rate cuts and 9/11 affected 2001.The market in January 2003 was held down by the anticipation of military action in Iraq. The second worst bear market since 1900 ended in March of 2009 and Federal Reserve intervention influenced 2010 and 2014. In 2016, DJIA slipped into an official Ned Davis bear market in January. Last year, 2018, became the tenth major error overall and the seventh since 2001 as a hawkish Fed, a trade war and slowing global growth concerns resulted in the worst fourth quarter performance by S&amp;P 500 since 2008. Including the eight flat years yields a .739 batting average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d4237535ede59fc7b779e5c862bc55ec/tumblr_inline_pkto8hrMOf1spdppr_640.jpg))**

&gt; Let’s compare the January Barometer to all other “Monthly Barometers.” For the accompanying table we went back to 1938 for the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA — the year in which the January Barometer came to life — and back to 1971 for NASDAQ when that index took its current form.

&gt; The accuracy ratios listed are based on whether or not the given month’s move — up or down — was followed by a move in the same direction for the whole period. For example, in the 81 years of data for the S&amp;P 500 for the January Barometer, 61 years moved in the same direction for 75.3% accuracy.

&gt; The Calendar Year ratio is based on the month’s percent change and the whole year’s percent change; i.e., we compare December 2017’s percent change to the change for 2017 as a whole. By contrast the 11-month ratio compares the month’s move to the move of the following eleven months. February’s change is compared to the change from March to January. The 12-month change compares the month’s change to the following twelve months. February’s change is compared to the change from March to the next February.

&gt; Though the January Barometer is based on the S&amp;P 500 we thought it would clear the air to look at the other two major averages as well. You can see for yourself in the table that no other month comes close to January in forecasting prowess over the longer term.

&gt; There are a few interesting anomalies to point out though. On a calendar year basis DJIA in January is slightly better than the S&amp;P. 2011 is a perfect example of how the DJIA just edges out for the year while the S&amp;P does not. For NASDAQ April, September and November stick out as well on a calendar year basis, but these months are well into the year, and the point is to know how the year might pan out following January, not April, September or November. And no other month has any basis for being a barometer. January is loaded with reasons.

&gt; Being the first month of the year it is the time when people readjust their portfolios, rethink their outlook for the coming year and try to make a fresh start. There is also an increase in cash that flows into the market in January, making market direction even more important. Then there is all the information Wall Street has to digest: The State of the Union Address, FOMC meeting, 4th quarter GDP, earnings and the plethora of other economic and market data.

&gt; **Myths Dispelled**

&gt; In recent years new myths and/or areas of confusion have come to light. One of the biggest errors is the notion that the January Barometer is a standalone indicator that can be used to base all of your investment decisions for the coming year on. This is simply not true and we have never claimed that the January Barometer should or could be used in this manner. The January Barometer is intended to be used in conjunction with all available data deemed relevant to either confirm or call into question your assessment of the market. No single indicator is 100% accurate so no single indicator should ever be considered in a vacuum. The January Barometer is not an exception to this.

&gt; Another myth is that the January Barometer is completely useless. Those that believe this like to point out that simply expecting the market to be higher by the end of the year is just as accurate as the January Barometer. Statistically, they are just about right. In the 81-year history examined in this article, there were only 24 full-year declines. So yes, the S&amp;P 500 has posted annual gains 70.4% of the time since 1938. What is missing from this argument is the fact that when January was positive, the full year was also positive 86.0% of the time and when January was down the year was down 58.1% of the time. These are not the near perfect outcomes that true statisticians prefer, but once again, the January Barometer was not intended to be used in a vacuum.

# Typical January Trading: Strength Early and That’s Been About It Recently

&gt; Historically, the New Year has started out well with modest gains the first few trading days of January. Since 1980, DJIA has averaged a 0.30% gain on the first trading day of the year. S&amp;P 500 has averaged 0.21% and NASDAQ 0.22%. Similar to slightly better average gains have been observed on the second trading day of January, but after that consistent gains have become elusive. January’s performance over the more recent 21-year period has been rather lackluster. Strength is still present, on average, at the start of the month, but quickly fades after the second or third trading day. Afterwards, the trend is sideways to lower, a brief pause mid-month and then more sideways to lower trading through the end of the month. Weakness is most pronounced just after mid-month, beginning around the 12th trading day of January.

# Market Fears and Economic Realities

&gt; Recent Federal Reserve (Fed) rhetoric has spooked financial markets, especially as uncertainty has clouded investors’ horizons. But we still believe the fundamental U.S. economic landscape is compelling, and despite market concerns, an important measure of market interest rates suggests that monetary policy remains accommodative.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, inflation-adjusted interest rates are still comparatively low and well below levels that historically have preceded economic recessions. Currently, the real fed funds rate sits at 0.3% (based on year-over-year core Consumer Price Index [CPI] growth of 2.2%), below the 1.3% real interest rate we’ve averaged since the end of 1970. During that same period, the real interest rate reached an average high of 4.2% before the U.S. economy entered a recession, significantly above where rates are today.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Real-Interest-Rates.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “There is a disconnect between U.S. economic data and pessimism priced into financial markets,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “The U.S. economy is strong enough to operate at current rates, and we expect the Fed to be pragmatic and flexible enough to guide us to a soft landing.”

&gt; This has been one of the most challenging market environments to navigate since the end of the Great Recession. However, we believe strong fundamentals are still in place, and the Fed’s plans remain supportive to the economic environment. While the uncertainty has been uncomfortable, the Fed remains data-dependent, leading us to expect two rate hikes in 2019.

personalfinance,I've come to seek advice on overcoming tough financial situation.,"Hello Reddit,

I've come to my crossroads of self infliction and I'm here seeking true financial advice.

29 Year old, Single Male, No Kids, No Girlfriend.

2018 I was absolutely atrocious with my finances, and completely irresponsible.

Money management has never been even close to a strength for me.

To be honest, a majority of this issue stemmed from Binge gambling.

I'm open about everything, and here for suggestions.

&amp;#x200B;

To start, my credit score is 597 according to credit karma (which isn't always accurate) I'm sure my experian is around 550 or 540.

Total Open Balances Reporting $29,582

Auto: $25,294

Credit Cards: $1434 ($1400max)

Other Loans: $2,289 (Only 2 of 5 loans reporting currently)

Collections: $565 (Medical)

&amp;#x200B;

I went a little over a month ago to try and get a debt consoldiation loan from my credit union. I was denied, but given the advice to simply lower my credit cards down beyond 30% and retry when those effectively apply to my credit scores. Claiming my score can be 675 after.

As far as my current plan, I feel unsure on how to attack this whole thing.. But I'm very ready and willing.

I am considering any and all options, I don't feel like I need to file bankruptcy or anything, I think this is very doable.

Please Bare with me, I hope I laid all this out correctly, and can edit too add absolutely any information requested

personalfinance,I received student loan forgiveness and now I’m unsure how this will affect my taxes,"I recently was approved for a grant that will pay $30,000 of my student loans over two years. The organization that awarded the grant sent the first payment of $15,000 to Fed Loan on December 27. From my limited understanding of tax law, student loan forgiveness counts as income, so with an extra $15,000 of “income,” am I going to end up owing money to the IRS because I didn’t pay taxes on that $15k? And can I claim the interest paid covered by the grant payment because it was technically my money? This is in the US by the way. Thanks in advance for your help!",finance
personalfinance,Another Student Loan Post,"Hi Reddit,

This is my first post ever.

My parents have approximately $130,000 in student loan debt from my sister’s education. This debt is spread across multiple Department of Education loans with an average interest rate around 6.5 to 7%. The monthly payment on these loans is over $1,100, while they can afford this now, it is really eating into their quality of life, and I fear it could impact their ability to retire. My sister has a decent paying job with definite opportunity for advancement, but lives in a high cost of living area and is still paying off loans she has in her own name. My parents have asked her many times to contribute to the loans they have taken out on her behalf, but she has refused. This has been frustrating for me to see, because I hear about her weekend outings going to brunch, bars, getting her nails done, and treating herself to massages.

My parents tried to refinance the loans through Sofi and Laurel Road, but both denied the applications. My parents have excellent credit, but they do not have bachelor’s degrees which I believe these lenders value highly. Are there other lenders we should try? I am tired of giving out my parent’s personal information to lenders only to get rejected.

My parents and I do not like the idea of income-based repayment programs as this will cause them to pay huge amounts of interest over the life of the loan.

My parents have a personal residence with approximately $80,000 in equity, and a fully paid off rental property with an approximate market value of $200,000. My mom has a 401k worth $140,000. These are the assets my parents have for retirement. Is there anything we could/should be doing to leverage the assets to pay down the student loan debt (e.g. refinance or sell something?)

All and all with so many options out there we feel lost, are there any companies or services that can help navigate people in these situations?

Thank you in advance for any replies, looking for any help the internet has to offer.",finance

I've been working on getting my credit straightened out and it's been going well.  I currently have 3500 on one credit card, \~6500 on another.  I'm trying to decide which of the following 3 options will be best for short term/long term credit score wrt dealing with that \~10k.  

1.)  Personal loan to pay off credit cards

2.) New credit card with balance transfer (I will NOT be able to pay off the full 10k during the 0% transfer period, but will a substantial part of it).

3.)  Balance transfer of the 3500 to the lower-interest rate card that has 6500 on it (15 k limit on that card).

Forex,I Will Learn Trading In 6 Months,"Last week I got laid off from my job (which I kind of engineered, to be honest) and I have bee interested in forex since November. I have been lurking on this sub since then and have gained a good amount of value from the posters and recommendations I have found. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I'm working my way through babypips course, I'm on the undergraduate section. Unemployment pays me enough to cover all my living expenses as long as I don't do something stupid, and I have $6k saved up from last year to trade with when I am ready. No debt, and I can collect for 6 months max, after which time I must be profitable to not have to go back to working construction (I am a plumber by trade). I must be able to clear about $3k per month after taxes in order to live an acceptable lifestyle. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel optimistic because this week I have replenished my Metatrader simulation account back to 10k, where I started. When I was just learning and practicing, I was down to 6k, which was a month ago. This is the first week I have been able to trade full time, and already I see many opportunities and systems I can create. I mostly like to trade trends, with some breakouts in specific cases, like news events. I plan to go live when my practice account is at 20k, and I have polished my trading strategies. Of course, I will repeat the babypips course once again, maybe two more times even. 

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, over these next six months, I am looking at branching out into several different areas to enhance my trading abilities. For example, I have an idea to create a fundamental economic matrix in Excel with weighted values on each different aspect, such as interest rates, GDP growth, etc. In addition, I am considering learning some coding to at least set up my own alerts. Also, I believe some mathematical/probability courses might be beneficial, but I don't really know where to start with that (I have done some college, no more than Calc 1 though).

So far, a combination of fundamentals with technical appeals to me, although I would consider myself more of a technical trader. Do you guys have any recommendations for further education? More importantly, are my goals within my timeframe even possible?",finance

investing,What’s wrong with this idea?,"A lot of people mention retiring after $1M+ so as to invest it for a yearly return at some rate. For a 10% rate you‘d then be able to live off of 100K+ a year. However, what’s stopping someone from taking a loan right now (some cheap debt), investing it for a higher return than the interest payment on debt, and profiting each year? For example, take a $5M loan out at 5% interest rate and invest it in a mutual fund at 10% annual return, then make $250K every year. This is arbitrage and should not be possible, so I’m trying to figure out where this line of reasoning breaks down. Is it the fact that you won’t be able to find fund managers returning anywhere as high as 10% annually these days? Or the fact that you wouldn’t be able to find any spread above debt interest rate and invested returns? Or the fact that some law prohibits you from borrowing to invest, sort of like how Ponzi schemes are illegal? If someone can explain why this idea fails or is highly impractical I appreciate it.

personalfinance,I'm an EMT drowning in student loan debt with no foreseeable way out,"{throwaway account, sort of embarrassing, don't need our friends at ems knowing that I made a huge mistake}

Hey r/personalfinace! I'll try to keep this brief, as I'm sure a similar question gets asked constantly.

I'm currently 21 years old. I'm a full-time EMT for the last 2 years, and expecting to begin a year-long paramedic program at the end of the month to further my career (and my paycheck). 

At 17, I made a huge mistake. I thought I wanted to go to nursing school and pursue that career path. 2 years in at an expensive private school, I found myself in a deep depression, hating nursing school and nursing itself. I quit nursing school and went into EMS. I immediately felt a million times happier, and I know that EMS is truly where I want to be. Anyways, this path to finding out what I want to do has left me in a bit of a bind. 

I'm currently approximately $40k+ in debt from student loans.

The majority of these loans (approximately $37k) is in private loans through a notorious servicer. The remaining amount was taken out as federal loans and is now in the hands of a servicer. 

Currently, due to some personal life circumstances, I was left unable to pay these loans in the amounts that they are requesting each month. I had to move out of my mother's home and into my own place in order to get to work, so now I am paying rent, utilities, etc every month. My monthly income is typically just enough to cover this with a couple hundred bucks left over for food and other things that may come up. I am starting a new job soon that will be paying me a few dollars more an hour, but I will need that extra income to pay my way through paramedic school. (It's a pay-as-you-go program. At the end of the year, I will have paid about $6,000 in total for it throughout the program and should have no further financial responsibility to it after the program ends.) 

My question to all of you financially-literate people: How do I help myself out with this mess? I know that's vague, but I'm really looking for any option to reduce my payments, or even to defer them for now. 

I'm honestly trying to do what's right by me in pursuing my passion, and give back to my community along the way, but I'm drowning here and I'm desperate. 

Thank you all in advance, I truly appreciate it!",finance

personalfinance,"Received an inheritance, requesting feeback on optimizing use of windfall, including reallocating retirement portfolio","I recently received an inheritance ($74k inherited IRA plus a $23k life insurance payout) and I would like feedback on how to use the unexpected funds as well as feedback on how to reallocate investment portfolio in view of this financial development. I am 31 years old, married, with two young children, located in the US. I'm employed (spouse is currently stay-at-home parent) with an annual income of $48k. I'm looking to change jobs within the next year. 

We owe around ~$80k on our house (currently worth around $200k) and my wife and I have combined ~$117k in student loan debt from graduate school. Average student loan interest rate is 6.57%. Our cars are paid off and we have no other debts. General expenses are charged to a cash back credit card that's paid off on a monthly basis. 

Here is our current financial picture:

Inherited IRA 1 - Note that I have to take out RMDs. In 2018, I took out more than what was required with the aim to pay down student loans, but I haven't made the loan payment yet. 

189k total 

35% large cap (VOO 27%, MSFT 4%, V 4%)

30% fixed income (SCHZ 30%)

35% cashish (SWVVX 35% - sold off some stocks in September 2018 and had it parked in money market)  

Inherited IRA 2, part of the recent windfall. Will have to take out RMDS starting this year. 

$74k 100% cash (currently in a cash allocation, it is en route from deceased relative's brokerage to my brokerage)

Vanguard 401k (I make the minimum contribution to receive maximum matching)

$20k (Vanguard target retirement 2050)

Savings - $65k (includes $23k life insurance payout)
Checking - $7k

I was thinking of paying down student loans by $35k then putting $10k in two Roth IRAs for my wife and I. That would leave $20k as an emergency fund. On the other hand, we will likely need to buy a new house in a better school district within the next two years, so a down payment on a new house would also be a good option. 

I would be happy to hear your opinions on how to use the windfall, including retirement portfolio allocations.

personalfinance,"$200,000+ Debt Emergency - Advice Needed","I'm trying to help my brother and sister in-law with what I would describe as a debt emergency.  Over the holidays, I sat down with my wife, her parents and her sister and brother-in-law to discuss potential options. At the conclusion of that meeting, we thought we had a best course of action but have recently met with some hurdles.  Here's a breakdown of their current financial situation, options we proposed and where we're at now.  I wanted to see if anyone here has ideas we haven't come up with yet.  Also, I should mention that they have two small children under the age of 4 which is relevant when discussing expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

Current Financial Situation:

Monthly Income: $5,400

Brother-in-law brings home $5,400/month and is receiving about $7,000 in a year-end bonus this month.

Sister-in-law used to bring home $4,400/month working full-time but recently lost her job and may be unable to work full-time in the future due to a medical condition.

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly Expenses: $9,755

Mortgage: $2,100

Utilities: $330

Medical Debt: $79

Cell Phone: $218

Groceries: $880

Daycare: $1,998 (this could go away if Sister-in-Law stays home with the kids)

Car Insurance (Liability Only): $160

Clothing: $100

Credit Card Payments: $845

Unsecured Personal Loan Payments: $2,007

Student Debt Payments: $1,038

&amp;#x200B;

Current Monthly Cash Flow: - $4,355

&amp;#x200B;

Assets and Liabilities:

&amp;#x200B;

Assets:

Single Family Home Valued at $320,000

Checking and Savings Accounts are tapped out: $0

&amp;#x200B;

Liabilities:

Mortgage Debt: $243,000 @ 3.5% interest 30yr fixed

Credit Card Debt: $33,500 @ 20.5% Weighted Average Interest Rate

Personal Loan Debt: $80,500 @ 14.2% Weighted Average Interest Rate

Student Loan Debt: $111,350 @ 6.63% Weighted Average Interest Rate

Total Debt (excluding mortgage): $225,000 @ weighted Average of 11.4%

&amp;#x200B;

Ideas we proposed for digging out of this hole:

\- Sister-in-law stays home, that gets rid of $2,000 per month of child care costs.  

\- File Chapter 7 Bankruptcy - this would have theoretically get rid of $2,900 in personal and credit card payments and $114,000 in personal and credit card debt.  However, Brother-in-law makes more than the median income for the state they live in which disqualifies them from filing Chapter 7.

\- File Chapter 13 Bankruptcy - this means they'd have to pay all of their disposible income to their creditors for 5 years.  This may be an option but I'm not sure how the court calculates their disposible income.  I've heard that any bonuses they make and any money my sister-in-law makes if she goes to work part-time, would essentially be taken directly by the bankruptcy trustee.

At this point, they're thinking of selling the house to get the $45,000 - $50,000 in equity left over after paying escrow and realtor fees and applying that to their highest interest debt (all of the credit card debt and part of the personal loan debt).  Then they plan on renting a house in a less expensive part of town which would cost about $1800 per month.

&amp;#x200B;

Taking away the $2,000 in childcare costs, $845 in credit card payments and $300 in reduced housing costs, their new monthly expenses would be $6,610.  This still represents a shortfall of about $1,200 per month.  There's not a lot they can cut from the budget at this point to get their expenses down another $1,200.  His parents do live locally but it would be a huge inconvenience for all involved if the 4 of them moved into his parents' house.  I don't think it would be good for anyone.  I'm kind of at a loss for what to suggest next.  Any help you all can provide is appreciated!

Several commenters replied asking if the 16th Amendment didn't in fact negate my argument. I created a new post because it requires more than a few sentences to adequately respond. People have gone to jail over this stuff, as it gets complicated. For those with limited attention please skip to the TL;DR/Conclusion for the most important part. Others may find a benefit to reading as it will make you a more effective tax protester or possibly a new one.

There are several problems with the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution

**Problem #1 - The 16th Amendment doesn't appear to have been properly ratified**

A proposed amendment becomes part of the Constitution as soon as it is ratified by three-fourths of the States. [source](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/constitution) However, tax protesters argue the 16th Amendment was likely not properly ratified. [This site](https://www.givemeliberty.org/features/taxes/notratified.htm) details the findings of Bill Benson, author of The Law that Never Was, on why the 16th Amendment wasn't properly ratified. The official position of the government, of course, is that it in fact was ratified properly. My conclusion is the situation is dubious at best.

**Problem #2 - The text of the 16th Amendment doesn't undo the original wording in question** 

Here is the exact wording of the 16th Amendment:

*The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.*

Notice how nothing is said about the original wording of the Constitution this amendment aims to address. As stated in my original comment that wording is in two places: 

Article I, Section 2: *direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States*

Article I, Section 9, Clause 4:*No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken.*

For the 16th Amendment to NULLIFY existing stated requirements it must explicitly do so. For example, the amending text could instead start with ""This hereby repeals any existing requirement that Direct taxes be apportioned by states or in proportion to any census or enumeration."" Now, that is explicit. That is clear. That is NOT what the 16th Amendment says. Why not? If I could think of it, couldn't legal experts in the early 1900s? Is the reason such clear text isn't there because it would be harder to get that properly passed by the States?

Since it doesn't explicitly repeal anything we must therefore conclude the original requirements REMAIN IN EFFECT. What then does the 16th Amendment do, if anything? Again, look at the wording. It is very clear. It says Congress has the power to collect taxes on INCOMES from whatever source derived and without any apportionment requirement. 

Let's pause right there. What is ""income""? That's the explicit key word, income. The dictionary definition is ""a coming in"". For example, if one is standing and an airplane shoots a missile at them, that would be an appropriate time to say ""missile incoming!"" In other words, to have something coming in doesn't require the recipient do anything. The action of coming in happens independently by definition. An example of monetary income is a savings account earning interest. At intervals additional money is added to the account automatically. The money has come in, regardless of action of the account holder. Similarly, payments from winning a lottery or gaining an inheritance would qualify as ""income"" because those would be come in by mail or other means to the recipient automatically, independent of any action. These are fitting monetary definitions of income. By contrast, showing up on a job site, performing a task, and being handed cash at the end of that task has not anything to do with ""income"". That is simply an *exchange* of labor for something else of value, in this case the the monetary payment.

A clearer example might be workers in fields. Historically, there were vendors who set up shop selling refreshing drinks and delicious food at the edges of fields so that sometimes workers who had sweat for hours, upon being handed cash payment at the end of the day then spent everything at the vending booths! It could have been decided, to save time, the workers were instead simply rewarded with plates of food and drinks as payment, leaving cash out of the picture. Would the gov call that income? Obstinate gov lawyers might, so let's continue the thought experiment. Say a person eats a meal at a restaurant then finds they've left their wallet at home. Nervously, they tell the shop owner they're a bit drunk and prefer skipping a long drive to retrieve their wallet and would, if allowed, wash all the dishes instead to cover the meal. The shop owner could agree. Would that then be income? If so how so? If a person could trade cash for a meal and have it not be income, but trade their labor for a meal and have it be income what has changed? The same activity MUST be classified consistently. Wages on labor are NOT income, and therefore are NOT newly allowed to be taxed by the 16th Amendment. 

**Problem #3 - The 16th Amendment Doesn't Nullify the 5th Amendment**

The 5th Amendment of course protects individuals from being forced to incriminate themselves. If it's true that filing a tax return incorrectly can result in prosecution for jail time, and federal prosecutors can use said tax returns to achieve that result, then how can the government also **mandate** a person potentially incriminate themselves by filing a return by a deadline, contrary to the protection of the 5th Amendment? 

By the way, why is the paperwork filed at tax time called ""tax returns""? How can one ""return"" something they never receive? The reason for the wording is the government used to handle taxes in a legally consistent way: the government would assess a person's tax liability and send them the a bill for taxes due. The individual could then review things, claim adjustments or disputes then *return* forms with adequate payment if any. That makes a lot more sense. In this way, the individual never admits up front they owe the government anything. People start out innocent, clear of liability. The government then makes a claim for a liability, and the individual can agree or reject and defend against it. 

Individuals cannot be legally compelled to submit and sign paperwork which can then simultaneously be used to prosecute them, as that's a violation of the 5th Amendment.

**TL;DR and Conclusion**

Say you disagree with Problem's 1, 2, and 3, as presented. You believe the 16th Amendment was ratified properly, the text was clear enough that the people of the time knew what they were signing on to, that this includes the non-explicitly stated power to repeal the original wording of the Constitution, that ""income"" does include wages on labor, and individuals must file forms that can incriminate them in conflict with the 5th Amendment. Let's say you believe ALL that, because that's what's required to enforce the system as it now exists in the United States. There is still a giant problem. 

**Where is the law?**

The 16th Amendment says Congress has the power to collect taxes on incomes, so where is the law Congress made that does this? Find me that and then maybe I'll say, yes, it can be argued the current system is above board and justifiably enforced with jail, violence and other means. I won't hold my breath.

The amazing gift the Founders gave to ordinary citizens was more than simply physical freedom. They gave people **economic** freedom. That's the secret to America's success. People didn't flock to America in search of handouts. They didn't come for Social Security, welfare, or other social safety nets like Obamacare, because none of that existed. They came for opportunity, they came to be free. It turns out if you simply let people keep the fruits of their own labor they are perfectly capable of prospering just fine, and the unprecedented success of the USA, being such as young country, shows the power of that simple design. America has been moving away from its founding roots, though, and has been suffering more and more various ways as a result. There are too many examples of this to list. But this is where Bitcoin comes in. The fact is Bitcoin Cash has the potential to return economic freedom to Americans, allowing them to again prosper more evenly, not just watch the top tiniest percent flourish. It doesn't stop there. Americans were fortunate to have the unique situation of such educated men leading the way out of the American Revolution and giving birth to a free country. Bitcoin Cash can deliver some of that same power to people **around the world**. THAT is what's so exciting and what makes so many passionate about this technology.

personalfinance,Quick question: Either invest in later property or into fun,"Hi!

&amp;#x200B;

I REALLY love this community since I discovered it, wish there would be one like this for germany half as active!

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have a ""bausparvertrag"" - you put money into an account and in some years, once you reached 40% of a certain amount you get 60% loan and 40% of your own money(back). I don't get the money beforehand, I cannot just get it without paying a penalty.

I did it because I wanted to buy a house in 5 years, this contract guarantees me a 1,5% interest rate, which I didn't want to pass on (It will remain this, even when interest is 8% in 5 years.)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I don't want a house anymore. I want one or two apartments I can rent out. I put 100€ into funds(for retirement) each month and 150 (in a few month 200€) into this ""Bausparvertrag"" to get the money quicker and buy apartments earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course my budget isn't too tight, so I still have room of around 200-300€ a month, which isn't budgeted for anything

At the end of each month I will have a look at my excel, see: Ah, I didn't spent 200€ this month. Right now I plan on putting 33% into a savings account for future purchases (fun stuff, nothing for retirement or so) and 66% into... Yeah, I don'T really now. Either my funds for retirement, into stocks (but to be honest.. around 130€ isn't much to invest with..). Or I put the 66% into the Bausparvertrag to get the apartments even earlier.

personalfinance,"23yo with low income, frequent traveler, and property owning aspirations. Considering for the first time getting a credit card and investing in stocks. Any advice appreciated.","I am 23 years old and so is my partner. We live in the United States. We live an unconventional lifestyle ie. no full time jobs with benefits/hardly even part time jobs, live in our van or at our parents', dumpster dive regularly for food, put high value on traveling/having experiences rather than material items, and have aspirations to have property one day we will turn into a permaculture food forest/community. 

&amp;#x200B;

My current income is very low. Last year (2017) I earned a taxed income of under $5,000. I also earned non-taxable income (cash), but not a significant amount (at most $1k). I probably earned between $5-$8,000 this year, but I'm not sure right now. We had a gig for a steady three months we earned $15/hr about 20 hours a week. I rate Instagram Ads which brings in \~$250/month, and watch animals through Rover, which has brought me \~$650 in the last three months plus probably about $500 in cash through dog watching jobs not affiliated with Rover. My partner works under the table with a moving company and sells cuttings and nursery plants from his (parents') yard. I have a job lined up for mid-April to June, then a two-month Europe trip, and return to that same job through at least September. Ideally I would find a job until then as well. I am pretty comfortable the way I earn money, and am not looking to change my lifestyle, but simply enhance it with intelligent investments and financial decisions. 

On Jan. 5th, 2019, I have a little over $6,000 to my name, no debt, and no investments. My partner has slightly less money to his name and no debt or investments. I/we do not pay rent, and my biggest expense with my partner is gas and on certain months entertainment/experiences. We are VERY frugal as we understand our goals/lifestyle and our income reality. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the past several years I have flown multiple times per year and 80% of the time with Frontier. I have been considering applying for a Frontier Credit Card so I can start earning miles on my purchases, but I don't know if a.) I will get approved with such low income and no credit established and b.) if it is even a good idea. I browsed their terms and read this:

&gt;0% INTRODUCTORY APR   
ON BALANCE TRANSFERS  
&gt;  
&gt;0% introductory APR for 15 months on balance transfers made within 45 days of account opening. After that, a variable APR will apply, 18.24%, 22.24% or 27.24%, based on your creditworthiness. There is a fee for balance transfers.

I really don't know anything about APR in the first place and hardly what that means, but that seems pretty steep to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I don't apply for the Frontier Credit Card, should I apply for a credit card at all? 

&amp;#x200B;

We are also considering investing. Supposedly in a few days, an [index fund](https://www.beyondfundadvisors.com/our-indices/index/) ""VEGN"" will be available that supposedly only invests in companies not *directly* destroying the environment (ie. fossil fuel or factory farming corporations). This is slightly still morally questionable for us considering they invest in large corporations like Apple and Verizon who are still directly mining the earth, but its better than nothing? Not being morally 100% behind the companies and corporations has been my biggest hesitation in investing stocks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our ideal life is one where we can obtain a piece of property by the time we are 30 (sooner would be better), start putting our investments in the ground (food and resource producing plants), and live a simple life. We highly entertain the idea of building several different tiny houses and structures to rent out/rent through Airbnb as our main source of income once that day comes, but we have to get there first, and we question if we are on the right or most direct path. We hope that by living a simple life, we essentially will be living in ""retirement"" and be able to travel/have experiences as we please. It is not a life for everyone and I understand that, but we are committed to it. It's simply who we are. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this is enough information. I'm looking for general advice. I've been so non-conformist and ""fuck the system"" forever I have pretty much chastised any thought of getting locked in ""the system"" (ie. through credit or stocks), which also means I have no fundamental knowledge about how any of this works. I understand the very basics of taxes, but that's about it. 

Oh, one last thing. I bank with Fifth Third and am considering switching to a credit union with higher interest rates on accounts and also that aligns more with my values with their borrowing/investments. I have not done any research on specific credit unions as it was an idea that came to me today.

gaming,This Kenshi review on Steam has to be the most interesting review I've ever read. It is: Iron Dawn,"I've only quoted here the parts that talk about his actual play of game.  [Full review is here](https://steamcommunity.com/id/sEvher/recommended/233860/)

&gt;My experience of Kenshi after first few days of playing with it:

&gt;I've played it safe, had a house in a city, earning my living by some mining, cooking my own food, training the new orphan girl I hired from the Hub to do things around the house. Never stole a thing, except looting some bandits who died when they chased me to a ninja trading outpost. Ninjas ain't no joke. 

&gt;On one of the mine trips we've got attacked by hungry bandits again. We've run to the guards, and they pacified the bandits, but my trusty companion Ruka got hurt in the head really bad. 
I've carried her to the town, it was night, all shops were closed, and we had no bandages to stop her bleeding and they didn't have any at the bars. Got to use all my money, 6k cats, to hire a guy who said he is a medic. He was and he had the bandages and all the fancy medical stuff and he saved her. She got way stronger since then, my brave Ruka, sometimes she even helps City guards with the bandit criminals. The medic name is The Wall, he is a bit lazy, but we keep him busy training with the crossbow turret and making medkits at home. We're glad to have him.

&gt;Sometimes I go out in the desert, hunting goats, bonedogs, or mighty garru. It takes a lot of kiting with the crossbow to down an animal, but I can always use the training in both crossbows and running. I'll get better.

&gt;We've started our own camp, few minutes away from the city gates, wanted to mine stone, so we could make our own building materials, as the store in the city doesn't have such a strong supply. We had the production facilities set up, but not the walls, some raiders came, claimed the place as their own, they were armed and armored, we were not a match, so we just ran. We will get back our camp at Crossroad Wreck one day. The orphan girl got good at researching too and we already know how to build decent walls and proper crossbow turrets. 

&gt;I frequently visit the explorers shop, just down the street when we run with Rukka with backpacks full of Iron every morning, to increase our strenght. They have books there, some of them tell stories about riches in the swamps, and the dangers there. We will go there too, in time. 



&gt;Update after 158 hrs in the game: 

&gt;Squin life was going pretty slow and easy, as town life should be. We made pretty big money mining and we hired all the Shek warriors that were looking for work in Squin bars. They're Ruka's squad now and we call them ""Black Guard"". You should see them how they deal with bandits nowadays. Namir, tall as a mountain, with this tiny high quality sabre in his giant hand, Ruka with a plank worth twice as much as our house, sweeping it like a scythe through a field, cutting down the enemy as if they were blades of dry grass. Loudmouthed Kang and quiet Nines, both good with the Sabre too, and two medics, all well equipped with the best armor of our own production. 
They're no joke now. The entire roof of our house was dedicated to their training for months. Weightbenches, training mats, attack training dummies, we had it all. Plus two cages where we kept whatever we could catch. A knocked out Garru, a wild Bonedog, or a Bandit. We mostly used those to train defense. 

&gt;I've went to Hub once again, recruited that sweet cook Molly, she was the first person I ever spoke to in the Hub, back then, when I only had a rusted iron stick to my name, a ragged shirt and a pair of pants. She now makes our cactus food, while the orphan girl Heft works the crossbow turret at the Crossroad Wreck entry gate. We have double perimeter walls and enough turrets to perforate a small army to look like Garru cheese. Invaders do not get to live long. That group that threw us out of our town, back when we just placed first production facilities... Last time they came, the fight lasted around a minute and we had really hard time trying to stabilize just a few of their dying to save them for the fight house. 

&gt;Times have changed. Our fields of cactus, hemp, and wheat whisper softly in the northern wind. We are essentially independent of Squin right now. Wind turbines whirl, lights flicker, water burbles in the wells. A life we have built in this at first sight inhospitable desert, did not come easy, but that makes us cherish it even more. In a shadow of this giant wreck of a mysterious ancient structure we have made a safe place to call our own. To build what we wish, and how we wish it. We've researched almost everything we possibly could from the books available at Squin adventure shop and I see our Chief Smith Engineer Foren sometimes standing on the roof of the industry building, looking west. We brought her from the waystation that way, and she says somewhere beyond there are places where hidden knowledge and treasures lie, waiting to get discovered and claimed. 

&gt;We also brought a Bugman named Hep from that place. A funny looking, tiny, very thin fellow. An extraordinary nighttime operator. It is not a problem for him to sneakily knock someone out and carry them away. We had him actually steal a prisoner from Squin tower once. A cute, but angry looking girl with one hand. We brought her home, healed, fed, she didn't mind joining us. I mean, who would? We bought her a robotic arm from a Hiver caravan, it goes well with a drifter jacket. For now we've attached her as crossbow girl to the Special Ops squad. Our army needs to branch out, if we're to conquer the wasteland.

&gt;I imagine we will go west soon. Once we're ready. Until we do, remember our name.

personalfinance,Stay in expensive Apartment or break the lease?,"Ok guys, here goes. 

I moved into an apartment 4 months ago with a friend of mine so I could be closer to college. (Living with my mom, it was a 1 hour drive without traffic 3-4 times a week and my schedule had to be planned around rush hour. It limited my class choices and social life at school.) When I got fed up with the commute, I declared that ""student loans will pay for my housing and living expenses!"" Uh..not quite. 

My school has given me about $4,000 a semester. ($1,000 a month) Rent ends up being around $1,000 a month, for my half alone. Paying for utilities, internet, groceries, car repairs etc. has left me with $1,500 in credit card debt, in addition to the $1,000 I had when I moved in. My job as a tutor has only been giving me around 6 hours a week, rather than the 10-15 I was relying on, which wouldn't've covered it anyway (I'm currently applying/interviewing for new jobs!)  I did not comprehend how utilites/water etc. would cost, and this expensive place was the only thing available. 

I'd rather move back in with my mom at this point to get the debt under control, even if I wouldn't have as much time to study/socialize with other students. 

However, the lease is a year long. It will cost around $2,000 to get out of the lease, which I could use student loan money to do. I also don't know how this would affect my credit (breaking the lease). Additionally, my room mate has anger management issues and would probably have a massive outburst if I told her I had to move out. I fear this. 

If you're wondering how I've got myself in this situation, so am I. Needless to say, lesson(s) learned.

personalfinance,"It seems based on my calculations that even with interest rates going up, it is better to pay off mortgage early than investing in bond funds or SP500. What am I overlooking?","If we assume that my marginal tax rate is *t*, my mortgage interest rate is *m* and the rate of return on any alternate investment is *r*, I believe that I am better off investing instead of paying off mortgage as long as *r &gt; m/(1-t)*

My reasoning is as follows. Suppose I have $100 to either invest or pay into mortgage. If I invest into a taxable account, leave the money there for a year, and then withdraw the full amount, I will receive 100 x (1+r), but with taxes, will only get 100 x (1 + r (1-t) )

However, if I throw this money into my mortgage and consider interest saved as income, then I have netted 100 x (1 + m). Additionally, I don't pay taxes on this ""income"".

Using assumptions of m = 3.375%, t = ~~33%~~ 15% (fixed erroneous assumption), it seems that any investment with an expected return below ~~5.6%~~ 4.4% is worse off than paying into the mortgage. 

Interestingly, over the last 20 years, the annualized return from the SP500 is 3.46%.

Additional assumptions: 401k maxed, all tax-reducing income deductions have been applied

MachineLearning,[D] Convolution Sequence to Sequence for HTR Pytorch Implementation Issues,"Hello, I am trying to implement a sequence to sequence-based model for handwritten text recognition.

I am using IAM Dataset which has almost 7000 training image and text pairs. I have modelled in almost the same as the SCAN paper indicates but there are some issues with my implementation. The model is giving very poor accuracy on test set. After the first epoch, the loss value doesn’t decreases but revolves around a range of value. This is my very first paper implementation on Pytorch. I am linking the Google Colab [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PDa6o4TZC0s_N8zaVytyCZhL1xaDE-dz) here, please help me out on this issue.

Just to clarify, the images are scaled to (32, ) maintaining aspect ratio. The images are batched and padded since all images have different widths. The image batch is passed through the Convolution Extraction layer which outputs feature in shape \[batch\_size, channel, seq\_len\]. The encoder is fed with above output with sequence expanding across seq\_len. The text are also batched and padded with token with and token at start and end. While training, the decoder initially is fed with token and further the decoder outputs are fed back into decoder as decoder\_inputs. I hope this somehow clarifies what my approach is.

personalfinance,Bad financial decisions along with debt control question.,"So, all total between my wife and I, we had about $11,200 in credit debt and a car loan. $9,500 of it being basically credit. I had 5 credit accounts, pretty damn well maxed, all stupid ""I can't wait for another paycheck to buy this stuff, I'll pay it back when I get paid"" mentality from me. Which of course, I never did. That was about $4,500 of it on my cards. The Remaining $5,000 is on her single card, that was our ""emergency"" card, so most of it was stuff like Vet expenses for our animals, groceries when we were short, car repairs etc etc. 

So of course she hated the fact we were paying 6 credit cards, 5 of which was my bad spending habits. So I curbed the habits, but we couldn't afford to do anything but the minimum payments when I got out of the Army and started up into college. I ended up getting a decent sized inheritance of about 5,000 dollars from a family member who passed while I was in the Army, it was left at a small local bank 3 years prior, so my wife and I had forgotten. So we picked it up when I was reminded by my mother that it was there. We immediately paid all of my cards off, and will be putting the remaining 500 towards her card. Basically leaving us at 4,500 dollars in credit left. (Her credit score was about 715, mine was 595, from the little credit estimator because my payments were never late and paying them off, this will raise me to about a 700! Yay!) with the truck payment. So here comes the kicker. 

We made a deal with a guy I worked with in the Army (who was a trusted friend....) that we would sell the truck to him. (There was about 2,300 left on the loan at this point) He was planning on selling his truck and we had to get off island (Hawaii) quicker than expected so we didn't have time to really shop around, so we basically said, give us like 400 as a good faith sell, then give us the monthly payment until he sold his other truck and could pay the rest off. 

Might I mention we were giving him a huge deal, the truck was worth about 5,500 itself, so he was getting it super cheap. Well he did okay for the two months, then it was like pulling teeth with him to get him to pay. Finally my other buddies got back from Korea, so I told them to check up on this guy with the truck. Well they did, and apparently the truck was impounded on October 5th for trespass. I figured this out on January 3rd. 

The truck had racked up about 2,500 dollars in tow fees, and when I finally got a hold of the towing company they said they were disposing of the vehicle the next day. Mind you too, the guy didn't even know who towed the truck, I had moved to Virginia by this point, and spent my time calling Honolulu Police Department to track down the truck. 

The guy didn't even make an attempt to find the truck. So, I finally got my friends to tell this guy, he either needs to go down to the tow yard, pay the fees, and then hand the keys over to a different friend to sell the vehicle, or he needs to pay me the remainder of the loan and I'll let the truck get crushed. 

He said ""I was just planning on giving you the payments until it was paid for"" after we gave him an extension on it and he didn't even tell us the truck was impounded. So at this point it looks like my wife and I are eating the remaining $1,700 left on this truck, not to mention I'm super worried about the bank (Navy Federal) figuring out the truck was crushed and somehow retaliating on me because the title is liened to them due to my vehicle loan. 

So backstory out of the way, I now have $4,500 of credit on one single card, the minimum alone seems to be around $75 and will go down as the balance goes down. The truck payment has a super low minimum of like $12 but we try to pay $100 monthly. What is my priority here? Should we focus on getting the car loan taken care of, or focus on dropping the balance on the card, especially with tax returns on the horizon. 

I've heard that you have to keep using your cards so you don't get lower credit scores from inactivity, with my 5 cards, how can I do that without overspending and falling back into bad habits? Can I just spend like 50 dollars on one card every month and immediately pay it off when the statement is due? 

Does anyone know if the bank can retaliate to a tow company disposing of a vehicle with a loan still out? 

And finally, where do I even start on getting a $4,500 credit balance down? The minimum is high with both my wife and I on part-time jobs and full time students. Should we go higher than the minimum, if so, how much over? 

Basically what are my next steps, what should I focus on. My cards are done and paid, so its consolidated to basically a vehicle loan and one card. I make about $450 bi-weekly, she makes about $500 bi-weekly, but it will fluctuate with school coming back, my rent is also paid for through the GI-Bill, so its just groceries and debt with stuff like pet food, litter, etc etc. I'm lost here and feeling a tad overwhelmed with all this truck stuff on top of the remaining debt!

I want to know how to best use this to sort out my finances as I have quite a bit of debt and not a great income. I recently underwent a two month period of unemployment which completely depleted my bank account and I am now working a job making half as much as I did before. The refund check will be approximately $2,500 and will be dispensed on February 15th. Here is my current financial situation: 

* Bank account balance: Approx. $0
* Weekly income: Approx. $250-450 depending on client load
* Credit card debt
   * Discover: $1,000 with a 15.9% interest rate, on a hardship payment plan paying $57/mo due to unemployment
   * Target: $1,000 with a 24.9% interest rate, working on getting a payment plan and currently paying $84/mo
* Car loan payment: $200/mo; approx. $3,500 to pay off completely, with 1.5 years left on the loan
* Car insurance payment: $150/mo
* Rent: $500/mo, utilities included; the lease is up at the end of May and I am considering moving to a cheaper apartment
* Phone: $20/mo
* Miscellaneous expenses: $200/mo (gas, pet care, groceries, medications, etc.)
* Car repairs that need to be done but I can't afford: $500

Some other details that might be important, but probably not: Based on my previous tax returns I'm anticipating getting a $1,000-$1,500 return by the end of tax season. I always file early so hopefully this will be sooner rather than later. As far as my income goes, I am in the works of discussing a promotion with my company, and if that pans out my income will most likely be a bit more stable. I am also going on a week-long vacation in March (all expenses paid thanks to the generosity of my partner's parents), but that will set me back as I won't be making any money that week. Also, I currently have a credit score of 655. 

Right now, I'm thinking the best plan for me would be to just knock out all of my credit card debt as that would help in the long term. However, I feel as if it would also be pertinent to try and combine both my student refund and tax refund and pay off my car loan as soon as possible, which would allow me to have a lower insurance rate with less comprehensive coverage. But, I feel financially illiterate and would like help figuring this all out. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,How to handle taxes as a freelancer/independent contractor,"I asked this in ElI5 but it got removed since I asked a couple of broad questions in here as well. 



I'm looking into working online teaching English. From what I hear you should put away around 25% of what you make so you can pay your taxes at the end of the year.



While doing some research, I read quarterly taxes might possibly need to be paid, and it didn't seem there was a way around it without paying some sort of penalty. Why exactly is this necessary? It said that if you would owe $1000 at the end of the year, you'd have to pay quarterly. $1k would be 25% of just $4k and I'm trying to earn at least $10k yearly.



I don't understand the other things I've read like, ""If your federal tax withholdings comprise 90% of the tax you owe for the year"" you probably don't need to pay quarterly taxes. What does that mean (someone said this wasn't relevant to my situation but I would still like to know in case it becomes relevant)? I've only ever just used the free version of Turbo Tax for regular work so I'm not well versed in taxes and owing as a freelancer. Can you use Turbo Tax for free quarterly?



Additionally,  how is what you owe calculated?
In my last post it was recommended I get an accountant. Are there online teachers out there doing this without one? I don't see myself affording one and if I could do what I need to do myself, it would be better money wise.

personalfinance,Walmart charged for battery but never installed it,"A few months ago my I took my car to a Walmart about 45 mins away (since the one near me doesn’t have auto services) to install tires and a battery. 
After ringing up the work order for tire install, I asked for the battery. The employee rang me up for the battery and took it back behind the counter. After a few hours the car I picked up the car and the work appeared to be done. After a couple of months of normal use, I go to start the car and it doesn’t turn on. I thought I left something on. So I find someone to get a jump and low and behold, see the original Toyota battery still there!!
Called up the Walmart corporate customer service which opened a case and sent it to the store. An employee from store calls back. After weeks of trying to reach the employee, I finally get a hold of her. She has no recollection of ever calling me, described the whole situation to her but apparently there’s nothing they can do because there’s no work order for a battery!
Obviously I should’ve popped the hood and checked the battery but what is my recourse here?

UPDATE 1: Found the receipt. It does not have any entry for installation. Also the battery core fee is there but then voided which is curious. 

UPDATE 2: after many calls to store and sending in my receipt and credit card statement, I was surprised to finally see a fedex overnight envelope with a money order for the amount I paid!",finance

personalfinance,Need some clarification for self employed on new Form 1040,"Starting January 2018, I have been self-employed and my income has come through my single member LLC. I live in WA state, so no state income tax. I paid $1,300 in estimated taxes so far in 2018. I filled out Schedule C, SE, and Form 8829 for business use of home as I used my apartment as office space and storage space. So far, here's what I have:

**Gross income** = $67,271.55

Expenses = $35,946.84

Business use of home + util. = $8,566.66

**Net Income** = **$22,788.05**

Using Schedule SE, I calculated that I owe **$3,219.85** in taxes this year, so minus the estimated payment of $1,300, I should have to pay **$1,919.85.**

Here are my questions:

1. On Form 1040, standard deduction is $24,000 (married filing jointly), so what happens if the deduction is higher than my net income?
2. What should I put in the Qualified Business Income Deduction line?

personalfinance,Big taxes to pay for 2018. Possible misclassification as independent contractor.,"In 2018, for about 6 months, I worked for a company as a freelancer working in the tech industry.  For the current firm, I get paid hourly, but the company does not take out any taxes for SS, Unemployment, State or Fed taxes. (I've worked freelancer before, but typically through a staffing firm, as an employee of the staffing agency. I once worked as a freelancer a few years ago, for about 1 month, while in-between jobs.) I do not currently have an LLC or report as an S-Corp.

In discussing with a friend, who has an S-Corp, she thinks that I will have many taxes to pay in April and possibly penalties for not paying quarterly taxes. I think she's right. However, she and I believe that I have probably been misclassified as an independent contractor by the firm, in an attempt by them to avoid paying payroll taxes to the IRS. Here are some reasons why I believe this is so:

* I work M to F at their office, during set office hours, 99% of the time
* 99% of the time, I use their equipment
* Every project has had someone overseeing my work
* The work to be done is determined by the contract their customer has with the firm
* When turning in work, I use templates provided by them for presenting work
* I use software of their choosing for completing the work
* I have been invited to employee parties, all-company meetings/townhalls
* I received an email about annual performance reviews

In all but name, I feel that I'm being treated like an employee -- other than not offering benefits and not withholding taxes. 

I did a Google search for something like **employer not paying taxes** and found some information and forms on IRS.gov website. 

* [About Form 8919, Uncollected Social Security and Medicare Tax on Wages](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8919)
* [Independent Contractor \(Self-Employed\) or Employee?](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/independent-contractor-self-employed-or-employee) 
* [About Form SS-8, Determination of Worker Status for Purposes of Federal Employment Taxes and Income Tax Withholding](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-ss-8)
* [Employer and Employee Responsibilities - Employment Tax Enforcement](https://www.irs.gov/compliance/criminal-investigation/employer-and-employee-responsibilities-employment-tax-enforcement)

In the last link, the IRS says ""Employees who are concerned that their employer is improperly withholding or failing to withhold federal income and employment taxes should report their employer by contacting the IRS at 1-800-829-1040."" I think this is my best bet for TY 2018. Form SS-8 goes with Form 8919, but I believe they report that you sent in this form to your employer. 

In case any one is curious, I would not accept a FT position with this company. Shady tax schemes are enough for me. 

Anyone else have any tips? I do have the names of at least 3-4 accountants, as well as an employment lawyer a friend recommended. I plan to reach out with them.

personalfinance,Feedback on current financial situation,"Hi everyone. Anonymous username for various reasons.

  

A little background about my situation. I am a 30-year-old female and live with my boyfriend of 9 years (same age). We both started out making around $30k each at the age of 22 or 23. We both had very slow career progression in our jobs at the time and we wanted to make a change. In 2015, I went back to school for a master’s degree at the age of 27 to change to a career in accounting and ultimately obtain a CPA license. I did not work from the fall of 2016 until graduation in August 2017. Taking full-time masters courses while also studying for the CPA exam was a full-time job itself. I took out a loan for school, and for the most part my boyfriend was generous enough to cover almost all of our bills and expenses for that year. Then came the reward of all that hard work. I went from making $36,000 in my previous job as of June 2015 to making $52,000 at my new job in October 2017. This job will also open up doors to extraordinary career growth, especially once I get my CPA license (all exams passed and experience requirement has been met, just have to formally apply for it now).  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, now that I have been working for just over a year (and now making $56,000), I suggested that now I pay most of the bills this year while my boyfriend decides what his next move will be – this hasn’t ultimately been decided yet. So, I wanted to share my current situation and get any feedback if possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

**A few things to note:** 

\- My job is very far away. I drive 140 miles round trip every day. I know one of the first recommendations here will be to move closer, but I will be searching for jobs closer to us this summer. I really wanted the experience at this current job but want to live where I am currently. Also, we just can’t beat our rent.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I know I am severely behind on my 401k. I started contributing at the age of 29, immediately after I started working in 2017. I currently contribute 8%. My employer matches 1.5% up to 6%. My boyfriend does not have a 401k or other retirement account.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I currently have 11k in savings. My goal is to get to 15k for an emergency fund and then save for a home. My boyfriend has about 35k in savings (he lived with his parents for a long time to be able to save before we moved in together).

&amp;#x200B;

\- I have two cars that I own outright. A 2014 Hyundai Sonata that I paid off last year (my everyday driver, excellent condition, 90k miles, estimated value $9,000) and a 2000 Honda Accord (250k miles, moderate to poor condition, only use when my car is in the shop, bad weather, and to transport my large dog to the vet, the park, etc. estimated value $1,000). I will keep both cars until they die. The Honda has helped tremendously with the upkeep of the interior of the Hyundai because my dog has never been in it. My boyfriend has a 2000 Taurus and a dirt bike. I pay to have maintenance done on both of mine, he does all the maintenance on both of his. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- The student loan mentioned above is the only debt either of us have. I have a credit card that I use for everyday expenses but it has always been paid in full every month since the day I got it when I was 22. My boyfriend has no credit.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Kids and marriage are definitely on the table but not until we are both settled into our respective careers. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Boyfriend is currently unemployed until February. I will not include his income here because it is unknown right now and I will be the one paying for all bills this year

&amp;#x200B;

So here is a breakdown of what our month to month finances will be:

&amp;#x200B;

**My Gross Monthly Income $4,666** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Pre-tax Deductions every month:** 

401k: $373 (8%) – 1.5% employer match up to 6%

HSA: $50 – as well as employer contribution $100

Health, Dental, Vision: $211 (we are both covered on the plan)

&amp;#x200B;

After taxes, my average net income is $2,700

&amp;#x200B;

**Recurring Bills:**

\- Rent: $750 (very old house on 3 acres)

\- Student Loan: 

* Original Loan: $20,500 
* Current balance: $18,592
* Interest rate: 5.060%
* Minimum payment: $232.06
* Actual payment: $300

\- Utilities: $143

\- Car insurance: $86

\- Trash/Recycling $18

\- Renters Insurance $30

\- Netflix/Hulu: $25

&amp;#x200B;

**Average Variable expenses (based on a 12-month average of 2018):**

\- Groceries: $330

\- Gas: $180 

\- Dining out: $200

\- Travel: $50

\- Clothes: $65 (this should be much less in 2019, as I needed new clothes for my job)

\- Cars: $50 (includes regular oil changes because of commute, car washes, maintenance, inspection, registration, etc.)

\- Other Misc. Expenses $100 (gifts, entertainment, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

\- My cell phone is paid for by employer

\- Boyfriend pays our internet ($55), his phone ($15), and his car insurance ($88)

&amp;#x200B;

That leaves me with about $400. Right now, I am currently saving it all. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My Goals:**

Get to 15k emergency fund by summer 2019

Save for a down payment on a home (between 20k-40k)

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:**

Should I be paying more towards 401k/student loan/HSA or keep saving for now? 

What are some recommendations to reduce recurring bills and expenses?

Any other tips about planning for my goals or our general situation?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!

The IRS website says that a person with an AGI between $64k and $74k will be entitled to a ""partial deduction"" for his IRA contribution. 

I have $6,000 ready to go and would like to contribute it to my IRA now (per this sub's maxim that time in the market &gt; timing the market). My impression is that I CAN do this; I simply will not be able to deduct the full amount come tax time. Is that right, and if so is there any reason to hesitate? This is the first year my AGI will be high enough that I'm not entitled to the full deduction. Should I consider taking some other approach?

Not getting the full tax benefit of a traditional contribution makes me want to do a Roth contribution instead, but I assume that is not allowed.

personalfinance,Consolidation to bring high interest down?,"Hello, first post to the forum. 

For 2019, I realized this growing CC debt I have is stressing me out somewhat and, based on my previous history of not doing anything about it (not taking action), I’m deciding to go head first in getting it under control.  

I have 5 credit cards with roughly 11K in CC debt. 4 cards are at 27.49% interest rate, 1 is at 22.49. Should I get a consolidation loan to pay these off at a lower interest rate? Or should I ask each of these cards to lower my rate so I can pay these down faster? 

Discover is tempting me with this personal loan offer for the past month (I have a Discover CC in good standing). Also, no $ in any of my savings accounts or emergency fund, and unfortunately my employer doesn’t have a 401K.  So essentially I have a old rollover IRA from my old job. 

Thanks,",finance

personalfinance,I feel like I haven’t made a dent in my student loans after paying towards them for almost 4 years. What options do I have?,"Hi I’m 29F and finished grad school in 2015 with about $34,000 in debt (most people are shocked by that so I’m assuming it’s a lot less than most people’s debt for grad school, but I went to a cal state for grad school and got a scholarship for undergrad). Anyway, the interest is really high on a couple of the loans and I feel like my payments pretty much all go towards interest and I feel like I’ve barely made a dent in the overall principal since I’ve graduated. I’m pretty good at saving and have a decent chunk of savings, and my sister advised me a while back to use some of my savings to pay 1-2 of the loans with the largest interest off. I knew it was a good idea but I was always so paranoid to spend that much at once and then not have much saved in case of an emergency. Now I honestly really regret it because I probably could have saved that money back up by now, but now I feel uneasy doing that because I’m currently pregnant. I’m on a loan repayment program that basically means my loans will be paid off after working ten years at a non profit, but I’ve only done 3.5 years so far and I’m not sure if I’ll stay at a non profit the whole time that I need. Some people have mentioned consolidating, but I really don’t know much about that and need to become more informed. What other options do I have or do people recommend any of the ones I just mentioned? I’m tired of making a payment every month that I feel is a waste of money because it’s not paying down my debt. Help! And thank you! 

Edit: sorry i did not post enough details about the loans, this is my first time posting here. Feel free to ask questions, and the two loans that have the highest interest rate (which are also the largest loans) are 10-11%. The rest are around 4-6%. Also, I do pay over the minimum every month. 

Edit: a few people recommended refinancing with Sofi, I will look into it for sure, thank you!",finance

investing,"The next hot career path may be in esports, but Hong Kong's kids don't want to play","Earlier this year, in parallel with its push to become an international events destination, Hong Kong spent $5 million on a three-day esports festival celebrating the vast and varied gaming cultures of *PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds* (*PUBG*), *League of Legends* and *Counter-Strike: Gobal Offensive*.  Nearly $13 million of the city’s 2018–19 budget is devoted to promoting  the sport this year. In addition to the festival, the promotion  includes mass-scale “venue innovation,” aka building new arenas and  repurposing facilities to focus on gaming.

The goal of  all this money and promotional effort is to make Hong Kong the gaming  and esports capital of the world. But further than tourism and  extracurriculars, Hong Kong’s largest youth nongovernmental  organization, the Federation of Youth Groups (FYG), hopes to frame  gaming as a viable career for the region’s youth. And the effort is not  based merely on the belief that [*Fortnite* and *PUBG* are awesome](https://www.ozy.com/need-to-know/special-briefing-the-game-that-took-over-the-world/87708).  Rather, as Hong Kong’s government looks to diversify its growing  economy, creating new jobs in gaming will help capitalize on the  near-billion-dollar global industry.

personalfinance,Desperately in need of immediate guidance PLEASE HELP ME!,"Hello, I am in quite a situation here and do not know how best to proceed. PLEASE HELP ME!

To start off, I just recently landed a new job, which pays exactly $68,122, bi-weekly $2,838. I started mid-December.

I just moved into a room in someone's house to save money. The room is costing me $850/month. Now I got myself in a mountain of debt because I was a heroin addict, and have been in recovery for the past 5 months. However, in the 4 years of active addiction I screwed myself over significantly, financially speaking, and in other respects, however, I am now trying to pick up the pieces of my life and put it back together.

Now I was going to ask you guys first how to proceed regarding all of my debt, and whether to pay it off or declare bankruptcy... but now things have gotten more complicated. I was just in an accident (my fault) and the insurance company is saying that they want to total my car instead of paying to fix it. The payoff amount they are telling is $23,500. However, I can choose to keep the car and fix it myself, in which case they will give me the car back, and about $16,000. However, the car will have a salvage title.

What exactly happened was the car hit a parked car (not a big or fast impact), however, it caused my car to flip on it's drivers side. The driver's side of the car is thus in pretty bad condition, and the mirror is broken off, however nothing beyond cosmetic issues. Additionally, the right bumper is a little dinged. They are now saying that there might also be some suspension damage, and in case there is anything wrong with the engine, they want to just total it. I am not sure if this is the best decision, and want to keep the car because I doubt I will be able to afford another one considering my credit score. I also do not know what to do now about getting a new car, in case it is best to let this one go.

I got this car about a month ago. I owe exactly $21,559, with a 10-day payoff amount of $21,988. I paid $3,000 down and pay $428/month for 72 months for my car, which is a 2014 Lexus is 250. The loan was at 11.9% for me considering my credit score was 580 for it. Now my credit score is 480, and I need to quickly decide what to do about my car since I have a rental only until end of business Tuesday, and I need a car to get to work, so please help me make the best informed decision as to whether I should keep the car and try to fix it with the money they give me, or use their money to buy a new car and keep this one for the loan, or let it go and try to get a new car, which means I lose thousands and risk not being able to afford a new one!

Now, here is how the rest of my debt look... I warn you, it is bad... please let me know how to even begin paying this back, or whether I should declare bankruptcy:

Open credit cards:

Capital One: $2,024/$2k limit, interest rate at 24.99%

Discover: $5,326/$5.5k limit, no interest until august on 5k, rest is at 24%

Amex 1: $4,600/$4.6k limit, interest rate at 18%

Amex 2: $1.900/$2,000 limit, no interest until may

Citibank: $1,924/$2k limit, no interest until october

Closed credit cards:

Chase 1: $5,200/$5k limit, 2% interest

Chase 2: $2,100/$2,500 limit, 2% interest

BOA 1: $7,100/$7,300 limit, 2% until March

BOA 2: $1,800/$2,000 interest rate at 26.99%

Open Loans:

Upstart $12,000 at around 13% ($300/month for 60 months, 1 year in)

Best Egg $8,580 at around 14% ($325/month for 36 months, 11 months in)

Navient

$5,900 at 6.8%

Great Lakes

$28,000 at between 6-6.8%

So altogether: $34k student loans, $21k other loans, $15k open CC, $16k closed CC, $22k car

I should also mention that I have exactly $7k in the bank, and so I have a little bit of money, not much, but enough to pay a bill or two, or perhaps put down a little bit in terms of a down-payment, or even to pay down some debt. I do not know what to do with this money, so if you have any suggestions I would like to hear them please and thank you!

I'm in the hole over $100k and I have no idea what I should do. Please help me. First and foremost, what should I do with the car issue? Then, how should I approach my huge mountain of debt? I am so grateful for your help, it means the world to me. Thank you for everyone taking the time out to help me. I can't wait to hear your suggestions and follow them thoroughly. Here's to a successful 2019 everyone!",finance

# 5 Things I'm Watching

We're going to make a progression from macro to micro. Ready?

**1) Jay Powell, foaming the runway**

Wall Street Journal [Fed Faces a Fresh Test: Engineering a Soft Economic Landing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-faces-a-fresh-test-engineering-a-soft-economic-landing-11546822609)  
*The disconnect presents the Federal Reserve with a tricky choice: focus more on the domestic economy and keep nudging interest rates higher to combat inflationary concerns, or pay greater attention to stresses abroad and in the markets, and hold rates steady or even nudge them lower.*

This comes after Powell spoke on Friday, which the markets liked. A lot. Basically, the markets are pricing in fewer rate hikes in 2019. The chances that 2019 closes with a fed funds rate equal to - or less than - the current level has shot up in recent weeks.

But is that accurate? Is the Fed chair for turning? That's a massive bet, and I think that a lot of Fed officials have kept the line in the past few weeks (or at least the voting members. Just ignore your Kaplans and your Kashkaris).

**What to watch this week:** Powell speaks on Thursday at 12:15pm ET, Clarida speaks on Thursday at 7pm ET.

**2) Yeah jerk, but how can we create 300,000+ jobs if the economy is slowing?**

Great question! That jobs report probably means there's still a lot of slack left in the labor force. LFPR hit a recent high. That was the best payroll print in almost a year. Wages grew at over 3%, but that was probably a one-off.  
What does this all mean for the economy? For the Fed? Honestly, who knows. If we're still getting this kind of jobs growth, the rate hikes over the past few quarters aren't really doing much to cool things off. That probably gives Powell and the Fed more justification to just keep going. Then again, inflation is at the Fed's target level. They've said a million times that the inflation target is symmetrical. Will they follow through?

It was such a weird jobs report with a lot of conflicting signals.

**3) Whatever the economic signals, S&amp;P 500 targets are being chopped down to size**

Wall Street Journal [Writhing Markets Force a Rethink of 2019 Wall Street Forecasts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/writhing-markets-force-a-rethink-of-2019-wall-street-forecasts-11546776000)

*Citigroup’s chief U.S. equity strategist, Tobias Levkovich, cut his year-end S&amp;P 500 forecast to 2850 from 3100, citing a December selloff that dragged the broad index onto the edge of a bear market. BMO Capital Markets’ chief investment strategist, Brian Belski, also trimmed his forecast: He now sees the S&amp;P 500 ending the year at 3000, down from 3150 previously. Similarly, Credit Suisse ’s chief U.S. equity strategist, Jonathan Golub, lowered his target to 2925 from 3350.*

A few things here:

* A lot of the forecasts came out in October and November, before the markets crapped out.
* Analysts notoriously swing for the fences here. Go back to late 2017, when a bunch of strategists had 3-handles on their 2018 year-end targets (CNBC [The stock rally is unfolding so fast investment banks are already raising their 2018 forecasts](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/21/investment-banks-are-already-raising-their-2018-targets.html))
* These guesses are completely predicated on what the Fed does, and these strategists know better than to try to predict how many times the Fed will hike (see: Goldman Sachs).
* That said, it's probably positive that these people are adjusting to the new reality. A lot of the earnings targets are staying put, it's the market multiples that are coming down. That's almost entirely on a combo of higher rates and less appetite for risk.

**4) China and the US finally getting it on trade**

It hurts both countries to be locked in a trade war. Who would have guessed. I think we're getting closer to some sort of agreement. The Chinese need to prop up their economy, which is slowing more than they would have guessed (oh, and their once-massive surplus is dwindling. Hello, capital flows!).

Trump still thinks that the markets are the scorecard for his success, and we've seen him push back on advisors who think otherwise.

This might go on for awhile longer, but we're finally seeing what were described as ""potential risks"" to a trade war finally happening.

**5) Chipmakers were left battered and bloody and in a puddle of its own urine. Things could only get better from here.**

That's at least what Heard on the Street argues. Wall Street Journal [Why the Chip Slump May Not Hurt Chip Investors](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-chip-slump-may-not-hurt-chip-investors-11546848103?mod=hp_listb_pos2)

These stocks will likely remain depressed in the coming months as the memory downturn unfolds, but investors should look for any signs of potential recovery. Cyclical stocks tend to bottom out before their underlying fundamentals. News about substantial capital-spending cuts from the major memory-chip makers could be a trigger. Samsung, Hynix and Micron effectively have an oligopoly in the DRAM market, making it easier for them to support prices with cuts to supply, as OPEC tries to do in the oil market. The NAND market is more fragmented, so manufacturers focusing purely on storage chips—like Toshiba or Western Digital —will likely do worse.",finance

financialindependence,"35, $1.1M - Luck, Stumbles, Dedication, and Thrift - An 11 Year Journey to FI","# Goal of this Post

I want this post to share my story on how I achieved FI. I don't want to focus on the individual line items in my budget or my investment allocation, because this is covered in so many other posts, but what I want to do is describe various aspect of my journey, filled with excitement, failure, and all sorts of unknown. I hope that I can help some people who are at various stages of their journey gain some tips and get reassurances that you can and will fail, but you can pick yourselves up and succeed. I've broken up the post into my background and four themes of Luck/Chance, Stumbles, Dedication, and Thrift to outline how each of these affected my path to FIRE.

# Background

35, renter living in near a HCOL US city, SINK, and don't plan to ever have any kids. I'm a 2nd generation immigrant raised in a middle to upper middle class lifestyle. I have not received any inheritances and did not have any trust funds, but I certainly grew up in a household with good parenting and financial stability. As of January 1st, 2019 my NW is $1.1M and I plan to live off a \~3% withdrawal rate - I'm a bit risk averse, so I want a lower rate in case costs go up, stock market goes down, etc. 

*Disclaimers: I have worked very hard, but 100% acknowledge that I've been very privileged with my upbringing and support I've had from friends and family in additional to many lucky circumstances I've had. In fact, in my first section, you'll see all of the ways that I my FI journey has been filled with chance/luck that helped me get to where I am today.*

# Luck

*Luck Definition - I know there was a recent thread that generated a lot of discussion about luck and I'd like to address what I mean by luck. To me, luck is any factor that is 100% out of your control including, but not limited to, genetics, socio/economic environment, or simply crazy things that happen in life. Yes, everyone will have various  lucky and unlucky things in life, but I think it is a disservice to assume that people are dealt an equal hand and their success is simply built upon their dedication and hard work.*

**Born in the USA -** Both my parents were independently able to escape the same war-torn, third world country and successfully immigrate to the US.  I can't do each of their stories justice in this post, but it's safe to say that either could have died or never it made over to the US. As an adult, I visited their home country and saw the staggering amount of poverty and it made me realize how different my life would have been if my parents didn't make it out and I was born there. My first stroke of luck in life was simply the fact of winning the birth lottery and being born in the USA.

**In my DNA -** My parents have always commented that I've been a saver ever since I was a kid. There is a great home video of me at 5 years old getting a $20 bill and I was super excited to put it into my piggy bank - saving just came naturally to me. Where many of my friends' families would go out to eat and go on yearly trips to Hawaii/Disneyland, I was also raised with a modest lifestyle with home-cooked dinners almost every night and our summer trips would be road/camping trips at nearby State/National parks.

**College Rejection -** I was rejected from all 3 of my ""reach"" schools - Harvey Mudd, MIT, and CalTech and ended up going to my safety school, a solid top 50 national public university an hour drive from home. At the time I was upset, but in retrospect getting rejected was probably one of the best things to ever happen to me. With part time jobs, lots of merit and need based financial aid, and the fact that the school tuition was only $5K/year (compared to $35K for MIT), I was able to graduate with no debt.

**Parents Divorcing -** This was very sad at the time, but ultimately what was best for my both parents and my siblings. An unexpected benefit of the divorce was that my college costs got reduced significantly. Through the divorce, my mom got a house which was fully paid off. Because of the illness that she had at the time, she wasn't working which meant no income outside of alimony/child support. The way FAFSA rules were written, my financial aid numbers ended up looking crazy bad (good) and I got a significant amount of need based financial aid even though she was relatively secure. I obviously wouldn't want anyone's family to get divorced, or so sick that they couldn't work, but it was a stroke of chance that all those things coalesced which resulted in me getting huge amounts of need based financial aid on top of my merit based financial aid. 

**Falling into my Job -** I've been at my current (and only post-college) job for 11+ years and I was literally within an hour to not even applying. I had applied to a number of places but didn't apply to this company because I literally didn't want to write a cover letter. My friend who wanted me to apply, asked me in the computer lab 45 minutes before the application was due to apply because he really thought I would be a good fit for the role, so I wrote the cover letter in 15 minutes, submitted the application and after a series of interviews, I ended up getting the job! It's crazy to think that without my friend or being 45 minutes later, I could have had a MUCH different outcome.

Also I was tremendously lucky on where I ended up taking my job. I had grown up and went to school in the same area, so I really wanted to move somewhere else for a change of pace. After receiving my offer, I asked to be staffed in ""a large coastal city"" which had work in the resources/energy industries and they ended up offering me the current city that I live in. I didn't know what I wanted at the time, but looking back, I feel very fortunate that the recruiter picked the city I'm now living in. It really happened to match what I value also is a HCOL city that I could get a high base pay and have a high savings rate.

# Stumbles

**""The Talk"" -** After some generic training I go to work with a client  in an area I really had zero experience. For fresh collge graduates, work at my company is pretty much all ""trial by fire"". After a few weeks of work, my supervisors pulled me aside and had a private conversation that can be summarized with ""hungn3, we brought you onto this role because we thought that you can do the work, but so far you haven't demonstrated that you are able to do it"".

SHIT. I already felt like I had imposter syndrome, but now they validated that I wasn't doing a good job. This was the first time in my life that I was not successful in something that I did and it was a rough hit to my ego. But I buckled up, worked extra hard, was very meticulous with my work, asked for help from my peers/supervisors, and eventually made it through that project successfully. I wasn't going to get ranked at the top of my peer group that first year or two, but I kept my job through the Great Recession in 2008/2009 when people were getting fired left and right.

**Betting Against the Market -** I was convinced the world was going to end in 2008/2009 after reading all sorts of doom/gloom blogs and kept on reading more stuff to confirm my position. I ""invested"" $25K in an ETF with a ticker of SDS. For those unfamiliar, SDS is a ETF that is a derivative and attempts to track *2X the INVERSE of the S&amp;P500*.  I bought it in 2009 in the $80-$115 range and didn't sell it off until 2012 when it was around $12. I felt stupid, especially since I had literally read ""The Bogleheads Guide to Investing"" less than a year earlier. I thought I was smarter than everyone else and could beat what was shown to be statistically/empirically better.

**Fear of investing -** After losing money by making terrible investment decisions, I basically went into turtle mode and decided not to invest in anything outside of my 401K and my discounted company stock purchases for over 3 years. I ended up with over $200K in cash sitting in a savings account making less than 0.5% before I finally pulled the trigger to put it back into the stock market. I missed out on tons of growth opportunity because I was scarred from making terrible individual stock choices.

# Dedication

**The Corporate Ladder Grind -** I've only worked at one company in the 11 years since graduating and work in the IT industry but am not a software developer. I didn't have a typical 9-5 job and often put in nights and weekends during critical phases of the project sacrificing a lot of the ""life"" in the work/life balance equation. At one point on a large project, I was on a call with India at 7AM-8AM, worked at the office from 8AM-10PM, got on call with India from 11PM-midnight and then went directly to bed. This was repeated every day over multiple weeks and wore me down. Since then, I've found that I've been able to enforce boundaries better and ensure that I have a better work-life balance, but my job is still a lot of work and stress. Within 9 years, got 3 major promotions, saw my salary increase from $66K to $182K, and I went from someone who struggled to provide quality deliverables to a person who people seek out for their specific industry/software expertise.

**The Travel Grind -** In my job, I'm required to travel 100% of the time and I have travelled for work for over 10 years, which means flying out and being at the client site from Monday through Thursday. Several sacrifices include not seeing friends/family as often, missing midweek events, and also spending so much of my life on a plane/airport/hotel. The George Clooney movie ""Up in the Air"" really resonated with me and I knew that I couldn't do this life forever and needed to downshift at some point before burning out and turning into Ryan Bingham

I'm both a data and airplane nerd, so I've tracked every flight in my life which you can see at this link: [https://openflights.org/user/hungn3](https://openflights.org/user/hungn3)

# Thrift

**Intentional ""Homelessness"" -** I got an offer to work on a project in NYC for a year.  For most people, that would mean flying coast to coast twice a week. Instead of paying rent despite being so home so seldomly, I instantly decided that instead of paying for more expensive hotels and flying back/forth every week, I would save my company money and myself a ton of money by living in a paid corporate apartment in Midtown Manhattan.  I got to explore NYC for an entire year, trying new food, meeting new people, and seeing new things. After that project, I ended up continuing my ""homeless"" lifestyle by doing one of the following:

1. Staying at the hotel at my client site  and exploring the city where I was working
2. Flying to my home base city and crashing with friends on couches.  I'd compensate them by taking them out to nice dinners and/or cash for staying a few nights before flying back to work.
3. Taking ""flex trips"" to other locations around the US and the world (see below for more details)

I stayed ""homeless"" for about 5 1/2 years, so I got to save a hefty amount by not paying a much rent during that time.

*Note - I use the word ""homeless"" in jest, and do not want to imply that I was anywhere remotely close to experiencing what real homeless people or those living with housing insecurity do.*

**Flex Trips -** One of the biggest perks of my job was that I was able to take flex trips to other destinations as long as the cost of the trip was less than or equal to flying home with any excess paid out of my pocket.  I'd have a ""Go-Bag"" packed under my desk at my client site that I could grab if I wanted to go do a weekend trip. I'd take buses, trains, or even plans to explore places for a weekend. One of my crazier trips was to take a long weekend trip to Belgium and being right back at work on Monday morning. I haven't taken advantage of this much in recent years because I want to re-focus on family/friends, but earlier in my career, I took full use of this perk by traveling all over the US and the world with heavily subsidized flights.

**Miles and Hotel Points -** With all the travel for work, I've accumulated a very nice stash of both airline and hotel points. Where many of my colleagues would use points on business class flights, I couldn't justify that when I could get 2X the number of flights flying economy.  When I did book flights with points, I was able to find great flight plans to maximize my points. One example of ""hacking"" a United Airlines award ticket by using open jaw flights, a stopover, a layover, and careful planning. I got the following flight itinerary all for 80K points + $150 in taxes which on paper is worth about $1000, but I got way more than $1000 value out of it:

* SEA&gt;FRA 23 hour layover to visit friends in Germany
* FRA&gt;IST 10 day stopover to visit Turkey
* IST&gt;NBO 31 day trip across 7 African countries
* JNB&gt;SFO Flight back to the US

**Per Diems** \- As a perk for being on the road, I get a post-tax per diem and can pocket anything I don't use. I would maximize my savings by eating breakfast at the hotel and doing things like meal prep and/or eating frugally while travelling on the road. My per diem varied between $32-$52 per day depending on my travel location. The approximate benefit ends up being \~$8000/year in post-tax dollars or $13,000 in pre-tax dollars.  I absolutely would have spent less on food if I didn't travel, but for people who eat simple food and can figure out other frugal food options, you can pocket a bunch of the per diems.

**No Car and Modest Housing -** To get around, I walk, bike, use mass transit (trains, busses), and will do Lyft/Uber for anything else which the other options don't easily allow. I also will occasionally get a rental car for a long weekend to do a road trip, but that is infrequent.  As for my housing, I live in an older (1970's) 2BR apartment that I share with someone.  Would I love a nice new layout with new hardwood floors, in unit laundry, and updated countertops? 100%! But with what I'm paying, I've determined that getting all those extra items fall into the ""luxury"" category and my space is very functional and large enough to host many friends over for various get-togethers and the location of my place is very walkable to most of the things I need. I was recently at home with my mom and watching shows like Property Brothers and House Hunters, and I couldn't help but laugh at what people deem as ""mandatory features"" for their home.

One thing that I'd like to comment that people often get wrong about HCOL cities is focusing so heavily on the cost of housing.  Of course you want to minimize costs where possible, but it should be to reach a global minimum, not a local minimum.  The point I'd like to make is that you really need to factor in **the total cost of transportation and housing** when deciding where to live, especially since most HCOL areas have relatively good mass transit options. If you can pay an extra $300/month for a better located apartment/house, it might cost you less when you factor in your time, the costs of owning cars, paying for transit etc.

Also, it is possible to have access to most of the benefits of a HCOL city, without actually living directly in that city.  In my case I'm about a 30 minute train ride into the city and will often go to meet up with friends, get dinner, etc., but pay significantly less rent than those who live in the city.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Life is complicated and there is no ""one"" path to success, nor are any of the paths clear.  I had a lot of luck, stumbled along the way, dedicated a lot of my time towards achieving FI via my career, and found many ways to save money.

***Update #1:***

People wanted some numbers for salary/networth/budget so here they are.  I still suggest you read the body of the post as that has a lot of good info :-).

\* May be inaccurate due to general unreliability [Mint.com](https://Mint.com).

Net Worth only includes base salary but does not include bonuses, 401K match, ESPP discount, per diems, or any other bonus/perk I may have received.  I didn't track my savings rate, so I don't have a breakdown of amount saved vs. investment gains.

# Spending

People seemed interested on my spending and how I could keep it to \~$33K. Below is my actual 2018 spending along with my FIRE budget.  I had to go to the ER in 2018 and get a few CT scans, so I had a surprise $2000 bill.  I would say this isn't typical, but I treat it more as a random one time expense. 2018 total costs roughly reflect the average spending each year

|Year|Rent + Utilities|Fun|Food|Travel|Clothes|Health|Transportation|Gifts|Other|Total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2018 Actual|7858|3880|5786|1832|1390|3744|703|809|5330|31332|
|FIRE Budget|9000|4200|6000|4800|600|1850|1800|600|4800|33650|

Note: Healthcare will be kept low with ACA subsidies by planning of capital gains/losses and I have low transportation costs because I don't own a car and I ride my bike/use mass transit.

***Update #2:***

Wanted to address a few common questions that came up in a single update instead of commenting in each post.

**Are you really FI?** \- Yes. Based on my spending rate today (see above) I generate enough with a 3.0% WR and I actually think I'm being a bit conservative given various CFIRE and other simulation tools.  Some people may consider it leanFIRE simply based on my spending rate - I see the definition of &lt;$40K on the leanFIRE subreddit, but this is probably for a family, and I'm spending $33K as a single person. **I feel like I've got a pretty damned good life with my current level of spending.**  Maybe you can't enjoy life with that much, but I certainly can!

**Will you retire early? -**  I currently plan to take some time off my job (either LOA or quitting) and see where things go.  I feel pretty comfortable to RE on my current savings.  However, it doesn't mean this is my final decision - that's the beauty of FI, you have the freedom to change your mind pretty easily!  My future could include more work, such as going back at the same compan/type of company with more conditions/constraints (part time/less travel), doing short term independent consulting work, finding other work I might enjoy more, or continuing the RE path.

**Free time?** \- I plan to just do a lot of relaxing, hanging out with friends more, dating, rock climbing, cooking more, and catching up on my video game/board game/movie/tv/book backlogs. I'll be looking to also volunteer for a variety of 2019 and 2020 elections.",finance
personalfinance,"In the 12% Fed bracket, is a traditional 403(b) even worth it?","I already max out my Roth IRA, but I have more money to invest. I am debating using a brokerage account versus the traditional 403(b) offered through my work. There is no employer contribution, and there is no Roth 403(b) available. I am currently in the 18% income tax (federal+state) bracket. In 35 years I expect (assuming tax law doesn't change) that I will be in the 9% state bracket, the 15% capital gains bracket, and 22% or 24% federal bracket.

If I earn $1 and invest it into a brokerage account, I first have to pay $0.18 in taxes so I only have $0.82 to invest. A 7% return for 35 years would leave me with $8.75, of which $7.93 is gains. I would have to pay $1.90 in taxes on the gains, so I would end with $6.85.

If I earn $1 and invest it into a 403b account, I don't have to pay income tax (right now). It grows at 7% for 35 years and I end up with $10.68. Then I have to pay income tax on that entire $10.68, so I'll have to pay at least $3.31 in taxes and end up with at most $7.37.

$7.37 is more than $6.85, but I have to ""lock up"" my money in a retirement account to get that extra $0.52. I don't think that the extra returns are worth the loss of liquidity. Am I missing anything?",finance

personalfinance,"I owe $2,200 on my car loan(14% interest rate), the car is valued at $12,500 - which credit card would be the best to pay off the lien, obtain the title, and sell the car? - bonus question: should I do this?","I made a semi-stupid mistake and bought a car for $18,000 in summer 2017. I paid $10,000 upfront (which was basically all my money) and I’ve been paying as large of payments as I could since then since the interest rate is so high. 

Fast forward and now I have a fiancée and 5 month old, the car has all these unnecessary bells and whistles...I’d rather sell it for the $12k and buy a decent used car for $5 or $6k and pocket the remaining funds for a decent savings nest egg. The car is reliable, but could I not find a pretty reliable car in the 5-6k range ?

I can’t sell the car until I obtain the title, but I don’t have the money to pay it off right now.

Is there a certain credit card I could use to pay off the lien in full? My score is in the upper 600s at the moment. 


I keep debating whether it would be worth it in my head and it’s driving me crazy.


We are hurting for money, but I’d be sacrificing a reliable car for something maybe a bit less reliable.  I’ve also never sold a car private party and I feel like it would be difficult to do, but a dealership would most likely rip me off..

personalfinance,Should I add more allowances to force a tax payment instead of a refund?,"2017 Tax Year I received a refund of about $6,000. It was my first full year owning a home and at the time I wasn't very knowledgable about all the deductions I was eligible for.

2018: I added a couple allowances to take account for the deductions and my refund should be about $1500.

Going into 2019, I am considering raising my allowances more so instead of receiving a refund, I owe up to $1,500 (or more?). The way I think about it now is, a tax refund is basically a savings account at a 0% interest rate. It would make more sense to have it in my saving account that currently yields 2.10% and then when I need to file my taxes in April 2020, I just transfer what I need from my savings account to my checking and pay the tax bill.

Am I missing anything here? Any IRS red flags? Obviously this only works if money is saved and not spent on something else.

personalfinance,Throw $ toward student loans or save for wedding?,"Just hoping for some quick financial advice dealing with student loans/saving for a wedding.

My mom, dad and I each pay $200/month for $600 total on student loans. I have two loans left totaling just over $29,000. Both loans do not have an interest rate, so the good news is that the loan amount won’t ever increase.

At the current rate, we’re looking at 4 years of payments before they’re paid off. I’m not going to ask my divorced parents to contribute more, but I’d like advice on whether or not I should increase my own amount.

I’m currently engaged and have 3 monthly payments left of $520 to pay off the engagement ring. 

Once that ~$500/month becomes available in April, should I throw it toward the loans, or put it in the wedding fund? It looks as if my fiancée and I will have to cover most of the cost for our wedding.

personalfinance,"Just graduated, 60k salary, 75k student loans","I finished my masters degree in the fall and started a new job in December. This is the first time I've had a real salary instead of being a poor student, and I'm looking for advice on how best to use money and tackle my student loans. 

I make 60k, but live in a pretty low COL area. My rent is $700/month, plus maybe $150 in utilities and $100 in gas. I don't have any other debt, but am considering getting married and buying a house within the next year or two. I have 23k saved in a money market account, and put 6% of my paycheck into a matched 401k. My monthly gross income is $3,166.

I've been making some interest payments on the loans while I was in school, but rather sporadically. Since graduating, I paid off a $3000 loan with a 7.5% interest rate, as well as the minimums on everything else. Here's what's left. 

$2,900 at 6.8%

$44,800 at 6%

$11,000 at 4.6%

$7,700 at 4.3%

$6,400 at 3.76%

$2,600 at 3.4%


The 6% and up loans are on a 15 year repayment schedule, and the lower ones are 10 year. 

I'm prioritizing paying off the 6.8% loan ASAP, but what then? I'm less concerned about the loans under 5%, but that $44,800 loan seems like it'll take forever to pay off, and the overall minimum monthly payment $814 is a bit much. I feel that I'm pouring my money into interest payments without making real progress. Not sure that refinancing is a good choice since most of the loans are below 5%, and my credit score is just OK. 

I'm also considering the complexities of combining finances with my fiance. He just graduated and is looking for a job, so many decisions will depend on his future salary. But he has no student loan debt and wants to buy a house when our lease is up. Not sure if I should also sign the mortgage (provided we're married by then), or just contribute some rent towards living expenses and aggressively focus on my loans.

personalfinance,How much house can I afford?,"Would really appreciate any insight. We have been looking at some real estate options and our tastes tend to be around the $900k - $1.2million. Real estate market around Northern NJ closer to NYC is pretty high. Trying to see if this is feasible or a complete stretch of the imagination. If this is not feasible, I'd like to better understand around what price range I should be looking for. 

My understanding from browsing similar threads is that you shouldn't spend more than 3x your total annual income which is around $765,000. I used Trulia's Affordability Calculator and my $900k-1.2mill is aggressive but possible, just not practical. I realize this is a pretty big range but I am trying to figure out how much is way too much.

* Our combined salary is about $255,000 with about $35k (around 4%-5% interest rate) left in school loans to be paid off by end of this year.
* We have about $80k liquid (I have offered to pay off her school loans but she wants to pay it off by herself).
* We have about $270k tied up in stocks (the $270k potentially go up or down much higher because the stock market fell through the roof this past month). I would ideally not like to touch this money but am totally willing to sell off all the stocks to get the house that we want. Most of it would be LTCGs. I don't believe there are tax planning benefits from converting stock to real property in a like-kind exchange.
* Currently situation: Renting an apartment at about $2,800 with two parking spots. All related bills like utilities, TV, etc is about $200 a month.
* Monthly car payments of $300 for the next 3 years and then will be buying a more reliable SUV roughly around the same price per month.
* Other expenses are pretty typical like car insurance, eating out sometimes, groceries, and movies very occasionally.
* We are putting a priority on traveling right now as there are no kids at the moment. Two big trips a year spending about $3k per trip with airfare, accommodations, sightseeing, etc. These trips will likely come to a screeching halt once kids happen.

personalfinance,Did I commit fraud on my IBR application?,"I’m a medical resident that graduated med school in April. I worked a temporary full time job between April and June and make approx $6-7k over that time. I consolidated my federal loans and my plan was to apply for IBR before residency began. 

Essentially what happened is I did not end up applying for IBR until July because the consolidation process ended up taking a long time. This was after beginning my new job but before getting my first paycheck. I got a start up bonus of $800 though. 

My concern is that I when applying for IBR I said that my income had not changed substantially since the previous tax year where I had no income, despite making $6-7k during the temp job and technically having started residency at time of application. My financial aid director at school said the money made with the summer job wouldn’t be enough to make a difference and that I should say my income hadn’t changed substantially, but I’m worried that since I applied after July 1 and the start of residency I effectively lied on the application regarding income change. Again, I had not received a residency paycheck yet.

Not sure why I didn’t think about it at the time, probably because I had always heard to always just go off last year’s tax report...but I feel like I screwed up. 

Did I commit fraud and am I at risk for audit/penalty going forward by the Dept. of Ed?

personalfinance,Pay off Student Loans faster or invest it?,"So I have about $28k in student loans, my grace period has just ended and I have to pay my first bill at the end of the month ($288) for ten years. My avg interest rate is about 4.25%, but I was thinking about consolidating my loans to 4.375%, and with autopay I get a .25% discount. So once consolidated my interest rate would be about 4.125% and a term of 20 years.

Would it be better to just pay the minimum ($175) for 20 years and then invest the rest? I'm assuming that I would be able to beat 4.125% in the market over 20 years.

Does this make sense to do? I know the interest on the loan will be more because the principal is way higher, but would it offset if I just kept investing the extra ~$150 or more per month into an index fund?

personalfinance,"$85K/year - should I buy a home, condo, or rent?","Currently live in Massachusetts which has a 5.7% income tax, on top of my 24% federal = 29.7%.Current rent is $1800/month with no utilities, basically a steal after searching for like 2-3 months (through a complex).

&amp;#x200B;

**Problem 1:** The prices for homes in the area is OUTRAGEOUS. If I want to buy a home that has semi-decent curb appeal, it's going to be at LEAST $400K+. Is this okay?

*Edit:* Not even joking a burnt down house in this area is $200K.

&amp;#x200B;

**Problem 2:** Credit is kinda bad, really don't have any. I can pay a large chunk up front to offset this, but that's a huge gamble I feel.

&amp;#x200B;

I've considered a condo mainly because they are slightly cheaper and I think I would enjoy the lifestyle more. I've owned a home before (unfortunate circumstances) and I feel that between the stress of things needing maintenance (staining decks, repairing roofs, landscaping) is a bit much for me as a young-er professional. HOA fees are generally like $300 around the area which isn't bad, but from my understanding I still need to pay taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bottom line:** I want to stop ""throwing away"" $21,600/year towards rent, on top of the $25,245 in income taxes. Figured I would want to build equity, to save the $21.6K - but I'm lazy and don't want to spend time with a home. What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit 2:** I'm looking to settle down, don't plan on leaving the area/job.

&amp;#x200B;

**Calculations:**

Correct me if I'm wrong. So right now I'm going to compare as of right now, the cost of yearly rent vs the average price of a home's yearly cost (all paid off).

**Rent: $21,600**

**Home:** 500K \* .01 = $5,000/year in maintenance costs + $16.5 per K home value \* 500 = (real estate tax) $8,250 **Total: $13,250**

&amp;#x200B;

Okay now we subtract the costs. $21,600 - $13,250 = $8,350/year in saving owning a home.

Now let's see how long until the house pays for itself: 500,000/8,350 = **59.8 years**.

Is the IRS not processing estimated tax payments during the federal shutdown? I assume I am okay since it was postmarked long before the Jan 15th deadline.

personalfinance,"Moved out, haven't changed address yet. Also want to change my car. Funky situation, need some advice","Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 21 year old guy, and moved out of my parents house and signed a 12 month lease for my own apartment about 3 months ago (end of September). My parents live in DE and I moved just barely over the line to MD. I make 66k/year at a steady job, so bear that in mind when reading this.

However, I have not changed my address yet due to some interesting situations, some of which are changing now. Allow me to explain:

&amp;#x200B;

First, I kept my address at my parents' because I stayed on my parents' insurance. I did so because I am currently driving a 2008 Mustang GT Convertible, and it was MUCH cheaper at the time for my family and me to stay on their policy.

 However, my brother recently got off the insurance policy, which cause rates to go up dramatically. As far as I understand, this is due to Delaware's interesting insurance laws, which distribute drivers among cars, even if you specify who is the primary driver for each car. We had 5 people on the policy with my brother and his wife, but 3 without, causing the raise in rates when they left (everyone has a clean record BTW). I'm talking a raise in rates for me from $350 every 6 months (magic, I know) to almost $900 every 6 months. Now that rates have raised, it's practically equivalent (\~$30 every 6 months) to get my own policy, which would require me to change my address. This is in no small part due to my Mustang (2008 - unsafe, 2 door, convertible, V8, and I'm 21 and male).

&amp;#x200B;

The second reason I kept my address was because I bought the Mustang this past May (due to my other car dying...that was a fun situation), and I registered it at my parents house. I did that because I wasn't sure if I would move out or not, nor when. NOTE: the car was used, bought for $18k (including all fees) @ 24k miles. I put down $7k, so the loan was 11k. I have about $9K remaining on the loan, and I put a lot more miles on the car than I expected (approx 12k since May, expected to end around 15k miles or more by May). The interest rate is low and the minimum monthly payment is about $215, which is what I have kept it at, given the uncertainty of costs of getting married. The way the loan was set up made it so that I would pay the same amount of interest on the loan in total whether I paid minimum or increased it, so to keep things safe I paid the minimum.

&amp;#x200B;

The third reason I kept my address was because I'm getting married this coming May. My fiance does not live with me, but she will move in with me and we will likely live in my apartment until the lease runs out, and then either rent and save for another year or immediately buy a small house or townhouse. Not exactly sure what will become of that, but I know we will move out of my current apartment, so I suppose I will have to change my address either way once we move. 

Regardless, I live in MD, and my fiance does not want to live in MD after the lease is up. Whether that will need to happen or not, we'll see, but I understand her logic - I work in DE and will for the forseeable future (work at a utility), why live in MD and pay MD and DE taxes instead of just DE?

&amp;#x200B;

Despite all this, I am still inclined to change my address. Reason #1 for this is my brother leaving the policy and raising rates. It would be nice to be one step further away from my parents, and I also feel like I could get my rates down with a different car. Additionally, reason #2 is I don't really like the Mustang. I liked it during the summer when I could have the top down, and I definitely will purchase another in the future when I can have two cars, but I really don't enjoy it as a daily driver.

&amp;#x200B;

What I would get instead is a used Volkswagen Golf GTI or a similar hot hatch or sedan. I did some initial searching today, and ones in the price range I'm comfortable with are about $20k. This was the type of car I had that died (big engine issues)...I regret not paying the $7k I put down on the Mustang to fix the GTI, but what's done is done. Thie $20k model is would be a 2016+ model, though I would be comfortable getting the same generation I had (2011-2014). The cars from that generation that I'm comfortable with go for around $15k. 

&amp;#x200B;

Given all this info, I have a few questions.

&amp;#x200B;

1. What are the costs of changing your address? I know you change your license ($50), passport ($110, I believe - and I think I would need this for the honeymoon in May), and the address itself is free, afaik. What am I missing on this? Anything besides just changing address I should be aware of when doing so?

&amp;#x200B;

2. What would you do in my situation: change address now, save on insurance, and avoid hassles of trying to get rid of the Mustang in the future? 

Or should I wait and do it once I'm married to avoid the extra costs of changing address? (plus the added benefit of already having my car insurance ready to go once my fiance joins me, making the transition to married life that much smoother)

personalfinance,"Next steps for 31-year-old (student loan + mortgage debt, $600 0% APR loan) - advice please!","I am a 31-year-old living in a suburb outside of a city in the Pacific Northwest. I would love for people with more knowledge and years of experience to chime in with thoughts on what my next financial steps should be given my goals and trajectory. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my stats:

**Base salary with full-time job**: $55k this year, going up to \~$60k next year and will subsequently increase each year thereafter by approximately $2-5k/year until it caps out around $90-100k within the next 20 years (likely to increase due to inflation) 

I do have side hustles that bring in some income, but the amount of income is inconsistent. Next month, for example, it will be $1300, and I am starting a new side business that may eventually net $500-700/month after business-related expenses. I don't, however, typically count my side hustles as part of my regular salaried income due to the inconsistency and the fact that I don't want to rely on them since I already work full time.   


**Savings** (in high-yield savings account of around \~1.58% APR): $9400  


**Retirement accounts:** approximately $20k total ($4k of which is in Roth IRA and very small 403(b) -- plan is definitely to max out Roth IRA for 2018 as well as to continue to max them out every year thereafter)   
\*\*Note: if I stay in my government job, I can retire with a pension that pays 40% of my highest-paying salary annually, which I do plan to do at this point in time. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Debts:**

**Mortgage:** I bought a $195,000 2br/2ba condo with a 4.625% interest rate. My mortgage is currently $1230/mo., and my monthly salary with just my full-time job is approximately $3k/mo. after taxes and retirement funding this year. HOA fees are just under $300. Yes, technically, I'm currently cash poor when side hustles are not counted. I do not have a roommate, but getting a roommate or renting out the spare room on Airbnb is a definite possibility if I decide I need to go that route. 

**Affirm loan at 0% interest**: $600 

**Student loan (federal):** $46,000 -- I'm planning on continuing to make income-based repayments to do Public Service Loan Forgiveness, and I'm on track and carefully monitoring to make sure my payments count. **However--and here's where my inherent question is--**a part of me wants to go full Dave Ramsey and knock these student loans out altogether before they are (supposedly) forgiven in about 9 years. But I wonder, if I go that route, will I miss out on money I COULD be making investing when my current student loan payment is about $250/mo and I am on track to have it forgiven with PSLF (currently making qualifying payments)?

**No consumer credit or car loan, but my car does have 175k miles on it, and I'm likely to need to purchase a new one within a year or two.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't included all of my expenses because I'm not really looking for budgeting advice, although if you think there is crucial information missing, just let me know. Any advice on how best to approach my situation so that I ultimately end up making the best financial decisions possible for my future would be greatly appreciated! Thanks for your input!

worldpolitics,No More Banana Phones: How the Smartphone Revolution is Changing the Fight Against Global Poverty,"Spend any time in the slums of Nairobi, or rural Bangladesh and it is hard not to be struck by the proliferation of mobile phones. Many of the poorest households, often without access to electricity or running water, will own a cell phone. Many of the poorest countries in the world are in the midst of a telecommunications revolution that is putting some of the most advanced technology into the hands of the poorest people in the world. Today's podcast episode will cover the cheap smartphone manufacturers that are making smartphones to more and more people in Africa, the growth of mobile telephony in Somalia despite the country's lawlessness and anarchy, and how the rise of the M-Pesa mobile money platform is transforming the lives of ordinary Kenyans.

Most of the listeners of this podcast, especially those living in wealthy nations, have never heard of Transsion, a China based smartphone maker. However, Transsion phones are ubiquitous in sub-Saharan Africa where Transsion had a [market share](https://qz.com/africa/1374404/chinas-transsion-dominates-africas-phone-market-with-tecno-itel/) of around 30%. Transsion has succeeded in Africa in part through offering smartphones are rock bottom prices. The cheapest models can cost as little as $80. Transsion can offer such cheap phones in part because of their willingness to accept low profit margins. Apple earns a profit of $184 per phone, Samsung earns $23 per phone, while Transsion earns less than $2. However, Transsion has also succeeded in creating phones well suited to meet the needs of the African environment. Transsion smartphones have long battery lives and can withstand the rugged environment like the feature phones that Transsion directly competes against. Transsion camera phones are calibrated to darker African skins. Moreover, Transsion is increasingly an African company. The overwhelming majority of Transsion's [employees ](https://pandaily.com/transsion-king-mobile-phone-africa-makes-fortune-low-profile/)are in Africa with R&amp;D facilities in Kenya and Nigeria, and a phone assembly plant in Nigeria.

Mobile phones are of little value without reliable and affordable service. Few places seem less hospitable for modern telephony than Somalia. The country has had no functioning central government since 1992, and is consumed by civil war and famine. However, Somalia has a thriving mobile phone industry, with data prices and phone quality much higher than in some neighboring countries. A recent World Bank study found that Somalia has the [cheapest mobile phone rates](https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/business/For-the-cheapest-mobile-call-in-Africa--go-to-Somalia/2560-3073770-deqjlm/index.html) in Africa, and the same bundle of cell phone services that costs $2.53 in Somalia costs $6.16 in Nigeria and $14.75 in Burkina Faso. The collapse of Somalia's central government also meant the collapse of national telecommunications monopoly, allowing competition to thrive in mobile telephony. A cell phone tower [costs only $100,000](https://books.google.com/books?id=he_bAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT105&amp;lpg=PT105&amp;dq=%22$100000%22+cell+phone+tower+somalia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2oS7F8Mbzx&amp;sig=Zq2FAvrCCFfRRK3WCo26CTCIYBc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiSgcPe4NXfAhUEUt8KHaddDx8Q6AEwBXoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%24100000%22%20cell%20phone%20tower%20somalia&amp;f=false) and requires little technical expertise to operate. Fierce competition has emerged between telecom companies, and the major telecommunications are highly profitable companies that[ dominate](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-somalia-hormuud/somalias-hormuud-rings-up-telecom-profits-despite-anarchy-idUKBRE9AC0WQ20131113) the Somali economy. Mobile telephony thrives in Somalia because it does not rely upon capable governments or strong institutions. Landlines hardly extended outside of the capital before 1992 because landlines required high fixed investments in cables connecting every house. Many Somalis were not connected to the infrastructure network, or lived nomadic lives landlines and as a result landlines had little utility. No such cables are required for cell phones, and a unspoken agreement agreement has emerged between the mobile phone operators and militias that allow cell phone towers to operate unmolested so long as they pay taxes and fees to these militias.

The rapid growth of mobile phone penetration in Africa has allowed for the development of new business models, that are often superior to those found in more advanced nations. M-Pesa is a mobile money system similar to paypal or venmo although M-Pesa can be accessed via any phone with text capabilities. M-Pesa was launched in 2007. [Today](https://medium.com/chainrift-research/m-pesa-a-case-study-in-financial-inclusion-5b14cb7c612f), M-Pesa has 30 million users, and 96% of all households have at least one person using M-Pesa. Approximately $30 billion were transacted through M-Pesa, or about one fifth of all transactions in Kenya. To understand why M-Pesa is so popular, it must be understood that less than one fifth of all people had access to formal banking before M-Pesa. The average family live 9 km away from a bank branch, and fees and mininum balances made formal banking out of reach of most families. M-Pesa acts as a building block for greater financial services including [M-Shwari](https://www.cgap.org/blog/top-10-things-know-about-m-shwari), a full fledged bank that offers interest rates on deposits and loans to Kenyan consumers. Greater access to financial services has transformed the lives of many Kenyans. [For example](https://digitalcollections.sit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2254&amp;context=isp_collection), it has allowed fisherwomen along Lake Victoria to avoid having to carry and store large amounts of cash payments, and allowed them to entrust the selling of fish to agents rather than having to travel with the fist to market. M-Pesa has allowed an [estimated ](http://news.mit.edu/2016/mobile-money-kenyans-out-poverty-1208)194,000 households out of poverty, and allowed 186,000 women start their own businesses. Kenyans have adopted M-Pesa because of the lack of pre-existing financial infrastructure, and have turned this disadvantage into an advantage.

It is easy to think of technology as something that is developed in top secret department of defense labs and by Silicon Valley startups for the benefit of people in wealthy nations. However, Internet and Communications Technology often makes up a larger share of GDP for poorer nations than in wealthier ones. The need for ICT technologies is higher in the poorest countries, and many of these technologies can function reasonably well even in nations with poor institutional environments. Global telecommunications is making it increasingly possible for people in the developing world to take their economic futures into their own hands.

Some other questions I'd like help with:

\- **Should I convert that Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA?** As a software engineer I expect my income to be higher in the future, but I also expect that when I retire it'll be in a similar tax bracket I'll be in within a few years.

\-  Should I withhold more in taxes?

\- Should I consider myself a self-employed contractor and file my taxes as such? I'm sure I'll be a full employee by the time 2019-20 tax season comes around so this is really just for 2018 taxes.

\- Should I contribute more to the student loan than I am to the IRA/TD Ameritrade?

Most of the listeners of this podcast, especially those living in wealthy nations, have never heard of Transsion, a China based smartphone maker. However, Transsion phones are ubiquitous in sub-Saharan Africa where Transsion had a [market share](https://qz.com/africa/1374404/chinas-transsion-dominates-africas-phone-market-with-tecno-itel/) of around 30%. Transsion has succeeded in Africa in part through offering smartphones are rock bottom prices. The cheapest models can cost as little as $80. Transsion can offer such cheap phones in part because of their willingness to accept low profit margins. Apple earns a profit of $184 per phone, Samsung earns $23 per phone, while Transsion earns less than $2. However, Transsion has also succeeded in creating phones well suited to meet the needs of the African environment. Transsion smartphones have long battery lives and can withstand the rugged environment like the feature phones that Transsion directly competes against. Transsion camera phones are calibrated to darker African skins. Moreover, Transsion is increasingly an African company. The overwhelming majority of Transsion's [employees ](https://pandaily.com/transsion-king-mobile-phone-africa-makes-fortune-low-profile/)are in Africa with R&amp;D facilities in Kenya and Nigeria, and a phone assembly plant in Nigeria.

Mobile phones are of little value without reliable and affordable service. Few places seem less hospitable for modern telephony than Somalia. The country has had no functioning central government since 1992, and is consumed by civil war and famine. However, Somalia has a thriving mobile phone industry, with data prices and phone quality much higher than in some neighboring countries. A recent World Bank study found that Somalia has the [cheapest mobile phone rates](https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/business/For-the-cheapest-mobile-call-in-Africa--go-to-Somalia/2560-3073770-deqjlm/index.html) in Africa, and the same bundle of cell phone services that costs $2.53 in Somalia costs $6.16 in Nigeria and $14.75 in Burkina Faso. The collapse of Somalia's central government also meant the collapse of national telecommunications monopoly, allowing competition to thrive in mobile telephony. A cell phone tower [costs only $100,000](https://books.google.com/books?id=he_bAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT105&amp;lpg=PT105&amp;dq=%22$100000%22+cell+phone+tower+somalia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2oS7F8Mbzx&amp;sig=Zq2FAvrCCFfRRK3WCo26CTCIYBc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiSgcPe4NXfAhUEUt8KHaddDx8Q6AEwBXoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%24100000%22%20cell%20phone%20tower%20somalia&amp;f=false) and requires little technical expertise to operate. Fierce competition has emerged between telecom companies, and the major telecommunications are highly profitable companies that[ dominate](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-somalia-hormuud/somalias-hormuud-rings-up-telecom-profits-despite-anarchy-idUKBRE9AC0WQ20131113) the Somali economy. Mobile telephony thrives in Somalia because it does not rely upon capable governments or strong institutions. Landlines hardly extended outside of the capital before 1992 because landlines required high fixed investments in cables connecting every house. Many Somalis were not connected to the infrastructure network, or lived nomadic lives landlines and as a result landlines had little utility. No such cables are required for cell phones, and a unspoken agreement agreement has emerged between the mobile phone operators and militias that allow cell phone towers to operate unmolested so long as they pay taxes and fees to these militias.

The rapid growth of mobile phone penetration in Africa has allowed for the development of new business models, that are often superior to those found in more advanced nations. M-Pesa is a mobile money system similar to paypal or venmo although M-Pesa can be accessed via any phone with text capabilities. M-Pesa was launched in 2007. [Today](https://medium.com/chainrift-research/m-pesa-a-case-study-in-financial-inclusion-5b14cb7c612f), M-Pesa has 30 million users, and 96% of all households have at least one person using M-Pesa. Approximately $30 billion were transacted through M-Pesa, or about one fifth of all transactions in Kenya. To understand why M-Pesa is so popular, it must be understood that less than one fifth of all people had access to formal banking before M-Pesa. The average family live 9 km away from a bank branch, and fees and mininum balances made formal banking out of reach of most families. M-Pesa acts as a building block for greater financial services including [M-Shwari](https://www.cgap.org/blog/top-10-things-know-about-m-shwari), a full fledged bank that offers interest rates on deposits and loans to Kenyan consumers. Greater access to financial services has transformed the lives of many Kenyans. [For example](https://digitalcollections.sit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2254&amp;context=isp_collection), it has allowed fisherwomen along Lake Victoria to avoid having to carry and store large amounts of cash payments, and allowed them to entrust the selling of fish to agents rather than having to travel with the fist to market. M-Pesa has allowed an [estimated ](http://news.mit.edu/2016/mobile-money-kenyans-out-poverty-1208)194,000 households out of poverty, and allowed 186,000 women start their own businesses. Kenyans have adopted M-Pesa because of the lack of pre-existing financial infrastructure, and have turned this disadvantage into an advantage.

It is easy to think of technology as something that is developed in top secret department of defense labs and by Silicon Valley startups for the benefit of people in wealthy nations. However, Internet and Communications Technology often makes up a larger share of GDP for poorer nations than in wealthier ones. The need for ICT technologies is higher in the poorest countries, and many of these technologies can function reasonably well even in nations with poor institutional environments. Global telecommunications is making it increasingly possible for people in the developing world to take their economic futures into their own hands.

personalfinance,"Pay down mortgage, hold cash, or sell stocks?","I recently bought a rental property. I got a 30 year fixed mortgage at 4.4%. At the time, I had enough assets to pay for the whole mortgage with liquid assets, but chose to only put 25% down.

However, my estimated rent was too high and I'm now operating at a net -$280/month loss each month after mortgage, HOA, taxes, insurance, and management fee. I could eliminate that loss by cashing out my no-penalty CD or selling stocks, and applying those proceeds to my mortgage payment to be even or cash flow positive. 

From what I've read though, the debate of whether to pay down my mortgage early depends on whether my money could do better than the 4.4% interest rate. I want to believe 8% YoY returns from the S&amp;P500 is still true, but the stock market is very volatile as of late. My original plan was to hold the cash until the market settled and then dollar cost average over a 3-6 month span.

I'm thinking about one of the following but having a hard time deciding:

1. Paying down my mortgage to be cash flow even and leave the rest in cash.
1. Keep the cash and sell my longterm stocks to pay down my mortgage. Then buy back into the market (longterm) on the dips.
1. Do nothing and stick to the plan since eventually my mortgage payment will decline over the years as I pay down the principle.

Would love anyone's advice as I crunch the numbers some more!",finance

I am currently with Commonwealth Bank but am looking to open a new additional account with Ubank, since interest rates with CommBank are so poor. I plan on opening the USaver account along with the Ultra transaction account so I can earn 2.87% interest, considering I meet the criteria. I want to transfer my current funds in my CommBank NetBank Saver account into the USaver account.  However, I'm unsure of how to transfer funds from bank to bank.

Also, does transferring funds between banks require you to pay a fee?

computers,"Thinking of switching to a Linux version, alongside a windows OS, but need help.","Hi, I've been starting to get fed up with some of the things that Windows has been doing lately, and have generally wanted to switch to one of the many Linux Distros, most likely Ubuntu, and was wondering if it would be a good choice for replacing Windows, with what I primarily do. I use my computer primarily for gaming, but also do video recording, editing, and just generally everything, but those are the main elements that I want to focus on. I was hoping that I could get some clarifications on if things like Steam could properly run games that show windows support only, would actually run on something like Ubuntu, and if Ubuntu would be a good distro for what I need it for.

I didn't know if this was the right place to actually post this, I looked for a bit on other subs, but thought that this would be a good one to get suggestions from. I already know how to set up dual boot, I've used Ubuntu before, and I was going to keep Windows on it, just in case I ever wanted to roll back to it instead.

personalfinance,"I have student loan forgiveness. Is it better to aggressively pay off the loans, or save for the tax payment that goes along with the forgiveness?","I currently owe about 91k in forgivable federal loans (Navient) with interest ranging from 3.1% to 6.8%. I’m on income-based repayment, which means the remaining balance is forgiven after 25 years. I currently pay about $260 minimums and have been paying for about three years now. 

I’m trying to set up a budget, and one key decision I’m trying to make is whether to try to pay those loans early, or to pay the minimum and put the extra money I would pay into an investment fund and grow interest for the big tax hit at the end. I believe the forgiven amount is taxed at 30%, but I could be wrong. I could also pay off the higher interest loans earlier and mitigate some of that hit. 

What do you think? Do I try to pay off the loans early, or let them be forgiven and save up instead?",finance

The organization lists itself as a ""Quasi-Independent State Agency"", the Finance Authority of Maine. They have a Governor-appointed CEO, and are using a private foundation to fund this program. They are not my employer, and I am not providing them anything in return, other than agreeing on residency in Maine for a few years, and the right to promote the program with my info etc. Because of that, I don't believe this would be considered ""compensation"" on a 1099 or W2.

personalfinance,Early Rollover of CD,"Hey guys,

Looking for some quick advice here. 

I put $5,000 (part of my emergency fund) in a 5-year CD at 2.1% in September, 2017; it's worth $5,140 today (early redemption value of $5,090). At this point, my savings account with Capital One is at 2.00%, and CDs are going for 2.7% (12-month) to 3.1% (60-month). 

I'm thinking about cashing in the 5-year CD, taking the $50 penalty (6 months' interest at 2.10%) and throwing it in a 12-month CD (or doing a two-rung CD ladder - 12-month at 2.7% and 24-month at 2.8%). My thought process is that even if the economy sputters and interest rates fall, I'll still be able to lock in a higher rate than 2.1%; until then, I can leverage shorter terms so I can take advantage of rising rates. 

At the end of the day, I know we're not talking about big money here - if I were to get 2.9% for 4 years, I'd come out $177 ahead, but at the same time, that's a couple of dinners!",finance

personalfinance,For those in need of a no interest &amp; no transfer fee credit card...,"Unfortunately I'm guessing some of you out there are carrying a balance on your credit card(s), and likely a high interest balance at that too!

If so, and you're having trouble paying it off, here's a list of (most of?) the current credit cards that allow a NO FEE balance transfer and NO INTEREST for a decent period of time.

This is a kick-the-can-down-the-road solution in you getting one of these cards though, and if you do I'd recommend a tight budget and getting it paid off soon.  To repeat another way, this isn't a solution, it's only a time buyer + interest reducer.

Ongoing rule for life though, is to always pay off your credit card in full before it's due, and never pay interest on a balance.  Also, god forbid, please don't think you should cash advance on one card and then balance transfer over to one of these so you can get zero interest for ___ months and invest the $ --- there's way too much risk to mess with that.

Here you go (courtesy of mymoneyblog.com, of which I have zero affiliation + am just a reader of):

personalfinance,"Fedloan Servicing screwed up, dropped my credit score almost 200 points, and now I can't get a loan","Obligatory Sorry for the long post.

I've wanted to get out of rental properties for a long time but I haven't had an opportunity to buy a home while in school. I graduated from college in May of 2017 but struggled to find work immediately so I put the thought of buying a home aside and worked a couple part time jobs making ends meet until I found full time work. I struggled for quite some time but I survived hoping things would change for the better. After a year of working at a number of restaurants as a server, bartender, and assistant manager, Fedloan Servicing called to explain that my loans would soon be due and asked how I would like to pay for them. This confused me because I was supposed to be covered by a special forbearance while the loan is paid for under a student loan repayment program. 

You see, I've been in the National Guard for over four years when they contacted me, I have an SLRP contract, and I contacted FedLoan Servicing when I joined the Army in 2014 to set up the forbearance so that I didn't have issues while I was away for basic training and eventually continuing my education. 

Well, come to find out, they updated my account when I finished training with the military and got back into college in the Midwest. This shouldn't be an issue I thought. I simply asked them to update my forbearance so I don't have to worry about it while they wait for the yearly SLRP payments. After the phone call, I didn't think I'd have any issues.

Fast forward 8 months, after 4 months of special training with the army, then finding a full time engineering job that I really enjoy, I start to look for houses. I have enough saved already to start getting serious. It doesn't take long to find a place I'd like to put in an offer. I find a mortgage lender and go through the process of applying for a loan. It took him less than an hour to get back to me with a question about my credit report. I supposedly had 6 delinquent accounts that dropped my score down below 600.

What I find out is, the employee I spoke with from Fedloan servicing in March made multiple errors. First and most crucial, I should have been placed on Mandatory Forbearance Part C which covers any National Guard soldier with a Student Loan Repayment Program contract. He placed a Military Forbearance on my account, one that soldiers only qualify for when deployed oversees. At the same time, he updated my address, but for some reason, not my email address. So a month later, after Fedloan servicing tried to confirm military status, the forbearance was canceled as I was not deployed, my account was billed, and I received an email to an old student email address that shouldn't have been on the account anymore. On top of that, although it is one account, I receive one bill, and one payment is made, it is technically multiple loans that total less than 20k in student loans, so they reported 6 separate loans in delinquency. 

At this point, I'm infuriated, but I stay calm and after calling Fedloan servicing and speaking with multiple people, someone explains the issue above in full. They state that the company should contact the credit unions and have delinquent status removed, but I have to request it and wait at least 30 days for them to investigate. And if they decide to contact the credit unions, my credit could still be stuck where it is for months.

Prior to this, I had perfect credit. I paid off 30k in private student loans, I only have 6 payments left on a car I bought brand new four years ago, my report even shows I've never been late on rent, bills, or any of my other minor loans I had taken out in college. I had a credit score of almost 700 when I bought my car so I can only assume it should be higher and a mortgage loan should be completely possible. But lenders just look at the score and push me out the door. They won't let me prove that this is an error on another company's part. Is there anything I can do to fix this issue faster or find a mortgage lender who would look at the evidence I have and assist me in getting a reasonable loan based on what my credit score should be?",finance
personalfinance,Advice on best use of Loan Refund? [x-post],"After completing Undergrad December 2017 I began making payments on my student loans (1-5 below). My current Employer offers 100% Tuition Reimbursement on continued education (A/B = 100%, C=75%), so I have enrolled in a Masters of Applied Analytics program (Online). To help offset the cost and not need to front the cash every semester, I went ahead and took out financial aid once more with an award of $15,500. Detailed below:

&amp;#x200B;

|Loan #|Issue Date|Loan Type|Status|Est. Balance|Interest Rate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|09/23/2010|Direct Unsub Stafford|Repayment|$6,500|6.8%|
|2|09/22/2011|Direct Unsub Stafford|Repayment|$3,200|6.8%|

|4|08/19/2013|Direct Unsub Stafford|Repayment|$6,850|3.86%|

|||Grad School Loan:||||
|6|01/04/2019|Direct Unsub Stafford|In School|$15,500|6.6%|

&amp;#x200B;

1 Semester costs roughly $5,000, so I have been issued a ""Refund"" of $10,500 from my latest loan and I am trying to figure out the best way to put that to use (As long as I keep my grades up, the $5,000 I will then get reimbursed from my Employer should be enough to fund most/all of my Masters program in the coming semesters).

&amp;#x200B;

Previously I was using the Snowball method under standard repayment and while I owed $350 total each month on my 1-5 loans, I was paying an extra $150 each month directly towards loan #2 (hence the lowest balance of my 6.8% loans). I would like to use roughly 20-30% of my loan refund towards an engagement ring in the coming year for my significant other, and keep another 20% back in case I have a semester where something comes up and grades don't meet my Employers Reimbursement policy (hopefully not, but life happens).

&amp;#x200B;

Under that plan, that leaves me with $5,000 roughly that I could immediately pay back into my loans but I wanted some advice on which one to put that towards?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Should I just pay off what remains of Loan #2 ($3,200)? And apply the rest to another loan?
2. Put it all towards my latest Loan #6 to reduce that principal back down?
3. Or put it towards, say, Loan #1 so another one of my 6.8% loans is close to being paid off?
4. Or is there a better idea I haven't thought of?

&amp;#x200B;

While I am now back in school and not required to pay on my loans, I still intend on fully paying at least $500/mo into my loans just like I was before. My Significant Other and I have started saving for House together and once I get around to popping the question we will likely move in together fairly soon after, thereby freeing up more of our income to repay our loans (currently living separate and paying all separate bills).

personalfinance,Understanding Loan Repayment Options,"Hi! This is going to be sort of a long post and detailed, so sorry in advance. Basic information: SO and I are both 21 years old. She's been accepted to Cornell Veterinary School, and I've been accepted to Yale Law School. We're both very excited, and also both very aware of the financial situation we'll be in post-grad. So I'm trying to get a handle on it now.

My law school loans: Using a calculator that adjusted for interest and all that jazz, my loans (I believe they'd be Federal Unsubsidized), would come out to $205,000 at the time of graduation. Yale has the best repayment program of any law school, called COAP. Here's a picture of what it looks like for both married people: https://imgur.com/a/4ZwHHuG

I'm assuming here that we both make about $75,000 annually. From what I understand about COAP, this would mean I pay about (75k + 75k - 40k - 20k (guesstimate about SO's annual loan payment)), I'd be making these payments: https://imgur.com/a/GbWdGau until they were forgiven at the end of ten years. It seems... doable.

Spouse's loans: Okay, so her loans are going to be a similar amount. She gets in-state tuition at Cornell, so she'll likely come out with around $215,000 in loans. I don't have a calculator for this so this is way more of a guesstimate. Now, it seems her best option is one of the income-based repayment programs -- either REPAYE, IBR, or PAYE. I don't fully have my head wrapped around all of them yet, but it seems like REPAYE is the best option for couples where both partners have loans. Please correct me if I'm wrong. Uh, so I'm having a bit of trouble using the https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/mobile/repayment/repaymentEstimator.action#view-repayment-plans calculator for some reason, so I can't really tell how much she'd be paying annually, but I'll assume it's a *reasonable* amount that we can both also live somewhere. REPAYE, I think, forgives her loans after 25 years.

Note that we're both from New York and would likely end up there, though we were both also interested in potentially moving to DC (lol great CoL areas I know). So I have a few questions.

1) How feasible is this whole situation? i.e. can we really take out this amount in loans and use our respective programs to pay it off and live?

2) What would it mean for the REPAYE program once my loans were forgiven after ten years? From what I've read, this program is better than IBR and PAYE when it comes to both people having debt, but I don't know what it would mean for her loans after mine were forgiven.

3) Would it better to stay unmarried and let her stay on IBR or PAYE?

If there are any other comments or things that you think could potentially help us, please feel free to let me know. This is obviously a massive decision, and one that I'm not taking lightly. But YLS and CVS provide a lot of opportunities that I'm not taking into consideration here because I don't want to put too much weight into intangible opportunities right now. Ideally though, we could both go to these schools and make the best of our situation.

Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,"32, drowning in debt, living with mom...I need help","I am a recent grad from the University of Arizona. After 2016, the year I graduated, I found it almost impossible to find a job in my given career field. I looked all over Arizona but to no avail. I decided the only thing that could possible help my situation was to move to the PNW and live with my mom between two major cities. More job opportunities there. I was wrong. I have been looking for more that 2 years now and I have little leads and little money.

I ended up finding a steady job at a local grocery store but the money isn't great. Obviously it is minimum wage! I only make $13.25/hour. 

I have ~$120,000 in total of student loan debt. I have about 10 federal loans and three private loans. The 10 federal loans are manageable because of income based repayment plans...but my private loans are destroying me. 

My minimum payment on my private student loans now totals $850 per month. I cannot afford this as it is more than one of my paychecks!  I have been looking to refinance my loans through a third party company but they will only consolidate up to $40,000! Is that normal?

Is there anything that I can do to lower my payments without defaulting and destroying my credit? I feel like I'm not making any headway into the future with the past debt sucking me backwards with every payment.

personalfinance,(UK) What is the most effective way I could invest or save with only £100?,"I am a student in final year at university. I work weekends for around £100 a week.

Should I simply put it in my savings account (Summit @ Dankse Bank) which has a low interest rate of 0.250%, so storing small amounts of money wouldn't exactly mount a big return, even in the long run, BUT it renders that money untouchable unless I really need it.

personalfinance,My Fiancee got offered a high paying private sector job. She has lots of student debt and was taking advantage of PSLF. Please help me with the financial cost benefit analysis.,"My fiancee is an attorney who is currently working at a PSLF legal services non-profit. She has about $200,000 in government loans at a the graduate student interest rate. She's making around $60,000 a year.

She was just offered a job at a private law firm making closer to $120,000 a year. 

Prior to this offer, she planned on working in PSLF eligible jobs for 10 years so that her loans would be forgiven. We are trying to figure out if it makes financial sense for her to switch jobs, make the minimum payments she would make under IBR/PAYE, have the loans forgiven at the 20 year mark with PAYE and then just pay the tax bomb with the increased base salary.

Her law school offers loan forgiveness help for 10 years (we are three years in, though only 1 year of that was PSLF eligible) that caps out at around $80,000 a year so her loan minimum would go up while she's above its salary cap (right now, she's under it and so they are helping with the loan minimums).

The long and short of it is - what salary amount generally makes it worth not working in a PSLF eligible job?

Thanks so much and let me know if there is are any details that I haven't provided that would be helpful.


EDIT

The other thing to mention is that I'm very very lucky and work in a high paying job (about $300k a year) and after this year, will have enough saved to basically pay her loans off.

However, I've been saving for a house and don't want to stay in this job for much longer and any job I take would be a salary hit of about $100k (so a salary of around $200k a year). We'd still be in a good financial position generally, but paying off her loans would have us both working high paying jobs starting from effectively zero.

My thought is that its better to save up for the house and keep money on the side to pay the tax bomb in 20 years on PAYE rather than to just refinance her loans now and pay them all off in a year, but I'm not 100% confident in that decision either.

Last caveat is that we might be moving (from NY to CA) in the next two years. If that's the case, she'll have to look for a new job and I'm not confident the salary will transfer accordingly - she may take a dip closer to $100k.

personalfinance,"Being told by my employer that I can't make a bulk pre-tax contribution to my HSA, within limits? Should I challenge this?","**TL;DR**: My employer is saying I can't make a large pre-tax contribution to my HSA out of my paycheck to meet the annual max of $3500, and that I can only meet the max by making by smaller contributions over the course of the year, divided evenly among my paychecks.  I'm wondering if I have any basis to fight this?

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm moving towards investing my HSA, and in order to meet a minimum balance requirement and invest sooner rather than later, I'd like to make a bulk contribution to my HSA from my paycheck, on a pre-tax basis.  Currently, the only way I can contribute to my HSA via my paycheck is by parsing out the contributions over the year, ie if I say I want to contribute the max of $3500, it gets divvied out over my paychecks in 2019.  I can't specify an amount greater than $3500 annually, when determining my contribution.

I called up my HR/benefits and asked if I could schedule larger contributions from my paycheck, say $2000 out of one, $1500 out of the next one, to meet my max for the year more quickly.  They said this isn't possible - they didn't say why, and tbh they seemed to be pretty confused by the question.  I took their ""no"" to be a ""no, because we don't know how"".

I'm aware that I can make my own contribution directly through my HSA account (not through my employer/paycheck), but then I'm contributing money that's been taxed and it defeats the purpose.  My employer also doesn't allow me to select more than the max annual contribution in their form, ie I can't try to force the math to work by specifying some large number so that my contributions are larger, then cancel once I've met the max.

I've done some reading and am finding some contradictory information.  [This resource](https://www.thetaxadviser.com/issues/2017/jul/contributions-hsas.html) references a [2004 IRS notice](https://www.irs.gov/irb/2004-02_IRB#NOT-2004-2) stating that (see bold)

&gt;Q-21. When may HSA contributions be made?  Is there a deadline for contributions to an HSA for a taxable year?  
&gt;  
&gt;A-21.  Contributions for the taxable year can be made in one or more payments,  at the convenience of the individual or the employer, at any time prior  to the time prescribed by law (without extensions) for filing the  eligible individual's federal income tax return for that year, but not  before the beginning of that year.   For calendar year taxpayers, the  deadline for contributions to an HSA is generally April 15 following the  year for which the contributions are made.  **Although the annual  contribution is determined monthly, the maximum contribution may be made  on the first day of the year**.  *See* A-22 regarding correcting excess contributions.

[This resource](https://www.kiplinger.com/article/saving/T027-C001-S003-more-answers-hsa-health-savings-account-questions.html) also suggests I can contribute the max limit at once:

&gt;**Can I contribute the full amount for 2015 now if I currently  have an HSA-eligible policy, even though I haven’t had an eligible  policy for all 12 months yet?**Yes, you can contribute the full amount now. But if you don’t end up  keeping the HSA-eligible policy for the full year (and don’t have it on  December 1), you could have to pay taxes and a 6% penalty on the  contributions you made for the months you weren’t eligible for the HSA

At the same time, [section (b) of US code 223](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/223) seems to reference a monthly limit on deductions, though I'm not clear if this means tax deductions or monthly contributions to my HSA:

personalfinance,My fiance and I are looking to buy a house soon and really need some advice...,"So, as the title says; my fiance(28f) and I(29m) are looking to purchase a home together soon. We have been living together in an apartment since April paying about $850 in rent plus electricity and internet as well as a flat rate for heat/water and we have a one year lease. We have a wedding date set for October and are looking to buy a house rather than rent until we are married. My concern though is that my current credit situation may not be good enough to get approved by our perspective lender (Third Federal). 

Here's the financial situation:

Me; 

Income- 46k (2018 w-2) 
Savings- 10k
Debt-
*car loan- $12,500 left on principal (480 monthly payment) 
*student loan- $2400 (making minimum payments currently of $18/month).
Credit-
*  Captial One Quicksilver Mastercard (opened 10/18) with $1,000.00 limit. Currently has balance of $20.00
* Amazon Prime Visa Signature (opened 12/18) with $500.00 limit and $20.00 balance.
Both cards are used for daily purchases and paid off completely every month to avoid interest. I opened them because, from my understanding, I needed to have more than just a car loan for my credit history when I apply for the mortgage. I basically wanted to show I have more accounts in good standing to hopefully increase my score. 

My credit situation in 2015 when I bought my car was dismal. I had multiple closed delinquent accounts from my mother using my ID for credit cards throughout my childhood. I had the student loan and no other form of credit at that time. My score was 550. This was when I started paying attention ( still cannot kick myself in the ass enough for not trying to do this sooner)

Since then I have been working on improving my credit. I have not missed a single payment on my car loan and have been paying extra toward principal as well. My credit is currently showing via credit karma at 703 Transunion and 710 Equifax.

If there's any more info needed from me please ask and I'll provide.

Her; 

Income- 47k salary soon to be 55k (starts new job next month)
Savings- 50,000 (just the portion shes setting aside for down payment)
Debt- ZERO
Credit cards- 1 (unsure of issuer) carries zero monthly balance. 
Credit score- 780ish

Our lease is up in April but we have the ability to stay with my grandmother in the interim while we look for a house we want. We would love to start looking now but we're concerned about my credit considering that it would be my credit being looked at for the mortgage. We are looking at Third Federal as a lender and understand that they offer loans on an approval basis only (interest is flat regardless of credit score, its just whether or not you have a good enough score to be approved).

Here are the big questions;

*Should we apply for the mortgage together or seperate?

*If we apply together, will my credit be good enough to be approved now or should I take more time to build it?

*how long will it take the reporting agencies to reflect the changes that credit karma has?

*with my student loan; will paying it off in full right now hurt me at all? Should I pay down a large portion and leave a few monthly payments while we look for the house?

personalfinance,Couple questions (Roth vs. Traditional 401k) and some IRA vs. student loans stuff,"23 yo software engineer with 70K salary. 6% state income tax.

Last year was my first year in the work force. I got rid of some dumb college CC debt (~$6000), have a few months worth of expenses in my emergency fund, and got my credit score above 750. I've been looking at what I can do better with my finances this new year and have a couple questions. 

Would it be better to do traditional or Roth 401k in my situation? I did traditional 401k my first year since it was the default. I'm doing 10% of my salary currently and I'll get 5% match from my employer. I expect my salary to go up as my career progresses, especially if I get my Masters, but I'm not sure how much or what my taxes will look like long term. Based on the wiki I'm in the middle income so I could go either way. What other factors can I look at to help make this decision? Any advice on one or the other?

One other question is whether I should open and start contributing to an IRA instead of paying extra to my student loans. I currently have about 34,000 in loans at a weighted avg interest rate of 3.65%. Since my average interest is relatively low, I figure I can do the IRA in addition to my minimum payments on loans. If I hit the contribution limit I can pay more to student loans. 

I can still make IRA contributions for 2018, correct? Is there something I need to do when opening one to make sure contributions count towards 2018 limits?

personalfinance,Credit Card debt vs. Personal loan when concerning credit score,"Hi everyone! Hopefully the title isn't too confusing. I'll try to explain without going too detailed and boring.

Hubs and I accumulated too much debt on our credit cards over the last 4 years (14 each) over bills, life expenses, dog expenses, and honestly just being dumb at times. We have made it our mission to crack down on our usage (which has basically stopped completely [I use the word ""basically"" because we are USCG and are affected by the shutdown so emergency food/gas purchases may happen when we run out of money]).

We are waiting on our tax return to pay some of his credit card down (not mine - I will get to that). He also mentioned the idea of getting a 5k personal loan to pay his CC down some more because (per what he found on google) CC debt looks worse on a credit report/score than personal loans do. Is a personal loan a good idea? We should, key word, be able to afford 5k at 36mo. giving us a smaller interest rate than his CC has now.

On to why it would only go on his CC and not mine. I am a SAHM and he is active duty, so he is the only one bringing in income. We transfer summer of 2020 and would like to buy a house at our next unit (regardless if we change our minds, between rent, power, cable, and every starter thing moving would take, his credit score would get checked A TON). Anyway, he is hell bent on getting his CC debt wayy down and his credit score wayy up (which I obviously support). He believes that *only* his credit score would be constantly looked up and affected, but in the house buying process I feel both of ours would be checked equally (including renting a place but not so much on the other misc. things if we put the rest solely in his name). His plan is to work his CC debt down so we could use the extra cash towards my CC (i.e. his CC payment goes from $300 to $150 and we use the ""extra"" $150 to put towards my card on top of regular payments). Is that smart or even realistic? I worry though because even if his CC payment lowers, we now have this $150-$175 personal loan bill that would take the extra cash for the next 36 months.

TLDR: Is it smart taking out a personal loan to pay down part of a CC? Do personal loans not affect credit score like CC debt does? Should we ignore my CC debt for the time being and solely focus on his?

personalfinance,Wanting to but a house in the bay area but is investing in other ways is a better option?,"Okay I have a lot going on here. But Let me just start the main reason I am posing. 

I am 35, live in the bay area, and have been wanting to buy a house for years as I never owned a home. I feel like I have saved enough to where it could be possible to purchase a home and have talked to a few loan providers to see if we could pre-qualify. They agree that we do have around the right amount saved and can start getting serious. But the more I look into the costs of homebuying around here, the more I wonder if it would be better investment to rent and just put all of that savings into the market. Now I have been lurking on here for a while and it seems that the common recommendation is if we plan to stay in the same place for at least 7 years, then buying could be potentially better ROI (which is the case for us as kids are starting school this year).

 Here is where I am at financially: Have $120K in the bank (enough for 10% down and am estimated $20K extra for savings).  Wife and I make about $180K/year. Only debts are $30K in 2 cars and will paid off in 5 years. We looking to get a place that will cost around $900K. Looking at the monthly costs (rent vs mortgage). Rent is currently $3400/month and with a 900K mortgage i am looking at $4,500- $5,000/month which includes property tax and all the various insurances. 

Now, looking at our budget, adding $1,500 to our monthly home contributions will really wipe out our monthly savings contributions (as we have been saving around that to get to where we are at).  So I want to know if you savvy money strangers think putting a good about of savings into a moderate to low risk market investments while continuing to save a good amount monthly is better than going into massive debt and only really gaining in equity for the first 10 years (due to the principle/interest split at the beginning of a 30 year loan). Is waiting to save 20%  for a home a better options? I always feel like waiting it out is putting us further behind because home prices are always going up and up around here. 

2nd question:

Loans:  With a loan of this size, I cannot get a fanny/freddy/firstime home loan with 5% down loan. So I would be applying for a bank issued loan which usually requires at least 10% down. Most of these banks are saying that it is better to get a 10-15 year ARM with a lower interest rate as the odds of staying in my home longer than that is low. Which I cannot disagree with. However, I have always been told to stay away from those as always go with fixed rate loan. I understand that going with either is really just playing the market and interest rate trends game. Thoughts?

 Also worth noting, some of these loan offering get around mortgage insurance by offering a 80/10/10 or a 80/20 loan structure. Which is really just taking out a 2nd loan and similar to mortgage insurance anyway. But at least something is going into the principle instead of just disappearing into the mortgage insurance abyss. Any recommendations in these types of loans. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Buying my first home,"Hi all,

I'm looking to purchase a home by the end of May this year. I'm currently 25 and due to be wed to my fiancé in November. Before I get to my questions, here's some of my metrics:

Credit Score: 700
Annual Salary: 55k 
Debt to Income: 3% (I have no student loans or car note but some CC debt)
Retirement: Been contributing up to 401k match from employer for the past 3 years. 
Savings: Around 5k (This is also my emergency fund and also includes my fiancé’s)

My fiancé’s situation is a good bit worse, at least in terms of debt:
Credit Score: 680
Annual Salary: 52k
Debt to Income: Didn't calculate but she has student loans, car loan, CC debt, etc. In total, 80 to 90K.
Retirement: Been contributing up to match with employer
Savings: See mine above.

Our overall life plan is:
2019 - Marriage/House
2020 - Paying down debt and marriage expenses
2022 - Kid 1
2025/26 - Kid 2

We currently pay $1400 in rent (lease runs out in May) and I’m looking for a home around the 150k to 200k price range. Also, I’m applying for any mortgage loans by myself. 

Here's some of my questions:
1.	Is now the right time to buy a home? My thoughts are that I’d be able to take advantage of FHA/First time home buyer incentives now while I’m still legally “single” and under most income limits.
2.	Assuming now’s the time to buy, should I be looking for a forever home (7+ years) or just something for the time being (3-7 year)? My thoughts are to go for the short term, 3-7 years, have somewhere to start building my family and improve our combined financial situation before really going for a forever home with a conventional loan. 
3.	If I do find a home and go for the short term, should I be seeking down payment assistance (higher interest rate) or providing my own down payment (loss of cash funds to fund wedding)?
4.	If I do find a home and go for the long term forever home, is a conventional loan with my own down payment, probably 5%, the most fiscally responsible thing to do?

Thanks for the help! I’ll respond to questions as fast and as accurately as I can!

personalfinance,401k General Purpose loan listed as Deemed by Vanguard but not my employer??,"EDIT: Could also be an employer payroll issue. Not 100% sure. Please read whole thing :) Love u

Let me start by saying that ultimately yes this is my fault. I'm upset for a few reasons. Back in 2016 I took out a ""general purpose loan"" from my vanguard 401k in order to make the down payment for our first home. Home is great, we got a great interest rate, yada yada.

The employer that I was with when I took out that 401k loan, I left 6 months after. Under the plan I was allowed to continue bi-weekly payments towards the loan without having to worry about it becoming a deemed distribution. I have since rejoined the company, and I have been working here since April 2018. So although my deductions are not automatically coming out of my paycheck, I am still paying it back

I was doing that diligently without issues for the longest time, until I login to vanguard today and see that my loan is now deemed.

I'm learning all this terminology today but I guess it was due to one single missed payment in March 2018 which triggered my cure period and the cure period has expired. My loan was determined to be deemed on Dec 31, 2018. I received no phone calls or letters in the mail which is their MO when I'm registered for electronic notification in which case it is placed in their ""message center"" lol

**However** the guy on the phone said that rarely this happens, but in my case my actual employer has not reported this to be taxable yet, and/or has not informed vanguard to set this up to be reported as income tax. I don't remember the terminology he used, but basically the point he was trying to get across is that even though vanguard has this loan listed as deemed, since my employer has not taken any action, I will not get a 1099 yet. They stated that it is possible if I pay my loan in full, I could potentially avoid paying tax penalty and having it reported as income tax, but it's not a guarantee because of who files when and how quickly.

Is this a thing? I can pay the loan in full now, and I would if it means NOT paying 4-5k extra in fucking taxes, but I wouldn't want to nearly wipe out my savings if I still had to pay it back anyway (I have about 15k in savings), so paying it back in full would leave me with about 4k.

Like I said the rep on the phone said this rarely happens and he actually said the employer is the one who reaches out to vanguard to tell them ""ok set this deem date to this day, and then we'll send out a 1099"" or some shit.

He also said that my employer is going through changes with their 401k plan and their current plan is actually in some type of ""Freeze""? I am not sure what that is.

The vanguard rep recommended I could potentially reach out to my payroll department with my employer, but I am wondering if this is a good idea. I could potentially find out when they plan to list my payment as deemed on their end, but on the other end if something was overlooked I am worried they will just see the oversight, push a button, and then be like ""oops, we made a mistake but fixed it and now you owe taxes again LUL""

This sounds both risky and scary but I'm not sure what to do.",finance
investing,ELI5: Relationship between Fed Interest Rate Hikes and Quantitative Tightening?,"Could someone explain how these two tools are used together to combat inflation and/or prepare for a recession?

&amp;#x200B;

My basic understanding is:

* The Fed **raises interest rates** to combat inflation because the cost of borrowing is higher, so people and companies  spend less
* The Fed uses **quantitative tightening** to pull money out of the economy so the dollar is worth more and inflation is curbed? How exactly do they pull money out?

personalfinance,Different places,"I have a lot of school debt. Approx 50K in private loans and $100K in FedLoans. I have been paying my minimum on the FedLoans and Snowballing my private debt. I have paid off my credit cards, my car, and 1 of 3 of my private loans. I work in the school setting and am in the 10 year public loan forgiveness program (about 3 years left). My FedLoans keep building because I am only doing minimum payments, and it is hard to watch even though I know it will eventually be forgiven. 

My SO and I live together and have a joint account where we split rent/utilities/etc. 50/50. She is 10 years older and makes more than I do, and only has the debt of her car, which will be paid off in about 6 months. We keep separate accounts as I am working at becoming debt free and have a much tighter budget with my leftover money. My debt was made before she came into the picture, and I struggle with having her be responsible for that in any way. She likes to go out and do things, so if it is out of my blow $ range, she will usually pay for it. We talk about our $ a lot, but because we are in such different places, I worry when we get married. At this point I keep encouraging her to pay her car off (which she is doing awesome with), and start saving for her 3-6 Mos Emergency Fund and then retirement. 

Any suggestions on how to combine our money fairly once we get hitched? I struggle with being a debt burden on her while I work the FPU steps.

I owe about $6k in student loans and am paying about $250-$500 a month on this loan.  The interest rate on this student loan is 4.6 percent.  I know that paying off all of your debt before saving for retirement is important, but since the interest rate on the loan is so low I thought that both paying it and putting money into the 401k was the best move.

personalfinance,100K household income with no federal income taxes,"Looking for ways to save on future taxes?   Here's a quick note on ways that a couple filing jointly could have $100K+ annual income but pay no federal income taxes.   (Many of the ideas here scale down to $50K for a single person.)   This is only possible in certain situations, so you need to plan ahead to achieve this.

-  ""Income"" is something that shows up on a W2 or 1099.   So not inheritance, gifts, sale of a principal residence, etc., which can provide hundreds of thousands of untaxed money.

- ""Federal Income Tax"", aka FIT,  doesn't consider Social Security / Medicare taxes, as well as state income taxes, if any.   This discussion is only current-year taxes.  

There are three primary strategies to make a lot of money but not pay FIT: take advantage of untaxed / 0% tax items,  use deferrals, and apply tax credits.   

- Untaxed income: the standard deduction of $24K for a couple is the big one here.  You get that even if you don't spend any money on deductible costs, so that allows you to have up to $2000/month to spend for bills, food, etc.  (You would have to account for FICA/state taxes in that, though.)

- zero percent bracket income.    If your taxable income (net of standard deduction) doesn't exceed $77,400, you pay no FIT on  long-term gains and qualified dividends that are part of that $77,400.  You could have $50,000+ in LTCG and qualified dividends and pay no taxes on those, if your taxable income was otherwise low enough.  Similar to how a Roth IRA works, but you can do it at any age.

- Deferrals.   Retirement contributions and healthcare savings defer or even eliminate FIT.    For people below 50, IRAs and HSAs would give us $6000+$6000+$7000 or $19000 in deferrals, whether or not there is also a pre-tax 401k, discussed below.

- Tax credits: some amount of FIT liability can be netted off against applicable credits.  The big one here is the child credit, at $2000/child.   Two children would eliminate the taxes due on the first  $36,000 of a couple's taxable income.   You have to have children to make this one work, so that's a possible downside, but they can take the place of LTCG in this strategy.  There are various other credits available for other specific situations.  

So....combining those three ideas, a couple could have income of $24,000  (standard deduction) + $19,000 (deferrals) + 67,000 (LTCG+QD+taxable income covered by credits) = 110,000 and pay no current-year federal income taxes.  (If you went higher, you would lose some of the IRA deduction.)  They would have to have earned income of at least $12,000 to get the IRA deductions.   

Now let's add pretax 401ks.   A couple could each max their 401ks and that would be another $38,000 in what they would consider salary, if not W2 box 1 income.  (Healthcare deductions would further add to this.)  So that gets us to $148,000.  

And if the couple is over 55, the deferral limits get bumped up by another $3000 for IRA+HSA, and another $12,000 for two 401ks.  That would bring the ceiling up to $163,000 for people of that age.   

This is meant more to show what is possible than as a prescription to be followed in detail, but it might be useful in your planning, if only to show how long-term gains and dividends are part of a low-tax income strategy.",finance

politics,[Megathread] President Trump’s Address on Border Security and the Democratic Response (Part 2),"**Please follow the comment guidelines - remain civil toward other users. Note that low effort or off topic discussion may be automatically removed in this thread**

Tonight, President Trump will delivered prime-time Oval Office address to the nation, [to discuss immigration and the ongoing government shutdown.](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1082347305699889157) The address aired on all major and cable networks. Directly following President Trump’s remarks was a response from Democratic leadership, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Speaker of the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi. This also aired on the same major networks. Today marks the 18th day of a partial government shutdown, which has resulted in the closure of approximately 25% of federal agencies and left over 800,000 federal employees either out of work, or required to work without pay. President Trump has firmly stated that he will not agree to any spending bill that does not include the $5.7 billion in funding for his proposed Mexican border wall. In a statement released earlier today, the White House stated that [Congress Must Do More to Address The Border Crisis](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/congress-must-do-more-to-address-the-border-crisis/).

personalfinance,Does my IUL make sense?,"Two years ago, I was talked into purchasing a flexible IUL policy from Voya through a financial advisor that came to my office. I was at first very excited about the promise of cash value, minimum returns and the ability to borrow against it for future investments at a low interest rate. However, I have recently looked at my plan and noticed that though i've sunk almost $10,000 the current value is only half of that. I understand that it's a long term investment, but after reading many articles online, I'm wondering if this was a bad investment. With the surrender charge, I would end up losing about $6500. This is no small chunk of change, but I'm worried about losing even more if I keep putting money into it. Do I cut my losses and run or stick with it?



A little about me:

Salary: $75k/yr

No dependents

IUL has 500k benefit

I contribute to my work 401k, but have a Roth that I haven't even contributed to in the past 2 years because of the costly premiums of my IUL.



Any advice or insight would be welcome!",finance
personalfinance,"Just got my auto loan information, It seems my dealership added some optional things that i didn't agree to. What do i do?","Hello All.
I just brought my first car and as a complete newbie i walked into a dealership and walked out with a purchase. I picked up the car 2 days later and didnt even think it was werid that they gave me no paperwork at all.

I finally got my auto loan information (11 days later) And i requested a bill of sale.

So while i was at the dealership, I agreed the following
25304 Car price 
-3500 manufacturer rebate = 21804
+1362.75  (0.625% taxes)
+495 doc fee
+ 130 licences and title
= total of 23791.75. 
- $4000 down payment 
 So i should be left with 19791.75 principle.

My bill of sale say : 
25304 price of car
+2785 service agreement (optional)
+1195 prime apppearance 72 (optional)
+1468.38 (0.625% taxes)
+495 (doc fee)
+130 (licence and title)
Total 31377.38
-3500 (manufacturer rebate)
-4000 (down payment)
Total 23877.38 Principle. 

They literally added a bunch of stuff without asking me... what can i do?...

Update 1/13/2019

So i got them to cancel it for me. But It will take 90 days to refund to my loan so i cannot refinance it until the refund go thru so i'm stuck with the 5.5% interest rate for 3 months =(.

So i finally got a copy of all the paper work. The finance guy didn't even want to give it to me, he was like oh the bank hasn't mail it to you? they have the same paper work. I am not sure why the bank would mail me a copy of my car purchase contract instead of them.

So from the paper work i can see how they cheated me.
During neogaotiation, We agreed on a adjusted price of 21,804.00. After all the fees and taxed the final price is 23827.69. After i signed this paper, the finance guy showed me his ipad and told me to sign it, which was the contract. But the ipad was scrolled to the bottom where i can only see the final price of 23877.38, which i didn't question the difference because it looked similar that i didn't notice. I have the contract now, which is digitally generated and does not have my physical signature because i signed on the ipad. 

What they did was this. They increased the adjusted price to 22,999 (which was the agreed upon price 21804 + 1195 prime protection, which is an optional addition that i specifically told the sales person to remove, but they added it back in without telling me and without listing it in my contract) Then they added the 2785 (service agreement, which is an optional thing that i never agreed to nor was ever alerted to me nor explained to me what it is. I still have no clue what that is... i assume it's some extended warranty.) Then they subtracted my downpayment, which ends it as 23877.38. 

Basically they added 2 line items that adds to the price of my downpayment, so i wouldn't notice them. Within minutes of signing a sheet with the 23827.69, they give me a contract to sign that is 23877.38 (But after my down payment was deducted). So in the end my principle was 23877.38 instead of 19827.69",finance

personalfinance,"Mom on the verge of breakdown, need help figuring out a plan","Hi everyone, my mom is on the verge of a mental breakdown concerning her finances and asked me for help. I am not very financially savvy, so I am turning here for help. I will try to keep things short and to the point.

She is about to turn 60 and works as a nurse. She takes home, after taxes, about $4,000 a month, $48,000 a year. My father passed away in 2017 and she is single. There are two large debts she owes that are making her struggle - she owes $120k to the bank for a refinance on the house, and $270k on Parent Plus school loans. The refinance costs her \~$1,380 per month, and the loans are now going to cost her \~$1,450 a month. In August of 2017, she qualified for the Public Loan Forgiveness and Income Driven payment plans and was paying \~$845 to the loans monthly. Shortly after is when my father died. The Income Driven plan needs to be recertified every year, and in October of 2018 she was given the new amount of \~$1,500 monthly. She reapplied twice, and each amount given was only a few dollars lower. There was a .75 cent increase in her hourly pay, and the death of my father, but no changes other than that. Is this enough to make the increase over $600? The people at FedLoan are no help when she calls.

Her other monthly expenses, not including food, (insurance, utilities, house taxes etc.) are costing her about \~$1,400 a month. So now, with the student loan payment increase, she will be left with little to no money for food or anything else depending on when she pays the bills. Is there anything we can do to make things work?

Edit: the 270k student loan is combined debt for two siblings. I don’t know of, or count on, any arrangements made between my mother and siblings for them to make payments. This was the information I was given from her and as much as I know.",finance

personalfinance,Buy a house or continue renting?,"Hi all,

I’ve been looking into and trying to figure out what my next living situation is going to look like. Right now, I live with 2 other roommates and we have all decided that next time we move, we’ll probably all have our own place (nothing happened between us or anything, we’re just at the point where we want to be on our own). 

I’ve been researching some one bedroom places in and around my city and everything seems so expensive. So much so that I’ve found decent houses for sale where even with no down payment, the mortgage with PMI and taxes is around the same as what I’d be paying in rent for some of these one bedroom places. 

My ultimate goal is to move out of the city into a house with a bit of land and room for activities, but for right now, I really do like living in the city. Many of the houses I was finding were near one of the universities in my city so it had be thinking — I could buy a house near this university, live there for a few years or so, then when I’m ready to move out into the suburbs, either sell it or rent it out to college students. With this plan, I’d still be saving money because the rent vs mortgage cost is pretty similar. Obviously , the missing piece that I haven’t accounted for is the maintenance cost when renting vs. owning. 

Just wanted to get your guys’ thoughts on this and/or hear your experiences if any of you have done something similar. Also, if there are things I’m not considering that are important, please let me know. 

Edit: forgot to mention, I have student loans at pretty decent interest rates (dept of Ed loans, no private) and a car loan, also at a low rate. But again, the rent vs mortgage cost is very similar.",finance
personalfinance,Need help navigating loans to pay for grad school.,"Hi everyone,

I am a novice regarding student loans. I graduated December 2017, and a parent offered to pay down those loans as a gift to me. Therefore, I started grad school this past fall student loan debt free. My university did not show that I qualified for any federal loans, but I will follow up with them this week to sort that out. In the meantime, I'm not sure what some relatively trusted private loans are for grad school. I've looked into Sally Mae, Discover, and a few more. Which ones did you guys use, and did you have good experiences?

Grad school is from Fall 2018 thru Summer 2020, and I believe I will end up taking out \~$30k. I am required to complete graduate school in my career field, so I am comfortable with this number. I plan on living at home when I finish school and immediately paying off all my debt.

financial,Just sold condo; buy a new house or pay off student loans or what?,"Just finished my PhD and moved to a different state so I sold my condo. Now we are living where my postdoc is and wondering what I should do with a decent chunk of money. Interest on my student loans compounds at the end of January when my payments start. Currently my plan is to pay off my credit card debt, but after that I am at a loss. My contract for work is a 3 year contract. Assuming I pay nothing on my student loans I qualify for a $200K home loan. The majority of my student loans are less than 3% interest though some are at about 6% (accumulated interest about $13K, principle roughly $80K).  If I pay off some of the higher student loans I qualify for a $325K home loan. I am in a fantastic housing market that fluctuated little with the last bubble, so I'm fairly confident that buying a house would be a good investment (also, rent is pretty ridiculous and my credit score is awesome so I could get a good loan interest rate). Should I pay more on my loans regardless of if I buy a house (or how much house)? Should we rent? How do I know what would be best!? I've done serious math that indicates renting is not the best way to go, but this is all new to me. Suggestions, comments, advice, things to read up on, or anything that might be useful is welcome. My parents were always been super honest and open about finances and what to think about and tried to teach us (at least where to learn this kind of thing), but I've never been in a situation where I was handed a check for roughly $115K.",finance

personalfinance,Bank Owes Me $5000 But I Can't Contact Them (Brink's Prepaid Account),"**FINAL UPDATE 1/10/2019:**

I just called them and there wasn't an option for operator unless you enter the account information (I tried with my SSN but they said they couldn't find it which makes sense because I already closed my account). However, the trick is, you just enter a digit, then the system will say ""this is a not an SSN"", and don't hang up. Wait a few seconds and the system will say ""we will connect you to an operator"".

Even though my account was closed they were able to find my closed account using my debit card number and the remaining balance. They said they would review the check, and I could contact them again after 3-5 business days.

After the phone call, I checked my saving account (the other bank) and found that I have cashed the check in October last year. So I did receive the check and cashed it, it's just I forgot that. BTW, I am using a Google Drive sheet to monitor the ""todos"" with all my bank accounts. I must have forgot to update the sheet when I cashed the check so the other day,  I was looking at the sheet and wonder why I haven't received my check (I did check all my banks, but I missed the saving account).

&amp;#x200B;

**Original Post:**

So, I opened a Brink's prepaid account about two years ago because they had a high interest rate. I closed the account in October 2018 and since then I was expecting the check (they said they would send it to my current address, and I verified the address was correct).

Now it's 2019 and I still don't get the check. I tried to contact them using their ""customer service number"" but that requires me to enter my card number. Since I already closed the account, after I entered it, I was told the number was invalid. It seems there's no way to contact them without a valid account. I don't know anyone has similar situation and I was wondering could someone give me some suggestion how could I solve this problem.

Thank you.",finance

My issue is I recently bought a new Honda.  Was going to pay cash but Honda offered 2k in additional rebates for financing through Honda financial.  Ending up putting nothing down and rolling everything into a 60 month loan at 1.9%.

My thought was no reason to pay an extra 2k and I can get a FDIC backed CD at more than 1.9% so why pay the loan off.  But on further reflection that doesn't really make sense since my families marginal tax rate is 38%+ considering state and federal taxes and CDs are taxed as income.  So I would need an interest rate above 3% to make it worthwhile which is not currently available.

Putting the money in a Vanguard index fund is another option but this isn't a long term investment that can survive a downturn and based on historical precedent I wonder how long the economy can hold off the inevitable downturn (we already are in longest bull market ever).

personalfinance,Questions on shopping around for a mortgage,"Hi everyone,

Not a first time home buyer, but my previous home I had one mortgage broker whom I worked with and never shopped around.

We are just out of attorney review on my second home, and I was wondering if it might make more sense to shop around now that interest rates are a bit higher. My questions are:

1) Will it hurt my credit significantly to shop around? I know a hard pull is not required for a pre-approval, but in my experience pre-approvals are not really indicative of what you will actually be approved for.

2) Would ""shopping around"" entail actually applying for loans at multiple banks? Or just asking for a pre-approval document at each one and seeing the ranges they can give me in the pre-approval for interest rates?

3) What else besides interest rates are competitive negotiation tools (eg., do some great lenders offer credits on closing, etc.) Just want to know what to look for!

personalfinance,Is a home loan better than credit cards?,"I apologize because I feel like I don't have all of the info necessary to ask this question, but I would like an answer soon, so I am asking anyway.

My husband has been looking into getting a home loan (I don't know the actual name for it, it is a loan against our house. FHA, I think). We're going to do some repairs and renovations on our home. We weren't really looking to get a huge loan, but after talking to the man handling our loan, my husband decided to use the home loan to pay off our minivan. We suddenly had to buy the minivan a couple of years ago (basically out of the blue) and didn't have great credit, so it has an awful interest rate. We also have some credit card debt, and my husband wanted to bundle all of our debt into this home loan. This would result in a low monthly payment that would allow us to get on top of things and stop slowly increasing our debt.

My husband received the loan info in an email this morning and called me freaking out. The loan itself is for $28,000 with a $5,000 closing cost added to it. That's a really high closing cost and my husband feels that with a closing cost that is basically 20%, isn't he better off just to put this huge debt on a credit card and not attach a loan to our home that has a TIP of 99%.

I think he is wrong. I think the 20% closing cost is somehow not the same as a 20% interest rate on a credit card...doesn't the interest on the credit card just keep adding up and the closing cost is a one time payment? I understand that with home loans you generally end up paying back a very high percentage of the principal as interest. I know the TIP is high and have read that it is normal considering the 5% interest rate. 

My feeling is that the home loan is the way to go, but my husband is balking and ready to put a new roof and electrical rewiring on a credit card. This sounds crazy to me.

The home loan would allow us to pay for a new roof, rewiring, existing credit card debt, our van payment and our home insurance for a monthly payment that is only $60 more than our current van payment. With a monthly payment like that we could easily pay extra each month to pay the loan off sooner rather than later - would that make the TIP better, or will the TIP stay the same no matter what?",finance

personalfinance,[Student Loans] Should I refinance my student loans - what does that mean for my credit and for my ability to apply for a mortgage?,"Hi PF people. (kind of long, tldr at bottom) 

I know this question probably gets answered a lot and also there a  million different variables that go into this decision. 

I am just overwhelmed with the amount of information and how various options play for my financial situation. 

My finances are kind of a tragedy. My spouse and I make a really good amount of money, which is great, and we have very stable careers with plenty of opportunity for growth. Together we make about $350k per year. 

Both of us have student loans that are soaking up all of our discretionary income. We do not go out, we don't really go on vacations. - But, we do live in southern california, and we pay a lot for our beautiful house - that we rent. 

We want to get into a situation to be able to buy a house sometime soon (next 12-24 months), but we're just confused as to what to do. 

Details:

* Cash: ~$40k

* Retirement (401k/IRA): ~$50k ($30k me, $20k SO)

* Housing/Utilities: ~$4.5k/mo with rent+utilities+TV/Internet

* I assist both of my parents with their expenses, as they are really poor, so I pay about $1500 a month to them for their bills.
 
* Debt: 

 * One car loan at ~$9k, this is actually a net positive asset right now as the car is worth ~$12k

 * SO Student Loans: Private $80k @ 5.4%, 

 * MY Student Loans: Federal $90k @ 6.9%, $18k @ 9.6%

 * We both use our credit cards, but pay them off every month and really don't carry a balance on any of them anymore. 

So - My question. 

tldr;

**I know I could definitely refinance my student loans and get a lower rate, we both have good credit (750+) and that means I could pay them off faster and save a lot over the long run - BUT 
I want to know if this is good or bad to do for my credit and for our potential to buy a house in the next year/2 years? Should I refi my student loans now? Or after getting a mortgage? Should we just accept that buying a house is a pipe dream? (approx mortgage value would be $550k+)**

I know we would ideally pay off our student loans before buying a house, and that was our initial plan. But with COL in CA and how annoying landlords are, we are just fed up with paying so much a month for a house that will never be an asset and that we can't really invest in upgrading more to our liking.

personalfinance,Spotter Needed for Mental Gymnastics,"Spouse wants to stop 401k contributions this year to pay off a loan. While the task of changing her mind is a monumental one, can we give this a go anyways? 

First off, you guys rock! I really enjoy the sub and continue to learn. Thanks! 

All is well in the household, emergency fund, yes, debt, no, less \~20k on a loan for solar panels at 4%. We didn't want the loan, but were afraid of the tax credit expiring before we were ready, so we took it.

Using round numbers, let’s say AGI for the year is 200k and after deductions the overall federal tax rate was 15%, state (CA) was 7%, 44k paid. Is it fair to say if no 401k contributions were made, AGI would have been 218k, putting federal roughly at 33k and state 15k, or 48k paid? 

Yes it’s restricted in the 401k, but compared to post tax $, there would be 4k more in our ""pockets"" today. The interest on the loan for this calendar year will be \~$900, so call it 3k more.

If things go terribly wrong and a hardship withdrawal was needed sometime in the future, even with the 10% penalty, it would still be better to make the 401k contribution, because the tax savings is \~20% and the penalty is 10%. Am I missing anything? 

I know there’s a lot more to consider and a withdrawal would be a last, last resort, but I’m trying just to bracket things and confidently say, in the worst possible scenario, it’s still better to contribute the max now and pay the loan off a little slower.

My situation:

My mother recently passed away from cancer in July and I was given a 200k life insurance policy to cash out.  When that had happened I was in a very, very poor financial situation.  At 34, earning 45k/yr I had a lot of CC debt, no savings, no retirement, and no investments.

Currently:

In an effort to fix my extremely poor early life choices here are the steps I've taken so far with as much detail as I thought would be needed.

1.) All debt has been paid, minus my car (15k remains, 2.1% rate)

2.) Paid off family debt of 11k (they helped me with things while mom was getting treated for cancer and I was missing work)

3.) I've set aside 8k in my savings account for emergency use

4.) I bought the house and paid it off in full and moved in to it (120k appraised at 260k)

5.) I maxed out '18s Vanguard RothIRA ($5500 currently sitting in Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund)

6.) I maxed out '19s RothIRA ($6000 currently sitting in Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund)

7.) I've opened a standard Brokerage Account ($3000 to get started, currently sitting in Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund)

8.) Checking account has 40k left

Questions:

1.) I know I need to get the IRA invested, assuming that a target retirement fund (2050) is best?  Do I just invest all $11,546 in to it?

2.) I don't want the 40k sitting in checking, I opened that brokerage account as my taxable account (following the flow chart as I don't have access to a 401k).  Do I just put the remaining 40k there?  Also set to target retirement fund?

3.) Should I move my emergency fund out of my Bank savings account? Where should that go?

personalfinance,Questions about retirement savings and investing. How much to contribute and how to invest it?,"Hello all!

&amp;#x200B;

So I am taking a gap year between undergraduate and graduate school. I currently work at a public university and they offered me the option to open up a retirement account, so I decided why not start early. Currently, I have a TIAA (Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association) account. I enrolled in a Tax Deferred Annuity Plan and an Alternate Retirement Plan (they offered me the option to also open a 457(B) Deferred Compensation Plan but I felt the other two were enough). 

I currently contribute 5% and the university contributes 9.29% of my pretax salary. I bumped up my contribution to 15% for my next paycheck onward. Was that a good idea? Should it be more/less? I have a reasonable amount of savings that I originally contributed 60% of my income to, but now it'll be 45% with the increase so I'm not really strapped for cash. I don't have any debt and, when I go to graduate school my degree will be fully funded and I'll get a stipend to live off of for a minimum of 6 years.

The big question I have is what to do with the money in my retirement account?

Currently my asset classes are separated:

10% Guaranteed

10% Real Estate

80% Equities (30% T. Rowe Price Institutional Large Cap Growth; 30%  Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund Institutional Plus Class; 10% Federated MDT Small Cap Growth Fund Class R6; 10% Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund Institutional)

I also the first few paycheck contributions are in this multi-asset fund (which consists of holdings in several asset classes such as equities, money market, and fixed income).

I thought it would be better to he highly aggressive with my initial investments since I'm young (23). They just listed out various funds that I could choose from and I really had no idea which one to invest in. There was a lot of jargon and figures that I wasn't sure what to follow.

Does anyone have any thoughts? Things I should change? Things I should look out for? Questions?

personalfinance,Question about EE Bond interest accrual,"EE Bonds earn a fixed interest rate, with interest [added every month and compounded semiannually](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ebonds/res_e_bonds_eeratesandterms_increaseinvalue.htm). I'm a little confused about what this means. Does the interest rate account for compounding or not?

Also, when I use the [bond calculator](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/BC/SBCPrice), it doesn't look like interest actually gets added every month, and the interest doesn't seem to match the interest rate advertised. I tried inputting a $200 bond (issue price $100) with different issue dates (they all had 0.10% interest) and found:

* Issue date 06/2018 and later: No interest has been added (Why? Is it not added every month?)
* Issue date 12/2017 - 05/2018: $0.08 in interest has been added (Why not $0.05, which is half of 0.10% of $100?)
* Issue date 06/2017 - 11/2017: $0.16 in interest has been added (Why not $0.10?)
* etc...

What am I misunderstanding about EE Bond interest accrual?

personalfinance,Calculating Income Tax and Withholdings,"I'm filing taxes for the first time for the 2018 year as a single with no dependents and one job and have some questions:

* Are withholdings essentially paying your income tax each paycheck?
* If you calculate your income tax owed, will you know exactly how much you should be withholding to avoid owing money when taxes are due?

(Paid bi-weekly for \~4.5 months)

Total 2018 Earnings: $30,000

Total Federal Tax Withheld: $3155

Total State Tax Withheld: $1400

Contribution to 401k: $2400

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, my taxable income for 2018 should be: 30,000-12000-2400 = $15600

Using 2018 federal income tax rates: (15600-9525)\*0.12 + 952.50 = $1681.50

**Does this mean that since I paid $3155, that I should be refunded $3155-1681.50 = $1473.50?**

Can I also use this process to estimate how much should be withheld for my paychecks in 2019?

personalfinance,Fraud claim denied by my bank due to registering as a chip-in purchase,"So I recently visited my college town for a couple of days to move some stuff out in preparation of a move, while I was there I guess my card got skimmed somewhere and someone went on a $200 spending spree draining my account (luckily I had been too lazy to transfer $500 sitting in my Venmo to my account LOL). I filed a fraud report with Charles Schwab but now they’re saying there isn’t anything they can do because all the purchases I reported are showing they used the chip with my verified pin, and since I have possession of my card they can’t go farther (ie. it wasn’t stolen). 

I went on a bit of an existential crisis of questioning whether I really had just spent $200 without realizing it, but I called the drug store where the vast majority of my money was spent and they were able to tell me that the transactions were for $160 in generic cash gift cards, which basically confirms it was fraudulent to me, and they’re also confirming they see it as a chip-in purchase. To make matters worse, I didn’t really buy anything after I got back, so it looks like I just spent a bunch of money there and left, and I really *do* have possession of the (obviously now canceled) card in question. How can it be registering as a chip in purchase if I have the card with me, is someone really generating fake cards with spoofed chips? Is there anything I can do to resolve this? I’m thinking of filing a police report or seeing if I can escalate this with Schwab, but I’m leaving the country in literally a few days so I’m not sure how much I can do in that time.

personalfinance,Handling the Live-in MIL,"Scenario: Live-in MIL, pays nominal rent+utilities.  One year ago, uncovered MIL has $7k in short-term loan debt across several providers.  This money was gambled away and creditors are calling and the debt is racking up.  I'm financially conservative, and ultimately made the decision to pay all of these off and take over the debt at a near-zero interest rate.  (Knowing full-well I may never see that money again.)

&amp;#x200B;

MIL has successfully paid back the first of two notes, or about 1/3rd of the total debt over the past year (yay!)

&amp;#x200B;

I would still like her to pay the rest of it off, but anyone in a similar situation knows that this sort of arrangement just adds a lot of emotional load to the household.  e.g. I have to ask my wife to follow up with her about payment.  My wife and I (and probably MIL) are uncomfortable around discussing it.  I really don't want to ever have to evict her.  I'm not desperate for the money, we're doing okay generally, but obviously kids need college funds, etc. so I don't really want to blow it off either.

investing,Interest rates and P/E ratio,"Hey guys. I have a few questions..

&amp;#x200B;

I'm aware that over the course of its history, the stock market has been following a rinse and repeat cycle, which consists primarily of stock price appreciation, followed by a correction/crash, and then followed by stock price appreciation. Aka, bull market, then bear market, then bull market, and so on, with the bull outperforming the bear.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it the same case for interest rates? The interest rates were very high in the 70s and 80s, but are much lower nowadays. However, some speculate that they may increase again in the upcoming decade(s). 

&amp;#x200B;

The same can be said for the P/E ratio. It was around 15 in the last century for many companies, but is at an all-time high of 29 currently. Will it eventually go down to the mid teens?

Will interest rates and the P/E ratio follow a ""rinse and repeat"" cycle, where during a period of time they may be high and then become low, and so on?

What are the best investment and also very liquid which will perform better when interest rate rises?

Should I get a second mortgage to get tax credit against my income?

In the event of interest rate rise, the economy should be doing good, my wage should rise accordingly?

Will the government be stupid enough to raise the rate while there is no growth, as no wage increase?

To hedge this, I have to find something that are highly correlated when interest rate are high, what are correlated securities when interest rate are high and also correlated?

Maybe I should just let it be, buy a 3k CD every month for a one year term, as the fund to be saved for the emergency, which is a high interest rate ?",finance

My parents are currently 65 and 70, and still working, although some health issues have popped up here and there.

personalfinance,"For Furloughed workers (and everyone else, too!)","*I am making this post to help everyone out, furloughed or not, but it is particularly targeted toward those who are furloughed.  The advice is still generally sound for those who are not, but the comments may not be.*

**Now that you are furloughed and have been sitting around hanging out with kids and the family, you have plenty of time!  But no money.**

These are a few of the things that you could to do reduce your future expenses.  They generally won't cost anything other than time now, but they may.

**Starting with the low hanging fruit:**

* Go get quotes on your insurance policies.  Auto, home, rental, etc.  Spend the time to pull out your current policy, determine if the coverages and deductibles are right for you.  Then go to the insurance companies (or an insurance broker as I did) and ask them to get you various quotes.  

For homeowners, I went from a major bank/insurer to a regional insurer that has the same ratings and better customer service.  My yearly bill went from $1200 to $550, with a 50% reduction in my deductible.  Remember here: it's not always about the price, but also about the service.  You don't want to get screwed when you pick a cut-rate insurance company and they treat you poorly and make you jump through hoops before they pay out.

* Check your cell phone bills and see if you can cut any services that you don't need (maybe you are paying a monthly fee for something you don't need or forgot about?).  See if there are any discounts for your place of employment (government worker, military, etc).  I personally transferred my services (which cost me $75 upfront) but lowered my bill by about $70 a month.  So far, the service has been comparable.

* Review your cable bill for the same thing.  For that matter, assess if you even need cable.  Really.  Especially with all of the added fees.  

For that matter, while you are at it, call up your politicians and after you are done complaining about them not doing their jobs, encourage them to reimplement net neutrality laws.  This would help prevent the internet from going the way of cable, which provides you a billion channels when you only watch 6. If you decide to keep cable, call and ask for a rate reduction.  Maybe threaten to quit, especially if you are on the fence about cordcutting (shoutout to r/cordcutting).  

Complain to the cable companies (especially the integrated companies like Verizon and Comcast) about the fact that they have collected $500 billion in fees for rural high speed internet that doesn't exist. 

* Do the same thing with your internet and home phone, if you have them.

**Be careful here... sometimes it's cheaper to keep the triple play and return the cable box instead of paying for internet by itself.**  I've done this in the past and just told them I bought my own cable box, so I didn't need theirs.  Or, in the case of Verizon, I just sent it back. Keep documentation and hound them until they remove the charges and the device from your account.  Personally, I went from triple play to just internet, and my bill went from $180 to $75.  A month.

**Now, the bigger stuff.**

* If you have a car loan, check out refinancing it at a lower interest rate.  Perhaps your credit has improved, and so you now qualify for a lower interest rate.  Maybe the rate is the same, but company b will give you a bonus for refinancing?  I did this on a recently purchased car and my rate dropped 2%+ and the new creditor gave me $200... which I put toward the car.

* Look into mortgage brokers, credit unions, banks, etc, and see what can be done about your mortgage.  Perhaps you can pay for (or request!) a reappraisal that will drop your PMI.  Perhaps you can refinance your home.  **Note: Don't refinance for a longer term, refinance for the same amount of time that you have left on your loan.**  Don't keep yourself in debt forever.

* For those of you that have private student loans, look into refinancing them at a lower interest rate.  

You have the time to do these now, so you don't have the excuse that I know I gave myself for a long time of ""I just don't have time"".  I have done these over the past few months, personally.",finance

personalfinance,2018-19 U.S. Federal Government Shutdown Megathread,"There have been many posts in the past several weeks about the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. Several have been locked or removed due to numerous rule-breaking comments, mostly political in nature. For the time being, this will be **the only** thread for discussions about the government shutdown, its impact on federal workers and citizens, and assistance for those affected. [Rule 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/about/rules) clearly prohibits political discussions, and that and all other rules will be strictly enforced on this thread. 

#What is a shutdown?

A government shutdown occurs when there is a lapse in appropriations to fund agencies and departments of the federal government. Without appropriations, agencies cannot pay their operating costs, including their employees wages.

#What causes a shutdown?

The federal government's fiscal year runs from October through September. In order to avoid a lapse in appropriations, Congress must pass an appropriations bill, which must be signed by the President, before funding from the prior fiscal year elapses at the end of September. 

#Why did this shutdown happen in December then?

In the recent past, it has been relatively common to come to the end of the fiscal year without a full appropriations bill for the following fiscal year. What usually tends to happen is that a continuing resolution is passed, which extends funding at the current levels for a few more weeks/months. This essentially kicks the can down the road.

#How long will it last?

Until it ends! There's no set timeframe, and the government will remain shut down until an appropriations bill is signed into law. Currently the shutdown has been going on for 19 days. The longest in recent memory lasted 21 days in 1995. It is possible that this shutdown will last longer than 21 days. It is unlikely for it to last months or years, as has been mentioned.

#So are all federal employees out of work?

No, not all of them. This is only a partial government shutdown. However, approximately 380,000 employees are furloughed and approximately 420,000 are working without pay. Many contractors who work for the government are also furloughed.

#Will federal employees who are forced to work without pay be paid? What about furloughed employees?

Employees who were deemed essential and required to work without pay will receive backpay when the shutdown ends. Employees who were furloughed and did not work are not guaranteed to receive backpay; it must be specifically authorized by Congress and approved by the President. While this has happened after every shutdown in recent memory, it is possible that it may not after this one or other future shutdowns. Contractors who were furloughed are highly unlikely to receive backpay.

#What can employees who are affected by the shutdown do in the meantime?

It can be very difficult to enter a time when you don't know when your next paycheck will arrive. Hopefully many people have [emergency funds](https://www/reddit.com//r/personalfinance/wiki/emergencyfunds) to help them through this time. However, it is a reality that not everyone is in a position to be able to have an emergency fund, and others may have exhausted theirs because of other emergencies prior to the shutdown. These suggestions should apply to you regardless of whether you have an emergency fund, but are especially important for those without one:

* **Cut back on spending:** When you lose your income (or one source of income for married couples), you need to take a good hard look at your [budget](https://www.reddit.com//r/personalfinance/wiki/budgeting). Eliminate everything that's not essential so that it's easier to get through the shutdown unscathed (or less scathed). That means rein in any spending you do on eating out, drinking, other entertainment, and other non-essentials. It might also mean being more frugal with essential expenses like buying different, cheaper groceries, more closely monitoring electricity/gas/oil usage, etc. The wiki section on [losing your job](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/leaving_job#wiki_what_to_do_after_you_are_laid_off_or_fired) may be applicable to this situation.

* **Contact your creditors and let them know you are affected by the shutdown:** Most, if not all, lenders are aware that a shutdown is in progress and that it has effects on real people. If you are furloughed or working without pay, contact your landlord, your mortgage company, your credit card issuers, your student loan servicers, and anyone else to whom you owe money, and inquire about whether they offer anything to aid those affected by the shutdown. Some may offer reduced or zero interest, allow you to miss or postpone a payment with no consequence, or find another way to work with you. Even if not all of your creditors offer some form of assistance, if you can get some it's better than nothing.

* **Contact your bank or credit union about a low-interest loan:** Many banks and credit unions, especially those that deal closely with the federal government and its employees, are offering low or zero interest loans to those affected by the government shutdown. Find out if your bank or credit union is offering any such loans, and what you need to show in order to qualify for one. [Here is a non-exhaustive list of some banks who are offering assistance](https://clark.com/personal-finance-credit/government-shutdown-assistance-financial-help/)

* **Apply for assistance:** There are assistance programs you can take advantage of. Furloughed employees may apply for state unemployment benefits while they are out of work. However, if they receive backpay after the shutdown ends, the unemployment benefits will likely have to be paid back to the state. Unemployment benefits vary by state, so be sure to become familiar with your state's laws if you choose to take advantage of this benefit. /r/legaladvice is a good place to start, and your state unemployment office likely has resources to help you.

* **Find other work:** No, this doesn't mean get an entirely new job. This means find other work to do during the shutdown so that you can maintain an income. The [side income](https://www.reddit.com//r/personalfinance/wiki/sideincome) wiki page has some ideas. Uber/Lyft, delivery services, and other gig economy jobs are good suggestions because they can be done when you choose to, as opposed to trying to get a part-time job which may be difficult when you don't know how long you realistically might work at it. 

#Will the shutdown affect me if I'm not a federal employee or contractor?

It's possible, but most important services should still be carried out by the federal employees who are working without pay. Social Security checks will still be mailed, although replacing SS cards and signing up for benefits will be affected. If you have a need to contact the IRS, it may not be possible until the shutdown is resolved, but the IRS will ~~be recalling employees~~ begin processing tax returns on January 28, even if the government is still shut down, ~~to process tax returns and distribute refunds,~~ so your refund shouldn't be *too* delayed.

Edit: /u/these-things-happens corrected me that there has been no formal announcement setting a date or number of employees that the IRS would recall, only that they will begin processing returns on 1/28.",finance
personalfinance,Any tips for saving (hoping to get a house in next few years)?,"Hello. I've been saving up and trying to get a house in next few years. Really I was wanting to when prices were down, but they've been getting quite high lately and from what I can understand the interest rates are too.

I made $40k last year, which probably sounds bad, but that's actually not that bad for around here. I live at home and pay $200 a month to my parents. Other than that I pay my food, gas, insurance and phone bill.

I'm just wondering if there's ways to save better.

I did splurge this year and got a car for $19k, which may or may not have been a good idea, but I did splurge and did it. I put $10k down and financed the rest, mainly to build more credit. Planning to keep it financed for at least a year and then possibly pay it off sooner than later.

My credit scores are around 740 right now. Right now, I could probably live with a house in the $150k price range. It sounds like a lot because during the low time I could have bought a nice place for about $50k at times. But I wasn't making as much then. But prices (and the interest rate) seem to keep going up (which I thought were supposed to be inversely proportional), and I wonder if in the future I'll have no chance at getting anything decent.

Ideally, I'd like to put a large percentange of the home price down and get the house paid off faster. This leave money for renovations or other things for home or fun plus. I'd also like to be able to get significant savings going for retirement earlier on,

I've only saved about $85k in savings right now. So far I've cut out most dining out which seems will save a decent amount of money. I'm also having to drive much less lately than I was before, so gas bills have been a lot lower.

Any other ideas? Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,Should I use my savings to pay off the rest of my car loan so it is easier to sell (since I will have the title) or try to wait and find someone that is willing to transfer the lien?,"Here's some background info.  A few months after I got my first career job in 2012, I acquired the vehicle brand new on a lease (ticket price was $26K) because I thought I was being smart for saving the $100 a month at the time and could get a new vehicle at the end of the lease.  I was an idiot, however, and went way over my allotted 12,000 miles a year on a 42 month lease (drove around 60,000 by the 36 month mark).  At the end of the lease, I had the choice of either paying a fee for each mile I went over or buy out the lease.  I decided to buy out the lease and get the warranty (I know I know) so my new loan with tax ended up being only like $6000 less than the original ticket price.  I definitely screwed myself.  If I finish paying this loan, I will probably have paid 1.5 times the original price of the vehicle.  Hindsight is 20/20, however, and I have taken this as a huge learning experience for myself and as a ""what not to do"" situation to pass on to other people and my children when they are old enough.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently STILL have about $10,000 left to pay on this vehicle with a $398/month payment at 4% interest rate.  I've decided I'm done with it and want to try to get rid of it to save myself the monthly payment.  My in-laws had an older car they didn't use anymore and have graciously given it to us for free so I wouldn't have to buy another vehicle after selling this one.

&amp;#x200B;

The value of the vehicle is about $10,500 so I'm not completely upside down on it yet, but I'm pretty darn close.  I have posted my car up on Craigslist for about 3 months now with only one serious bite.  In my ad,  I make it very clear that there is still a lien on the vehicle and that we will talk about the financials if they are interested.  One gentleman came to take a look at it and was very interested and was ready to make the deal.  The problem is the bank would not be able to send the title to the person who buys my car even if the loan is satisfied at the bank with the buyer.  The bank will only send the title to me first, which will take roughly 2-4 weeks.  I would then have to contact the buyer or new owner rather, and meet up and sign it over to them.  This requires the new owner to have a lot of faith in me to contact them once I receive the title.  The potential buyer reasonably got spooked and ghosted me after that.

&amp;#x200B;

The alternate solution is if the buyer was planning on taking out a used car loan to buy my vehicle, we could go to the buyer's bank to have them reach out to my bank and transfer the lien.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where my question comes into play.  I have about $15,500 in my savings account.  I could pay the remaining balance of my loan with $10,000 of that (this allows me to have the title in hand for a sale) leaving me with only $5,500 in my savings until I end up selling the car (if I sell the car...).  Or I could continue doing what I'm doing and hope someone is wanting to take out a loan to buy the car and is willing to transfer the lien over to their bank.  I have just recently posted it on CarGurus and FB Marketplace to broaden my potential buyers circle.  I did ask an acquaintance that works at a used car lot how much he's willing to pay for my vehicle and he said $8500.  That's $1500 I'd have to eat, but I could wash my hands of it after that.  At the moment I'm going to continue to try to sell it, but if I don't sell it after like 3 months, I'm going to ask the guy again if he's still willing to buy it for his lot as I'd have paid $1200 in payments by that point and would only have to eat $300 (he of course may offer me less by then though).  What is your take on all of this?  Am I missing another potential solution?  Thanks in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

I'm an idiot and have a lot of money left to pay on my car loan ($10,000 @ $400/mo).  I want to get out from under the loan and am trying to sell the vehicle on Craigslist with little success.  Should I use my savings to pay off the $10,000 left on my loan, leaving me with only about $5,500 left in savings but having the title in hand for an easy sale once another buyer comes along, or should I keep waiting hoping someone will come along that's willing to transfer the loan?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

The interest rate is 3.85% and I have 30 months left of a 66 month term.  Again, yes I screwed myself over big time.  I should have financed the car from the beginning instead of leasing to try and save a little in the beginning.  Ended up losing FAR more in the end.",finance

stocks,"Morning Brief - January 10th, 2019","Any questions, let me know. Anything you'd like for me to cover daily, let me know that too.

&amp;#x200B;

The markets were up again yesterday, that makes four days straight and the longest run since November. There is, however, still a lot of uncertainty that could send us drastically lower.

The big news of the day yesterday was a continuation of President Trump's speech on Tuesday night. The President met with Democrat leaders yesterday to discuss the government closure and the potential for wall funding. Well, that meeting didn't last too long at all after Pelosi told Trump there would be no funding for the wall within 30 days. Should there be no solution today, government employees will miss their first paycheck tomorrow.

**Brexit:** Theresa May appears to be losing control of the government after another blow to her Brexit plan in parliament yesterday. The next vote on the matter is scheduled for Tuesday, and she is expected to lose. The ""hard Brexit"" deadline of March 29th looms.

**The Fed Speaks:** There will be a lot of talking from Federal Reserve members today, and those talks tend to send markets haywire. Several Fed President's from around the country along with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell are scheduled to talk.

**Junk Bonds:** This may sound crazy, but no U.S. company below investment grade has issued bonds since November. This is raising concerns about volatility in the markets.

investing,A silly thought: What if the bulk of the equity drop post-fed were ROTH IRA backdoor conversions?,"The tax changes make the ROTH conversion ultra-desirable right now.  Never has it been so cheap to make the switch, and a direct reward is locked in since the tax-shielded money is already being re-taxed at a lower rate, essentially already enjoying the benefit of traditional IRA, decades early.

Depending on who you invest with, a traditional IRA-&gt;ROTH conversion may require liquidation of the account.  I did mine with Vanguard on Jan 2, and had to convert to cash before buying back in.

Given that the time to make such a conversion, at least in theory, would be at a market low (thereby minimizing your taxes owed), it might make sense that a huge rush of this behavior took place through the leadup to Christmas.

If so, I hope lots of them were caught in cash on Dec 26 and had to buy back in 5% higher than they exited.  

Also, if so, this might suggest that investors are more bullish than we have been assuming.  NAAIM did report a jump to 40% long just before new year's eve, from 0% long prior to Christmas, and 60% long now.  

Obviously the initial phase of the market drop, leading through fed announcement, was fundamentals based, but it looks like everything thereafter may not have been.  We are now higher than we were prior to the fed's announcement in Dec that they were raising rates and didn't care about volatility.  

If so, those calling for a bear market may be early.  Not wrong, IMO, just early.",finance

personalfinance,Properly fill out w-4,"So, I’m 22 and should know this but I don’t. I just recently found out that if you get a big refund back from the irs when you file your taxes it means that you’re paying too much to them throughout the year. I’m late I know. 

I’m pretty sure my coworker is doing his taxes very shadily. I know he’s not married but he has he is. He’s claiming 6 allowances and saying he’s married. And he doesn’t have his own kids or his own place. His deductions for federal taxes says 0. That can’t be right. Idk how he’s getting away with not being audited. But anyway I don’t want to ask him about this bc of how shady he already does his own taxes. 

Could someone tell me how many allowances should be on my w-4 roughly for me to be paying the correct amount in taxes? I don’t have any kids. I live with roommates. And really this is my first real job. Right now I have 2 allowances but I’m guessing it should be more.",finance
personalfinance,33k Student Loan just went to default/collections. Is now 40k. Kinda panicking. Options? (expenses included),"Hi. I’m an idiot. I don’t want this to just turn into a debate about how my loans ended up in collections, so I won’t be disclosing exactly how/why (a little bit of medical stuff, a little bit of life issues, and a dash of stupidity). Here are the facts as they stand.

They went into default in October 18, and a letter saying I had 30 days to respond by mail to dispute the collections and/or get more info. Unfortunately I didn’t receive that letter until about a month and a half later, so I missed that opportunity. Regardless, the debt is real, and I haven’t paid any money to it in forever, so I don’t know what that would have mattered exactly.

After spending 2 weeks calling the Dept of Ed, Professional Collections of Maryland, and Central Portfolio Control Inc, I was finally able to get ahold of someone at Central Portfolio Control  Inc directly. They said my options are a 1 time compromise payment of ~$29,000, or ~$320 a month for the next 20 years (they have a 6.625% interest rate, so with the 20 year plan I’ll ultimately have paid 77k all told). If I choose the compromise payment they will mail me the appropriate paperwork and I will have 90 days to send them a certified payment. If I fail to pay within the 90 days then I can take the Standard 20 year payback. If I do nothing, they can ultimately start garnishing my wages (my state, Connecticut, allows up to 25% wage garnishment I believe).

I’ve done a little research on my own, but I’m not very familiar with collections for Federal School Loans at all, so I don’t know how straight the collections agency was being with me about options. My loans are already consolidated, so that doesn’t apply. They were consolidated into 2 Direct Loans. I’ve read in a few places about something called Loan Rehabilitation, but I don’t know what exactly that is, what is does, and whether or not it is something I need to request directly.

*ANY help would be massively appreciated. I realize I’m probably screwed and those are my only 2 options, but I figured it doesn’t hurt to ask.*

Bonus:

I will be leaving my current full time position that currently pays me a salary of $42,400 a year for a new job on Monday at a corporation that will be paying me $25 an hour for an annualized $48,750. I am currently single (just a gf for now), no dependents, and claim 2 allowances on my W4. Here are my monthly expenses.

**Monthly** 

**+The Basics+**

* Rent: ~$750 (650+50 for heat+electricity; it never breaks 750)

* Car Insurance: $153

* Car Payment (~39 payments left): $267

* School Loan 1 (About 15 years left): $92

* School Loan 2 (About 15 years left): $75

* Internet (my portion of a 3-way split): $23

Total: $1,360

**+Other Monthly+**

* Direct Deposit into Savings for car maintenance: $100

* 31 Day Bus Pass: $63 (old job required car, new job is in city, 
parking too expensive)

* Netflix and Spotify together (for sanity): $24

Total: $187

**+Other Estimates+**

* Groceries: $200 ($50 a week, I’m pretty diligent about this)

* Gas: $60 (2 tanks, I will likely still need to drive places)

Total: $260

Grand Total: $1,807

Defaulted Loan Monthly: $324

**New Grand Total: $2,131**


That should be doable, right? Will probably put a strain on my relationship and make me miserable for the next 15-20 years, but it is possible? Any other recommendations or advice based on my expenses?

**EDIT**

**Credit Info**

My credit overall is pretty shot due to the default, but I'm hoping it's salvageable once I start paying back the loan again. I haven't missed a payment on the other 2 loans in years, if ever, so that helps. I settled a small credit card debt about 4 years ago when my life every so slightly got back on track (it was about 2k, I settled for like 1.4k I believe). I opened up a Savings account and a Secured credit card ($300 deposit/limit) with a local credit union in the summer, and have been using it as I was instructed by them to help rebuild credit (spend ~$150 a month, pay off all but $50 a couple days before the end of the cycle, pay off the $50 a day after the new cycle begins). I've actually already noticed a slight bump in my score.",finance

personalfinance,What was your road to financial literacy?,"Hi everyone, 
How did you guys become finically literate and get on top of your finances? 

My reason for asking is, I’m a math heavy stem grad so personal finance was just a bit of knowledge acquisition and mental math as far as I see it. I’ve tried to pass on some money management skills to my mother and my efforts have mostly failed. She completely  lacks basic budgeting skills, knowledge of how interest rates work(she’ll pay off low interest debt before she pays high interest debt) and a shopping addiction have left her fairly broke. 

Any impact I’ve had on improving her personal finances have largely been fought tooth and nail because she wants to maintain control over how she manages her money. Which leads me to the conclusion that the only way through this is for her to learn these skills on her own but I am no teacher, so any advice on how to send her down the right road would be much appreciated.

Update: thank you all for your suggestions! You’ve been immensely helpful. I saw Dave Ramsey’s name thrown around a lot. I’ll find some other PF gurus/influencers to go along with him  and go on my moms YouTube account and subscribe her to the lot of them. While a bit sneaky it seems like the path with the least conflict and a fairly easy way to start introducing her to the right content. I’ll adjust the difficulty of the material as she progresses.

financialindependence,Brokerage dividends--FIRE foe?,"I'm realizing lately how dividends in my brokerage (post-tax) account interact significantly with possible FIRE options. And I'm not liking what I'm learning. This is definitely an issue for (some) American FIRE people in particular, because it only kicks in when a) you've amassed a sizable amount in a brokerage account, b) are index investing, and c) are trying to be savvy about health insurance tax subsidies, and d) picking a state to live in that is good for taxes (if you're going to bother about that).

When I first got into investing, I naively thought dividends were ""bonus"" money. In other words, your stock price per share would go up (so you now have more money ""on paper""), but you'd also get this *extra* cash money that people who weren't in dividend stocks wouldn't get. But then I found out that when you receive a dividend, the value you receive as the dividend is equal to the value lost from the stock. So you are not getting any extra value. [Note: there may be a case for reinvesting dividends capturing value in the stock at the right time, but I'm totally unclear on that point. Feel free to help me out on this point and I'll add it in.]. When I learned that, dividend investing seemed like a supermarket sale that advertises ""$12/dozen!"" when the item is normally $1.

But then the story got a bit worse.

I learned that when this past year I had a lot of dividends in my Schwab brokerage account. Part of that was due to holding bond funds and a dividend-ETF--which I have now sold--and so I should be able to get the average dividend yield down somewhat from now on, but even if I hold SCHB (a whole market index fund), the dividend yield is above 2%. Given I currently plan to have $500k (and growing) in the account, seems like I'll have no choice with index funds but to accept at least $10k in dividends. At some point, maybe in 10 years or so, I hope it doubles, so I'd have $20k in dividends.

I know long-held stocks' dividends are considered qualified dividends and so I shouldn't pay *federal* tax on them if I stay with low enough income, but there are still a few concerns that make me feel dividends are possibly a problem:

1. ~~**Tax Loss Harvesting.** Sometimes one wants to tax loss harvest prior to holding an investment less than one year. Seems like those are opportunities you don't want to miss--not only for reducing your taxes in this year and carryover to other years, but reducing your MAGI this year and carryover years [can you do that?] for qualifying for Medicaid/AA (see point 3). But if you do this prior to the 1-year+1day date, you will pay tax on those dividends as ""non-qualified"", so at your ordinary income tax. If you are not yet FIRE'd, that might be 12% or even 22% or more--not good.~~ **EDIT:** Whoops, I confused the Long Term Capital Gains period (one year) with this one. As /u/jabotical pointed out, "" the IRS description of the required qualified dividend holding period is that ""You must have held the stock for more than 60 days during the 121-day period that begins 60 days before the ex-dividend date"". So this is much less of an issue, if any.
2. **State tax**. There are only 7 states in which you will pay no income tax on dividends--because there is no state income tax at all, including dividends. Even two ""no income tax"" states, NH and TN, currently have income tax on dividends (5% and 6%, respectively). In my case, in MA, I think at 5.2% tax and the deductions, if at some point I'm lucky enough to have $1mil in brokerage, then $20k in dividends would create about an $800/yr tax bill. Not that much, but that's like a mini close-by vacation a year and should be accounted for in the planning budget, and counts more if you are retiring on a rather lean budget. 
3. **MAGI for Healthcare Costs.** This is a big one, because, unlike selling off stock from your brokerage account to fund your FIRE life in which a big proportion of it might be *basis* (and thus you are just taking your own money, you're not receiving *income*)--so you will pay no taxes on it--dividends count as ordinary income for the purposes of MAGI (the Modified Adjusted Gross Income). The [ACA cliff](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ac8u3l/how_are_you_monitoringcontrolling_your_income_in/) is one of the biggest gotchas out there for post-40 year old FIRE people, so it's got to really hurt if your dividends push you over the cliff. Alternatively, if you are running really lean, or you have serious Roth income, or you feel like living partly off your cash, you could qualify for Medicaid in Medicaid expansion states, which has some serious advantages relative to ACA--particularly if you hit one of those bad luck periods where you would blow through $5k of the deductible out of your own pocket. But you won't qualify if your net dividend income pushes you above the income eligibility cutoff. Dividends are also somewhat unpredictable, so if you don't build in a significant ""margin of error"" with your income, it's very easy to incorrectly predict your yearly income; remember, just going $1 over can cost $4k to $20k in lost ACA subsidies if you're an older couple.
4. **Moving abroad.** I've found that the tax rates on worldwide income in, say, European countries, can often be quite a bit higher than in the U.S. But, if you go abroad and live mostly off your capital gains *and* most of your brokerage account is basis (or let's say 60% of it is basis; and you can ""basis things up"" by tax gain harvesting for some years before moving abroad), you can keep your tax bill to your new country fairly low. But, if you have dividends, that's considered new money and you will have to pay their taxes on it. When I looked into it for Spain, the taxes for dividends are 19%--23%. Given that I've been living in the 12% income bracket for a long time here in the U.S., with generous standard deduction, this feels like a lot. For a $1mil portfolio generating $20k in dividends, that'd be about $4,000 in tax each year. Whereas if I were only drawing from my almost-all-basis portfolio, it would be about $400 in taxes.

Given all this, I'm taking another look at dividends from a FIRE perspective. 

One approach that occurs to me and others is to only invest in companies that don't pay dividends. But then you are losing out massively on diversification of your portfolio. Some have suggested buying Berkshire-Hathwaway as a way of owning a lot of companies (indirectly) but even that isn't very diversified.

Maybe there are other ways?

So, what do you think? Here are some specific questions:

- **What is the highest dividend yield number (for an ETF or mutual fund) you should accept?** Like I said, the two Schwab funds I have right now are like 2.19% and 2.21% or something like that. Is that too high? Moving down to 1.93% would reduce a million dollar portfolio's dividends by ~$2,600  (1mil * (2.21%-1.93%), which, though only like an $80 state tax bill difference might come into play on the other issues I listed.

- Seems like **owning a home**, and therefore having some of what would have been in the brokerage account tied up in the home's value, helps keep the dividends lower. What other places to store value (with growth) could be other alternatives?

**Conclusion:** For now, my plan is to just be aware of this, account for this tax in my budgeting, maybe move to the lowest dividend yield index fund I can find (which may mean moving to Vanguard), and consider moving to a state that doesn't tax dividends. Oh, and discuss it here. :D",finance

personalfinance,"Over 1 YEAR LATER, Bank of America refuses to refund the $8K that a cyber criminal directed me to deposit as part of a real estate scam. Even after I informed them, they did NOTHING","EDIT UPDATE: I got my money back. My congressman just confirmed that they are sending a check for the full amount. NEVER GIVE UP. Thanks for all the crappy advice and judgement!   


  
I saw something similar on here the other day so I'm hoping your fine folks can help. This is a long one, but I'll try to stick to the important details as they pertain to Bank of America.

On September 27, 2017, I made a $8,176 deposit at the local branch of Bank of America, following the instructions of someone who had spoofed my lawyer's email. I was in the process of purchasing a home and needed to provide the remaining balance of the down payment. Someone spoofed my lawyer's email and directed me to make a deposit into a specific account at Bank of America. The reason I fell for it was because we were far in the process of purchasing the house (we were close to closing), had already exchanged dozens of emails, and the spoofer knew details of the conversation I had with my lawyer the night before the email was sent. I suspect that the realtor may have had something to do with it, but I'll let the FBI make that determination. I can discuss those details in another post - this one is about the Bank's negligence.

On October 2, 2017, I spoke to my lawyer and we realized it was a scam. I immediately went to the local Bank of America to report it. I spoke to the Branch Manager, who told me that she had put a temporary hold on the account. I forwarded her the email chain for proof of how I was scammed. She suggested that I go to the police to report it and indicated that I may need a subpoena for the funds. I went directly to the local Police Department to generate a police report. I've also reported this incident to the FBI through the IC3 website multiple times. I never heard from Bank of America, so I gave up on the home that I was trying to purchase. In addition to the stolen funds, I lost additional money that I had already spent on an inspection, appraisal, and a down payment on homeowner's insurance. I almost also lost the down payment on the house that I had already made. The police concluded that I was in fact scammed but were confused about what needed to happen for the bank to return the funds.

Bank of America never so much as sent me a letter indicating that the incident was being investigated or provided me with a case number. I tried to call them to get an update but would always get the run around. I called a few months back, and after about 3 hours of run around and multiple transfers, I spoke to someone in their security team who assured me that funds were still in the account.

Since it was over a year and I had heard nothing, I decided to email the CEO of Bank of America, Brian T. Moynihan, directly and inform him of the issue. I sent him an email on December 17, 2018. That seemed to prompt some action because someone from the bank called me back within hours. The story seems to change every time that I speak to someone from BoA. At first I was told that there's nothing that they can do because it was a cash deposit that I willingly made. I explained that I was misled by a scammer to deposit my money into a specific Bank of America account, and was told that ""no one put a gun to your head"" so I was technically liable. Unsatisfied with this response, I emailed Mr. Moynihan again. This prompted additional new responses, including an email from someone who's title is Executive Advocate, Office of the President, saying that they were looking into the matter. For the first time, I was given a case number. Over the Holiday break, someone from BoA called me to inform me that they were investigating the incident. After the new year, he called again to inform me that the account has been closed and the funds are no longer available, so there's nothing that they can do for me. When I ask why they released the initial freeze that was put on the account while they were still investigating the fraud, I get told that they can't tell me information about others accounts. All they told me is that the funds were withdrawn in October 2017.

Why did they never update me in over a year, even though now they are claiming that the funds were cleared out back in October 2017? Why did they release the initial freeze, after the fraud was reported and they claimed to be investigating? Why does the story continually change? Why did they initially tell me that I need a police subpoena when the police themselves were confused by the requirement? The officer investigating my case told me that police only subpoena evidence if they have an arrest. They had never heard of subpoenaing a bank for stolen funds. The officer even went to the local branch to try to see what he could do, to no avail.

Based on the comments I saw on here the other day, I've taken some additional steps including:

* Filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
* Filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau
* Filing a complaint with the Federal Reserve.
* Detailing the incident to the my local congressman, Elliot Engel. I've already spoken to his office and was assured that they will be reaching out to the bank of my behalf.
* Blasting a warning about Bank of America being a safe space for cyber criminals to funnel money through on their Facebook page, Instagram and Twitter
* Created this post to help spread awareness and gain some attention to my issue.

Please help guys!

TLDR: Bank of America allowed a cyber-criminal to use one of their accounts as a funnel for stolen money, and even after it was reported, they allowed the scammer to withdraw the funds. They mishandled the case and never reached out to me.

personalfinance,Should I invest or pay off my mortgage early?,"Hey all!,

The time to get a mortgage has come. I found a property made a bid, got accepted. The bank says the paperwork is in order too, so all that's left is time, and deciding what type of mortgage should I get: either linear or annuity. 

Currently, I live in the Netherlands, where the interest rate for mortgages is quite low. In my case, the rate will be around 2.1 - 2.2%, and it is tax deductible. In this country, any savings over 20k euros generate tax, and very little interest, so there is no incentive to just leave money at the bank. 

Since the interest rate is so low, and I'm finally in a position where I am getting a decent salary for my industry, I was considering to finally start investing my money, just go for the mortgage where I will pay the smallest sum right now, put some money in a savings account (for traveling and other large expenses), and invest the rest, as it's likely my money will grow faster being invested rather than paying off my mortgage.

cybersecurity,It's Lonely Out Here...,"Do you remember when you first started your journey into cybersecurity? I don't know if this is the same for all of you but for me, I was a lost 14-year-old black boy who barely understood HTML and made websites in WIX. Looking back I was ambitious to become a ""security researcher"" and dip my hands into this new field of technology, so eager to try out new things. As a novice looking for new ways to hone my talents, I often found myself getting into trouble. I would poke around systems and get the attention of the school's IT team who wasn't as ambitious and excited as I was. One day the school got fed up with me and I was suspended for port scanning and slowing down the school's network, but upon my return, the vice principal gave me a choice that I will never forget. He told me I could ""use my powers for good"" and inform him of any vulnerabilities I found on their systems, I was finally given the chance to use my skills productively in a way that helped others. Right?

Now I am 18, I have been forced out of my school, disconnected from my peers and am facing criminal charges for Computer Tampering. So what happened?

What happened is a problem I see A LOT when it comes to youth in cybersecurity and I feel like it needs to be discussed. You see at the time, the vice principal had used his offer as a way for me to incriminate myself through signature despite already serving my punishment and not being of legal age to sign documents. Because I could not be expelled (my IEP protects me), the school used both my mental health and ""technology issues"" as a ""scapegoat"" to get me transferred out to a therapeutic school (which did not end up working out), what's worse is I am facing multiple punishments for doing something as harmless as helping the school after I was ASKED (or tricked) into doing so. All of this didn't help my mental health. I spiraled down a deep depression and then got admitted to an inpatient facility for suicidal ideation twice within a months time only to come back to the police charging me with something the school already punished me for several times.

What's funny is everything seems to be getting worse. Since I have no friends I find it easier to get into trouble. I have picked up really bad habits and stopped eating, I have become skinny and sulky and worst of all lost much of my motivation to ever want to do anything sort of offensive-security work in the future, I feel betrayed.

This is something that I see happening a lot in the cybersecurity community, especially amongst the youth. There is this criminalization for curiosity and it scares hackers away from cybersecurity. There is no reason why I should be sitting here alone at 1:44 PM when I am supposed to be at school interacting with my peers. What is even more frustrating is the fact that my school has actual trouble to worry about such as gangs and drug dealer, not some computer nerd, yet they are still attending high school whereas I am not. I have been punished for doing what I was told and have always wanted to do: ""use my powers for good"", but being good only brought me loneliness. There has to be another way to have gone about this...",technology

To note, we'd like to pay off some cc debt first.

My question is: With a straight cash withdrawal where the 401k resides (Merill Lynch), I'm stuck with a mandatory 20% federal tax withholding fee in addition to the 10% fee because I'm under 59.5. Is it best to roll over the entire amount to a IRA and then withdrawal? Am I just stuck with only a 10% fee and not the 20% federal withholding?

personalfinance,Student Loan Payoff vs. Invest Calculator: thoughts?,"I came across this calculator on studentloanhero, and wanted to ask if it was reliable? https://studentloanhero.com/calculators/student-loan-payoff-vs-invest-calculator/

For example:

**Step One:**

* Loan amount: $300k
* Avg interest rate: 4%
* Current monthly payment: $5525
* Loan term: 5 years

**Step Two:**

* Current investment savings: $6000
* Annual rate of return: 3%
* Current monthly contribution: $3166 (assuming 403b and 457b access, and maxing at $19000 per year each)
* Years of contributions: 20 years

**Step Three:**

* Monthly extra payment(to either loan or investment) : $2000

With the above example, if you payed off your loan with the $2000 monthly extra payment, you would shorten your loan term to 3. 6 years and save $9066 in interest payments.

However if you instead invested that same $2000 monthly for the same 3.6 years, you will have increased the final balance of your investments by $148,287 at the end of 20 years. The interest earned by the end of 20 years is $62287.

So with all of that said, why would anyone want to payoff their loans sooner than needed? I understand that markets go up and down, but according to the calculator, even a 1% return on investments over 20 years earns you $17130. Granted, $17130 20 years from now won't buy you the same amount as $17130 now. 

Am I simply misunderstanding the calculator or not taking into account other factors?",finance

personalfinance,Planning some Repayment Strategies,"To make a very long story short, I ended up with a ton of college debt, a car loan with a ridiculous per month payment, and two forms of credit card debt that don't really charge a lot, but are a nuisance, and not helping my credit score, which is already about a 2 I believe. So I had an idea, and want some opinions on the matter from the more... financially capable individuals on here. Basically, my car can be put on a 6 month pay hold, where they don't charge me for the 6 months, but the interest still accrues (a nightmare, believe me, I've had to do it more than I like). The problem is I still have something I can't pay all that well, because I'm maybe about 100 short of it. So here is what I'm thinking about doing. If I put my car on that 6 month pay hold thing, I can pay off all of my credit debt in that 6 months. I'd still be paying my one student loan, which is about 300 a month. In April, my phone bill is gonna (assumably) drop about 100 bucks or so, due to my phone plan dropping a line off it (another super long story that somehow added up to getting a new line on my phone plan with a phone being cheaper than replacing the broken phone). The thing I see though, is if I wipe out my credit debt, I could begin rebuilding my credit score, by simply using my credit card for gas only, and paying it off as the month ends. This way I'm not carrying a balance, and things are being paid. What do you guys think? Is it worth it? I don't know the interest rate on my car exactly, but I do know that when I was doing interest only payments, it was about 250 bucks a month. This is all assuming that they let me do it anyway, as I'm not sure if I'd be eligible.",finance

personalfinance,Public Sector Employment Vs. Private Sector,"An opportunity for governmental (state, not fed) is likely to present itself to me in the near future.

I'm looking for insight from folks about the pros and cons.

Governmental work pays substantially less, at least 25% less than the private sector. The benefits are substantially better when it comes to PTO, insurance, and retirement benefits.

Government benefits: health insurance for a family is ~$300 a month with a $1500 deductible. PTO is 6 weeks in years 1-4 (2 weeks vacation, 2 weeks personal time, 2 weeks sick time).
Retirement: you contribute 10% and the state contributes 14% (you can choose a defined benefit plan, a defined contribution plan, or hybrid). Guaranteed 2.5% COLA annually. You also don't have mergers or acquisitions threatening your job, and there isn't much restructuring to threaten your position. I also have a flexible start time (between 6:00-9:30) so I can avoid traffic.

Private industry health insurance is expensive, cheapest I've had the option for was ~$850 (covers my husband) with a $5000 deductible, PTO is typically 2 weeks vacation plus 1 week of sick time, or pooled into a PTO bucket. 401k matching varies, typically between 3-6% match. There's much less flexibility with work schedules in my experience/geographic area.

It seems as though the benefits are as valuable as the difference in pay. I can afford to live comfortably enough on the lower salary, though probably wouldn't be able to afford buying a home, but I'm not sure I'd want to. It's definitely possible to stay for the rest of my career, though I'm not sure I'd want to, so I'd not opt for the pension plan.

My wife and I are planning to buy a larger home soon, and we are having a hard time decided if it's a better financial decision to rent out our condo or sell it now. The situation is a little complicated by the differences in our credit scores. Here's a breakdown of the situation:

* Combined, we make around $152k per year before taxes.
* We both have stable jobs, she is active duty military and I work for the military as a civilian.
* My credit score is 774, wife's credit is around 630.
* Wife has roughly $20k in debt (credit cards/car payment) and I have about $12k in debt (student loans).
* I owe $195k on the condo, my realtor estimates we could sell for about $205k, which would just barely have us breaking even.
* Interest rate on the condo is 3.25%
* The condo is in good condition, and within 3 blocks of the beach in my town which makes it very desirable, and likely to sell or rent quickly.
* Should be able to rent it out for roughly $200 more than the mortgage+condo fee.
* Price-range for homes we're looking at buying is around $350k.
* If we sell, I can use my VA loan to buy the new house, if we rent it out, my wife will have to use hers.
* According to Kredit Karma, paying off just $3k of my wife's debt will boost her score by 100 points to \~720.
* We have about $10k in our savings, but are aggressively building it monthly

My concerns with renting it out are that IF we were to have issues with the renters, we will not be able to afford to cover 2 mortgages for longer than a few months. Also, being that it's a condo, there's always the possibility of a special assessment popping up, and depending on the cost might be a significant challenge. Additionally, I am uncertain what type of rate and amount we will qualify for on my wife's VA loan, even if we're able to raise her score by 100 points by then.

My concern with selling it is that we are losing an attractive asset (with a crazy low interest rate) that's likely to grow in value and could eventually be a real passive income earner for us, as well as the fact that we likely will lose our chance to ever be in this proximity to the beach again, as property values here seem to consistently climb every year.

I'm trying to calculate how much money I need to pay back to my parents after they were kind enough to lend me money for a new-to-me car. The problem is, I don't exactly know how to calculate it! We agreed that they would lend me $21,000 using their own personal line of credit, and that I had to pay back the total amount + any fees &amp; interest incurred, and so long as my payments were regular they didn't mind how long it would take.

So my parents withdrew $25,000 (they gave me $21,000, and kept the remaining $4,000 for unrelated reasons). Their line of credit interest rate is 3.95%. I'm pretty sure it's compounding monthly.

This was in March 2018, and I've been making regular payments since they lent me the money (Mar 2018) ($600/mo from Mar - Jul inclusive, and then $1000/mo since August). I also gave them a lump-sum payment of $2,500 in September.

To date (i.e. as of 10 Jan 2019), I've paid back $9,900. I know I still have quite a way to go before I've paid them back completely, but I don't know what the numerical value shall be (and neither do they). Because they had actually pulled out $25,000 instead of just the $21,000 they lent to me, I can't just simply keep paying and paying until their balance is back at $0.

We have two big dogs and are hoping to have a baby next year and our biggest car is just about at capacity with that family size, so I think we'll need something bigger eventually. 

I love Car B (which is ""my"" car) and Car A is a good little city car, but both have needed expensive repairs this year. That combined with our eventual need for something a little bigger has us wondering about trading both cars in on something bigger and newer. Our loans are affordable at our income (roughly $200k combined) and so I'm not worried about a new car loan. We don't need two cars, neither of us commute by car, so that's not a worry. As an additional factor, my husband thinks we would save $150 on insurance each month if we got rid of Car A, but that seems a little high to me.

My question is really, when is the best time to get a new car? Should we wait until we've built up a little more equity? A lot more equity? Or until we've paid them off, bearing in mind that more repairs may come up in that time? We thought about just selling Car A back to the dealer and adding those payments to Car B's loan, but the dealer would only give us $5,000 for Car A and while we could pay back that negative equity it just didn't seem to make sense.

[Edit since I started typing this, I hung up because they were experiencing high call volumes, after 39 minutes].  My average rate is currently 10.875% on these 4 loans.  Sallie Mae is a horrible company, I know.  Don't use them.  I know, but it's too late for me.  They told me that they cannot garnish wages, awesome, but I currently owe them $1,135.56 on these 4 loans.  This is roughly going to be my monthly fee. 

$54,358 is with the Department of Education and these loans are all in forbearance, accruing interest.  With an average rate of around 4%-5%.  Not my priority.  

I have a super high interest rate credit card, around 32%, in a 12% repayment program right now (card is unusable) and it's balance is around $9,455, and it's not even maxed.  

I just moved, so I don't know what my expenses currently are, but I am not having to pay rent for the next 2-3 months. 

I was making around $51,000 per year, but I just accepted a position making a gross salary of $70,000 per year, so I have yet to see a paycheck from it.  I am currently set to contribute 5% of my salary into my Roth 401k and receive a 3% match.  

So far, I have not been able to get any type of refinance personal loans, but that was on my old salary.  I have been denied to every loan I've applied to, including banks, personal loan companies, and credit unions.

personalfinance,"Met with an advisor, and now I’m more confused. Can someone explain in understandable terms?","Warning! Could be long.

Back story. Father passed away in Dec of 16. Had a large sum of money sitting in a checking account. Mom doesn’t know shit about investing (neither do I), so I took the reigns and attempted to try to make something rather than it sit there and do nothing. Main goal is to invest for my mother’s inevitable soon retirement, ie low risk. She’s 67. She will (should) have enough passive income (unrelated to investments) to cover everything even after she retires.

From here, don’t shoot me, but I went to an advisor from a large bank in May of 17. Put 30% into a 7 year annuity and 70% into bonds. Can give % profit of each of 2018 if need be. I know I could have done different shit, but it’s still better than a damn checking account.

Ok, with that being said, I met with him (we’ll call him Bob) today to pretty much just check in. After I bombarded him with questions, he mentioned a “long time care policy” for my mother in the amount of $100,000. The 3 companies he mentioned were Great West Insurance, National Western Life, and Forecare. He kept explaining that it would be for if she ever needed in home care or to be placed in a rest home, and it would make some decent money as well. Rate is based on federal fund rate. Something about the $100,000 being treated as $180,000 and her being able to draw $3600 PER MONTH to be used for in home care or nursing home ONLY and IF that were to happen.

1) Can someone explain what this sort of “long term care policy” actually is? Also, is it worth a damn?

2)Should I look into a life insurance policy for her? The one she has now is for $50k or something like that. Any recommendations or how much it would cost per month? Or, should I just keep reinvesting everything and ignore a life insurance policy?

3)She has free health insurance from my dad being in the army. Doesn’t this take care of a nursing home or in home care if it ever comes to that?

Any help would greatly be appreciated. Thank you in advance.

personalfinance,Error in HSA contributions,"Hello All.  I done effed up.  Will try to be clear and concise to make it easy to understand.

General info. (Don’t think this matters much but just in case it relates)
28yo Male
Single
Salary ~82k

At the start of 2018 I wanted to enroll in an HSA.    I didn’t accrue a large amount of medical expenses in 2017 and didn’t like that my employer didn’t provide health care saving options that didn’t roll over.  So I enrolled in my employer’s high deductible insurance plan (I believe it was 2000 dollar deductible, can confirm).

I then opened my own HSA with HSA Bank.  I briefly read through their info and they asked me to confirm my deductible before enrolling.  After that all I had to do was have my employer direct deposit a portion of my paycheck into the account ($75 per deposit paid biweekly).  My employer puts post tax income into the account,  they are just given an account number and routing to execute the transfer,  so payroll only thinks it’s a bank account.  I was planning on correcting the tax benefit in my tax return.  

This is the screw up.  Since I didn’t have a great savings account at the time, I didn’t want to have no monies available for medical expenses.  so I also enrolled in my employer sponsored FSA ($600).  Since this was employer sponsored,  that portion of my paycheck used to contribute to FSA is pre tax.

That job ends on Dec 31st 2018 and I just started a new position on Jan 7th 2019.  As I’m reviewing my health care options,  I learn that for an HSA, you not only must have a high deductible plan,  BUT you cannot be enrolled in an FSA or HRA unless it is limited to vision and dental (mine was full medical option FSA).

Since my contributions were post tax,  I don’t believe I have reaped any illegal tax benefits.  But I’m not sure how to correct this issue.  I need to confirm with HR, but my new employer has high deductible plans,  but all are auto enrolled in employer sponsored HRA which we can earn money into by doing healthy life choices.  (Up to $500.  Pretty nice perk.  This does roll over if we don’t consume it).  Since my new employer always provides the HRA, I don’t believe I can contribute to the HSA this year either.

So right now I will plan to stop contributions,  but I’m not sure how to draft the 2018 tax return.   Especially since the income was deposited post tax.  The account also has small monthly fees unless you reach a certain threshold ($5k I believe). Since I have not reached that threshold,  I would like to remove those funds, but I’m not sure what that entails.  Since it is post tax income, I feel like I should be able to remove without penalty but I can’t seem to find a clear answer. 

Anyone have good answers or resources for help.",finance

personalfinance,HELOC on a U.S. investment property to buy an overseas property?,"I have a house in the U.S. There is no lien on the house. The mortgage is all paid off. I have no debts at all anywhere. And my credit score is well over 800. I also have some cash, but not enough to buy a new house with.

I live in Tokyo and want to buy the house I have rented the past 11 years. Timing is somewhat critical, because the elderly landlady is not in the best of health and the family wants to sell sooner rather than later. The selling price is extremely good, plus there is a vacant first floor I can use for storage or fix up and rent out for extra income.

While I might try to apply for a bank loan here (interest rates are very low), I'm just worried about how long it will take, or how much extra difficulty that would be because I'm a U.S. citizen, though I have permanent residency in Japan. So I want a back up plan.

I inquired with the bank in the U.S. that held the previous mortgage on my house, but they don't do HELOCs on investment properties. That's what it is now since I'm renting it out while I live overseas.

I understand some place do such HELOCs. I started filling out a form at [lendingtree.com](https://lendingtree.com/) , but didn't finish the form when they started asking for social security number info. I don't know enough about that site, and I didn't want to start getting sales calls.

My U.S. bank said they would do a ""cash out"" or something like that, instead of a HELOC, but I think that would be time-consuming and also probably involve closing costs.

I just want to do something quick, to borrow about 50% of the value of my U.S. house, plus use cash I have and buy my house in Japan as soon as possible.

One other consideration is that I am expecting some money over the next few years that will pay back the HELOC at that time. So I'm talking about a relatively short-term loan.

What are good places from which to get HELOCs on investment properties, and does this sound like a reasonable approach?",finance
personalfinance,"After researching the Debt Snowball and Debt Avalanche method, I'm having trouble choosing which is better for our situation. Help appreciated, details below:","We currently owe $5540 on two CCs, $15k on a car, and ~$17k in student loans. My income is around $4000/mo after taxes, health insurance, and retirement. 

Largest interest rate: CC

Lowest balance: CC

Highest monthly payments: Car ($362/mo)

My wife and I have no kids, and we've been saving 10% of my income ($400) for a couple months. Currently have a $1700 emergency fund, hoping to make it $2000 by February. I always make minimum payments each month, and often pay extra when I can; we almost never eat out anymore.

My question is this: my wife got a part time job this week and since we've been living okay on my paycheck, we have decided to save every dollar she makes. As a result, we've decided to take the $400 from above (our previous monthly savings) and apply it to our debts. Towards which of our 3 debts do I use that money first? The CC, car, or student loans? I figure with the minimum CC payments in addition to this 400 (39+59+400=498) we can be free from CC debt by the end of the year. It's a nice victory and it's what we're leaning towards, but is that our best option? Should we pay the car loan first and use the extra $362 towards other debts in 19-20 months from now?

personalfinance,"Moving between companies with likely moving repayment, a few questions","Long time lurker on reddit and this sub specifically. Anyway,  I moved locations within my company a little over 1.5 years ago between major cities with a 2 year moving lump some repayment obligation if I leave.  I recently was recruited/offered a  job paying close to 38% more, with promotion, payed OT, and the experience will likely come with great exit opportunities down the road. During this time I had to weigh the risk of my current employer asking for the moving expenses to be reimbursed.  Long story short, I decided it was worth the risk. The new employer essentially offered 10k sign on to help, so I accepted.

I am so far leaving on an extremely positive note, with several managers verbally offering me positions if I ever wanted to go back. Lunches with coworkers throughout the last week and half.  An ""Office"" jello computer mouse prank.  Generally its been a fun last couple weeks!

HR....got to love them....has come through at basically the last second to ask for the money back on my final day.  Ugh, I don't want to complain but these guys had full notice...just frustrating. I am going to stall tomorrow and approach them next week with a proposition to prorate the amount based on the ridiculous amount of work I did for them. I anticipate they will tell me no, in which case I will pay the full amount (\~20k).

At this point I am trying to understand the tax implications...its confusing.  The taxes involved during the moving (5.5k state and federal) are to be payed back as part of the agreement (bundled in that 20k). 1500$ of social security and medicaid, are NOT required to be payed back. These moving benefits stretched between 2017 and 2018, aka two years of filings impacted.  I have done some preliminary research on this, and I believe I would get state/fed back from the government through an overpayment of wages form.  If this gets too complicated, I will seek help with a tax professional.  But I thought I would ask reddit for some background first.  My questions

1. Should I be asking me current employer for receipts on everything, including moving expense payed to me directly?
2. I have an itemized excel sheet, is this enough for the IRS?
3. Anyone go through this before, were you able to negotiate a lower amount with your employer?

personalfinance,Looking for advice on how to buy a house. My GF and I want to get married but want to buy a house first.,"I’d like to buy a house but my credit is not great. I make decent money. 90k but that is a recent development. My GF who I plan on marrying has great credit. We would both be first time home buyers. Would it be better for her to buy the house and later add me to the title? Problem is I make double what she does.  What’s the quickest way to buy a house? Currently renting now and can’t afford to pay off debt, down payment for a house and rent without waiting many years. Are there first time home buyer programs?

My thinking was ride my GFs credit so we could get in a starter house and split the deposit. She could add me to the title once I got a better credit score. I prob have 15-20k in bad debt.  Once I pay off my truck in 2 years I could apply the payment down on my debt in collections . Or take a loan for the debt and pay all at once. I would have a paid off truck and some equity in the house. (I think that’s how equity works) I would be the one making higher payments on the mortgage every month. Prob 70\30. 

The other solution was to pay off the truck in 2 years with extra payments then start hacking away at debt in collections to get my credit to 680 once I have no truck payment. I just don’t know how much hacking that would take to get there. Need to go talk to my loan officer.  I was just trying to do something at the end of my lease in 9 months. 

Starter homes (Move in ready 2 bed/ 2 bath) 350k to 450k. There is a 10 yr old 2 story duplex down the street selling for 1.1million. 550k per side. Small lot across from a HS. Gives you an idea of what homes are selling for in my area. Which I am aware I can not afford on my first home. 

Edit: My conclusion from all the great advice and to answer some questions. 

I had just signed a lease for a year and her lease was up. She moved in with me for 2 months until she found a place she liked. We actually got along great it was just a small place for two, so we are waiting to upsize to a bigger place. Basically this this post is to get advice to see if buying a house together when our leases are up is even doable. The houses in my area are expensive. But that number is “move in ready” homes. I am confident we could find something closer to $250k-$300k that would need some work. Or even less. Depending on how much we wanted to take on. Moving out of city limits is a possibility or even just on the outskirts. She works for the University so bus line is important.  (TBH We have no idea what we could afford for a mortgage this is our 1st time) 

Our initial plan is to rent a home together for a year max two and save. We think our priority should be to buy a house together before we spend money on a wedding and (me on an engagement ring) get married. Everything is on the table now so I am just trying to sort it out. My past is the past and now it’s time to start owning up and take care of business so we can start a family.  

1 I think go talk to a loan officer or financial planner and my credit union. 
2 when time comes go talk to a family attorney lawyer to sort out benefits of being married first when buying a home and get their advice. 

I think having a low budget wedding is doable and she is on board with that decision.  Maybe once I pay my truck off then put money away for a ring. In the mean time start paying off any debts in collections.  Starting with higher interest rate first. I just don’t want to start stirring up collectors if it doesn’t help my credit. (Step 1)

This advice really helped thank you.  I’m open to more positive suggestions on this new but great time in our lives.",finance

However, the Traditional IRA was not available to be converted right away. I tried several times unsuccessfully and then I called Vanguard about this. Vanguard said it was normal due to waiting for the funds to clear from my bank, and to just wait a few more days. 

On 1/9/19 the funds cleared, and I made the Roth Conversion of $6000. The transaction was activated on 1/10/19.

personalfinance,Impact of a pension on the Traditional vs. Roth debate?,"Hi all - I've been learning a lot about the traditional vs. Roth IRA debate in the past few days reading posts and engaging in discussions here on this subreddit. Thanks!

I'm a 31y/o federal employee with a tenured, career position and intend to work until retirement (which, based on when I started at age 23, will be age 50). I will have a federal pension at that point. I'll probably do another career after that, so I don't intend to pull the pension or get into retirement savings (at 59.5) until much later into my 60s.

How does that ""guaranteed"" pension factor into my decision-making about traditional vs. Roth retirement? I currently max out my Roth TSP and a Roth IRA each year. Since I started with the gov't at age 23, I was doing Roth contributions as soon as I could. Today, my salary has nearly doubled (I'm close to 6 figures) since I started and from now on won't increase too much more (maybe +$15-20k) until retirement (yay government).

Am I at the point where I should start shifting contributions over to traditional IRA and traditional TSP? How does that pension weigh into my estimation of my tax bracket at retirement?

Received my first check for 2019 and noticed it was about 50 bucks bigger than my last 2018 check. The difference seems to be tied to me changing my tax status (W4) from Single with 1 Allowance to Married with 1 Allowance. This change caused my Federal Withholding to drop the amount of the pay difference. 


Is this normal with this W4 change? I'm trying to avoid paying the Feds, but don't really care about getting a big return.",finance

This amount does not include CC payments (which I have only been able to afford the minimum).  I have also completed the application process for law school and will be enrolling in the fall. I will likely receive scholarship money and some federal money but will most likely have to take out loans for the remainder of the balance and living expenses.

I have tried getting loans from some banks in town but none have been able to offer me a personal loan. I have found some online loan companies such as Marcus and Lending Club that will offer me loans for $8,000 at around 20% interest and $300 monthly payment. My question is if this is the rout I need to go. Making only minimums on my cards will take decades to pay off and cost me a lot of money. I am also worried that when starting law school I will not have monthly income to pay the loan or even my minimums unless I can include them as a Monthly living expense and pay them with student loans. Or would I be best off trying to make as much money in the next 7 months and put it all towards my cards without a debt consolidation loan?

When doing so, I guess they took additional allowances - more so than they should have.

Long story short, in June  2018 I was told to provide receipts, etc. for allowances, or to pay taxes owed.  I ended up paying taxes owed - over $2k additional for federal.

Shortly after, in Oct 2018, I received a bill stating I owed additional state taxes.  I paid.

I chalked all this up to a learning experience and life lesson - that if it seems too good to be true, it is.

I have since received another bill stating I owe additional state taxes and interest due to an adjustment that was made by the IRS.  On the new bill, it shows my AGI at approx $10,000 higher than it was on my first state tax bill.

Do I have any recourse here?  Is there ever any conversation that can take place with the dept. of revenue to negotiate down the amount owed?  Remove the interest?

---

*Longer Version*

Hello PF,

Wanting to get your thoughts on a few options I’ve got coming up in the next month or so.  I’m planning on selling my house and buying another sometime in the next few months, but depends heavily on the right place to buy coming on the market at the right time.  This could stretch into the summer.  Credit is already good to very good.  

I’ve been saving some money for a while with the intent of sending a lump sum payment to pay off my private student loan, serviced by Navient.  This savings has been my larger emergency fund and is currently earning 2.25%.  I do have a separate, smaller emergency fund in a short term investment account.  

With tax season coming up, I would like to take advantage of the tax write off for Traditional IRA contribution this year up to the amount of my tax refund.  From preliminary tax calculations with no IRA contribution my refund should be about $2,900, but if I contribute that amount to my Traditional IRA the refund goes up to $3,300 because of the tax benefit.  Free $400 seems like a no brainer, and this could be the last year that I’m eligible for this tax write-off due to income phase out in the future (it’s already going to be partially phased out this year for anything above that contribution amount).

Option 1: Hold off on payoff of student loan – make IRA contribution and wait for refund to essentially reimburse savings account sometime in April (can’t file until mid-March).

Option 2: Pay off student loan in Feb - $6,200 and 8.55% variable interest rate, increasing ~0.22% each quarter.  Minimum payments are $80-100/month but I’ve been paying $600+/month.

Option 3: Keep saving and hold money for unexpected necessary cash outlays during the home buying process and pay off student loan from the proceeds of the sale of my house.

Option 4: Pay off Credit Card - ~$7,000 with 0% interest until October then increases to 9.9%.  Minimum payment ~$75 but I’m paying ~$200/month.  Will be paid in full with proceeds from sale of house, but if paid off immediately could bump credit score by another 20 points which could help with home purchase.

I have a feeling I need to go with a combination of Options 3 &amp; 1, letting the other two get sorted out during house transactions, but I really hate Navient and want them out of my life.  Thoughts and advice appreciated.  Can add more info as needed.",finance

personalfinance,Federal Perkins loan from 2012 recently marked delinquent,"I recently just noticed a very large drop in my credit score and came to find out that a Federal Perkins loan I had taken out in 2012 was marked as delinquent.

This loan had a 9-month grace period after becoming less than a half-time student. I stopped being half-time at the end of the Fall 2017 semester so I believe the loan was deferred.

The problem is that I had never received communication that this loan was late, they were sending mail to an old address as well as my old student email account, which I haven't used in years. If I had received a phone call I would have been all over making the required payments.

Since I failed to update my account details and this is potentially my fault, do I have any recourse here? Is there anyway I can be ""forgiven"" for the late payments and have it removed from my account? I'll be looking into purchasing property within the next couple of years and I am afraid this will seriously hurt my ability to do this. My credit score went from ~780 down to ~690.

Any suggestions or help here would be greatly appreciated.

Any individual or family whose adjusted gross income for 2018 was $66,000 or less can find at least one Free File software product they can use. Often, taxpayers are eligible for multiple products. The income limitation means that 100 million taxpayers – 70 percent – are eligible to use Free File.

Workers, families with children, first-time filers and seniors who meet the income criteria are all eligible for Free File. The software supports all the new tax law changes as well as long-time benefits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. While most products have a set of eligibility requirements, 10 Free File partners have a special offer for active duty military personnel by making their sole eligibility criteria an income of $66,000 or less.

IRS Free File is all that’s needed for residents of Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and Wyoming where there is no state income tax. Some Free File partners offer free federal and free state return preparation. Some states have their own Free File program.

What does this mean for me?,"I was just rehired about 8 weeks ago at my current job after leaving it earlier in 2018 to finish school and work at a different job that was more flexible with their hours. Upon graduating back in Mid-October, along with my then current job coming to a close (it was for a professional baseball team, so when the season ended, my time there ended), I needed a source of income while I sorted things out in life. So I contacted my old job and they were more than happy to bring me back on board.

About a month after being rehired, I started to notice that my checks were higher than usual. I didn't think too much of it at the time, since there was a weekly $200 retention bonus for not being late. But when other coworkers started discussing how much they made from a week with one holiday day-off pay (I am currently inelligible for it, have not worked the required amount of time to receive that benefit), I noticed I was closer to their paycheck than I should be. So I went online to check things out.

Sure enough, Federal tax was not being withheld from my paycheck, even though it used to be only a few months before when I last worked for them. I dug a little deeper and also saw that on my W4, the amount of Allowences I was claiming was at 98, instead of 0. I have always claimed ""Single and 0"" on my tax forms, so I have no idea where this came from.

What are the steps to take here to get things situated? I have contacted the HR department and left a message, but as of this post they have not returned my call yet. I will be going into work early, if they do not get back to me soon,

personalfinance,Deciding whether or not to recast a loan,"My wife and I are building a custom home. We have a construction-permanent loan, which means when construction is complete the loan converts into a standard 30 year mortgage. Until the home is complete we are making interest-only payments. The loan is for $500,000 and our interest rate is 4.625%. We have the option to recast the loan to reduce our monthly mortgage payments. My wife and I currently both work, but my wife will be stopping work in March/April to prepare for our new baby. My wife intends to go back to work in August or September. When my wife stops working we will have ~$200k in savings (2% interest right now). Our mortgage without recasting is estimated to be $3500 a month including principal, interest, and escrow. It will likely be slightly less, as the bank did not include the cost of insurance after the construction portion of the insurance is removed (reduces by about 300-400 per year).

We can recast by making an additional down payment of $40,000. This would reduce our mortgage by ~$208 per month and about $75,000 over the life of the loan. This will leave us with ~$160,000 in savings. My wife will be returning to work as an attorney. We are currently unsure what her take-home pay will be, but it will be at least 1.5-2 times what she makes today. As of today, and hopefully when she goes back to work, we put the entirety of her paycheck into savings.

Why am I unsure whether to do this? New born baby bills. Baby comes in late April, right around when our house MIGHT be done. We have good insurance but I can still expect to be out anywhere from $2200 to $10,000 between our deductible and hospital bills. We also need to furnish our new house. We have a lot of furniture we are taking from our current rental house, but I expect to spend 4-10,000 over the first year buying bedroom, living, kitchen, and dining room furniture (immediate needs). Reduced income due to my wife being home with our son. I have worked out in a spreadsheet that we can afford our mortgage, current bills, and projected utilities and still save ~$300 per month some of which I intend to throw at the mortgage. I have considered reducing my 401k contributions for the time while my wife is home to help our available non-savings cash. I would not be reducing past the point where my company vests. We are also going a little above our budget for a few things in the house, adding an additional $3,000-4,000 to the total cost of the home. This amount will not come out of our savings; rather it will just be money not saved from my take-home pay between now and when the house is complete sometime between May and June.

So, should I spend the extra $40k? If it wasn't clear, I am super paranoid about touching our savings.",finance

I'll be honest I didn't fully understand the agreements going on when my loans passed from the dept of education to Sallie Mae (which became Navient for federal loans).",finance
personalfinance,"higher income in 2018, but paid less federal tax than 2017. how did that happen?","Hi everyone,

Question regarding federal taxes withheld. As the title of my post suggests, I made more money in 2018 than in 2017 (\~$13k more in 2018 if that's helpful to know), yet somehow paid $400 less in federal taxes in 2018. Nothing changed in 2018 as it relates to my filing status (single w/ 0 allowances elected).

Luckily I do not owe money for 2018 and will still get a refund, but my refund this year will be considerably less than last year. I just received a raise that will become effective  Jan 1 onward and now I'm worried that next year I'll have the same issue and might even end up owing money. 

Any ideas why this happened? Please let me know if there's any additional info I can provide that would be helpful.

Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,What do I need to know about unemployment?,"Long story short I work a seasonal part time. For two-three months a year I can go home with 400+ a week, average about 500 a week. But for the better part of the year especially winter months I go home with 150 a week, if that (could go on for weeks without a call). 

I was told by a coworker that I should collect unemployment because it covers our seasonal job (and apparently that’s what everyone does). But I’m skeptical because: 

a) I’m not sure how it’ll affect my credit score and my credit cards

b) I’m not sure how it will affect the tax filing process and the tax return

Secondly, just like the previous years, you cannot claim the standard deduction (which has been essentially doubled to $12,000) unless you are from India and can claim tax treaty benefits.

personalfinance,My W-4 was incorrect or read incorrectly (NYS),"First, I hope this is the right subreddit - and hope I can get some guidance!

I have been with this company for two years, but they transferred me to another store last year and had me fill out another W-4 as it's technically under a different name (same parent company though).

I *thought* I filled it out correctly, trying to claim only myself as a dependent (in the past I claimed ""0"" on everything, but this year has proven difficult times and decided to take the risk of not being taxes quite enough).

Regardless of whether or not the form is right (I will put line by line what I entered at the end of this), my taxes are wrong. I was put in as having three dependents, both federal and state (I'm not sure if that is worded right). Obviously, I do not have three dependents and just realizing now *really sucks* because it's been an entire year that I've been taxed (or really, **not taxed**) this way.

I brought it up to our manager right away who suggested that the form was filled out incorrectly and that they are meant to be deceiving, and to go to H&amp;R Block when I file to see if they can guide me in any way.

I'm totally freaked out - I'm broke as it is and I'm not sure if there is any way for me to find out a ballpark of *how much I will owe back* so I could take a loan out and pay it or what - - last year when I claimed nothing I *still ended up owing NYS over $300*.

If anyone has an advice or guidance... I'd love to hear it.

TL;DR: W-4 was input as having 2 dependents on accident when I do not, did not notice it the entire year until now (right before taxes are filed). Not sure how to get a ballpark on what I will owe to plan accordingly or what to do in this situation.



For anyone interested on how I filled out the W-4....

A. Enter 1 for yourself if no one can claim you as a dependent. **[1]**

B. Enter 1 if **you're single and only have one job**; you're married, only have one job and your spouse does not work; or your wages from a second job or your spouse's wages (or the total of both) are $1500 or less. **[1]**

C. Enter 1 for your spouse. But, you may choose to enter 0 if you are married and have either a working spouse or more than one job. (Entering 0 may help you avoid having too little tax withheld.) **[0]**

D. *Enter the number of dependents (other than yourself or your spouse) you will claim on your tax return.*  **[0]**

E. Enter 1 if you will file as head of household* on your tax return. (See conditions under ""head of housebold"" below.) **[1]**

F. Enter 1 if you have at least $2,000 of child or dependent care expenses for which you plan to claim a credit. **[0]**

G. Child tax credit. If your total income will be less than $70,000 ($100,00 if married) enter 2 for each eligible child; then less 1 if you have two to four eligible children or less 2 if you have five or more eligible children.
If your total j come will be between $70,000 and $84,000 ($100,000 and $119,000 if married) enter 1 for each eligible child. **[0]**

H. Add lines A through G and enter here. (Note: this may be different from the number of exemptions you claim on your tax return.) **[3]**

**I am single, so I marked single on the W-4.**

1-4 is name, address etc 

5. Total the number of allowances you are claiming from line H above. **[3]**",finance

My student loans total $15,700 at an interest rate of 4.875%.

personalfinance,Saving and building wealth - 25 year old broke Indian,"As the title suggests, I am really struggling to get a lid on my finances, regardless of how much I try. After two years of failed attempts, I've decided to reach out on here. All figures are in Indian Rupees

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 25 and I work in a small 100 person company in Pune, India. Some key financial details:

&amp;#x200B;

\- I earn 35k INR a month

\- I have a loan payment of 15k every month for my education loan. While I can pay more, I'm trying to save. Since this is a 0% loan, I'm not bothered about pumping more than the committed instalment amount

\- I live with my parents and pay a rent of 3k every month. My expenditure (doctors, eating out, fuel and the like) amount to 8k

\- I have a term insurance policy, whose premium is around 20k a year. I need to buy a health insurance policy which I plan to do in Feb. Likely to cost me 16k for 5 million. 

\- I have now (since Jan) started saving 10k a month. However, that is all I have.

\- My parents are broke and fiscally inept, and its only a matter of time before I start paying their bills

I have no idea how to build my wealth. Saving 10k a month, so around a third of my salary seems like nothing - especially keeping in mind inflation and any sudden expenses that may come up. I don't know anything about investments, and am likely to lose out on income tax since I still haven't managed to understand taxation. 

I really enjoy my job, but the income growth every appraisal is around 15%. Since no one in my family has reached this level, they really have been unable to guide me on whether this is a good number or not.

Recently, two things I have done are as follows:

\- Moved all my payments to a credit card. This way, I earn more points, and the money in my account stays for longer and draws a greater interest rate. I am very disciplined about my card payments, and make a full payment every month. I have a 750+ credit score

\-  I have moved my loan payments to the end of the month with the same intention of keeping more money in my account to draw upon compound interest. However, I'm not sure how much of a difference this change will make. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I am in a really difficult situation financially. I don't have an emergency fund, nor any investments. I don't have health insurance, which I feel is a necessity but I don't know if I should spend the 16k on it.

&amp;#x200B;

CryptoMarkets,The monetary system for a successful and sustainable future,"Kinetically Charged Yield Bearing Asset Based Monetary System of Shared Economic Wealth

[In the same way our sun unconditionally delivers an indiscriminate share of energy to planet Earth that stimulates life, we present a comparative energy system to stimulate the movement of money, assets and hence overall commerce and economic activity in a fair, honest and rewarding process. It is an entirely new monetary system, which is based on movement, kinetics and velocity. We name the system Kinesis.](https://kinesis.money/en/)

The Kinesis system is an evolutionary step beyond any monetary system available in the world today. It enhances money as both a store of value and a medium of exchange, and has been developed for the benefit of all. Core to the mechanics of the system is the perpetual incentive and thus stimulus for money velocity. Outside capital is attracted into Kinesis via a highly attractive risk/return ratio and then put into highly stimulated movement, promoting commerce and economic activity. This is achieved through structuring money to represent 100% allocated title of an asset and then attaching a unique multifaceted yield system that fairly shares the wealth generated by the system according to participation and money velocity.

Aside from offering the greatest store of value and striving to provide the most efficient medium of exchange, Kinesis is a monetary system focused on: minimising risk; maximising return; stimulating velocity and maximising the rate of adoption. 

Kinesis defeats Gresham’s Law of Money that asserts “bad money drives out good”, by highly incentivising “good money” to circulate and be utilised as an effective medium of exchange. Someone who values money over other money is inclined to hoard it and not use it as a payment currency, but rather use the less valued currency for payments. This model has been broken in the Kinesis system as the reward for using the valued currency is so tremendously strong.

The primary currency chosen for the Kinesis monetary system is a kinetically charged physical gold based currency. Gold being the greatest store of value, indestructible in every sense, physically rare in quantity and has been appreciated by human civilisation as money for longer than anything else. It is the money created by our universe and not by people. It is created by a rare cosmic event of two neutron stars colliding, so rare that the first time this event was witnessed by humankind was 17 August 2017. Hold gold in your hands and you can feel its energy. It is the colour of stars, it is the money of the universe. Gold is the undisputed champion of fair, honest and sustainable money. Put allocated gold on a kinetically charged decentralised rail system and you have a very special monetary system. We believe this is what we have achieved, and a lot more.

[The Kinesis system can be overlaid on top of anything that can be standardised, traded and stored as value. Accordingly, we are developing a kinetically charged digital currency suite with allocated title of bullion, fiat bank notes, cryptocurrencies and other assets that are physically and digitally securely stored in our allocated Kinesis banking and asset management system. By attaching a yield to digital currencies, risk/return ratios can be forecasted and virtually all currency and investment asset markets can be targeted and infiltrated. As such, over time we plan for more currencies and assets to be added, ultimately infiltrating more markets spread across the world.](https://kinesis.money/en/)

Kinesis will attract capital from:

Cryptocurrency markets – currently little to no yield
The gold and silver markets – currently little to no yield
Fiat currency markets – low to negative yield via debt based interest rates
Investment asset markets – comparatively low yields for stock market and property investment
Ultimately, if someone can get the same asset at the same price, but with significantly lower risk and higher return, it makes little sense for them to not choose the asset with the better risk/return ratio, particularly when significant returns are on offer. As the Kinesis monetary system is one that allocates title directly to the ultimate beneficial owner, where banks conversely hold legal title of their customer deposits and put those deposits at risk, the Kinesis system is in fact much less risky and with much greater return than legacy alternatives. With global low to negative interest rates, bail-in provisions, depositors’ insurance being removed, and with banks holding legal title to their customer deposits, it makes no logical investment sense to choose risk and nil-to-negative return over the alternative Kinesis system with negligible risk and high return. In comparison to legacy fiat money and fractional banking systems, Kinesis seems too good to be true, but it isn’t. Once clearly understood, Kinesis will lead a highly disruptive paradigm shift in money.

Kinesis has taken the very best properties of both old-world money and new-world innovation and combined them together to power banking and commerce in a new fair, inclusive and incentivised way. The result is something extraordinarily powerful that will change the way we all view money forever.

The primary elements of Kinesis are: 

Gold &amp; Silver - The primary currencies offering allocated 1:1 title to physical gold &amp; silver – the greatest stable and definable stores of value for use in commercial and private transactions and investment.
Yield - A perpetually recurring yield generated from economic activity, not from debt based interest like fiat currency – providing definable value via Net Present Value (NPV) calculations for use in commercial, institutional and retail investment.
Cryptocurrency technology – can only be enhanced.
Blockchain peer-to-peer decentralised distributed ledger technology – blockchain may become obsolete, but distributed ledger technology can only be enhanced.
Kinesis can never be destroyed as these elements will never go away, never be valueless and can only be enhanced. Nothing can take away intrinsic asset value and the value of future cash flows, and technology will only ever be enhanced. Gold and silver have survived the greatest test of all, time, and so too will Kinesis. 

Other cryptocurrencies with value determined by the anonymous decentralised blockchain payment capabilities and their controlled supply scarcity are all at risk of losing value as their initial founding value proposition is diluted by others coming into the market with enhanced solutions. This is evidenced by Bitcoins’ dominance continuing to fall and has been witnessed in many other industries and markets throughout history as competitors rise.

A major contributing factor to the volatility in cryptocurrencies is that they are impossible to value. By intrinsically backing a currency, hence back-stopping the value and defining the risk, and then placing a yield on it, hence defining the return and providing superior value, then a currency which is safe, stable and rewarding is created with a highly attractive investment risk/return ratio attached. This form of currency has necessary real-world application in both commerce and private transactions, along with attracting capital from institutional and retail investors and savers.

This is not just a currency, this is a new parallel monetary system to sit alongside but integrated into the legacy problematic centrally controlled fiat and fractional monetary and banking systems. Kinesis is the undeniable superior alternative.

This model is highly revolutionary alone, however to take it the next step further, already in place is a highly disruptive retail and institutional commercialisation strategy with unique distribution and committed adoption from day one of launch. Pre-existing investment commitments are in place for the Kinesis currency suite which will surpass the largest ICO to date by a significant multitude. Kinesis is being developed and being brought to launch by a consortium of industry leading organisations in the precious metal trading, mining, refining, exchange, technology, blockchain, mobile banking, vaulting, postal system and marketing spheres. From launch the system will have extensive institutional and retail distribution, integration, liquidity and adoption. Our liquidity, which will be provided by professional bullion market participants and others, will enable billions of dollars of value to efficiently enter and exit the market. Direct and indirect integrations will provide for immediate adoption into hundreds of millions of users.

With the evolution of blockchain, cryptocurrencies and mobile devices, the people of the world have been presented with a profound opportunity. It’s an opportunity to apply empowering creativity to money and be part of a person-centric revolution. We have now been enabled to adopt and support a system that individually and collectively benefits us all based upon nothing more than participation. This system combines new world decentralised technology with the oldest, fairest and most sustainable form of money, to empower and serve the interests of us all equally and capitalistically.",cryptocurrency

Bought new house for $355,000 and put 5% cash down on it. 
Going to sell townhouse and expect to profit around $125,000 when all is said and done.  
Out of that $125,000 i need to keep around $25,000 reserved in case i need to pay back the 401k loan that i took out for the down payment on the house.   
My PMI will be $84 per month for the next 10 years and I would need to make a lump payment of around $53,000 to recast my loan to get rid of the PMI.  
I would like to add another bathroom to the new house and add an attached garage, is it worth it to not pay down my loan and continue to pay the PMI and use that money towards these renovations and think of it as a loan and the PMI as the interest on the loan?  How would i calculate what interest rate that would equate to?  Or would it make better financial sense to recast the mortgage and get rid of the PMI and hold off on the renovations i want to do, or take out a HELOC after recasting the mortgage?

stocks,"Earnings Season Begins! Get ready for the trading week beginning January 14th, 2019!","Hey what's happening r/stocks! Happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty good last week in the market, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 14th, 2019.

# **Earnings season may turn up some stock market winners after December's battering  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/11/earnings-season-may-turn-up-some-stock-market-winners-after-decembers-battering.html)**
*****
&gt; After the market's December meltdown, earnings season could turn up some winners among the rubble, analysts said.
*****
&gt; What fourth-quarter results will do for the market's rebound from December's trough is tough to say, given other factors, like trade talks, Washington dysfunction and the U.K.'s upcoming Brexit vote. But analysts do see some potential for positive reactions in individual stocks, even with the diminished expectations for 2019 earnings.
*****
&gt; Fourth-quarter reporting season kicks off this week with major banks Citigroup on Monday, J. P. Morgan on Tuesday and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs on Wednesday. There are a few important data releases, like PPI on Tuesday and industrial production on Friday, but reports on retail sales and housing starts have been delayed because of the 3-week-old partial government shutdown.
*****
&gt; Analysts expect earnings to be fairly strong, but are watching to see what companies say about the current quarter and the rest of the year, given expectations for a slower-growing economy and lower profit growth.
*****
&gt; After a 10 percent rebound off the Christmas Eve low, the S&amp;P 500is bumping up against a major area of resistance at 2,600 as earnings season begins. The S&amp;P 500 was trading slightly lower at around 2,590 on Friday afternoon.
*****
&gt; ""In our view the bulk of the decline is clearly behind us,"" said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG. Earnings could boost the overall market, but there are also geopolitical and other factors that could affect stocks. ""It wouldn't be a shock given the stiff resistance around 2,600 that it could pull back a ways.""
*****
&gt; Emanuel said he switched last week from a posture of buying on the dips to buying the market. ""We are not in a bull market fully yet. We are in a transition stage. You switched from both bad news and good news being sold in the last quarter to good news being bought, but if you're really in a bull market, both good news and bad news is going to be bought.""
*****
&gt; The market is expected to remain volatile, and could be choppy during earnings season because its surge higher was so sharp and swift.
*****
&gt; ""We thought earnings season would still be a net beat but with more mixed results,"" said Keith Parker, chief equity strategist at UBS. ""The key will be about 2019 guidance and what we've seen thus far is revisions to 2019 a bit more than the post-crisis average. ... The big bar reset typically happens during the first quarter, during fourth quarter reporting. We already saw expectations drop down a lot.""
*****
&gt; Analysts expect that most of the bad news is out on earnings, but if the results and comments are worse than expected, the market could easily retest its lows. On the other hand, if earnings are better than expected, they could act as a positive force to help fend off further declines, strategists said.
*****
&gt; ""Our view is we'll probably have more mixed results and guidance going into the quarter, but it does raise the likelihood of relief rallies, given where positions and expectations are,"" Parker said. He said health care could be a positive.
*****
&gt; ""Health care has positive revision trends. We think they have a better earnings, sales backdrop,"" he said, noting that in consumer discretionary, lodging and restaurants stand out.
*****
&gt; Earnings are expected to be strong, up 14.7 percent in the fourth quarter, but the fourth quarter is a transition period. Corporate executives could find themselves showing off double-digit profit growth, while discussing the activity in the current quarter, which is expected to see much slower profit growth. First-quarter earnings are expected to be up around 3.9 percent, according to Refinitiv. Earnings in 2018 were up about 23.5 percent, but 2019 gains are expected to average just under 7 percent for the year.
*****
&gt; BTIG's Emanuel said the market may be ready to reward positive news, and the biggest winners could be those that beat expectations for revenue and profit. Emanuel said in the last two earnings seasons, many companies that beat were hardly rewarded while those that missed on both profit and revenue fell an average 3.2 percent in the July period and 5 percent in October's reporting season.
*****
&gt; Source: BTIG
*****
&gt; ""Estimates have come down quite sharply for the quarter and the year. It's a mixed bag in that you've seen a raft of pre-announcements. You've seen positive reactions, negative reactions. The positive reactions have been skewed toward more cyclical companies. You've seen the worst reactions for some of the most defensive names,"" he said.
*****
&gt; In order to find possible earnings winners, BTIG analysts screened for companies that were down 20 percent from their 52-week highs, but in the past two years had beaten on earnings and revenue and their stocks were rewarded.
*****
&gt; Among those names were Morgan Stanley, which reports Thursday, Ralph Lauren, LAM Research, Akamai and Northrop Grumman.
*****
&gt; BTIG said vulnerable names could be those that haven't declined that much but that have missed on earnings in the past. The firm's analysts screened for stocks which have disappointed on both earnings and revenue during two or more quarters since the first quarter of 2017 and have declined less than 10 percent from their year highs.
*****
&gt; On that list are Walt Disney, Hershey, American Water Works, American Electric Power, AutoZone, Duke Energy, Ameren, Ecolab, NextEra Energy, Varian Medical Systems, First Energy and TransDigm.

# Time to Take Off The Blindfold?

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index is off to its best start in years, but this is on the heels of the worst year for stocks since 2008. The trifecta of crashing oil prices, confusion from the Federal Reserve (Fed), and trade issues with China all pushed equities lower by 14% during the usually bullish fourth quarter last year, and in the process made December the worst month of the year for the first time, according to data going back to 1950.

&gt; Here’s the catch: Investors have had blindfolds on trying to hide from all of the bad news, but maybe it’s time to remove the blindfolds. “Like Sandra Bullock in Bird Box, sometimes it’s better to keep that blindfold on in order to survive. But eventually there is a time to remove the blindfold and look around. We think investors should consider that, as many potential positives have taken place recently,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; Consider the following:
Since Fed Chair Jerome Powell used the word “patient” last week when referring to the Fed’s approach to hiking interest rates, stocks have gained five straight days. There had been a big disconnect between what the Fed was saying and what markets believed. That seems to have been alleviated now.

&gt; Oil prices have stabilized after crashing in the fourth quarter of 2018. OPEC is doing what it can to stabilize the commodity, and things appear to have calmed down substantially.

&gt; Trade talks with China are continuing, and we think there’s a good chance there could be some type of deal over the coming months, as the pressure is mounting on both sides to find a resolution.

&gt; Following the 2.7% sell-off in the S&amp;P 500 December 24, stocks gained more than 10% in 10 days. You have to go back to July 2009 to find the last time stocks were up that much in 10 days. That wasn’t the worst time to be long stocks.
Valuations have dropped significantly, and historically this has been a bullish event. Please read our recent Weekly Market Commentary for more thoughts here.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up nearly 3% after the first five trading days in 2019. Since 1950, when the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 1.1% after the first five days of the year, each of those years closed higher 23 out of 23 times before 2018. Yes, 2018 ended that incredible streak (along with many other tried and true historical market records). Still, a good start to a year potentially can be a sign of a strong year.

&gt; Our LPL Chart of the Day offers another reason to remove the blindfolds and look at some of the positives. The chart shows that after a midterm election year low (as in 2018), the S&amp;P 500 has been higher a year later every time going back to 1950. We now know the S&amp;P 500 low in 2018 was December 24, and history suggests there’s a good chance stocks will be higher (maybe much higher) by the same time this year.

&gt; Last, Bird Box was a great movie, but if you are trying a #BirdBoxChallenge, everyone at LPL Research wishes you luck and safety!

# Key Earnings Reports Next Week

&gt; Earnings season begins next week with the big banks kicking things off starting Monday. As shown in the chart below, the big reporting days don’t hit until late January/early February when 100+ companies are set to report each day for a number of weeks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/reports-by-day.png))**

&gt; Below is a list of the key earnings reports to watch next week. For each stock, we show its historical earnings and sales beat rate along with its average one-day price change on its earnings reaction day. The beat rate is simply the percentage of the time the company has beaten consensus estimates, while the average 1-day % change is the stock’s average move on the first trading day following its quarterly release.

&gt; On Monday, Citigroup (C) kicks things off with earnings before the open. While the stock has beaten EPS estimates 74% of the time, it has averaged a one-day decline of 0.35% on its earnings reaction days.

&gt; JP Morgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report Tuesday morning along with United Health (UNH) and two airlines — Delta (DAL) and United Continental (UAL). UNH beats EPS 91% of the time, which is the strongest beat rate of any company on the list.

&gt; On Wednesday morning it’s all Financials on the calendar — Bank of America (BAC), BNY Mellon (BK), BlackRock (BLK), Goldman Sachs (GS), PNC, Charles Schwab (SCHW), and US Bancorp (USB). Wednesday evening we’ll hear from Alcoa (AA), CSX, and Kinder Morgan (KMI).

&gt; Thursday morning will be led by Morgan Stanley (MS), while American Express (AXP) and Netflix (NFLX) will report Thursday after the close. NFLX is projected to earn 35 cents/share, and the stock has beaten EPS estimates 85% of the time throughout its history.

&gt; Schlumberger (SLB) and VF Corp (VFC) will close out the week with reports on Friday morning.

# S&amp;P 500 Sector Performance — 2019 vs. 2018

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 3.3% YTD as of mid-day today. As shown below, Energy has been by far the best sector so far this year with a gain of 8.4%. Consumer Discretionary ranks 2nd with a gain of 5.7%, followed closely by Communication Services in 3rd with a gain of 5.5%. Industrials and Materials are the other two sectors that have outperformed the S&amp;P 500.

&gt; While all eleven sectors are in the black for the year, Utilities and Health Care have lagged the market with gains of less than 1%. Note that the Tech sector — the largest sector of the market — is up 2% YTD, which is 130 basis points less than the S&amp;P 500.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019ytduse.png))**

&gt; The chart below compares 2019 YTD performance with the change seen in 2018. Utilities and Health Care were the best performing sectors of 2018 and the only two sectors that were up on the year. These two sectors have taken a breather so far in 2019 as the weakest performers.

&gt; Generally speaking, the sectors that did the best in 2018 have underperformed so far this year, while the sectors that did the worst in 2018 have bounced the most. Energy was the worst sector of 2018 and is the best so far in 2019. The big exception is Consumer Discretionary, which only fell 1.6% for the full year 2018 and is up 5.7% in 2019 — good for second best so far this year.

# The End or the Beginning

&gt; An article on Bloomberg overnight highlighted the ‘historic’ nature of the S&amp;P 500’s rally over the last 10-trading days as the biggest gain since 2009. The chart below shows the S&amp;P 500’s 10-day rate of change going back to the start of 2000, and as you can see, there hasn’t been a larger gain over a similar span since March 2009. Anytime you start hearing comparisons to March 2009, it’s enough to get any bull excited as that kicked off what was the strongest bull market of all time.

&gt; When making market comparisons, though, it’s always important to keep perspective and not focus on just one data point. A perfect case in point is the example below. While it is true that the period in 2009 kicked off a period of exceptional market returns, back in the bear market from 2000, there were no less than five different periods where the S&amp;P 500 saw larger moves over a ten-day span before the market could find a firm enough foundation to rally from.

# What Does 300,000 Jobs Tell Us?

&gt; The December jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls grew by 312,000 last month, well above the median consensus estimate for a 184,000 increase. This was a record 99th consecutive month with positive jobs growth. The good news sparked a big equity rally on hopes that the U.S. economy remained on firm footing.

&gt; What does a 300,000 monthly print tell us? First things first: Be aware that the labor market is constantly growing—so 300,000 jobs last month isn’t the same as 300,000 jobs back in the mid-1980s. In fact, the total number of employed people is about 50% higher now than it was then. Still, 300,000 jobs is an impressive increase and one that could suggest a recession is a ways off. “The most recent jobs figure could be a great sign that a recession is still a long way off, as the previous two cycles didn’t see recessions begin until 13 and 23 months after the last 300,000 print,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, looking at the previous five cycles, it took an average of 12 months after the last 300,000 jobs print before a recession started—with the last two cycles actually taking longer. We remain in the camp that we probably won’t have a recession in 2019, and this is another potential bullet point to support that.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/A-300000-Jobs-Number-Could-Suggest-a-Recession-is-Still-Far-Away.png?ssl=1))**

# Positive Santa Claus Rally &amp; First Five Days Brighten Light at Tunnel’s End

&gt; Solid across the board gains today lifted S&amp;P 500 to a year-to-date gain of 2.7% at today’s close and thus our First Five Day (FFD) early warning system is also positive. Combined with last week’s positive Santa Claus Rally (SCR), our January Trifecta is now two for two. The January Trifecta would be satisfied with a positive reading from our January Barometer (JB) at month’s end.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/95bbba30521313c806f2a15eddc564ee/tumblr_inline_pl1azilDYL1spdppr_500.jpg))**

&gt; The best case, most bullish scenario is when all three indicators, SCR, FFD and JB, are positive (in table above). In 30 previous Trifecta occurrences since 1950, S&amp;P 500 advanced 86.7% of the time during the subsequent eleven months and 90.0% of the time for the full year. However, a January Indicator Trifecta does not guarantee the year will be bear or correction free. Of the four losing “Last 11 Mon” years, shaded in grey in the above table, 1966, 1987 and 2011 experienced short duration bear markets (2011, S&amp;P 500 –19.4% peak to trough). In 2018, S&amp;P 500 retreated 19.8% from its September high close to its December low close.

&gt; Even if S&amp;P 500 was to suddenly reverse course and finish the full month in the red, the prospects for the next eleven months and the full year remain fair. Of the last 10 years since 1950 that the SCR and FFD were both positive (and the full-month January was negative), the next eleven months advanced 80% of the time and full year advanced 70% of the time with gains of 7.4% and 2.9% respectively.

personalfinance,Is the Vanguard Settlement Fund the same as its Federal Money Market Fund?,"Here's the situation: I started my first real job last year and was able to max out my Roth IRA using a combination of earned money and saved money I had sitting around in my credit union. I currently have a bit over $3000 in VTSAX (due to the reduced Admiral minimums) and about $1300 in a target date fund; I started the TDF first and I'm happy to leave it as-is because the expense ratio is higher. (I also have $1000 in a Wealthfront IRA, also not adding to it going forward.)

In order to start diversifying my Vanguard portfolio, I'm trying to save up enough money to buy in to Admiral shares of international markets, bonds, etc. The question is: While I'm saving up to get to $3000, is it better to put that money in my IRA (the Vanguard ""settlement fund""), or my PNC HYSA earning 2.35% APY?

According to [this Vanguard info page](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/money-markets-vs-savings-account-rates), their money market account currently has 2.19% APY and a 0.11% expense ratio. Am I correct in thinking this makes the actual APY 2.08%? And if so, ***is this money market account the same as my IRA's settlement fund***? The page says:  
&gt; A $3,000 minimum initial investment is required for a mutual fund account (no minimum if you're using the fund as your brokerage settlement fund).  

If the settlement fund does earn that 2.08% APY, is the fact that gains aren't taxed in the IRA enough reason to save money there? Or should I save money in the 2.35% PNC account until I have enough to buy my Admiral shares?",finance

https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/9e788m/fedfire_or_how_a_us_foreign_service_officer_can/

----

Anyway, on to bidness (I say ‘bidness’ cuz I’m from the streets).  And yes, this is rambling, but I ain’t got nothing to do right now.

**Being FIRE in Furlough**

This seems to be a bit of a no-brainer.  If you are pursuing FIRE, you should likely have an emergency fund, right?  Well, we do, no problems there.  The thing is, many people overlook the fact that, even if you are a FIRE adherent, some are *just* starting out.  I mentor people, and I try to push financial responsibility as *part* of the job (FIRE in a bubblegum wrapper, maybe)…and technically, financial responsibility is important to maintaining clearance eligibility, so it’s not a bad idea to stick it.  If you’re just starting…a year or two in, you may not have saved up that much, you may be shoveling more into debt, paying for living in the DC region, and having to take on new-ish car debt (because some countries don’t let you bring in vehicles X years or older).  My friends in the civil service (non-diplomats) don’t have the exact same problems, but even in the government, a lot of people…they may not all be living paycheck to paycheck, but they can only miss one or so.

Our efund will let us last about two months before we would have to start raiding personal stock holdings, those stocks would probably let us last out any length of shutdown (assuming this one doesn’t last until 20 Jan, 2020).  FIRE was invaluable for letting me go to sleep in this situation.  Certain folks may not have declared a *national* emergency, but this furlough has now reached the point of being a financial emergency for many.

I will say, efund aside, this happening *directly* at the holidays was probably one of the most terrible ways for it to go down.  People splurge at the holidays.  It may not be sensible, but it’s a fact.  Compound that with a missed paycheck (or more), and things get nasty quickly.  I’m sympathetic…happy I’m not currently in that situation…but a decade earlier, I sure as heck would’ve been.

**Just Go Get Work or Barter with Your Landlord**

Gee, thanks OPM…the administration being tone deaf as usual.  Funny thing, *many* federal employees are restricted in their outside employment.  You have to get permission from your supervisor, from higher echelons in your office, from HR, from Legal, depending.  This is for ethical reasons, security reasons, and proprietary info reasons…plenty of reasons more, I’m sure.  Guess what you can’t do when the government is closed?  Get government approvals, oddly enough.  I’m not allowed to enter a federal building without explicit orders to do so—it is literally against the law right now, just like any other random citizen trying to enter a federal building without permission.  Working without permission is *also* against the law.  Read into that what you will, but technically, if I check my email for work purposed, I’d be breaking the law.  

So, the recommendation to get additional work applies to some, but certainly not all, otherwise we’d be in violation of regulations, and could be ousted from a government job once we returned.  Would a reasonable boss do this, probably not.  Would administrators put into place to disrupt or co-opt the mission of certain agencies do that?  Well…I wouldn’t put it past the Zinkes or Pruitts of the world to gleefully fire employees after the furlough was over for seeking outside work without approval.  Just following regulations, after all.

The whole barter with your landlord thing…come on.  I don’t know a single apartment complex in the area that isn’t run by a real estate corporation.  Your ‘landlord’ is a board of directors in Nevada or some other place with low incorporation fees.  Individual renters, sure, maybe…but landlords gotta eat, too, and painting or odd jobs don’t buy groceries.

This also sticks with me because, right now I’m in the DC region, but if I was overseas, I’d be working (most of my colleagues at post are working without pay).  Still, can State or other civilian employee do side work to make ends meet overseas?  No. We’d literally be stealing their jerbs.  No rent, most of time, but there are still bills.

**This Is Just Hurting Those DC Elites**

85% of federal employees work and live outside the DC area (to be clear, DC area is DC, Virginia, and Maryland).  National parks are, well, nationally found.  NASA has a big presence in Florida and Texas.  Air Traffic Control and TSA are in *every* state…border patrol, USDA inspectors…not all these people are considered “Essential”…the security apparatus, sure, but you know who is not there?  Administrators, processors, plenty of IT folk, and others who actually make sure things run smoothly.

The way it normally works when a shutdown occurs is that people are pre-identified as essential and non-essential (various agencies have different terms for this).  There are also mission critical people (they know from day one they don’t get time off in emergencies or shutdowns or zombie apocalypses).  Depending on your organization some people have pay funded from the previous fiscal year, some don’t.  It really kind of depends on what bills your funding falls under.  I have a friend right now who is currently working under DoD and getting paid.  Meanwhile, the guys two offices down from him are working but *not* being paid, and the office further down the hall has been furloughed.  It seems like a crapshoot from the outside.

The kicker with this is, not that much work is getting done.  We are in a holding pattern (to use the parlance of overworked and unpaid air traffic controllers).  The Federal Government is not really operating right now, rather, *just* enough is operating to make sure nothing incredibly terrible happens.  You are less safe now than you were 20+ days ago, and it has nothing to do with the border.


**Who Wouldn’t Love a Long Paid Vacation?**

Here’s a thought experiment.  Your employer tells you that you can go on vacation.  Great!  While you are on vacation, regardless of your vacation days, you will not get paid.  Wait!  Also, your employer can require you to return to work with no more than 12 hours notice.  Uhh…

Doesn’t sound so good, does it?  We now know—two weeks in—that Congress is authorizing backpay.  That wasn’t true at first, and I’m not holding my breath that it’s a done deal.  I can’t go visit my folks for a long weekend because I don’t know if I’ll be at work on Monday.  We’re not allowed to take time off in lieu of furlough, either.  I certainly can’t go on a real vacation (sorry, mom and dad, but you’re not exactly Disney World).  Even then, traveling takes money, which will be tight for plenty of people.

Maybe it’s a taste of Early Retirement [insert angels’ choir sound here]?  Nope.  I am definitely not experiencing a sense of independence, freedom, or lack of financial concern.  I’m not sweating my next meal, but I also kind of feel like I’m under house arrest…or maybe just wearing an ankle bracelet with a DC-area range.

To add insult to injury, *many* organizations are having employees come in for a day here, a day there (in the sense that you are “essential” one day and return to furlough status the next), so that everyone would at least get some money in a paycheck in the event Congress did not authorize backpay.  Kudos to our bosses who do this.  It’s good foresight, but it definitely makes doing anything but waiting around for a phone call difficult to accomplish.  To reiterate, not how most people spend a “vacation”.

**What About All Those Free Meals and Discounted Cocktails?**

So, in the DC region, there are places offering “furlough” deals.  Some places are giving discounts on food or drink, some places a free meal…and all you have to do is show your ID.  This is marketing.  I mean, yeah, you can take advantage of it, I guess, but a lot of it is in DC proper, not the ‘burbs where a majority of the employees live.  And are you going to try to do that every day?  Probably not.  And does it apply to your kids or spouse?  Most likely not.  I’m pretty sure this also isn’t happening much in other states, either…again 85% of the federal workforce is not in DC.

On top of that…well, there’s the issue that it’s also typically *against* regulations (possibly the law, though don’t quote me on that) to receive benefits based on your federal status.  Approvals can be given, and there are exceptions here and there (GEICO, for example, gives a discount to government employees as a standard practice).  The idea here is that we’re supposed to *avoid* reciprocity…you give me a discount and maybe I’ll help you out later.  Admittedly, the likelihood of my State Department role affecting a pub in Arlington is *pretty* low, but I don’t get to choose which rules I want to follow, and there’s literally no one to consult about that right now.

**I Don’t Work for the Government.  Who Cares?**

Even when the government is working, there are still disasters, still romaine lettuce that will make you sick, still bad guys doing bad things…all that is, well, not entirely unchecked, but certainly not as well-guarded against.  There is no significant food inspection going on right now.  You still go to the grocery store, don’t you?  Water safety, environmental protection, all that is limited or non-existent.  Probably nothing to worry about, but if you were an amoral company looking dump something toxic, when would you do it?  No risk, right now.  Customs and Border Patrol gets paid pretty poorly, TSA too…now they’re not getting paid at all.  This isn’t even to imply their doing their job *less*, but rather, how long can they show up and *not* get paid?

You do depend on interstate commerce, and travel, and flying, and all other sorts of things.  No one should *really* have to make an argument that the federal government provides vital services, but here we are.  If a few more TSA folks stop showing up at Atlanta, Chicago, JFK, and maybe LAX, air travel is going to be messed up.  That impacts things like Amazon deliveries, too.  It’s not just business or vacation travelers that will feel it.

Following this, I wouldn’t expect Q1 numbers to look great if this continues for another paycheck or so.  It’s not just federal employees…it’s contractors, contract services (like cleaning or maintenance), stuff as simple as office supply companies, vending and cafeteria services, all sorts or stuff that are suspended or operating with skeleton crews.  How many of these companies can survive weeks without being paid?  It ripples out.

Heck, let’s go a step further…800,000+ federal workers are non-essential, and almost a million more are working but not getting paid.  Two million people, so even assuming these employees are terrible with money and aren’t investing *anything*, the government is still investing 1% of their salary into TSP.  If everyone is being paid $50,000, that’s about $40,000,000 that didn’t get invested with this past (missed) paycheck.  The average salary in the federal government is higher than that, and the average TSP investment is *definitely* more than 1%.  When institutional investors (and the TSP most definitely qualifies) *aren’t* buying stock…is that good or bad for the economy…?  I forget.

**Some Personal Notes and Being Reminded of FIRE on Furlough**

Meh, that’s a lot of doom and gloom.  I’ve been at work four days since the holidays.  Moral is not good.  Maybe a needed to vent.

Fortunately, right before the holidays, I sold my underwater townhome for mortgage value + $3500.  I found a local “We Buy Houses” type company (just a realtor with a bunch of investors backing him up), and they bought the townhome *with* the renters still in place.  After owning the place for 12 years…I literally broke even (probably less, since I’m not really accounting for inflation).  But hey, I’m not shelling out $200 a month in excess of my renters’ rent anymore.

A weird thing that happened included my going to a pre-pre-retirement seminar on Monday and Tuesday.  This was training I had paid for out of last year’s budget, so I could still go (no refunds).  It was a seminar designed for people more than five years from retirement.  There was some good stuff, and they talked specifically about FERS, FERS Special, and Foreign Service Retirement.  I am still on course to able to really retire at 50, so, yay.

There was some great stuff on legal and financial planning, particularly regarding springing power of attorney, revocable trusts.  The lawyer who spoke for that part made a point of indicating that from 18 years onward, all family members should have springing powers of attorney, and possibly limited powers of attorney.  This was particularly important for those of us in foreign service, since we find ourselves in tough situations every once in a while, but just for general financial security in a time when you or a spouse is incapacitated, it’s good to know you can accomplish critical business if needed.

Revocable trusts were an interesting concept from an estate planning perspective.  Those of you who plan to have more than once residence or property in multiple locations may want to look into that to possibly simplify probate / estate planning.  It does not work in all situations, but it might for some.

The financial planner presented a case for having a mortgage in retirement, which I thought was interesting.   He made a point to not to use it to overbuy, but rather—and this was particular to people with pensions—it can used to avoid some tax liability.  Much of this was dependent on current mortgage rates, but it *could* be tax advantaged if you have a pension to also have a mortgage interest write off.  I found it funny, because he specifically called out Dave Ramsey and his “anti-debt at all cost” schtick.  I probably won’t have a post-retirement mortgage, but it’s food for thought.

The Financial Planner also made a great analogy about the market (it hit home for those of us in the DC area): 

Being in the market is like being in traffic.  You pick a lane, and you’re going along to your destination.  Then your lane starts to slow and you see people to the left and right of zooming past.  After some swearing, you pull out into another lane, zip along a few car lengths, and then stop.  Now, the rusted-out Ford you were behind for the past ten miles is passing you in your old lane, so you switch back, but there are a few more care between you and the Ford.  Waitaminute!  I’m losing progress!  Better switch lanes again.  Rinse and repeat.

This isn’t to say there aren’t some true fast lanes, but unless you have really good financial GPS, all you’re doing is weaving in and out of the market on a hunch, and losing position along the way.  The destination, and progress toward it, are still pretty well-known / predictable factors.

There wasn’t anything particularly illuminating about the financial planning part of it, (though the fact that these guys charge 0.5 - 1.5% to give advice we talk about here daily is a thought for post-retirement income…though I’m not sure what’s all involved in becoming a Certified Financial Planner).

He went over opportunities for backdoor Roth contributions, and made a point that Roth isn’t always better depending on where you are in your career, and where you expect to be, tax-wise, in the future.  For federal employees, unless you choose to work *after* retirement from the government, it would be hard to have more earned income post retirement.  Our pensions are *always* a fraction of our past earnings.  Again, not mind-blowing, but Backdoor Roth is often chanted as a mantra here, but everyone is different in their situation.

He also mentioned this step-by-step guide for the backdoor Roth from Physician on Fire.

So, the guy knew about FIRE, but never actually mentioned it by name…heh.

**Some Fed-Specific Stuff**

For those who are federal employees, a guy from the TSP board talked to us and told us that significant positive changes to withdrawal options are coming, and they are looking at growing fund options in the next 3-7 years.  He said there’s usually very little pushback in that area, so don’t do anything drastic (i.e., moving all funds to another brokerage) if you don’t have a better reason than you just want a little more diversity.  

As a final note, the guy from TSP board mentioned three huge mistakes they see all the time:  Keeping everything the G Fund—don’t do it unless you’re already retired and the low return meets your needs.  Moving everything into the G Fund when the market dips (happens a lot, good ol’ buy high and sell low).  And last, having some money in a target date fund (L Funds) *and* in a regular fund (G, F, C, S, I).  If you’re going to use an automatic balancing fund, having any of the same funds outside there is silly, and if you want more control, just mimic the allocations of your preferred target fund once a month (or quarterly, or whatever).  Creating combinations of target funds (like having 25% in aggressive 2050+ and 75% in the 2020 fund) is fine (though maybe not optimal), since they’re still all automatically rebalancing.

For those who are FERS-RAE or FERS-FRAE (people who pay more for their pension plan), the poison pill retirement adjustments pushed by zombie-eyed granny starver Paul Ryan (credit to Esquire), we were shown math that indicates you still benefit, obviously, from a full government career (the health care coverage being a primary factor), but the inflection points are about 8 and 12 years for RAE and FRAE.  If you quit before then, not a huge loss, if you quit after then, you’re likely cheating yourself financially.  I can’t replicate the math here, but I don’t think he was lying.  He did point out that if the healthcare situation in US changes for the better (Universal / Medicare for all), many federal employees might find themselves re-evaluating the benefits of their benefits.

I can't seem to find anything online discussing this idea of if there are any rules against it. 

Edit: According to Investopedia, the IRS does not allow you to invest in a Roth with borrowed money. But how do they distinguish borrowed money, from what you earn?

That's not an option for me. I've wanted to get out from underneath this car for some time, but I was unable to sell it due to the value vs. what I owed. I had to have the clutch and flywheel replaced only four months ago (to the tune of over $2k) - I asked if this could be a related issue or just shitty timing, they said the latter, as this wasn't a transmission issue (they're a different shop than did that work, btw).

I want to be done with this car, and either try and bike/uber to work (weather) or maybe buy a POS privately for a few hundred bucks and just keep working to pay off the car. 

I don't know what that means in terms of what to do with the Mini, though. I feel like I can't just uninsure it or sell it because the bank wouldn't be down with either.

About 70% used 3 months before from putting mine and my wifes 33 day road trip mostly on rewards cards and paying off the ballance at the end of the month. But no real ballance carried over. 

So, last month I stumbled upon one of my obtainable dream cars a 2007 Element in the exact spec I wanted.  orange, 5speed ex 4wd. One of 2 for sale south of the 150k mile mark with 89,000 miles roughly. Sadly it was in Jersey, but 3 hour drive was worth it.  Normally I'd just pay cash and go about my day. But I was about to surprise my wife with a trip to France. And I wanted to keep the majority of my savings secured for this, so, used car loan. Figured 5 or 6 percent interest. No big deal, pay it off next September. First car loan car for me since 2002. 


Apply for loan with my wife who has similar credit scores according to the same apps.  The dealer came back and said hers was higher so she'd be at the top of the loan. No big deal. When I asked what my score was, they showed me both reports being around 645 for me and my wife's being around 760. I didn't care so much at the time, we still ended up with a 7.5% interest rate after 2600 down and out the door we went. Got a letter 4 days ago saying after careful review, they were going to lower our rate to 6.25% 


My question is how can these scores be so similar between the apps and so different from whatever they got back? Also, my wife's score was spot on with the apps. Nothing has changed and I want to know if I should be worried. I don't generally do car loans, my wife and I are mid 30's no kids and we make good enough money for our lives and we live cheap so we can travel and retire early in life.

personalfinance,Refinancing auto loan to lower payment and put that money into my 401k,"I've got an auto loan with just under $13k and 36 months left (originally $25k / 72mo at 1.9%). The payment is $367/mo. My employer offers a 50% match on my 401k. I'm currently contributing $1,000/mo (plus another $500 from the match). My marginal income tax rate (state + fed) is about 21%, not factoring in SSI since 401k contributions aren't exempt from SSI tax. I recently realized that if I refinance my auto loan, I can dump the monthly savings into my 401k.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, if I refinanced to 72mo at 3.25%, the new payment would be about $190. Therefore I'd need $177/mo less in **net** income, or $225/mo in **gross** income. If I take this $225/mo and put that into my 401k, that gets me significantly closer to maxing out my 401k. Additionally I gain another $1350 year from the additional matching funds. Therefore my annual contribution with matching would jump from $18k to $22k.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously if I refinance I will pay a bit more in interest, but the tax savings, 401k matching, and additional interest earned on a larger 401k contribution will *easily* far outpace any additional interest I rack up on the refinance. For example, if I don't refinance, I will pay approximately $400 in interest over the remainder of the current loan. If I refinanced to 72mo at 3.25%, I'll pay $1,300. In this scenario, I'd break even (difference in additional interest paid vs what I put into my 401k) in just 3 months. Over the life of that 72 month loan however, I'd come out at least $8-10k ahead of the game, possibly more, depending on a number of variables. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm well aware that it's not usually a good idea to have an auto loan longer than 60/mo (for a variety of reasons), but in this case, given the above scenario, I would be inclined to refinance out to 72 or even 84 months if possible, even if the interest rate is 5% or 6%. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My question is, is it possible to refinance my auto loan to a significantly longer term like this and are you aware of specific credit unions or banks that offer favorable terms for refinancing a used vehicle loan that is on the smaller side?** I've done some research but I don't want to apply and have a bunch of hard credit pulls unless I'm reasonably confident I could secure a loan term that is favorable enough to make it worth while to refinance. For example if the best I could do is 48/mo, than it's probably not worth the hassle.",finance
personalfinance,Can I afford to buy a house? Help?,"I’m trying to figure out if I can afford a house in San Francisco.  I am looking at places around $1.3m.

We have a newborn.

All student loans are paid off; no debt. 

We are currently in an apartment (in SF) that isn’t  baby friendly (rent is $1.5k).  I’d like to wait longer to buy (as I assume Trump will eventually force the fed to lower rates), but I’m running out of time.  

So, can I afford $1.3m?  Why?  Why not?  If less or more, how much less/more?

personalfinance,"I was overpaid, now employer asking to repay net+taxes?","Due to an accounting error, I was overpaid by my employer for approximately $2800 in 2018. They are asking me to sign a document authorizing them to deduct the net income ($2100) plus state and federal taxes that were withheld ($400). The additional CA SDI and Medicare taxes, they have not asked me to repay. Is it correct for me to repay the taxes that were withheld as well ($2100 + $400)? 

The way I understand it, that would mean that essentially the IRS/CA FTB ""owes"" me $400, likely captured as the fact that an extra $400 was withheld on income that in essence never happened. But I am not sure that this will be reflected on my 2018 W2, which means it would be contingent on me to follow up on my 2019 W2 to make sure this happens?

So what's the best outcome? It's likely that the extra $2800 has already been incorporated into my 2018 W2 (they say these are finalized already), which means I will have to pay taxes on it. If the same amount is then subtracted from my 2019 W2, I suppose that would even it out on the income side. But I have very little faith that I would get the appropriate credit for tax being withheld, if that makes sense.

On a somewhat related note, the same employer has owed me ~$8k in back pay for several months now for work that was done in 2018. They dragged their feet and are now only getting around to paying me in 2019 (incidentally, a year in which I expect to have significantly higher tax liability). In essence, they cost me ~10% additional taxes on that $8k. So I am in no mood to help them out, especially since once they found out about the overpayment they **quickly** moved to rectify that.

A few additional details that may be relevant. This is in California, I am an exempt employee, and I will only be with said employer for another half year.

personalfinance,Student Loan Interest Changes Making Any Progress Near Impossible,"A little financial background..
 I am making approximately 48k a year after taxes. I teach during the typical school year in a fairly inexpensive cost of living area and work in the summers at a restaurant in an attempt to “get ahead”. Teaching pre tax is set around 45k while the restaurant brings in about 15k prior to taxes. In the past 2 years I have been able to pay off my 25k car loan about 4 years early and put extra money towards a student loan that is not the one I am mentioning below. My question is related to my largest loan between the two.

Upon entering my collegiate year, I had little options other than student loans due to my parents refusing to assist outside of co-signing a loan (Frustrating seeing as they make about 200k a year combined) But, it is what it is. My Mother being my co-signer, signed us up for a loan through our credit union at this current moment I cannot find the starting rate but by 2016 this interest rate was a 6.25 rate. Fast forward the rate is not 8.5% which seems ridiculously high to me. This rate again will increase in march to 8.75% I have a good credit score that has fluctuated with the purchase of my car. Scores around the upper 680s and I currently only have 2 student loans out. One for 19k at about 4% and the other for 56k at 8.5%.

My payments are over $500 with about $30 going to principal. Again ridiculous. I am reaching out to ask some of you what my options may be. Should I refinance with another company? Is my mom being a co-signer and her having poor credit the reason for the constant hike?

I was looking at a $400/mo apartment I could move into right now. To get the funds though, it looks like I’ll need to take out another student loan this time through Navy Federal, (My bank provider.) Everyday it’s something new with my mom. When I was a junior I worked a part time job and whenever I’d get a paycheck in my account she’d take money without asking out of my account (through nfcu she was my sponsor, so she had direct access to all my funds), she would spend it on the loan she got to buy her 2013 Chevy Camaro, rent, alcohol, basically relied on me to help pay her bills when I needed gas money to drive myself to school. The thing that set our argument off this time was her toxicity. To keep a long story short, she didn’t want my step sister of 10 years to come to my sister’s baby shower and she’s taking the anger out on me, so I really need to move out. I’ve found an apartment very close to my campus for again $400/mo, I can find a job and finish up college later when I’m back on my feet. Should I go through with this?
I do have my own form of transportation but she refuses to sign the truck she bought for me over to me so it’s questionable on whether or not I’ll have it after I move

Edit: So, thank you for everyone replying and talking to me about my best course of action!

Hi personal finance,

I'm a 31 year old who recently went back to school for a master's and just about doubled my student loan debt. That said I am very fortunate and have under 40k to pay back through federal loans (undergrad included). I've always been a good saver but never had to deal with investing.

I just started my first job in my field in October and am trying to figure out whether to focus on paying off my loans before contributing to my 401k beyond my companys match (a measly $600/year) or should I be focused on contributing to my 401k and only doing my necessary student loan payments to make up for ""lost time.""

Student loan interest rate: 5.31%
Total student loan amount: $33,000
Housing status: renting for $700/month

personalfinance,Should I settle my student loan debt with Navient (Sallie Mae)?,"I have 2 active student loans that I’m currently paying:


*Federal Loan (Nelnet)* = **$11,300** @ **6.25%**  // Minimum Payment due: **$154** // Current Monthly Payments **~$500**


Private Loan (Navient/Sallie Mae) = **$34,000** @ **.0001%** // Minimum (current) Payment: **$205.00**

Current Cash on hand = **$15,000.00**



After I lapsed on payments for a few years with Navient, I finally started making enough money to pay it back. By then they had an offer for my (at the time) $40,000 loan. I pay $2,500 upfront and commit to a direct transfer of $205.00 a month, they would drop my interest rate from 11.5% to .0001%. I accepted. They also offered to settle the entire balance for $12,000 - an impossible feat at the time.

Since then I’ve been aggressively paying back my my Federal Loan with the goal to pay it off entirely by 2021.

Fast forward a few more years and I’ve been in contact with a rep at Navient who says I may be able to settle the remaining balance of **$33,000** for around **$8,000**. If I do that, I’m likely going to pay around **$250** a month on my Federal Loan while I rebuild my savings (I’m an independent contractor so it’s important to have a nest egg in case I have to go a month or two without work)

My questions are:

- Should I take the Navient deal? Is it cost effective to pay it off now if it means I pay my Federal Loan (6.25%) slower than my original goal?

- What are the tax implications of settling that debt? How much am I looking to pay in taxes next year if I settle this loan?

- Is the Navient interest rate so low that it’s worth paying off my Federal Loan first before I settle the Navient Loan?

My annual bonus will come in March and our plan is to use $5000 to pay off a loan (or put $5000 towards the $9000 I owe my parents), $3000 to pay for the Disney World trip, and the remaining $2000 to go $1500 into savings and $500 for a new mattress.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to be as detailed as possible. Feel free to ask me questions, critique the budget, point out areas we are overspending etc. I won't be offended, so be brutally honest need be. As far as a house goes, we want something around $150-$175k and 2+ acres. Our goal is to homestead.

personalfinance,Tax specialist or no?,"Throwaway because reasons- 

I am 24 and a full time server in Georgia. I make 2.13/hr hourly which obviously does not cover taxes owed so at the end of each year I owe. I'm not looking to get parented and I am fully aware of the financial mistakes I have made so here is my situation- The first year I served full time I never really thought about taxes and that I would have to pay some out of pocket. I was astonished when I owed $1500 fed and $700 state. Obviously I didn't pay it or else I wouldn't be here. This snowballed for a few years. I am on a payment plan and throwing extra payments when I can. Total amount I owe is a lot but not daunting or something I can't handle. I am engaged but not married filing single. I do not own my home and I have no children. Is it worth paying someone to do my taxes? Or would it more or less be the same as if I used the software my mom uses for her small business?",finance

personalfinance,"First full-time job, have loans— should I start investing?","Hey :) Recent college grad here, seeking your advice! I grew up in a household without models of healthy financial habits, and the idea of growing your money (versus living paycheck to paycheck) is pretty foreign. Now that I have a full time job, I’m trying to be smarter than my parents were by balancing loan payments, living expenses, and savings. My biggest questions are: When is the right time to think about investing (or how much should I have in savings before I invest), and where?

I started my new job in September, and since then I’ve been able to pay all the interest on my $20k of low interest federal loans (about $2.5k), and a little bit toward the principal. I’ve also saved about $2k with my bank, and gave myself a living expenses budget of $500/month. I’ve been able to do all this because my parents let me stay at home and borrow a car, so I don’t have huge monthly expenses—  until May (when we agreed that I’ll move out and possibly start splitting rent with my boyfriend).

At this point, would it be wise to move my savings into an IRA or index fund? (Work won’t offer 401k for another several months). If I do invest, should I wait a few months to save enough for a Vanguard account, or start sooner with a different company with lower/no minimum initial investment?

The alternative would be to focus on paying off my loans and building up an even bigger emergency fund— continuing what I’ve been doing.

I don’t want to miss out on the possible growth that could come from investing early, but I also don’t want impatience and inexperience to bite me back.

I’d appreciate any insights that you could offer, considering my amateur financial literacy! Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,New to Tax Deductions,"This is my first year out of college working full time.  I have always just had my parents do my taxes where I was only making 10-20k/year for part time jobs, campus jobs and the like (was also an RA in college).  Starting right after graduation I began working a job for 52k/year, after a few months was bumped to 65k, and at the end of the year moved to a new job for 83k/year.  On the side, I then also did some tutoring work through an agency.  I'm going to be filling my first ""real"" tax return this year and am wondering what I can deduct.  I live in MA, claimed ""0"" dependants on my forms, and had state and fed withold an additional $50/week each.  I live in an apartment that a family member owns and pay rent at a discounted rate as I basically am doing all the repairs and upkeep of the building (like a part-time property manager but discounted rent instead of pay).  I also own a car and drive to work, sometimes I then have to drive to other client locations for work but work offers mileage expenses.  

Things I have in mind for deductions:

\-Student loan interest

\-Can I deduct anything in a ""home office"" sense for the tutoring work?

\-I didn't know about the mileage compensation at work for one of the jobs I was on, can I deduct any of that?

\-Anything else come to mind?",finance

personalfinance,Is my friend being scammed? Should I say something?,"My friend who's been in debt for a long time said that she was doing debt consolidation which I was initially really excited about.  (I've wanted to see her get rid of her debt for years.)  She said that she would be out of debt 3 years from when it started.  I'm thinking finally!  

Then she started saying things that I didn't understand.  She said she was taking a big hit on her credit rating and that she was getting constant calls from her credit card companies because she isn't paying them during negotiations.  The debt consolidation company had instructed her not to answer when they call.   Also she said the interest rate on the new loan would be 0% - but she's never had a very good knowledge base on financial matters, so she could be confused on the rate. 

She seemed like she didn't have a good understanding of the process and just kind of shrugged when I politely asked a question or two.   I hate to get involved in other people's finances, but she's a close friend, and I'd hate to see her in a worse financial situation than she is in now.

personalfinance,"Looking to Refinance my Student Loans, Fixed or Variable?","So I have recently (last few hours) started to research into refinancing my student loans so that I can save some money over the remainder of the next few years while paying it off.  Currently my student loan is through FAFSA and is broken down as;

Group A: Principle = $12,773.92 at 5.221%

Group C: Principle = $5,821.32 at 4.410%

I just recently paid off Group B which had the highest interest rate and wish I had thought of refinancing sooner to save money since that was over 6% interest.  I know in itself neither of these interest rates are horrible, but I feel like I could get a better rate due to my credit score.

FICO: 782

CreditWise: 760

Transunion: 760

Equifax: 763

&amp;#x200B;

I still have a few places to narrow down before putting in my info to receive which interest rate I will receive, but I was mainly curious as to whether I should do a Fixed or Variable loan.  I know the market has been down lately and people are expecting it to rise again but how will that exactly affect my rate if I were to go with a variable rate?  Does the market being down mean my rate would be higher or lower?  I am still somewhat new to educating myself on finances and don't exactly understand too much about the loan types except that a fixed rate stays where it's at and a variable will fluctuate, but it seems that variable rates tend to have a lower bottom rate.

&amp;#x200B;

Also not sure if it is too important to this, but I am 25 and my pre-tax take home pay is roughly $35,000.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

Anyone new to reading this, is it possible to refinance only Group A or would I have to refinance both loans?  Found a rate of 4.95% with the availability to receive a 0.25% discount for signing up for Auto Pay if I refinance through my credit union.  I plugged in the numbers into an online calculator and know that over the course of the next few years I would be saving money regardless, but if it's possible to only refinance Group A while keeping Group C with what I have I would be able to save more money.",finance

A little about my relationship with VeChain:

I have followed the project since the mainnet launch, and was recently able to get my hands on an X-node, something I had wanted for a while that wasn't possible before.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to make this post because I truly believe in VeChain. Not in the way that  most people do, in the sense that as I see it VeChain has perfectly set itself up to be on the forefront of the blockchain revolution. At this point it cannot lose, and while some of you may think this is purely speculation, I will explain why it is much more than that. The giveaway details will be at the bottom but has very much to do with what I will say.

&amp;#x200B;

More than any other partnership currently, the best one VeChain has in DNV GL. I dont know how much most of you **really** know about DNV GL so I wont make any guesses, but ill just say this; the next time you have 1 hour to spare and want to research something interesting, read the FULL wikipedia page of DNV GL. Then look up what an Accredited Registrar is, and what kind of powers it holds in countries, as DNV GL **IS** an accredited registrar and **IS** licensed to operate in more than 80 countries. What business DNV GL does are so far and spread throughout the world that they hold a significant position at the ""big boy table"" the companies and governments of the world with the most influence. Institutions like the IMF and World bank gathering every few years to review ""Global economic health"" are essentially monetary mafias , we in the crypto space have already seen the IMF and US threaten Malta for trying to create a national cryptocurrency.

&amp;#x200B;

You may be asking now, why is any of that good for us here at VeChain. Well I think there is a reason everything is so quiet. Other followers of this channel will have seen a post on this subreddit about a italian newspaper publishing an article about My Story, DNV GL and VeChain. Whats interesting is that no where in the article is VeChain **actually** mentioned. The company who made the technology available and partnered DNV GL to do it was not mentioned? History may not always repeat itself but during the last technological boom we had of the internet if any company was partnering with large internet companies it would have been big news! Yet dispite this, a company (DNV GL) so experienced, wide-reaching and advanced are still buying equity stake and investing heavily into **VeChain.** They (DNV GL CEO) has already said they are piloting solutions to 4 or 5 new industries, i cant quite remember. What I, said about DNV GL's wikipedia page wasnt a joke, if you read the whole thing you will be scared about the kind of R&amp;D and other projects DNV GL performs. I would say they are some super advanced dark mafia organization, but this is not james bond.

&amp;#x200B;

Its not a coincidence that all the while this we keep hearing news about how wealth is shifting into the richest wallets. Institutions and wealth actors are buying cryptos under our nose and people are still wondering if its a scam? I dont understand how any of you out there who truly believe that this wont succeed can face the facts and the evidence and still be so ignorant. I am not a VeChain maximalist, I just fully understand as a **FACT** that in 5 years VeChain will be a **THRIVING**  ecosystem, and blockchain will have started worming its ways in all aspects of society. My father is an executive at really big, global telecommunications company (I dont want to say which just because im not sure what private information im allowed to say or not) and he is very conservative. Like Insanely conservative. I spoke with him during the summer, around august to September, and I asked him if in his professional world he had heard of blockchain and crypto's. He said to me that the company he was at (a multi billion dollar global corporation) was already having board meeting discussions about implementing blockchain throughout their entire network and supply chain, and went further to say that in 10 years most of the worlds companies and likely systems will run on blockchain technology. His company is already looking at 3rd party solutions though not even he knows.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I mean to say by all this? its all being kept low right now because the big players are all trying to figure out whats up and whats down, what they can make the most money with. I truly see a VeChain at 10$ in a 10 years future. Really think about it, a \~700 Billion dollar valuation. Partnered with some of the most far reaching and wide companies in the world with networks that will all be fed to VeChain, an ecosystem of 700 Billion dollars is not a ""pipe dream"". I am ready to eat my words and I expect the community to hold me up to my word. I know with full certainty that by 3 years VeChain will be priced at 1$. There are all these TA charts prediction these slow and tiny gains over the next few years and they all fail to understand that this is an emerging technology thats already penetrating aspect of business and society, as soon as they are regulated and companies are not afraid to touch them in public, there will start a blockchain revolution that will change the world just as the internet did.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Giveaway**

I wanted this to be a community event, to get some real knowledge and research flowing through the space, and so to be eligible for the giveaway comment about your thoughts on the same things that I spoke about. Why do you think VeChain or even blockchain in general will succeed, what real life experience do you have with it? Have well informed people told you anything similar to what I heard? I want to open the space up.

&amp;#x200B;

I will rank the top 3 posts in terms of how good the information is, how credible the sources are and if it does make real sense, not just speculatory and in the air. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, places will receive 40,000 VET, 35,000 VET and 25,000 VET.

personalfinance,Is paying off a lower interest loan worth it?,"Looking for a little guidance (and maybe some numbers) on a scenario of paying off a car loan with existing funds (and then saving what would have been payments) or continue making scheduled payments.


I should clarify that I already have an emergency fund, no other high interest debt and am saving near the max in retirement accounts. The money for this would be from a short-term savings account (home improvement and vacation.)


Here are the details:

Loan APR: 5%

personalfinance,Is it logical to be wary of having money saved in multiple banks?,"I have multiple credit cards but I keep all of my money in two accounts. One is my checking account with Bank of America that has essentially all of my money. My other account is my Roth IRA with Fidelity. That's it. I don't have a savings account or anything.   

I've been thinking about getting a savings account either with Bank of America or with an online-only bank like Discover or Ally for the higher interest rates. I'm leaning more towards a savings account with Bank of America, despite the very small interest rate, simply because I and my family have done our banking with them for decades and because that way I have all of my money with the same bank, same app, same everything, which makes it a breeze to move money around when necessary and I can rest easy knowing that the bulk of my money is secure with an institution I have decades of experience with.   

However, I'm always hearing about the benefits of having a savings account with Ally or Discover since their interest rates are over 2%, which is much larger than Bank of America's zero point something percent. But with my small amount of money (around $15,000) is an extra couple percent even worth it any way?    

What do you think? Is it better to keep the bulk of my money all in one bank that I am familiar with? Or is that a silly notion and I should simply open a savings account with who ever has the highest interest rate and keep a small sum in my Bank of America checking account?  Is there any danger to having my money spread out between multiple institutions (Bank of America, Fidelity, and now possibly a third)?

personalfinance,How to tackle the 18% APR auto loan of my mother’s?,"So, my mother is currently disabled and I’m paying her bills. The vehicle we share is in her name exclusively. After suffering multiple financial troubles out of her control, her credit plummeted before signing onto this loan.

Now, my credit score is in the mid-high 600s, and I know I could get a better rate (quoted 4.5-9% with some refinance companies).

a) Is refinancing a student loan more likely to hurt or help mortgage rate based on the arguments above?

personalfinance,"Getting divorced, need to split equity in house","Background: 

* I'm in the middle of a divorce, expecting to finalize everything in a few months. 
* We own a house together that's worth $300k according to our friend who is a real estate agent. 
* We owe $215k on the house via a 30 year 3.75% fixed rate mortgage. 
* I'm currently experiencing health issues which pretty much keeps me at home 24/7. I work from home.

Issue: 

Per our divorce agreement we need to split the equity in the house.

Options:

1. Sell the house. This is probably the cleanest option to split up the equity but I actually really like this house and I can still afford it on my own. Plus, the thought of moving right now with my current health issue would be pretty stressful.
2. Cash out refinance. The LTV can't exceed 80% so lets say our house appraises at $300k, we could cash out $25k. The refinance would increase my interest rate to 4.75%. When calculating the equity that I owe my spouse, do I just take (300k-215k)/2 to get $42,500? Or should I factor in closing costs into this calculation since if we were to sell the house we wouldn't receive that much? Also, if I can only get $25k from the cash out refinance are there any other options I have to come up with the remainder? I could tap into my savings but that would bring my emergency funds down quite a bit. If I refinanced the house I would rent out 1 or 2 of the bedrooms so that would bring in additional income that could replenish my savings. 
3. ?

I will be speaking to a real estate agent and a loan officer next week to go over my options but I would like some outside opinions. Which option do you think would be best? Is there anything that I'm missing?

personalfinance,Money and saving,"By no means am I wealthy. I’ve been saving a while and have accumulated a small amount for a student. I have about 5,000 and will have around that much already including my budgeting for my accomodation, food and so on. 

Currently it’s sitting in a savings, which I can take out at any time for an interest rate of 1.65%. 

What’s the best way to get a higher rate? Invest or what to do with the money.

Of course, I know higher rates equal more risk. One of the things I’ve learnt in economics and finance. However, I don’t like that the rate hardly keeps up with inflation",finance

personalfinance,Certifying income for income-based student loan repayments with IRS,"This morning I logged onto Fedloan to recertify my income, which is required annually to kee my student loan on an income based repayment. There is a deadline of 1/25 to certify my income. When Fedloan attempts to link me to the IRS page to pull my income information I get a dead link.

personalfinance,Can I close an IRA with holdings in bank CDs with rollover to 401k?,"I am writing on behalf of my wife.  This is a weird one.   Before she met, her credit union talked her into taking a large chunk of her savings, opening up a Roth IRA with the bank, and then as the investment vehicle, using two traditional bank CDs which obviously are performing well less than the stock market in general.

We want/need to get that money out and into her work's 401k retirement savings plan.  We're okay with taking a $100 or $200 hit on early CD withdraw to get that money earning at a higher rate NOW.

We stopped in at the bank, and wanted to see what the penalty for closing the CDs, moving the money to savings, and then drastically ramping up my wife's 401k contributions as a way of moving the money from CDs to 401k.   But the bank made it clear that doing this would result in federal penalties for closing the IRA before retirement.    

We kinda agree that we'd wait until September in the one week renewal window of the CDs to roll them over to her 401k which would not result in federal early IRA withdraw penalties.

But, what I realize now is that the bank lady put up a smoke screen to keep that money at that bank (credit union) longer than we need.

**My real question:**

Can we just initiate a rollover from her IRA that has CD holdings, to get that money less CD closure feeds to her 457 NOW?

This would, I assume, result in the CD early closure penalty which we are okay with, and hopefully avoid the 10% or whatever federal penalty for closing the IRA.

Does that plan of attack make sense?",finance

stocks,Goldman Picked These U.S. Stocks for Investors Craving Safety,"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-07/goldman-picked-these-u-s-stocks-for-investors-craving-safety](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-07/goldman-picked-these-u-s-stocks-for-investors-craving-safety)

U.S. stocks could be capable of big gains in 2019, but investors still need to be careful, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said.

American economic growth that’s expected to be around 1.9 percent on average this year, combined with an anticipated 1-percentage-point deceleration, is “often associated with positive stock returns,” strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note dated Jan. 4. They said current low valuations suggest upside potential, though recommended caution amid low cash allocations and a volatile trading environment.

 

“Investors should own companies with ‘quality’ attributes,” the strategists wrote. “We recommend investors increase portfolio defensiveness” and highlight “stocks well-positioned to outperform during an uncertain economic environment.”

The “margin of safety” screen looked for companies via a valuation analysis that picked “stocks that would still trade at less than a 10 percent premium to the historical median if earnings sharply decline. This measure is particularly relevant in light of Apple’s negative [preannouncement on Wednesday](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-02/apple-cut-first-quarter-sales-forecast-on-weak-iphone-sales) amid the slowdown in China’s economy,” the report said.

&amp;#x200B;

 

Other factors for selection included a strong balance sheet, a non-zero dividend yield and limited popularity among hedge funds.

Stocks that made the cut include: FedEx Corp., KLA-Tencor Corp., United Parcel Service Inc., Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., International Business Machines Corp., Essex Property Trust Inc., AmerisourceBergen Corp., Tyson Foods Inc., C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. and Altria Group Inc.

Kostin holds a year-end target on the S&amp;P 500 of 3,000, [just above the 2,980 median](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PKLW706TTDSA) of estimates from strategists tracked by Bloomberg. That would be a gain of 18 percent from Friday’s close.

&amp;#x200B;

 “Weakness in recent regional Fed surveys, the ISM manufacturing index, and China manufacturing PMIs have weighed on investor sentiment,” the report said. Stabilizing economic data in the U.S. and globally could “lift investors’ confidence regarding the longevity of the current expansion, which in July will mark its 10th anniversary (the longest since at least 1850).”",finance

personalfinance,[US] Debt consolidation @ 21,"Hey y'all,

I'm a 21 year old college student, and thus have a limited income. I obtained a credit card at the *ripe* age of 18, and thus have accrued about $4,000 in debt. My current interest rate is 24% (I know), and because of my limited income I don't make a dent in the debt at all.

I am only able to meet the minimum payments each month, which is then reapplied to the account in the form of interest. Basically, until I get out of school, I am making no progress on paying down the debt. This has of course destroyed my credit (~630), so I'm not sure if I could even find somewhere that would qualify me.

Any ideas on how to un-fuck my young and dumb mistake?",finance

personalfinance,Switching online savings accounts for higher interest - tips/advice?,"Hi PF Redditors,

I have 3 savings accounts currently with Capital One 360 (when I opened them it was ING Direct. Anyone remember them?). I'm fairly happy with them, but my husband and I have a joint account at Synchrony Bank that earns 2.20% and my Cap One 360 earns 1% (up from 0.75% last year). I've seen what the interest rate deposits are and it's quite nice to see those dollars stack up! I don't have a huge amount of money, but I would like it to ""work for me."" Liquidity is important, but I don't care about having a local branch, for that I use my checking accounts.

What's the best strategy to move my existing funds from Capital One 360 to Synchrony? I was going to keep some money with Cap One, but what's the point when the interest rate at Synchrony is double? I was thinking about contacting Capital One and just having them cut me a check for my balances to move the money myself. For those of you who have switched banks in search of better interest rates, how did you do it? Do you have any tips?

Thank you :)",finance
personalfinance,10% down or withdraw from Roth IRA to get 20% down.,"I'm in the preliminary stages of considering buying a house and am exploring a few of my options.  Ideally I would be buying later this year when my current lease is up.  

Income ~$162k

Debt ~($45k) @~4%

Expected Savings ~$30k (without touching Roth IRA)

Budget $250k-$300k

Credit Score ~780

I am estimating that closing costs/fees/inspections to be around $6k-$8k (based off of what I've seen online.)  If I'm off on this please let me know.

All of my other ducks are in a row  (emergency fund 1 year, maxed 401k, bills and debt are under control, Savings rate ~40%.)

My questions is should I look to make a 10% downpayment or should I consider pulling from my Roth IRA to increase the size of my down payment to 20%?  I will be an eligible 1st time home buyer and since the account is a Roth I can pull my contributions without being penalized.  

What math should I be considering to see if this move is worth it?  If I keep my money in the IRA I can expect ~6% roi vs. The amount I would pay in PMI, mortgage interest rate, and expected property appreciation. Everywhere I look online I see articles saying that I can, but not if I should pull from my IRA.

**EDIT:** Sounds like the consensus is I should do my best to hold off a 6-12 months to get up to 20% instead of touching the retirement account. The tax benefits of the IRA are not outweighed by home ownership.  Thanks everyone who provided constructive advice!",finance

my net income for last month was roughly $4,500. My day job i get paid hourly plus commission so it ranges month to month. In the night i drive for uber.

Expenses: Bills are about $3,480: This includes my bi monthly payment to a debt program i am currently enrolled in, rent (1,876), car insurance ($147.00), internet (110.38), Misc services such as hulu, netflix etc. (about $100.00) electricity ($40) gas utilities bill ($12)

I pay about $120 in gas and about $350 for groceries and eating out.

Credit score: 565

Details of debt: personal loan of $2,681.39 with an interest rate of 131%. I have about $35,000 that the debt program is negotiating with the creditors. They have already resolved $13,000

Each month I pay the debt program $606.

Edit: My financial situation doesn’t look too good. I am open to advice/tips on how to better manage my money and save.",finance
personalfinance,How important is building your credit score?,"When discussing certain topics, I see people mention that they do or avoid certain things for their credit score. Even stupid things like carry a balance on their credit cards to help their credit score. I understand that you should HAVE a credit score and not do anything really stupid in order to avoid having a really bad credit score, but is it really worth fussing to go from a good credit score to a really good credit score? 

&amp;#x200B;

Note, I am against paying interest on any forms of personal debt, besides my mortgage. I have had many credit cards in my life (but have never paid interest on any) and have purchased 2 houses, one with a purchase loan from a family member that was refinanced into a mortgage and another with a mortgage from the get-go. At this point, I have the mortgage to afford my house (and I think the low interest rate and the tax deduction make it worth the interest) and I use credit cards religiously, but only for convenience and to get points. I have a credit score in the mid to high 700s, but as far as I'm concerned, I really don't care what my credit score is any more. Should I be more concerned about it?",finance
personalfinance,Paying off IRS Installment Debt with a 0% Credit Card,"I am on an installment plan with the IRS. The current balance is $14,500 at 3.75% interest.

Payments are drawn from a bank account that I would like to close because, beginning in February, the bank is introducing minimum balance fees. I have accounts at a credit union that are more favorable, and have kept the bank account just for the IRS payments. Unfortunately, because of the shutdown, I cannot reach the IRS to change the account associated with this debt.

The interest rate on this debt is favorable at under 4%, but I'd like to pay off the balance for my own piece of mind. To do so, I am considering opening a new credit card. My credit score is above 750 and I am not considering any major purchases in the next year or so.

I have taken a preliminary look at available cards and am debating between two cards: (1) an all-around better credit card, with 1.5% cash back, and 0% APR for 15 months. Payments would be about $967/month ($952 if the 1.5% applies); and (2) a card with 0% APR for 18 months, and no other benefits, lowering payments to $806/month.

I can afford either payment. An extra $160/month will allow more flexibility in my monthly expenditures but isn't make-or-break for me, but then I'm left with a card with no other benefits. Alternatively, the 1.5% cash back card is better than my current 1% cash back card, outside of specific monthly promotions, and may get used after I pay off this debt.

Is my analysis correct? Is there anything I'm missing? What's your advice?",finance

personalfinance,Purchase Short-Term Disability Insurance prior to becoming pregnant (U.S.),"Some of the women in my July pregnancy group are discussing how they wished they'd taken out a short-term disability policy since they're not covered by their employers. I wanted to share as a PSA.

It may not be necessary in all states, but those whose employers don't offer short-term disability benefits to eligible employees as a taxable benefit should research whether they'll need it following the birth of a child.

Those whose employers do offer STD should make sure they're signed up for the benefit since these policies must typically be elected before your disability arises (e.g. before you become a pregnant employee) so this does require some planning and foresight.

Just as you might pay for your own healthcare, life insurance or any other kind of insurance policy, there are many  vendors (AFLAC, for example) for short-term disability insurance and each policy is different, so be sure to read the fine print. Typically, the same rule of purchasing into this benefit before you become pregnant applies. 

Many [short-term disability plans cover pregnancy and the postpartum period at 2/3 of your regular salary](https://fairygodboss.com/career-topics/short-term-disability-insurance-pregnancy-and-maternity-leave-questions-and-answers) and may last only 6-8 weeks (depending on whether you deliver your baby naturally or via Caesarean section), but better than nothing.

Short-term disability payments are a financial payment and are not related to whether an employer is required to keep your job. [FMLA](https://fairygodboss.com/career-topics/fmla-forms-eligibility-and-other-frequently-asked-questions) is the federal law requiring that employers offer up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for qualifying employees (typically those who have worked at least for one year at an employer with more than 50 employers within 75 miles of your workplace).

tl;dr: [Short-term disability insurance](https://www.policygenius.com/disability-insurance/learn/short-term-disability-insurance/) policies replace a portion of your paycheck if you can’t work due to pregnancy/childbirth. Short-term disability plans that include pregnancy protection can give you back up to 2/3 of your income that is lost should you have to leave work early to take care of yourself. The time between the disability diagnosis and when you get benefits is often just a few weeks. Make sure you're covered prior to TTC.",finance
personalfinance,I have about $4000 in credit card debt and I'm not sure where to start to get out of it+,"A year ago I took a break from school and went back after a semester off. When coming back, I realized that I now owed the school double in tuition and Perkins Loans were no longer available. I was maxed out of Stafford loans so due to the short time frame and lack of funds I very stupidly put my tuition on my credit card. I thought I'd be able to pay it off, but due to other circumstances I could no longer make more than the minimum payment and my interest rate is 24%.

I really want to get out of debt by the end of this year ideally, or at least bring it down to $1000. I've been researching and I'm thinking that opening another credit card and trying to transfer the balance would be my best bet? My score is about a 700 right now and I have two credit cards open plus student loans (I won't need to start paying student loans until June of next year). 

I have no idea what kind of card to apply for, my debt is on a Capital One card. I have no one around me who is knowledgeable in finances and I really am not a frivolous spender, I just made a stupid decision and am now trying to get out of it. I'm working part time as a server so I bring in around $300 a week.

personalfinance,Paying off large portion of mortgage,"My wife and I are in year 3 of a 30-year mortgage on a property. We got an excellent interest rate (3.125%) for a 30-year fixed.

personalfinance,"sorry it's long - job did not get back about raise, car accident, wife lost job, and more student loans than expected - advice","so on the surface i am doing well financially. for my area and compared to my friends, I am making the median household income at $35k.  I just requested for a promotion/raise, which is usually $5k-$10k depending. i am doing work outside of the degree because it was worth the raise I would be getting to switch at the time. i do work outside of my job description to save my boss money and to show loyalty and that I am a good employee with several skill sets. my boss explained that if I stuck with him, I would be making 100k before I was 30, which I would have never been able to do so early if I had stuck with my current field. I think a percentage of that amount is outside of commission but I am not sure exaclty what that is.

&amp;#x200B;

I have about 30K in student loan debt. If i could redo it, I would have went to community college, paid my way through that, and transferred out to finish a degree with the hope the majority would transfer and be accepted and live at home and commute an hour and a half while doing it, or stay at the cheap apartments with mold in them and communal showers. As it is, this is a mute point. my parents took out loans for me for the difference that I couldn't get loans for. they are keeping it in their name as to not effect my credit or life goals, this is mixed in with my other siblings debt for that same gap, which all 4 of us split evenly. It is actually cheaper for me to do it this way, and it is not directly tied to me, and is at a better interest rate than it would be under my name. the total account balance is at least 100k.

&amp;#x200B;

out of the student loans, i am covering a cheaper one for my parents per our deal, the ones under my own name, and splitting the cost of the ones in my parents name with my siblings, as they wouldn't have this debt if not for us, and we don't want them to go bankrupt. My younger brother's loans will be starting soon as he just graduated, and I have been paying the interest on that while he was in college. I have no plans to help my sibling with his direct loans as I have my own, but he does not understand that this is his responsibility (he is disabled and is fighting for social security, which my parents and I helped him apply for, but he has not received)  he was looking at part time jobs in the hopes of helping, but i know that's not feasible. he also would need me or a parent to facilitate the payment process for him. i made the mistake of cosigning for him for two loans, and now am tied to this debt, but we thought the degree would help him get a full time job and turn things around (he will go to interviews for full time positions and be shot down constantly, plus the job market is not good right now). I didn't realize how bad the situation was and would be at the time of cosigning.

&amp;#x200B;

I also pay for my own groceries, cell phone, car loan, insurance, clothes etc. my total monthly expenses with the loans in effect are 652.00, but this will raise as my brothers loans will start on the group loan, and I am concerned with his ability to pay his portion, which is what makes them all manageable. I know that if he fails to, my other siblings will feel as though they should get to pull out or not split his sum up among remaining, and my father and I would have to eat it. To be honest though, being the more responsible sibling and ally of my parents, I would probably be the one to eat it because I would make the second largest income. I also have one other sibling who will be starting college within the year, and who actually deserves to go to college. she is brilliant art wise, architecture wise, mechanically, and will be in a stem field (I don't think the rest of us necessarily should have, but my parents forced it)

&amp;#x200B;

someone hit me in my last car and totaled it (head on from the other side of the road, it was a miracle i was alive/not injured) and the insurance claim settlement was actually a loss of 2k, so i purchased a 2015 suv for 15k for 5 years at the lowest interest rate i could shop (4.2). i tried to bargain with that 2k and sent comparables to the adjuster, but was denied. this would have been my down payment. i paid cash for tags, tax, insurance, gap insurance, and an overexpensive warranty that set me back.

&amp;#x200B;

i attempted to find additional part time work on top of my full time schedule, in the hope I could log or do something CS related on weekends or on weekdays for an additional two hours/3 hours a day, but so far no bites or just fishy offers, which is why i requested a raise. the cost of living here is cheap, my parents are letting me and my wife live with them as long as I can pay a bill or two occasionally and handle the loans. my wife and I however would like to move out within the year, and have looked at houses from $130k - 175k. we are working on saving, and have so far only about $11k. I think her parents would help us a little bit, or will in time. I think feasibly we could come up with $15k-$20k between us, depending on time and her parents assisting some.

&amp;#x200B;

That was until my wife recently lost her job because the non profit she worked at disbanded. she has a masters degree and had always been able to work for universities, non profits, or museums and dabbled into publishing and corporate fields, among other things, but she has put out at least 70 applications and called in to her contacts and hasn't heard back from anything that is not contracted or part time. We are very worried about health insurance since she lost her benefits and my job doesn't come with any. her next contract is up in 3 months (no sign of renewing), and I have started calling my own contacts in the hopes that someone I know could put in word and get her through the door somewhere that is full time, benefits, and in a field she would like. However, she does know if the opportunity arose for something out of her realm and out of her degree, she would have to take it. she has two things pending for her now, but that could take 6 months to a year and would require an hour commute one way, which she would do, but definitely different than the 10 minutes it used to be.  these also might be false promises or people with good intentions that just might not pan out.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I am wondering what would be best for us, pay off my car loan as soon as possible is what I was thinking would be my best option. with the car loan gone, I wouldn't notice the student loan payments as much, and any raise I get, I would put towards this completely. I would do this also with my tax return, or split these ideas to add to my savings/down payment fund. But I am concerned that my brother will not be able to pay back his loan and drag us all down with him, and my youngest sibling will be joining and adding to the debt (unless I can convince her to do my plan looking back). i also came clean to my wife before she married me about the mess, but explained that i could handle all the bills, and we would keep her income separate, but now things are looking bleak. any advice? Anyone know of ways to make money online and being considered an employee for tax purposes, and picking out projects? My wife and I also typically buy generic and second hand now, and we stocked up on soup and ramen and cheap sandwhich fillers, we also try to have a budget for fun or bonding activities/experiences, so i feel like what we save from the little things covers this. I know i made mistakes and so has my famiy, but I am trying and I do want to give my wife stability in her time of need, even if it means waiting another 2 years to move out. I just am concerned my family will depend on me too much, and the student loans would turn into a payment as big as a second mortgage if i don't do something. any help is appreciated. Thanks for reading, sorry it is long.

I have an old employee 401k at Principal that's been sitting around and collecting dust for quite some time that's at $31,000. [Here's a snapshot of my current allocation](https://i.imgur.com/Vx6gYmc.png) (don't remember why I went with these).

Not ideal. I'm thinking the best move here would be to rollover to a traditional IRA. I could also contribute the max since I've been saving up and haven't been giving my retirement any love for a couple of years, orrrr use that to pay off some/all of my student loans below.

Loan 7 | $500 | 6.55%

It all comes out to about $13,000 which I could pay and still have a decently sized emergency fund. Monthly payment is $550.

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/01/14/russia-plans-tackle-us-sanctions-bitcoin-investment-says-kremlin/

It made me have a few interesting thoughts about how such a nation could adopt cryptocurrency into its monetary policy.  Let me know what you think. All criticism very welcome.

Say Russia buys x amount of BTC, and they then create a publically tradable token - xruble (or whatever) on the ETH blockchain (Vitalik has a relationship with Vlad or at least there is some respect towards Vitalik from Vlad).  

The Russian government then uses the ETH based token to settle payments where each token was worth a set or flexible amount of that x Bitcoin (initially pegged to fiat but allowing the amount to decrease if the price of Bitcoin increases).  Thus enabling a new gold standard (replacing gold with BTC, or introducing a hybrid valuation where the two assets are mixed in a basket to reduce the underlying volatility) with both the advantages of Bitcoin (and potentially gold) in safety and security, and the speed of Ethereum for individual settlements and the ability to create smart contracts that settle in a currency that can be exchanged for BTC (without requiring development of smart contracts on the Bitcoin network).  

This model could potentially scale up to supporting the internal payments system of an entire nation, depending on:
1) BTC's success in its store of value proposition and 
2) Ethereum's success in ensuring scalability of its network to handle the transaction volume.

The additional advantage of using an ETH token, rather than BTC directly for settlement, is that the Russian government would control the inflation model, allowing them to revalue the currency at will rather than have to rigidly stick to Bitcoins deflationary model. Also specific wallets, addresses and tokens on the ETH chain could be blacklisted, allowing the government to have a greater control of the currency than they would have than if they were using BTC directly for settlement.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Should I aggressively pay my mortgage?,"I think this really comes down to personal preference and the feelings of soundness, but I'd like to get some opinions. 

Besides my mortgage of $148k, I'm debt free. 

I pay all my bills on time, and I always pay off my CCs at the end of the month.

I am investing 15% into my retirement in my company's 401k, and they give a 6% match on top of that. I'm 30 and single, and the amount I have in my retirement seems on track for retirement at age 65. 

I'm working on trying to get my emergency fund to $6000, which I can 100% hit this year. That's 3 months of expenses. Even with that $6000 goal, I am currently somewhat aggressively paying my mortgage (about an extra $300/month), because I've just never had that big of a debt and it really bothers me.

I don't have any PMI. My interest rate is 4.1%. I've read a lot and people seem to think this is ""good"" debt. I just can't really wrap my head around any debt being good debt.

But one day, within the next two years, I think the bf and I will move in together, get a house, plan for marriage, etc. With that in mind, I don't have any savings for another down payment on a house. Should I stop aggressively paying my current mortgage to just save for the next home?

I understand there's equity in my current home, but what if I can't sell it as fast as I buy the next house, you know what I mean?

TL;dr Most of my finances are in order, so should I aggressively pay my currently mortgage or save for the next house?

China would suffer bad if the US dollar crashed, as we own them a shit ton of bonds. China is not committed completely on crypto yet except that many many companies control it. Bitmain is suffering right now and closing offices, because of dirt cheap bitcoin. So China is losing control of crypto. Also Russia is buying a shit ton of Yuan so if their economies both tank it will be bonfire of cash. China will be holding even more US dollars from selling Yuan to Russia.

Trump has supported the oil and gas industry unquestionably. Why? Because we are #1 in storage and production in the world.

investing,Shorting Strategies as a moral imperative,"(copied from Barron's)

## Blame the Bankers for Bad Corporate Behavior -- Barrons.com

4:16 pm ET January 4, 2019 (Dow Jones) Print

Blame the Bankers for Bad Corporate Behavior -- Barrons.com

By Bill Alpert 

In 2010, Carson Block pioneered the activist short-selling tactic  of publishing detailed critiques of companies he considered frauds. His  firm, Muddy Waters, helped puncture that era's bubble of dubious Chinese  companies that evaded scrutiny by listing their stock via shell  companies on U.S. exchanges. Some five years later, Block started a  hedge fund (by the same name) that applies the activist short strategy  of publicly calling out the bad behavior of companies and individuals.  Last month -- at the KASE Learning Shorting Conference organized by  investor Whitney Tilson -- Block proposed a new moral initiative: Knock  out Wall Street's support for companies that significantly hurt the  public. Shorts should call out the bankers, analysts, and fund managers  who enable toxic businesses, said Block. Barron's caught up with Block  recently to ask him about his muscular version of investing according to  environmental, social, and governance factors. 

You burst on  the scene by writing some of the first ""activist short seller"" reports  that critiqued U.S.-listed China stocks like Orient Paper -- a  NYSE-listed stock that ultimately collapsed. 

Carson Block: I  put that Orient Paper report out there, and that opened the door to  this wide world of China frauds listed in the U.S. The success of our  Orient Paper report, and the next one on Rino International \[ticker:  RINO\] created a bunch of competitors. We were all sprinting to expose  these things. 

Rino was delisted and its executives were  barred after settling SEC fraud charges (without admitting guilt).  Orient Paper disputed your accusations and the SEC closed the  investigation with no enforcement action -- but the company's sales have  eroded steadily. 

After doing that for about two years, I  realized that the conflicts of interest that enabled these frauds from  China to list in the U.S. are really the same conflicts that pervade the  stock market. So we started looking at companies outside of China. The  dysfunctions caused by conflicts of interest and evil management exist  everywhere. 

You've had successes, and some high-profile disappointments -- like your 2012 short of Singapore-based commodities firm Olam International (O32.Singapore). 

They got bailed out multiple times by the investment company  Temasek. The stock ultimately went up because of the bailouts. So we  were right, but the short didn't make money over the long term. 

The vast majority of the things that we publicly short do go down  over the medium and long term. We've got a track record that matches  anybody's on the long side, in terms of hit rates. And that's during a  10-year bull market. 

How do you operate today? Are you a conventional hedge fund? 

Through 2015, we didn't manage outside capital. Then in late 2015, I  launched Muddy Waters Capital LLC, which manages private funds --  otherwise known as hedge funds. The strategy is primarily an activist  short-selling strategy. We've institutionalized the business. It is  still a small firm. We manage about $200 million. 

We still  go public with our theses. But there have been developments in the past 8  1/2 years that have made things a little bit more challenging. The  human attention span hasn't gotten longer. We used to be under the  impression that people maybe read the first three to five pages of the  report. These days, I don't know if people even get through the first  three to five sentences. So we made video reports for two of our shorts.  You should check out the one on [OSI](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=223329) Systems \[[OSI](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=223329)S\] from December on our website. 

Instead of presenting a new short idea at the KASE conference, you made a morality play. 

I thought it would be a great platform to discuss something that  I've been thinking about for a while, which is morality-based activist  short selling. 

Crusading shorts like yourself always appear to feel as if you are serving a moral purpose. 

Most short theses are about companies that are hiding the ball from  investors -- so there are definitely crusading elements to exposing  that. But the kind of companies that I'm thinking of for morality-based  short campaigns are companies that traumatize people -- not the  investors who own them, but people that have no relationship to the  stock. If we can effectively remove financial incentives and ensure that  the perpetrators of egregious acts make less money than they hoped,  then we are doing something good. Banks are going to look more  skeptically at raising money for companies that could be doing things  that are toxic. Analysts will be quicker to drop coverage. 

So while activist short sellers have been very healthy for the market,  and a force for good, this would have wider societal benefits than just  keeping the market from getting dirtier than it already is. 

You mentioned a few companies at the KASE conference that you considered  examples. One was AAC Holdings (AAC), which owns American Addiction  Centers and in 2016 settled a criminal case in California over the death  of a client. It agreed to a civil fine and an injunction requiring  quality improvements. 

Yes, there was a death at one of their  facilities. That's a situation where the brakes need to be applied and  investors need to say, ""I want to look into this. Maybe I shouldn't own  stock in a company that is operating so poorly."" 

You also  cited Insys Therapeutics (INSY), a maker of a synthetic opioid spray  that literally killed patients who used it to overdose. You noted that  Wall Street defended the stock even after Insys started to settle  government lawsuits about the drug's marketing, and as doctors and  former employees were pleading guilty to kickback schemes that promoted  the drug. 

Insys agreed to settle a federal criminal  investigation in August, and its former CEO just agreed to plead guilty  to conspiracy and fraud. 

I pointed to the past actions of  these firms' former employees, but I was never short either AAC or  Insys. Their shares are in the dirt now, and I have no view on their  current business practices, so I'm not saying that they are or aren't  shorts, here. 

How does Wall Street enable bad behavior? 

When the media reports on a company that has been doing something  evil, the rationale usually given is the company's pursuit of corporate  profits. But that's pretty nebulous. What is really happening is that  the senior executives become fabulously wealthy on paper, because of  their equity ownership. And in many cases they can monetize that  ownership. 

So if we're in the capital markets buying the  stock, we are providing the incentives for that bad behavior to  continue. I don't expect investors to know that a company is evil before  it makes the news. But once it gets out there that this company could  be doing something that is actually awful, investors have a moral  obligation to really research it. 

I don't mean just call the  management and ask them about it. Because if a management is doing  something awful, then lying to you in a phone call is just a drop in the  ocean. So, actually look into it. 

Other steps in your moral activism program would involve reaching out to sell-side analysts and bankers? 

This is really about the individuals, not the institutions. So once  the market is on notice, a short activist should try to reach out to  the buy-side people who control a position and reach out to the  sell-side analysts. Appeal to them directly. 

If I come away  feeling like the person on the other end of the phone is basically in  denial of the obvious -- and that person doesn't subsequently sell, or  downgrade, the stock -- then I think I should name that person publicly.  I should say that I spoke to Joan Smith and showed her my evidence. She  hasn't sold the stock, and that's a problem. She is enabling these guys  to continue to be well-paid while they continue whatever bad acts I've  accused them of doing. 

My goal in naming individuals is that  some accountability be imposed on them. I hope that their family will  come across these things on the internet and say, ""Gee mom, I see here  that you appear to be helping this evil company. Is that true?"" Try  explaining it to your kids. 

We are talking about people who  are acting legally; but we are trying to disabuse everybody of the  illusion that their actions in the capital markets don't add to these  negative impacts. They do. 

What sort of bad behavior would merit this kind of campaign? 

Certainly not one-off kind of events, accidental, one rogue  lower-level employee...but rather a harmful activity that a company's  business is predicated on. Then you have a moral obligation to sell, if  you are long the stock. And if you are a sell-side analyst, you have a  moral obligation to either take the Buy off the stock or drop coverage. 

People criticize fossil-fuel companies, gun makers, cigarette  companies, opioid makers -- where is it important to go active? 

Investing has always been amoral. To move investing from an amoral  point to one where morality is occasionally applied as a filter, we have  to start with the things that 90% to 95% of people in the investment  industry would agree are evil. Fossil-fuel companies wouldn't rise to  that standard. Tobacco companies wouldn't rise to that standard. But  certain health-care companies would. 

You have all of these  health-care parasites that are out there ripping off the system or  ripping off individuals. They are narrowing access to health care. And  that is impacting people's lives, because they can't get access to  necessary health care for themselves or their kids. 

Or else  companies whose corner-cutting results in serious injury or death. Those  definitely rise to that level. We need to start with these practices  where the vast majority of investors would agree that it is an evil  behavior. 

You mentioned AAC, now a micro-cap, and Insys,  whose stock has dropped tenfold. Do you have any that you're looking at  now that might invite this activist approach?",finance
personalfinance,"Does increasing my credit limit, with two new credit cards, by $8,500 help my credit score?","Background, before all the current events of the past week. 
Things are a bit complicated as a family member, whom I trust completely, basically created (with my permission) multiple credit cards in my name and used them for themselves/bills. 

We are down to 7 cards at a moment that I don't have control of and 1 that I am in complete control of (you could say it was my first credit card). Not so long ago, a couple years ago I believe, usage across those 7+ cards (some were later paid and closed) was like 99%!! But then as each card got a payment my credit score kept climbing and climbing, at least a point a week. I was even able to buy a new car a few years ago with an insanely low interest rate. 

My total credit card use across all cards is around $13,000 out of $29,075. I have around $10,000 left on car loan. Current average age of all accounts is 7 years, 6 months with the oldest four being 12-13 years each. 

My credit score hovers around 700 which is decent but not great imo. 

I *try* to do things smartly but I feel even I am impulsive and can make mistakes. I think this one *might* have turned out well though.
I had a few incidents that came up that needed me to rack up around $1,300 in credit card balance for my main credit card. With no way to pay it before incurring interest, which I never want to do. So I, stupidly, opened up a new credit card with the same bank hoping to transfer the balance to the new account which has 15 months no interest on balance transfers or purchase. Except I didn't realize...you can't do balance transfers with the same bank. AND they only gave me a $500 credit limit (because of my annual income is low right now) GRRR. At least I can transfer the credit limit from my other card which is around $5500 so I have some interest free purchase power for a year. Then, stupidly, I also asked them for a credit card limit raise which got denied. 

So then I decided to go for broke and apply for an American Express which also has free balance transfer/interest free for 15 months. I got approved...for $8,000!!!

Did the increased limit help offset the 3 hard credit checks and reduced credit card age? Credit Karma says hard inquiries are low impact, credit age is medium impact, and credit card usage is high impact.

CryptoCurrency,"Some thoughts about the ""Russian government buying Bitcoin"" article in The Telegraph - 14th Jan 2019 v3","Whether or not this article is BS: 

[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/01/14/russia-plans-tackle-us-sanctions-bitcoin-investment-says-kremlin/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/01/14/russia-plans-tackle-us-sanctions-bitcoin-investment-says-kremlin/)

It made me have a few interesting thoughts about how such a nation could adopt cryptocurrency into its monetary policy. Let me know what you think. All criticism very welcome.

Say Russia buys x amount of BTC, and they then create a publically tradable token - xruble (or whatever) on the ETH blockchain (Vitalik has a relationship with Vlad or at least there is some respect towards Vitalik from Vlad):

[https://medium.com/@omosanzalettere/vitalik-buterin-putins-useful-genius-37cab1bb12e3](https://medium.com/@omosanzalettere/vitalik-buterin-putins-useful-genius-37cab1bb12e3)

The Russian government could then use the ETH based token to settle payments where each token was worth a set or flexible amount of that x Bitcoin (initially pegged to fiat but allowing the amount to decrease if the price of Bitcoin increases). Thus enabling a new gold standard (replacing gold with BTC, or introducing a hybrid valuation where the two assets are mixed in a basket to reduce the underlying volatility) with both the advantages of Bitcoin (and potentially gold) in safety and security, and the speed of Ethereum for individual settlements and the ability to create smart contracts that settle in a currency that can be exchanged for BTC (without requiring development of smart contracts on the Bitcoin network).

This model could potentially scale up to supporting the internal payments system of an entire nation, depending on:

1) BTC's success in its store of value proposition and  
2) Ethereum's success in ensuring scalability of its network to handle the transaction volume.  
 

The additional advantage of using an ETH token, rather than BTC directly for settlement, is that the Russian government could control the inflation model, allowing them to revalue the currency at will rather than have to rigidly stick to Bitcoins deflationary model. Also specific wallets, addresses and tokens on the ETH chain could be blacklisted, allowing the government to have a greater control of the currency than they would have than if they were using BTC directly for settlement.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Life insurance worth getting if you are super wealthy?,"My uncle recently sold his business for a good chunk of change.  After taxes, he has around $50 million in liquid assets (cash, stocks and bonds).  He is considering whether it is worth it to purchase whole life insurance, with the primary idea that the proceeds can help pay his estate taxes when he passes, and of course reducing his final estate taxes.  He is 62 years old, and has a wife and a daughter.  We are pretty close, and I'm helping him with some initial analysis, and I just want to flesh out my idea with reddit and hopefully get some comments.

&amp;#x200B;

His whole life insurance annual premium is expected to be roughly $65,000/year for a $4 million death benefit.  His current net worth puts him wealth above the $22.8 million threshold for a married couple where the federal estate tax will set in.  From my understanding, the beneficiary of the life insurance will receive the proceeds income tax free.  However, if my uncle owns the policy, the death benefit is included in his taxable estate - unless the money goes to his wife.  When death benefits go directly or indirectly to his daughter, the money will be included in his taxable estate.

&amp;#x200B;

A way that he can get around having the death benefit being added to his estate is by opening the insurance policy under his daughter's name (i.e. she's the owner of the policy).  Both him and his wife can each gift both the daughter and her husband $15k annually tax-free ($30k per person for a total of $60k) to help offset the cost of paying of the insurance premium.  This way, they are the beneficiary and owner of the policy, and the death benefit will not be added to my uncle's estate.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the only reason why a high net worth would have estate tax that his/her estate couldn't pay is if their estate is illiquid (meaning, they have a family business or a farm or something like that), which might require a fire sale at bad prices in order to pay off the estate taxes.  For my uncle's case, the bulk of his assets are liquid, which can be easily sold for cash to pay the taxes.  Could his situation be better off if he take the insurance premiums and invest it instead?

&amp;#x200B;",finance
personalfinance,W2 and W4 not in agreement. Who's on the hook?,"I worked a summer job for two months in 2018, making $848.16 in gross wages. I was asked to fill out a W4 one week in, and when I did I very deliberately put down 0 allowances because I wanted to owe the federal government $0 come tax season. I have a digital record of this provided to me through the employee portal where pay stubs can be accessed. (See redacted version [here](https://i.imgur.com/66XE6N8.png).)

When I received my first paycheck last summer, I was surprised by just how little of my gross income appeared to be being withheld for federal taxes. I asked my employer if this was correct. She said she believed it was so. This was her first year in operation and she was still learning the ropes. She said she *thought* she had it correct, and did not make any adjustments despite my prodding. This Q&amp;A repeated the next paycheck and the next, after which point I gave up asking about it. I left the job shortly after.

I received my W2 from this employer yesterday evening. It says that only $31.23 was ever withheld in federal income tax. This matches what is reported on the pay stubs for the weeks worked. Doing the math, $31.23 out of $848.16 seems astonishingly low, at only 3.68%.

Q1. When I file my taxes *(I am still waiting for my current primary job to send out their W2s)*, am I going to owe the federal government money?

Q2. If I do in fact end up owing any money, given the W4 I filed in July who is in the wrong here / who is on the hook for the missing federal taxes -- me or my summer job employer?

Q3. If my employer is the legally responsible party, what is my next best course of action? Pay the missing taxes and *then* seek compensation, or hold off on filing taxes until this is sorted out? Approach my summer job employer and discuss the matter, or go straight to a lawyer? Should a lawyer even be involved over such a small sum of money or should I go to small claims court? Or should I just pay the missing taxes and save myself a lot of lost time and grief since the amount in question is, for me, going to be so small?",finance

personalfinance,Financial Aid for Federal Employees,"I’ve been in the banking industry for about 13 years and this is the 1st time I’ve done loans for government employees in mass.

If you weren’t already aware, and are a government employee, most banks and credit unions offer loans, lines of credits, and credit cards for furloughed federal employees. 

I work for a local credit union and we’re offering credit card increases without running credit. Personal loans with reduced interest and no payments until pay resumes. And existing loans to be deferred indefinitely.

I lot of these employees are only hearing of this through would of mouth as most banks don’t promote this info. 

Hope it helps :)

Edit: I should have mentioned, every Financial Institution (FI) has their own policies and underwriting guidelines. Different documents may be required depending on the FI.

Edit 2: For those of you looking for help, the easiest way to find out is contacting your current bank. 

If your bank doesn’t offer anything, google the following: “government shutdown relief X” X being the city you live in. When I do it in my area, our credit union is the 2nd link, the 1st being a news article about banks that are helping in the area.",finance

If so, curious as to what you think a hedged investment strategy for a medium-long term horizon is. Some primary (and certainly not all) factors to contemplate:

&amp;#x200B;

**The Bad:**

* Stock Market being generally overvalued &amp; ripe for correction
* Corporates using tax cuts to repurchase &amp; inflate stock prices instead of creating jobs (as POTUS intended)
* Interest Rate increases depreciating bonds
* Love him or hate him, Trump destabilizing the fuck out of our country (trade, steel, NATO, Russia)
* Student Loan Crisis
* Seems like we are at the top/precipitous peak of all valuations

&amp;#x200B;

**The Good:**

* Everything has a fraction of the leverage as they did in 2008, so less risk.
* Commercial Real Estate is healthy
* Equities will always go up on an infinite time horizon, right? RIGHT!?
* Equities are on sale AF right now

&amp;#x200B;

**Strategies?:**

* Start divesting non-retirement holdings, allocate to high-yield savings until the smoke clears
* Fuck it and continue DCA'ing (or accelerate drip amount if equities start sliding down)
* Move to South America

solar,Help Deciding on Bids,"Hi r/solar,

I'm located in Illinois and I am currently debating between a few bids. I have one through a local installer and another from Tesla. We have some truly incredibly incentives right now through an ""SREC"" program that will offset nearly 30% of the cost of installation in addition to the 30% Federal ITC and 1:1 net metering up to 110% of our last 12 months usage through our utility.

&amp;#x200B;

The Tesla bid is the most price aggressive at $3.45/W with a system size of 5.53kW. I'm also a Model 3 owner so I would receive a 25 year warranty on all components of the system, apparently including labor. Their panels are rated at 19.4% efficiency with up to .5% degradation a year. 25 year estimate is 87.5% efficiency.

&amp;#x200B;

The other bid I'm looking at comes out to roughly $3.19/W with a system size of 6.50kW. These are Panasonic panels (I suppose like the Tesla ones) with a 19.8% efficiency rating, .25% degradation every year with 90.76% efficiency at 25 years. This bid is 10 years labor, 20 years rack, 10 years inverter, 25 years panel.

&amp;#x200B;

Both quotes cover at least 110% of my historical usage, though I just bought a Model 3 last month, so I estimate my energy consumption will increase by roughly 100-120kWh a month.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? Any experiences with these companies and thoughts on these bids? My initial reaction is that the Tesla deal is better largely because of the wararnty. Even though the output numbers aren't as impressive I have a feeling some kind of failure in the system (inverter or otherwise) is likely and probably expensive. I think the one thing I'll miss with Tesla will be very detailed historical reporting and per-panel analysis like you can get with some systems.

I may shop around for a SunPower quote (though I know it will likely be a hefty price premium on both these sytems).",energy
personalfinance,Advice on how to aggressively pay back 6.2k by the end of the year,"Hi everyone,

I am about 6.2k in debt and looking to pay it off very quickly (by December at the latest). I was wondering if anyone had any advice or tips they would like to add to my plan. Here is my breakdown:

Credit Card: $1300 (highest interest)
Personal Loan: $1000 (second highest interest)
Student Loan: $3800 (lowest interest rate, less than 5%)

I just graduated college and start my job mid-February. Should make around 2.1k a month after taxes. I will be paid bi-weekly, so my plan is to pay $300/per paycheck to my credit card bill first. Once that is paid off, $300 per paycheck towards the personal loan and so on. I know it is typically suggested to pay the lowest bill first, but the credit card bill is costing me more money (in interest).

I’m currently living with my parents (bc I am determined to pay off these loans first). Other bills are as follows: phone ($90), car insurance ($115), whatever bill I have to pay while living with my parents ($100-125 max), grocery ($50 per week max. I’m trying to live as frugally as possible).

Am I missing anything with my plan? Anyone have any other tips or suggestions? Was thinking of setting up an auto-transfer of $20 to my savings just so I could have an emergency fund in general. Any other cool tips like this that have worked for you would be greatly appreciated!!!

personalfinance,"First-time homebuyer, do I qualify for a mortgage?","I'm 23, employed full-time (1 year), earn just above the median income (\~$50k) for my area, have a 740 credit score with a 5-year credit history, \~30k in student loans ($400/month) and \~$5k in credit card debt.  No savings as I've been using it to pay down credit card debt.

Currently, I pay \~$525/month in rent and live with 2 roommates.  Our lease ends in June, and they're both moving out of state, so I'll be on my own.  I'm not interested in finding new roommates.  I anticipate my rent will then become \~$900-$1200/month for a one-bedroom apartment.

I've found houses I like on Zillow for $100-150k, and plan to stay in the area for the foreseeable future.  They all need a bit of updating/work, but appear to be in livable condition.  Zillow estimates that my mortgage payment would be approximately the same as what the rent payment would be, given I put $6k down (if I go down to making minimum credit card payments, I'll be able to save this before June, but it would leave me with a higher credit card balance accruing higher interest for longer).

I like the idea of owning a home more than renting an apartment.  I realize it comes with maintenance, but I'm fairly handy (my parents had us very involved in the multi-year renovation of our childhood home, and I'm capable of fixing basic leaks, identifying electrical problems, etc.), so not worried about that.

The real question is, do I qualify for a mortgage with 4-6% down?  And, though I've been reading about first-time homebuyer incentives, I'd like to hear anyone's personal, first-hand experience.  The whole world of mortgages and lending and federal incentives is foreign to me.

I have not checked to see if I pre-qualify for anything yet because I still have 5 more months until I'm moving, and I don't want the hard check on my credit report until it's something I have confidence will be possible.",finance
personalfinance,Post 9/11 GI Bill pays for school but should I get a student loan to pay off extra debt?,"I’m currently a full time student at a public state university. My Post 9/11 GI Bill covers most of my school cost with the exception of books and parking pass. Between the housing allowance from the GI Bill, monthly payments from the VA for service connected disability and a part time job, I live pretty comfortably and bring home about $3K monthly. I still owe about $14K on my car and have about $5K in credit card debt that’s negatively impacting my credit score (One card is almost maxed and the other is halfway there). I know these are pretty meager debts in comparison to some other people but I’d really like to buy a house by the end of the year and get out of my not-so-great neighborhood. I can’t get a VA loan right now so I have to save enough for a down payment and closing costs which I figure would be between $4-7K. Sorry, that was just some background for you.

I recently applied for FAFSA for the current and upcoming school year in hopes to qualify for a Pell Grant which I would put all towards my debt. I didn’t qualify for Pell, probably because the tax returns I had to use were still from my active duty military time. I did qualify for federal loans. For the Fall and Spring semester I qualified for a $2,750 Federal Direct Sub Loan as well as a $3,500 Federal Direct Unsub Loan which gives me $6,250 for each semester, $12,500 total. I know it seems counterproductive to pay off debt with a debt but, from what I’ve read, the government will pay the interest while I’m in school and I don’t have to start payments until I’m out of school and hopefully I have will have enough saved up to pay off a chunk of it by that point. This is a lot of money that could really help me but I hear so many student loan horror stories and I don’t want to screw myself over for the future. This would be a one time deal for me as I don’t want to have $20K+ debt hanging over my head especially if I decide to do grad school in the future (that would add even more since I’d be out of the GI bill by that point). 

I’m looking for any thoughts or insights someone may have to help me make the decision as to whether or not I should take on these loans? Thank you in advance.

I figure my options are as follows:

1. Continue to pay the minimum as the monthly payment is barely noticeable;

2. Pay the entire balance now to save on the interest and divert the payments that I would be making on loans back into my emergency savings until I feel comfortable;

3. Pay a portion of the balance (probably half) to decrease the total interest without obliterating my savings and continue making the minimum payment after the lump payment; or

4. As I’m comfortable with my savings as is, divert the amount I save in that particular account ($200 per month) into my student loans to lessen the overall interest and length of payoff  while not withdrawing from my current savings account. 

I know number 1 is not reasonable because the interest rate is so high, so I know I’ll end up doing 2, 3, or 4, or a combination. I’m sure this a common problem so I was wondering if anyone had a similar situation and how they faced it. 

I appreciate you taking the time read and I hope you all have a wonderful night.

TL;DR Not sure if I should pay off my student loans in full or simply contribute more each month till the loan is paid off.",finance
personalfinance,Needing Budgeting Advice.,"First off, I’m a Union Sprinkler Fitter - Apprentice in rural Georgia. I’m about to “turn out” where I’ll be making $32.00/Hour. Excellent money, yes. As of right now, I make $25.00/hour.

I’m currently $7,000 in credit card debt, split (un)equally between 4 cards.... 
* JUST got approved for a card for balance transfer as I’m typing this - but only approved for $750 balance transfer. Unfortunately.

I messed up 2 years ago, I co-signed with my buddy on a vehicle to help him start up his company, his credit caused him to have around an 18% interest rate, he’s missed one payment due to late fee’s accrued because his bank was taking the money out late - or so he says, still owes roughly $21,000 on a $27,000 loan.

I bought a car, for my sister, she makes payments and currently owes $4,600.

My truck has $16,200 left on it, and I may roughly $400 a month on it with a %4.5 interest rate.


Anyways, with all this being said I pay roughly $1,300$-1,400  a month in bills (Rent, cable/internet, cellphone, power/utilities, truck, etc) not counting credit card payments.

I need a plan, to pay these cards off, hopefully get the unwanted vehicle out of my name, then start chipping away at my truck...",finance
personalfinance,Trying to clear the runway for retirement in 10 years and possible reduction in income soo,"Hello all.  48yo.  My company may be downsizing me in the next year or so, and there is a possibility I may not find a new position with the same salary I am making now.  I was doing pretty well attacking my budget until I went a little crazy about 18 months ago and splurged on a new vehicle. 

My big hitters right now are a mortgage with about 10 years left, a 30k HELOC from some repair work that hit me a few years ago, the car payment, and about 8k in credit card debt. At the moment, the highest interest rates are the credit cards, and the HELOC.  

So, I am considering taking two steps. Aggressive, and probably stupid.  First up, the HELOC has enough room to absorb the credit card.  The card has a 13% rate, while the HELOC has 7%. I will also be able to combine my principal overpayments into one $800 monthly payment. So I will be basically paying about the same, but dropping the rate from 13% on some to 7%. Is that smarter than stopping the overpayments on the HELOC, and just attacking the credit card?

Next is the stupid thought. I currently max out my 401k yearly. Company matches 4%.  Should I consider lowering my contribution to the match, and then using the extra $15k to chunk down my debt?  I’m still trying to figure out the tax hit for not putting that money away too. I have about $550k in my 401k, plus I’ll have a home worth about $150k.  I’d realistically like to retire or semi-retire by 60.  So that gives me just over a decade to do what I can.  I don’t have any fancy aspirations for retirement. Just me, my dog, and a used RV chasing the sun. 

Finally, as I started with, my current position will probably be gone soon.  3 months?  2 years?  I am not sure, but who is?  I am trying to maximize what I can with my current salary, before I may be forced to take a lesser one.  I know people will ask, I’m in IT, my skill set is based around a lot of technology that is going overseas, and at my age, I’m not looking forward to suddenly being a road warrior consultant chasing the contracts.  I can always hope for the best, but I am trying to be conservatively realistic.",finance

personalfinance,Spousal Inheritance Advice,"Wife’s aunt just passed away this past weekend. My wife is sole beneficiary. Properties, ameritrade acct, and some other assets equal out to aprox 800k. 

Currently we have only two sources of debt. We just built a house, 540k mortgaged at 4.2% 30y. 

Second form is my medical school debt which was acquired prior to marriage.  On REPAYE plan and we’re planning on paying the minimum until REPAYE is done so 17 years away. Actual interest rate is 6.9% and total is now up to 330k. We currently pay about 1300 a mo there. 

My income is 250k yearly and my wife is a homemaker and we have two young kids. 6wks and 2.5y. My retirement account between ex savings, 401k and stock is at 150k. I have been working for 3 years outside of residency and am 35yo. About 30k in savings for emergency fund.  

Im in still in shock over this and this post is mainly to get some outside input in to how to proceed. I am not sure how to approach my wife but I think her general idea is to invest it all and not touch it to pay for kids education etc in future. My knee jerk reaction would be to try and pay off my student loan completely and the rest towards our mortgage to be almost completely debt free. Allowing us to then use entire income towards investments. I am afraid of sounding selfish for bringing up the student loan as it is not a joint debt as it was acquired prior to marriage but obviously its our scariest debt. Who knows if the REPAYE system will even work in the long run with how our govt is functioning these days. 

So what are some ideas as the way to go here? Zero out debt and move forward using current income or stash away the funds and continue how we are currently?",finance

gaming,Microtransactions,"This is obviously something that has been very prevalent in the gaming community over the past few years and is only becoming more and more common. Companies charging 60 dollars for a game only for there to be pay to win and endless cosmetic content only accessible if you give them more money.

But one thing I have failed to understand over the course of this terrible trend is, if gamers are so fed up with this, why is it becoming more and more common? If you don’t like the micro transactions, DONT buy them, and/or don’t buy the game period. The Call of Duty’s, the battlefields, the assassins creeds, all of these games continue to sell year after year and have progressively become more and more about selling as much as possible every year and less about quality. These microtransactions give these developers excuses to put out less quality content at launch and nickel and dime you to improve your experience.

I understand that some of these games have become so deeply rooted that people will still buy them without knowledge of these terrible features. But if you don’t like what a company is doing with a game, it’s simple. Don’t buy it. And eventually they will get the message.

I think gaming communities in general should make a conscious effort to buy and play games that are truly finished products with no strings attached. I am tired of seeing game franchises like battlefield, that at one point were quality finished games, put out garbage with more and more content being stuck behind extra fees. 

Consumers are the reason that this terrible trend continues to stick around. Stop spending money on in game junk and stop buying games that want to try and sell it to you.",technology

personalfinance,Looking to put $50 of every paycheck away. Best way to maximize it?,"I am looking to put $50 away from every paycheck. I get paid bi-weekly and I want to set up an auto deposit and make it an out of sight out of mind type of deal. But I need to have it accessible in case I need to pull it at any time.  

I am wondering what or where the best place to put my money is? should I just put it into a savings account I have with my bank that does not accrue interest? Should I look into these online banks that have High yield interest savings accounts but want minimum deposits or balances to keep interest rates? Should I put it into a CD?

personalfinance,Saving for a Down Payment: Buy this year and pay PMI or save for one more year and pay no PMI.,"My wife and I live in a HCOL area and are looking to buy soon. We'll have about $50,000 for a down payment by the time our current lease is up this year. We're currently able to set aside about $3,000 per month for a down payment and a conservative home that fits our needs will probably be around $400,000. Here are our two scenarios:

1. We buy this year. In this scenario, we will pay PMI, but continue to overpay our mortgage by roughly $2,000/month (the net amount left over after adding taxes, insurance, and PMI to the overall monthly cost, minus our current rent payment). Based on a standard amortization schedule with a mortgage interest rate of 4.75% APR, it would take almost exactly 12 months to bring the balance of the mortgage below $320,000 to remove PMI.

2. We save for one more year. In this scenario, we will have the $80,000 for a 20% down payment and avoid PMI altogether. In this scenario, we start out with a mortgage of $320,000 on the same month that Scenario 1 hits $320,000.

It looks like a wash. Either scenario results in the same outcome. However, a few other factors to consider:

1. Interest rates will likely be higher a year from now, which will mean Scenario 2 will be more expensive in the long run.

2. Despite the housing market slowing down a bit, values will likely be higher a year from now as well, so we'd have to settle for less house or be willing to pay more on the sticker price.

3. Since we're probably near the peak of the current housing cycle, maybe it's better to wait to buy (even longer than just one more year). However:

4. My area (Washington DC metro area) will have a huge influx of jobs over the next several years with Amazon coming into the area, which would likely temper/eliminate any potential housing price downturn that could happen in the US as a whole.

Given the possibilities and the scenarios above, it seems like the smart choice would be to buy this year as long as we plan on staying in the area for a while.

personalfinance,Are IRA contributions based on Total Gross Income or Fed Taxable Gross Income?,[deleted],finance
personalfinance,Am I wrong to think I should have a higher credit limit from Capital One?,"Some brief background: I messed up my student loans, got lazy, forgot to repay them, they went into default, and my credit score was badly damaged. Four years ago, I went through the federal loan rehabilitation program and my loans were put back into good standing. My history of missed payments has since disappeared from my credit report. I began rebuilding my credit and in the spring of 2017, I got a Capital One Platinum card with a $500 limit to begin building a credit history.

I make all of my payments on time, have a very low utilization, and don't carry a balance. I use my card like a debit card and only buy things I can already afford. In September, I asked Capital One for a limit increase and was given a limit of $1500.

Fast forward to today. My score is roughly 744 and I decided I wanted a card with some rewards. I applied and was approved for the Capital One Quicksilver card with a limit of $1000. I feel this seems a bit low for someone with a good score and 100% on time payments. Is it because my credit history is only two years old? Is Capital One being stingy because of my originally poor credit from years ago? Again, I'm not being financially irresponsible, but having a bigger limit is important because it improves your credit score and gives you a bigger buffer for emergencies. Having a $2500 total credit limit across two cards is a bit disappointing. Do you think Capital One would increase my limit again if I called even though they just increased my limit on my other card in September? What might happen if I applied for another card from another lender? I know you're not supposed to apply for multiple cards at once. It's frustrating because I was planning on making a fairly large purchase (~$2200) and instead of reaping the rewards on the full purchase, I'll have to split it up into multiple purchases because the limit on the Quicksilver card is so low.",finance

bonds,Could someone help me understand corp bonds vs. treasury ratios and trends?,"Adam Robinson has made some tweets about how he likes to simplify his market trending metrics down to just a few important ones.

He currently tracks LQD (a corporate bond ETF) and IEF (7-10 year treasury bonds).

""A bond trader who’s bullish on the economy will buy corporate bonds and sell treasuries as a hedge (just in case the interest rates rise – causing the bonds to go down in value)""

""So just take a ratio of LQD/IEF – this will tell you what bond traders think of the economy. When they disagree seriously with equity/stock traders, the bond traders are right, and early.""

""Want to understand our economy's health? Forget employment, trade wars, consumer confidence, yield curves, or price of oil. There's ONE KEY VARIABLE. In a HEALTHY economy, US 10-year yields should be INCREASING. They recently bounced off 1-year LOWS. ANYTHING ELSE IS NOISE.""

""To clarify, if our economy were healthy, companies would be looking to the future positively, borrowing money in anticipation of increased economic activity, and so bidding up long-term interest rates. US 10Y yields recently hit 1-year lows; Japan &amp; Germany, 2-year lows.""

Now what I'm unclear on is if the -trend- is what matters, or the absolute position of these values.

Basically, 10 year treasuries being sold down mean we've been bullish for a while, but they are about to start increasing now because they bounced off the bottom?

Also, looking at IEF, it doesn't show a clear downward trend, so I'm trying to get an idea of how this ratio works since the chart doesn't show the yield - just the current value/return I think.

I'm mostly trying to understand what the current treasury indicators mean to most people (based on Adam's tweets), and what the correct investment/hedging strategy would be now.",finance

The gas mileage has been phenomenal I only spend about $25 a week in gas, but I don't trust the car at all after the engine damage it had previously and the warranty is not going to last for much longer.

So my dad recently contacted me and said he wants me to have a 98 Chevy truck that has recently had a rebuilt engine that runs great but it needs a few little things here and there, the registration paid (California it costs a lot) and insurance which is about half of the cost of the Cruze, so I am no longer in dire need of this car.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 31 and make $75k/year (before taxes). I'm not married and have no kids (and no plans for kids), but live with my boyfriend. We don't have combined finances, but we split everything 50/50. I spent a lot of my 20s in school, so, I feel a little behind in retirement savings, though I know it could be worse. I started a new job in October that bumped me up to my current salary, before this I was making $62k. My current retirement savings are:

&amp;#x200B;

$25k in a traditional 401k from the job I left in October (I will probably move this over to a Vanguard traditional 401k)

$11k in a Roth IRA (I'm now contributing the max to this)

$16k in a traditional 401k with my current job (I worked for the company I'm with now immediately out of grad school, making very little, so, I contributed most of this during my previous employment with my current employer)

&amp;#x200B;

My current situation: My employer contributes 6% to the traditional 401k. This isn't based on matching or anything, I get it regardless of what else I do. I contribute an additional 10%. Currently, this 10% is going into a Roth 401k (also through my current employer). I did this because I listened to a Suze Orman podcast that convinced me that we're at historically low tax rates, so, Roths make sense. However, the more research I do, the more unsure I am of that decision. My federal tax bracket seems to push me in both directions (depending on what I read). I do live in a high tax state (MN). I'm from another state, with lower rates, so, it's possible that I will retire somewhere else since I don't have deep roots here, though my boyfriend does.

&amp;#x200B;

I would really appreciate any advice or guidance on what to do here. Should I keep putting my 10% into the Roth 401k (this is in addition to the $6k I put into my Roth IRA), should I split my contribution so that I do 5% traditional, 5% Roth, or should I put all of it into the traditional 401k with the 6% from my employer.

personalfinance,Payment strategy for 70k in student loans - many questions,"I have been watching youtube videos about how to pay off student loans.  I saw some information about living directly on credit cards while i do this, as a strategy, where all money goes to your student loans and what you use to live on the credit card each month. Instead of keeping savings you pay off your credit card each month (and pay the bills with the cc) and pay the loan directly from the bank.  So you don't accumulate savings until your loan is gone and you use the credit ard as the emergency fund itself with the extra credit you have.  I may try this instead of saving my money up in the bank like I do now.

But my REAL question is:  I understand federal student loans are Amortortized, so as I make a regular payment most of my money goes toward paying off interest - right?  My 70k is dispursed amongst 7 loans total; 3 of which have 6.8 percent interest.  I just made a 15k payment which brought it down to 70 actually - and i targeted a high interest rate loan.  Would it have been smarter to make a regular payment for $800 and then with and EXTRA payment have them apply the remaining 14k to the principal? (I heard I can request to target principal if I make a regular payment and then an extra payment).  the way it stands now is I don't have to pay anything month to month so my required payment is 0.  So when i made that 15k payment to one of my loans in the group, did it go mainly to interest or to principal? was that a smart move or would it have been smarter to restart my payments and then make the regular payment plus and extra payment of 14k?",finance

 We will be doing the transfer shortly for some CC's we have that are not already below 3% (some are 0%) and we expect to have all of them completely paid off this year.

personalfinance,I recently started making A LOT more money and I don't know how to begin to manage it.,"I come from poverty and don't have anyone else to ask how to handle my money so I hope this is the right place for this and I want to thank everyone in this sub in advance for any advice that can be offered.

&amp;nbsp;

So, as the title states, I recently started making a lot more money than I have ever been used to. For years I was living paycheck to paycheck, barely scraping by, but then I landed a great job and started making A LOT more (for the curious, it's a tech sales job and the products being sold average in the 10s of thousands and I get a decent commission off of every sale). I'm not a millionaire by any stretch so what is ""a lot"" to me is probably less than what you might consider ""a lot"" but it really is quite a bit more for me personally and I want to be smart about it.  

&amp;nbsp;

I've been growing my savings account for a couple years but it's really been this past year that it's blimped quite a bit and now I'm fairly certain I have too much in my bank account. Here's the approximated rundown of debts and accounts I currently have:

&amp;nbsp;

* **Student loan debt**: about $35k (with, thankfully, a very low interest rate).


* **Credit Card Debt**: I've never had one. I'm terrified of credit card debt having watched my family drown in it.


* **Income**: around $130k this year, hoping to grow that next year


* **Expenses**: around $1.5k per month for rent, utilities, food, etc


* **Checking Account**: $18k


* **Savings Account**: $30k


* **401k Account**: $40k


* **Investment Management Account**: $15k


* **Various crypto**: $500

&amp;nbsp;

It's not much to many but I really want to manage this intelligently and safely. I'm not the biggest risk taker and I've had bad luck in taking financial risks in the past so while I'd like strong, healthy returns I would prefer to avoid disastrous/risky pitfalls. This probably sounds pretty obvious or even naive but I am a total neophyte here.

&amp;nbsp;

Like I said at the top, I come from nothing and I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop and to find myself back at the bottom. I've spent enough time unemployed/underemployed to still have nightmares about losing this great job or some other personal disaster hitting me. I think this is one of the reasons I am so nervous to put this money to some good use (if shiat hits the fan I feel safe knowing my meager wealth is sitting securely in my bank account)

&amp;nbsp;

My personal finance goals are pretty modest. I'd love to grow some wealth and maybe buy some property down the line (I live in an extremely high COL area so this is a longer term goal). I'm currently mid-30s and I'd like to grow a nice retirement account so I can actually retire before I'm too old to enjoy it. I live cheaply but I have enjoyed having more spending money (even if I don't do too much spending).

&amp;nbsp;

I wish I had someone I trusted who could advise me here but I don't travel in those circles and my family is too poor to know how to help or to not ask for some of my new wealth. Any advice for someone in my situation? Thank you again for any help!",finance

personalfinance,Student Loans vs IRA,"Hello,  


I'm sure there are a few posts on here about this  topic, but I'm trying to figure out what would work for my specific situation/goals. I just graduated college in May, and began a full time job in October making $36K. I also do freelance work and receive anywhere from $500-$1000 a month from that. I live at home, so I don't have to pay rent or groceries, which really helps. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I have just over $18,800 in student loans at an average interest rate of 4.45%. I just started paying against them last month. I have also opened a Roth IRA and begun investing in that. I have just under $2,000 in there.  I also invest 7% of my income into my company's 401k. There is just over $500 in there at the moment. My plan currently is to contribute $500 a month to my IRA in order to max it out (limit is $6,000 a year now), and pay $700 a month to my student loans in order to get them out of the way quickly. This would get it paid off in 2.5 years or so.  


My question is, however, should I leave my IRA as it is and put that $500 a month towards my student loans in order to possibly get them done with in a year? The stock market has done nothing but fall since I opened my account, and I am reading that it could do the same this year as well. But I have also read that it's good to just keep consistently contributing to an IRA when your debt isn't high interest in order to reap the rewards of compounding interest. I know not to freak out when the stock market is under-performing. I'm just wondering if it might be wise to let it sit for a year and really attack my debt, which I would love to get done with in a year so I can move out of my parents house and not have to pay rent and debt payments.

&amp;#x200B;

Would pausing my IRA while still investing in my 401k be good enough for a year in order to attack my loans? Or should I keep on course with what I've been doing in order to reap potential benefits of having money in the market for a longer time?",finance

personalfinance,Stopping all retirement contributions while paying off debt?,"My company offers a free SmartDollar account. I went in today and viewed the Baby Step 2 video about paying off debt and saw this: “you should stop all retirement contributions while on Baby Step 2” and it concerned me a bit. 

My situation – due to various reasons, including not saving for retirement for a long time and then having to take out everything I had in a very small retirement due to an emergency many years ago, I am almost 40 yrs old and currently only have about $50k in a 401k. My current contribution to the 401k is 9% and my company match is 6%.

My student loan is actually six govt loans of varying interest rates for a total of $47k. I am currently using the snowball method to work at paying those loans off. It sounds great to stop my retirement contribution to pay extra towards the student loan except for the fact that I’m like $200k behind where I should be for my age in retirement savings.

So good and wise folks of reddit personal finance – do I keep on my current path, or stop retirement contributions - putting that money towards the student loan until it's paid off?",finance

personalfinance,"Trying to Fix my Credit Mess, Confused About Defaulted Student Loans and Old Accounts","Hi. Throwaway account, for obvious reasons.

My credit is a mess.  I could write a book on all the stupid stuff I did in my youth that put me where I am, try to blame it on taking bad advice from others, but the end point is that my credit is a mess and I'm trying to get my shit together and fix it as best I can.

I have a history of anxiety issues, which has led to me playing the stupid game of avoidance instead of addressing issues.  I pulled my credit today for the first time in ... probably four years.

A quick background:

I took out way too much in student loans, both federal and private (for a variety of reasons). After my loans came due post graduation (loans went due beginning in very early 2011), I struggled hard to make payments.  I deferred my federal loans for a year due to financial hardship and tried also to do so with my private loans, but was told I could not. Instead, I struggled with payments that were roughly 40% of my monthly income.  Was told by a few lenders that no one was consolidating loans (as the economy was a wreck) so I just struggled to pay and moved forward.

In no better of a financial situation when my federal deferral was up, instead of reapplying, I let my federal student loans fall into default, mostly due to struggling with depression and allowing a lot of things to fall by the wayside.  Reasons for the default aside, I'm attempting to fix it now.

I set up an online account with FSA and am looking through my options. It seems like rehab / consolidation is likely my option; can anyone shed some light on this?

Here's the second half of this whole mess: about a decade ago, I opened a few credit cards, overloaded them, eventually fell behind on payments, and subsequently defaulted.  Again, no good reason, no stories worth telling, just that I'm doing my best to fix things.

Fast forward to today. I signed up for both Credit Karma and myFico and pulled my credit scores. Varying rates on both; CK says 680, MF says 728-762.  According to both sites, I have no negative strokes against me.

I believe that defaulted credit cards leave your credit history after 7 years. I suppose that's what happened to those cards? The latest card would have been closed in 2011. What should / can I do about those accounts? I still occasionally get collection notices ... should I ignore them, or call and deal with the companies?

Also, I know I have a substantial amount of defaulted federal student loan debt, which is ALSO not showing up on these credit checks. Why not? What does that mean? 

I have a substantial amount of private student loan debt as well, which I have not missed a payment on in nearly a decade (hence the not abysmal credit score).

What should I be doing to get these things in order?

Thanks in advance for reading; I know this is a weird / complicated situation. I can certainly provide clarification / details as necessary.

EDIT: Providing some more details.

I currently have $50k in private student loans, all currently in repayment and up to date.

I have $26k in defaulted federal student loans. I defaulted on them in 2012; they have been transferred to a collection agency, but are not currently showing up on my credit report when I pull it, and I don't know why.

I had three defaulted credit cards; of the three, I still receive collections for one (the most recent letter from December indicates a defaulted balance of $1,270), and I cant honestly remember the balances for the others because they've been closed for nearly a decade.

I am salaried and paid biweekly; my take home salary is 1,175 a every two weeks, BUT I almost always have overtime (I actually can literally depend on my overtime because of a unique work situation), and my standard work schedule nets me $450 in take home overtime per pay period.

I did receive a raise that goes into effect with my next pay period, but I'm not sure what the take home increase will be.

My rent, insurance, utilities, car payment, etc. adds up to about $1,500 per month. My current private student loan payment is approximately $500 per month.",finance

personalfinance,Husband and I are buying a house. We are considering putting only my name on the mortgage. Unsure about student loans.,"My credit score is significantly higher than my husband's. We have done a lot of work to imporve his credit over the last year, but we were starting from a very deep hole and have only pulled outselves up to a marginally-deep hole - he had multiple serverly delinquent payments on his student loans a few years ago but they will not have fallen off the credit report by the time we are getting the mortgage. So if we only put my name on the mortgage, we would shave around 3/8% off the interest rate. We're confident that we can find a house that we  would qualify for using only my income. We're also confident that the difference in the monthly paymentis not going to be make-or break even if my husband is on the mortgage. So we could go either way.

Other than my husband's student loans and the impending mortgae, we have no debts.

**Here's my question:**

I'm planning on going back to school soon. **What kind of an impact will it have on my student loans if my debt-to-income ratio is high?** I don't have student loans, and at the time my husband took out his loans, it was the only loan he had, so we're in completely unfamiliar territory.

Thanks for any thoughts you guys have!

personalfinance,IRS waives penalty for many whose tax withholding and estimated tax payments fell short in 2018 (90% CY Tax Paid Req. to 85%),"I have seen many posts in the past year, and moreso in the past couple months, of users confused on or questioning how much withholding they should have had withheld during the year, and how to adjust their W-4 for the new tax law changes, so I thought this would ease the minds of some of you.

Here is the write-up from the IRS pertaining to penalties for tax payers who didn't meet the requirement of paying in enough estimated tax either via paycheck withholding and/or estimated payments.  BTW the rule of thumb is typically 90% of current year tax owed, or 100% of prior year tax owed (110% if you making big bucks).

&amp;#x200B;

*""The Internal Revenue Service announced today that it is waiving the estimated tax penalty for many taxpayers whose 2018 federal income tax withholding and estimated tax payments fell short of their total tax liability for the year.*

***The IRS is generally waiving the penalty for any taxpayer who paid at least 85 percent of their total tax liability during the year through federal income tax withholding, quarterly estimated tax payments or a combination of the two.*** *The usual percentage threshold is 90 percent to avoid a penalty.*

*The waiver computation announced today will be integrated into commercially-available tax software and reflected in the forthcoming revision of Form 2210 and instructions.*

*This relief is designed to help taxpayers who were unable to properly adjust their withholding and estimated tax payments to reflect an array of changes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the far-reaching tax reform law enacted in December 2017.*

*“We realize there were many changes that affected people last year, and this penalty waiver will help taxpayers who inadvertently didn’t have enough tax withheld,” said IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig. “We urge people to check their withholding again this year to make sure they are having the right amount of tax withheld for 2019.”*

*The updated federal tax withholding tables, released in early 2018, largely reflected the lower tax rates and the increased standard deduction brought about by the new law. This generally meant taxpayers had less tax withheld in 2018 and saw more in their paychecks.*

*However, the withholding tables couldn’t fully factor in other changes, such as the suspension of dependency exemptions and reduced itemized deductions. As a result, some taxpayers could have paid too little tax during the year, if they did not submit a properly-revised W-4 withholding form to their employer or increase their estimated tax payments. The IRS and partner groups conducted an extensive outreach and education campaign throughout 2018 to encourage taxpayers to do a “*[*Paycheck Checkup*](http://links.govdelivery.com/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTkwMTE2LjE4ODc0MSZtZXNzYWdlaWQ9TURCLVBSRC1CVUwtMjAxOTAxMTYuMTg4NzQxJmRhdGFiYXNlaWQ9MTAwMSZzZXJpYWw9MTcyMjI3NjImZW1haWxpZD1kYXZpZEBycm1vYXRzY3BhLmNvbSZ1c2VyaWQ9ZGF2aWRAcnJtb2F0c2NwYS5jb20mZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;127&amp;&amp;&amp;https://www.irs.gov/paycheck-checkup#_blank)*” to avoid a situation where they had too much or too little tax withheld when they file their tax returns.*

*Although most 2018 tax filers are still expected to get refunds, some taxpayers will unexpectedly owe additional tax when they file their returns.*

*Additional Information*

*Because the U.S. tax system is pay-as-you-go, taxpayers are required, by law, to pay most of their tax obligation during the year, rather than at the end of the year. This can be done by either having tax withheld from paychecks or pension payments, or by making estimated tax payments.*

*Usually, a penalty applies at tax filing if too little is paid during the year. Normally, the penalty would not apply for 2018 if tax payments during the year met one of the following tests:*

* *The person’s tax payments were at least 90 percent of the tax liability for 2018 or*
* *The person’s tax payments were at least 100 percent of the prior year’s tax liability, in this case from 2017. However, the 100 percent threshold is increased to 110 percent if a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income is more than $150,000, or $75,000 if married and filing a separate return.*

*For waiver purposes only, today’s relief lowers the 90 percent threshold to 85 percent. This means that a taxpayer will not owe a penalty if they paid at least 85 percent of their total 2018 tax liability. If the taxpayer paid less than 85 percent, then they are not eligible for the waiver and the penalty will be calculated as it normally would be, using the 90 percent threshold.

Those most at risk of having too little tax withheld from their pay include taxpayers who itemized in the past but now take the increased standard deduction, as well as two-wage-earner households, employees with nonwage sources of income and those with complex tax situations.*

financialindependence,"Yay, we are FI enough to RE!!!","I've spent the start of 2019 going over our investments and costs and have been trying to work out how Brexit (we're UK based) could impact us. 

And looking at our investment income versus our life costs we are now at a stage where we won't have to make any lifestyle changes even if my husband loses his job. He could stop working tomorrow and there are no sacrifices we'd have to make.

Please may I celebrate here? None of our friends really know our financial situation and although my parents have an inkling we are financially stable they've not realised how much our portfolio has grown. 

(Edit) Someone asked me to copy this and add it to my original post so here goes 

So how/why we did it. My husband was suddenly and unexpectedly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in his mid 20s - that gave him a massive shock and made him re-evaluate the rest of his life and he decided he wanted to retire earlier than the usual age as he thought his life expectancy/quality of life would be affected by his 60s. So he saved like a fiend and planned on paying off his mortgage early - he then bought another house to rent out (rent would cover mortgage) as an investment . This was early 2000s, so about 17 or 18 years ago.

I had a small flat when we met, and decided to rent it out when I moved in with him (mainly so that I'd still have it if things didn't work out between us!!!). His enthusiasm for paying off mortgages asap made sense to me (I'm naturally debt averse and quite cautious with money) so with the rent I was getting from my flat, plus bits of my salary I'd saved up/work bonuses I was overpaying my mortgage plus cutting off huge chunks of it whenever it was time to remortgage.  

When property prices crashed in 2011 we used savings plus a small remortgage on his rental property to buy our family home. So now we had 4 properties, one with a largish mortgage, my flat was paid off and his houses were being paid off way faster than the initial 20 year mortgage term. We then got very lucky with interest rates being historically low since then, living in South East England where rents are high, house prices skyrocketed, and getting tenants who didn't cause too many problems. 

We're now at the stage where our properties together are valued at a total of around £1.4m (although Brexit will probably cause a house price crash) and last November we totally cleared the remaining amount owing on our family home (using rent from other properties plus my husband's salary). Whenever we paid off a mortgage on one the rental income would go towards paying off the others (it didn't make sense to put a lot into a savings account as interest rates are so damn low that inflation would wipe out a chunk of it).

The rental income from the 3 properties (including me taking into account maintenance costs and times where we have no tenants) will now more than our living costs especially since the family home has been paid off so we just have the bills to pay. 

It hasn't been a super quick journey and a lot of it is down to luck with interest rates, house price gains in the south east, etc. We didn't really spend any bonuses on big holidays, new cars, etc we just used them to pay off mortgages. Same with pay rises, our everyday spending has remained pretty much the same with the majority of them just going toward paying off the houses.

I need help explaining whether or not other options are a good idea besides just paying the near impossible $850 a month. And also, if a financial advisor is worth it for my situation.

 Is refinancing through another company a good route? Like, should I get this debt out of Wells Fargo if they can't offer any help?

What is Loan Modification?

Is applying for financial hardship more intended as a last resort? And how can I tell if some company like that is legit and not a scam? My parents are unsettled by the fact that they ask for money up front (~$3,000 from what company/lawfirm place I was referred to, they reduce my loan amount by 40% minimum and then I make monthly payments to them with no interest). 

Or do I buckle down and just make payments for the 20 years? 
Give it to me straight, doctors. Mostly just trying to understand what all these options mean and their repercussions. Thank you.",finance

gaming,EA is inept and needs to give up the Star Wars license,"Rant incoming here.

So it's being reported that EA has cancelled another Star Wars game. Apart from the fact that it was an open world game and which studio was developing it, there's little info going round as to what it actually was. EA cancelled it apparently because the development cycle would take too long and they wanted a product sooner.

Now I'm fully aware that this story is just breaking really and details are sketchy at the moment but come on. Yet another Star Wars game cancelled? What the hell is EA playing at? I know EA is the punching bag of the industry at the moment but are they really this stupid and unaware of the community feeling towards them as to yet again deny gaming and Star Wars fans alike a potentially great gaming experience? Just because (according to Kotaku sources) that ""  **they needed something earlier than the planned release date** ""??

What the actual hell? Are they serious?

They've also gone onto say in a statement that they're ""*fully committed to making more Star Wars games"".* If that's the case then why are they cancelling the games that people want to play? I swear any other publisher would have got the hint by now as to what the players want, but yet again EA has demonstrated that they A) haven't got a clue what players what and B) don't care a fig. I assume because they want something sooner they mean some quick to make garbage that will ultimately be a broken mess on release, and piss off the fanbase even more, perhaps to match up with Star Wars Episode IX release date with Disney?

At this point Disney (who I assume sold the rights to EA in the first place, I'm not an expert on the backroom dealings that go on) needs to re-evaluate their deal with EA, because at the moment all they're getting out of the deal is cancellations and fan and gamer disappointment and rage (I'm sure I don't need to reiterate the Battlefront 2 debacle again).

EA employees, if you're reading this, what the hell are guys playing at? I'd seriously like to know because right now, and I hope I can speak for other gamers and Star Wars fans, we're pretty damn fed up with how you're handling the Star Wars IP. As long as EA holds the license, I don't feel like we're ever going to get a decent Star Wars game. I don't know which publisher to suggest to take over but frankly right now, anyone will do, so long as it's not EA.",technology

gaming,any gamers shopping on PS3 / PSP Japan psn store lately for rare games yet to be owned/played?,"I am so miffed that SE removed Tobal 2 from the PS3 PSN Store, I seen it there years ago, but its an example that its better to get a game while its available instead of assuming it's 'always' gonna be there.  (I do own physical version of Tobal 2, original case, original instruction manual, but the disc is scratched up due to use by sloppy relatives and family friends that dont know how to properly handle CDs! )I became an expert at the disc swapping PS1 method and even had a gold finger device that plugs on the back of the PS1 to use cheats and stuff.   Its weird SE pulled Tobal 2 from the store, but Ehrgeiz is still there (that game is inferior to Tobal 2, and Tobal 2's Quest mode has yet to be matched. )

but yea anyways, I got several AMAZING games from PS3 Japan PSN Store, which are still there!   including Valis (the original classic complete with voiceovers, cinematic presentation and more! this isnt the cheap Genesis version) , Valis II (has cinematics and voiceovers too),  Rival School 2 (its actual name is very long: Shiritsu Gakuen Nekketsu Seisyun Nikki 2. its life sim mode is so extraordinary and improved over the original! )  Advanced Variable Geo 1 (greatest production values in character personalities and story presentation than Street Fighter games. it even has characters have VAs and say things even in the victory screen with animated mouths!), Advanced Variable Geo 2 (stylistically not as ambitious as the first game, but does improve the combat and effects),
Athena Awakening from the Ordinary Life (ULTRA RARE, UNIQUE and INTERESTING!  hardcore Resident Evil fans would feel right at home with the movement controls. it also has the highest quality CG FMVs SNK ever produced. well ok there's KOFXIV, but it is a miracle this rare Athena masterpiece exists and graphically and storywise so ambitious for its time, its generations beyond her other games!).  

and SaGa Frontier (I know english version exists however, SE hasnt cared to sell the english version on PS3 nor PS4,  so this is the only version I can grab instantly for just a few dollars).  and one of the perks of PS3 versions of PS1 games is they come with the original instruction manual, all pages, full color, full quality, and SaGa Frontier's japanese instruction manual has gorgeous, rare Tomimi Kobayashi art!!  some that appreciate art would get this game for the manual artworks alone!

and SaGa Frontier game itself is phenomenol!   amazing selection of protagonists, amazing style, outstanding soundtrack, great gameplay, it even has like 15 slots for party members!  even with language hurdles, the UI design really makes it easier to understand what is what here and there.   I know how to check status, equip, save, and other stuff. 

I now have all these games on PS3 and PSP to play, and this is a better deal than purchasing some $60 current gen game I know I would only play for like a day to a week. 

theres tons of obscure, unknown and rare games found in the PS3 market.  not sure how long Sony is gonna keep that market up. but yea anyone interested in PS3/PSP gaming still, may want to check out the PS3 stores, Japan store expecially for great and inspirational treasures! 

and a cool things about games like these PS 1 games is that the ones with PS3 + PSP labels, are basically cross buy, so purchasing those games, we can literally own it and play them on both console and portable!  a really sweet deal! 

so you can share games you have purchased/played and glad you got them from PS3 stores while they are available. this is one of the examples of advantages of the digital market.  of course physical is important too, though digital is a great option and even very valuable last resort to be able to have and play these games at all.  :)",technology

personalfinance,175K Student Debt - just got first job - help strategize?,"Hi all,

Long time lurker, first time poster. This is going to be a bit unorganized because I am writing this fast but just wanted to get some advice.

As the title said, I am 28 years old, just finishing grad school (distracted from writing my dissertation right now). I just landed a nice job in a relatively low cost of living city in the Midwest. Full time job with $115K base + 20% yearly bonus ... about $138K per year. Start full time as soon as I defend my thesis. Before taxes about $9600 a month. I imagine this will be around $7000 a month after taxes.

I have a bunch of federal student loans from undergrad and masters. Did not take out any loans during my PhD because I was funded during it. I didn't pay off any of my loans during this time. It's pretty tough to when you're only making 25K a year before taxes.

So anyway - all my loans are federal besides one private loan. I am wondering if I should consider refinancing my loans. And if I do should I refinance all of them? I have some debt on top of the loans as well.

Here are the federal loans:  

| Principal | Interest Rate | Accrued Interest |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| 4500      | 5.6           | 0                |
| 3245      | 6.8           | 1250             |
| 4755      | 4.5           | 0                |
| 5500      | 3.4           | 0                |
| 24460     | 6.8           | 10545            |
| 10681     | 7.9           | 5221             |
| 11090     | 6.41          | 3680             |
| 11056     | 7.2           | 3325             |
| 20500     | 6.2           | 5315             |
| 15966     | 5.840         | 3000             |
| 20500     | 5.4           | 5750             |

I do have one private loan. About $6000 at a 11.2 interest rate. Was going to pay this off within my first few months of work. 

I have credit card debt of a card that is interest free for another 2 months. About $6000 on it. I was going to use my tax return to pay that off (open to other ideas). 

Another credit card that is interest free for another 16 months with about $1150 on it. 

A car loan with $11,000 remaining (2015 corolla with 25,000 miles on it, have had it since it was brand new but was leasing it and changed it to buy after the lease). It's a 5 year loan at a 5.3% APR. I'd like to pay this off soon too so its just done.

I am planning on buying an engagement ring soon, not gonna go crazy but prob in the 3-5K range. I think that's normal? I don't know.

Please give some advice on some strategies you guys would take. I'm aware of the avalanche strategy but not sure if I should refinance or not. My credit score is ~750. 

Other Monthly bills:  

  * $650 rent + utilities  
  * $50 for car/gas   
  * $93 for car insurance (girlfriend is on this)   
  * $80 cellphone   
  * $50 for dog related stuff    
  * $250 on groceries

personalfinance,Roth or Traditional 401K for a 27 year old in the 24% tax bracket?,"\*\* Typo in title: I meant I'm in the 22% tax bracket! Thanks u/SwAeromotion \*\*

Hello!

I am a 27 year old in my first job out of graduate school, trying to decide if I should invest in a Traditional or Roth 401K offered by my employer. Some facts that may or may not be relevant to my situation:

* Salary = $85,000/year
* I live in Washington State, where there is no state income tax
* My employer will contribute up to 3% of my annual salary to my 401K
* I have approximately $28,000 in federal student loans with an average interest rate of 4.22%
* No other debt besides my student loan debt
* I have not yet begun saving for retirement
* I will likely invest in Vanguard's Target Retirement 2060 Fund
* This year I will be getting married to a spouse whose annual salary last year was $40,000
* My spouse and I plan to contribute $2430.15 to my employer-sponsored HSA annually

Any insight on whether I should choose Roth vs. Traditional? From everything I've been reading, it seems my situation is borderline. Thanks for your time and help!",finance

Thanks to the great advice on this subreddit, my wife and I  (25 and 32) have gotten out of the red, and into the black.
We're now paying off our last debts, planning a wedding ceremony, and saving for a down payment on a house (we'd like to purchase one hopefully in about 2 years).

I have $4,000 left on a student loan @ 9.5%, and $7,000 left on a car loan @ 5.3%.

We have $34,500 in total savings: $25,000 in savings accounts (aiming for $40,000 for a down payment on a home), $9,000 in a 401k, and $500 in random stocks.

We're adding $240 / month to the 401k, $250 / month to the savings account, paying $377 / month on the 9.5% loan, and paying $244 / month on the 5.3% loan

Upcoming expenses: $11,000 for our wedding and honeymoon in 3 months. This will bring our total savings down to about $23,500

Current credit score is 728.

So this is what I'd like to do... I want to pay off the 9.5% loan ($4,000) in one lump sum payment just so I don't have to stress about that high interest rate any more. That would bring us down to about $19,500 in savings, but we could then start putting the $377 / month that we were paying on the high interest loan into the savings account (down payment fund). 

But I've heard that paying loans off in large one-time payments can hurt your credit score. I want my credit score to be 740 or higher for when we buy our house. 

So what do you guys think is the best course of action? Anyone have experience with this type of situation?

Any advice greatly appreciated!

I’m confused about what percentage of federal tax is taken out of my paychecks. I get paid for my OT, and am claiming (S-2). Weeks that I worked 0 OT last year my fed taxes (just “Fed Tax Withheld - Claiming S-2) was 9.8% in august and 9.4% in October and November. Last week it was 8.9%. These are all with the same base pay. And with OT the tax rate doesn’t seem to increase proportionally. In general with a few exceptions it goes up when I work more OT, but I can’t figure out a calculation or range that explains its change.

~~Also, Social Security keeps changing too. It fluctuated from 6.2% last year until October, when it changed to 6.1%, and 6.0% this last paycheck.  Everything I’ve read says it should be 6.2% so it’s confusing. This is less of a big deal, but I still like knowing where my money is going and where to find the current tax rates to make sure I’m getting paid accurately and to budget myself more exactly than just a general range I could earn based on unknown taxes.~~

Thanks for any help you can provide!

I am trying to find the best choices for a couple questions. I understand that it's tough to know exactly what is best for Japan, but general info would be helpful too:

-------------

**What is the best western credit card for the following points:**

* No fees for using it abroad
* No monthly fee
* Intention to use points ONLY for plane tickets to visit home in the US
* *Basically simple is best!*

**Is there a western bank that is good for expats?**

* I use a Japanese one (Japan Post) that gives no interest rate and I have about $60,000 dollars sitting in it. 
* I use Schwab for investing so I'll probabably put more in there soon, but if there is a good global bank for checking/savings, I imagine it would have better benefits than the one I'm using. 

***Quick Investment Question***

As I understand, I can't do a Roth IRA in the US because I don't claim any US income. Is there any other thing an Expat should do when thinking about retirement? Right now I just invest in stocks and indexes.",finance
personalfinance,"I've accumulated about $4500 in credit card debt. I am paying $400 a month for it but the interest rate is eating a big portion of it. Should I see if I can apply for lower interest credit, like an unsecured line of credit or a low interest credit card?",[deleted],finance

CryptoCurrency,‘Ex-chainers’: meet the men and women struggling to adjust to life after crypto,"*While bitcoin lost 85% of its value over 2018, the real tragedy of the bear market has been the human cost. In this series of guest posts, Inferno publishes interviews with former members of the blockchain scene who left the crypto sector for the real world. Names have been changed to protect privacy.*

It’s a crisp January morning and I’m waiting outside the Starbucks in the concourse of King’s Cross station, London. It’s 10 am and the commuter traffic has slowed, but King’s Cross is far from quiet. It’s a constant hubbub of action that feels like it will never cease. But cease it will, at 1am, when the station locks its doors for the night. Then there’s a four-hour window of absolute desolation. Silence, like a scene from a post-apocalyptic movie. The analogy is poignant.

‘That’s what happened in the crypto world,’ Lenny tells me when he arrives, punctual to the minute. He’s not at all what I expect. I had been anticipating a skinny kid, maybe just out of college, hoodie and greasy hair, whose naive dreams of getting rich quick had been shattered by a brutal downturn in the cryptocurrency markets. But Lenny is in his mid-thirties, clean-shaven and wearing an M&amp;S shirt and jacket. This is someone who still makes an effort about his appearance. Not because it will help him get a job, I later discover, but because right now these little rituals are the only things holding back the tide. He looks like he works out, something confirmed by his impressive grip when he shakes my hand. He’s strong – at least, physically. Emotionally, it’s a different story.

‘It was like *28 Days Later*,’ he explains, when we’ve sat with our lattes inside the doorway. ‘One day everything’s normal, you’re going about your life, you have a fiance, a future, and it’s all good. Then you wake up and…’ He makes a nondescript gesture, but the meaning is clear. ‘It’s all gone. Almost overnight, your hopes and dreams. The wealth is one thing. But it’s the loss of identity that really destroyed me.’

Growing up with a father who turned to gold as a store of value during the high inflation of the 1970s, and a mother who was one of the first women to earn her economics doctorate from Cambridge, Lennie was exposed to the Austrian school of thought at an early stage. ‘It made sense, intuitively,’ he explains. ‘Deflationary monetary policy, gold-backed currencies – and bitcoin as the technological successor to all that. I was hooked.’

For a while, it worked out exactly as planned. Lenny started buying bitcoin mid-way through 2016. As the value began to rise, he increased his position and took out a loan. ‘The idea was to book some of the profits, pay off my debts and buy gold, and weather the storm that we all knew was coming,’ he says – his ‘all’ referencing the echo-chamber of the crypto forums, where talk of impending economic collapse are the bread and butter of daily conversation. ‘But it didn’t work out that way.’

personalfinance,I am recently divorced and attempting to divide existing debt. My credit is awful. How do I get a loan to cover my half of a variety of debts so we can get detached financially?,"I got divorced in November of last year. My ex moved out the previous April. We had a variety of debts including a personal loan, a credit card, and two credit cards that have been consolidated through a consolidation service. My credit score is 560 or so, last I checked. I've applied for loans on my own, and loans with a co-signer. Both have been denied due to delinquencies that I do not have money to resolve right now (all of these occurred after she moved out (she did all the bills and financials while we were married, and there's been a learning curve)). My half of the loans in total is about $7800. All I want to do is get all those loans paid off, off my ex's credit, and half of that value onto mine. The consolidation is short-term, so is very expensive per month. Almost any loan would be cheaper, even with a high interest rate. The divorce decree says I should secure money to get my half paid off, but my lawyer says I cannot be compelled to do something that cannot be accomplished.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there some kind of service (besides a loan shark) that is willing to work with someone in this circumstance? I need $7800 to pay off shared debt and take my half on myself. The payments will certainly be lower overall, so easier to pay.",finance

personalfinance,Risk of Treasury-backed Money Market Fund,"My brother is planning on buying a house (in the US) in the next 1-2 years.  He has a bunch of cash he is saving for a down payment (into 6 figures, but less than FDIC insurance limit) sitting in a high-interest (1.00%, they don't seem to be marking to market very often ಠ\_ಠ) FDIC-insured saving account.  I have told him to move this whole sum to Vanguard to their [Vanguard Treasury Money Market Fund (VUSXX)](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VUSXX) fund (currently at 2.3% interest) until he's ready to buy.  I chose this for a few reasons:

1. Vanguard is a good-guy financial institution (I use them myself), as opposed to his current for-profit US mega-bank.
2. Treasuries are super-conservative (more on this below) but this is a good yield for a cash account.
3. In an increasing interest rate environment I'm thinking that fed funds rate increases will be more quickly reflected in this money market account.

He has heebie jeebies about moving his money out of an FDIC-insured account.  I was trying to imagine scenarios where principal could be lost to try and convince him it's very unlikely, but I wanted the hivemind's opinion.  The main risks I see are:

**Institutional**

* Vanguard is [mutually owned through their mutual fund shareholders, and is private](https://about.vanguard.com/what-sets-vanguard-apart/why-ownership-matters/).  They've also got a reputation as extremely steady, conservative, and boring (good boring).  If the market tanks and everyone sells their Vanguard mutual fund shares does anything bad happen?  The ownership is concentrated?  Does the decrease in value of their funds or the $$$ under management throw off their balance sheet or something?
* While Vanguard may be ""safe"" (as safe as it can be in US financial institutions...?) it obviously has entanglements with other banks/brokers which might not be as careful as they are.  I'm not sophisticated enough to understand their [balance sheet](https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/vmc_sofc.pdf), but I'm willing to assume that they are smart enough to protect themselves from any kind of existential counter-party risk. Am I wrong?

**Underlying Assets**

* Here is where I see more realistic (but still far fetched) risk.  Given our current federal shenanigans, it's not inconceivable that there would be a similar political stand off in the near future about increasing the federal debt limit (which has happened before) and that it goes farther than past standoffs (as is happening now) to the point where the US misses coupon payments or something.  This might send the price of treasuries lower as people dump them, but if the fund in question is just buying and holding treasuries there's no chance the principal could be lost, correct?  Or maybe there is if treasuries are reaching maturity date and the feds aren't paying up?  Or if there's a run on the fund?

This question was more interesting to me as a thought experiment about how things like this break down under extraordinary circumstances, but I'd also be interested to hear if folks have other recommendations for cash investments.  Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,What is the difference between Consolidation Loans vs Credit Cards,"Background:  I got a cold call from a lending agency who apparently had access to my financial debt information.  Not sure how they got it, but that's irrelevant to this post anyway.  Anyway, the guy was offering me a consolidation loan to consolidate some of the credit cards I have.  He kept coming back to ""our loans are so much better because credit cards have compound interest"" and ""higher interest rates with consolidation loans aren't as bad as the same rate with a credit card because we have simple interest"".  

I smelled a rat, and told him I wasn't interested.  But I was curious on how big of a rat I smelled, so I went looking for some information and didn't find too much that made sense to me.  So here I am.  

My question: What differences are there between consolidation loans and credit cards?  Other than the fact that you can't put more balance on a consolidation loan.  From the information I read, it seems like they both still have compound interest.  I looked in the wiki and didn't find much info on it.

To clarify: I am not looking for financial advice, so please don't give it.  I have been a long time sub of this community, I semi-frequently read other's stories and comments.  I have read the 'How to Handle $"" guide, and I am well aware of what steps are left that I need to take, and in what order, to achieve financial independence.  Please just answer my question.

personalfinance,2 Schools of Thought. Which one has better results?,"So I asked a question yesterday about if I should pause IRA contributions for a year to attack my debt even harder, or if I should continue maxing it out while still paying extra on my loans. And I got 2 answers:

1) Pay off all debt before investing for retirement. 

2) Do both because you have the potential to make a better return on the investments than what the interest rate on the loans are. 

I actually agree with both schools of thought here. They both make a lot of sense to me. I’m wondering though...

She lives in NYC and is a model that also does catering jobs. Doesn’t make much but gets by. This situation bit her in the butt a few years ago and now she has her checks garnished. Unfortunately that bite wasn’t enough to get her to start filing or keeping good records. If a person hasn’t filed taxes in years and likely kept zero paperwork, where is a good place to start? My plan is to get her to write down as many employers as she can think of and start making phone calls to get tax documents.

I could completely transfer (payoff) card A, or I could transfer a portion of card B, that has the largest interest rate.

For the 2017 tax year we filed jointly and split the return 50/50.

He demanded and harassed me for half of the federal return, which I submitted to him within 24 hours of receiving the deposit but when he received the state refund my divorce attorney had to argue with his for him to give me 50% of that while he made us jump through hoops as well as contacting the accountant to prove that he owed me nothing.

personalfinance,Best way to get ahead of debt that's been holding me back for years,"Long story short, I've ammased a substantial amount of debt mostly through a few impulse vehicle purchases/vehicle changes.

Anyways I'm sitting with about $32,000 in debt across a line of credit ($23,000) and my credit card ($9,500) and it feels like I've been battling this for the past 6+ years not really being able to make any headway. I've been trying to put payments on both each month, with most going to the credit card since it has a %12 interest rate and line of credit has %8. Would my best option be to put minimum payments on the line and then put as much as possible on the credit card each month?

personalfinance,Found out my boyfriend is 30k in debt,"So my boyfriend of two years and I have been talking about getting a house together. We moved forward and I contacted a mortgage guy who pulled out credit. Turns out my boyfriend has 30k total debt which hampers our housing options somewhat. My initial reaction has been sorta ""holy shit dude did you not think of telling me about this before?"" But I want to actually try to help us figure this out.

He always spent freely which I (poorly) assumed meant he had little to no financial worries, and we never really had seriously discussed our finances prior (a mistake, I know). He actually makes a little more money than me, around 38k.

His debt:

Amex: $12,500 - min pay: $320

Bank credit card: $1,500 - min pay: $25

Car loan: $9,300 - min pay: $320

Student loan: $7,600 - min pay: $340

He has about $8,000 cash saved. He has been living with his parents so no rent.

What's the best way to approach working on this? Should all the cash go to the Amex since that's going to be highest interest and a big minimum pay, or would it be better to do the bank card completely, or student loan even though that will be a lower interest rate?

I also don't know what to do with myself about housing and him, but that might be more of a r/relationships question. I don't know if he should really move out and have an additional expense of rent/mortgage when he should be focusing on paying this down. I have a decent amount of free cash I could contribute but that's kind of a scary route to go down, lending money to him.

personalfinance,How to best approach my debt,"I'm looking for some help. I have a substantial amount of debt. Mostly, student loan debt with a car loan and I'm not entirely sure where to start with it. This time last year, my former employer announced they were shutting their facility here down by the summer of this year. I left last summer with a severance of $20k (after taxes). I haven't touched that money since leaving. I wanted to make sure my career change was sustainable. It has been, so now I'm comfortable with using this money to pay off my debt. The table below goes over everything.     
     
When it comes to the monthly payments, the Nelnet/Mohela loans are using income based repayment options. This makes things manageable. However, from what I can tell my monthly payments are more or less only covering the interest being generated each month.     
     
My first thought was to knock out my car loan (Capital One) and/or the Navient loans first since they would provide the highest amount of money that can then be directed at other loans once paid off. I know going after the highest interest rate loans may be better. In this case with so many loans, I didn't know if that would be the best course of action.     
     
Any suggestions on how to best approach this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, in advance....

personalfinance,modeling benefits of mortgage paydown vs. investment in 10-year timeframe,"My partner and I are early 40s DINKs with gross income around $200k/yr combined.

We have \~$1mn in assets (etfs / funds in brokerage, roth-iras, 401ks; stock options; house).

We have \~$275k in liabilities (\~$15k 0% loan, and), primarily: $260k remaining on \~27years of our 30yr mortgage at 3.25% fixed.

We're maxing out all potential contributions, have an emergency fund, have great credit. We're good on the usual advice.

---

We're overpaying principal on the mortgage (currently: \~$700/mo interest, \~$500/mo principal, \~$1300/mo overpayment), which will pay off the mortgage in about 10 years.

Due to the execution of stock options over the last few years (for diversification purposes), we're currently sitting (unproductively) on \~$160k cash.

I have two main options:

1. Pay down the mortgage.
2. Invest.

Naively, as I expect the market to return far in excess of 3.25%, it **seems** like it'd be wiser to invest rather than service low-interest debt, but I'm having trouble modeling exactly why/how...

For example (and using ""$100k"" as a nice round number):

Investing $100k @ ""7%"" for 10 years will yield \~$100k return.

However, putting $100k towards the mortgage (as outlined above, and continuing the monthly overpayments) [will bring the payoff date in from \~10 years to \~6 years, and save $30k in interest payments.](https://www.free-online-calculator-use.com/extra-payment-mortgage-calculator.html)

- 25k: payoff in 9y, $10.7k interest savings
- 50k: 8y, $18.6k
- 75k: 7y, $25.2k
- 100k: 6y, $30.9k
- 125k: 5y, $35.5k
- 150k: 4y, $39.2k

And after that, the freed up $2500/mo cash flow becomes usable for investment, and taking the same 10-year window as before, the last 4 years at $2500/mo would total \~$120k.

This strikes me as the way to go, though either it's counter-intuitive or I'm missing something.

Would I rather have – in 10 years time – no mortgage and:

A. a chance at 100k returns from market investment, or

B. $120k (invested, cash, whatever)?

Option B seems right.

Is it simply that: while the interest rate is low, the sheer size of the principal makes paying it down more valuable than potential return on the investment?

personalfinance,"Considering leaving college job turned career, not sure what considerations/questions I need to be asking of myself to help make the decision","I've been a member of this and related subreddits for about two years now. Helped me to get serious about the future and gain enough confidence to even consider the below. There is a TLDR if desired. Apologies for wall-o-text.

&amp;#x200B;

Considering leaving my current company for more pay or similar pay and better culture. I don't have any job offers, and am dragging my feet to even apply. Hoping to get a sounding board of feedback to help make an informed decision. TIA.

&amp;#x200B;

**Immediate family (those I support):** myself (age 30), my wife (age 29; stay at home mom), two kids (ages 4 and 5; one in school now and the 4yo starts in August 2019)

**Career Path (thus far):** Started with my current company almost 11 years ago at the recommendation of a roommate who helped me get the job. Started in sales, enrolled/finished college degree (BS - Game Design) then started earning promotions/lateral recruitments. Now in Dallas working in a mid-level PM-type role supporting the field operations. Prior to this company (ages 15-20), I held random jobs in the restaurant and retail field. None for more than a year or so and all were hourly low-paying jobs. This was my first ""real"" job.

&amp;#x200B;

**Considerations for leaving:**

* The company is continually undergoing ""cost-cutting initiatives"" which effectively mean more surplus, fewer work amenities, diluted benefits, and an overall sense of unhealthy competition among peers that are supposed to be chasing the same goals as you.
* Culture is diminishing: things like the option to telecommute on days you may have a doc appt are now being stripped away. The options going forward are to take the time unpaid with FMLA, use PTO (which is annoying because it has to cover your commute time as well so a simple 40-minute dentist appointment requires 3-4 hours of PTO since most people don't live in the city). Everyone is so worried about getting surplussed and there is no real ""team"" feel. It's just everyone fighting to protect and define their scope before another stack rank happens.
* They recently eliminated about 1800 jobs across the country, moving most of them to two hub cities. I'm in Dallas now because of a surplus (I opted to find a guaranteed position and move vs wait for the results of the surplus to shake out). More surplus are announced every quarter. Since 12/13/18 there have been four surplus announcements.
* My pay, while not low and capable of providing a somewhat comfortable life for my family, is less than many of my peers (I skipped a management level when leaving the field). I've gotten 5% for each promotion/lateral move and a 2-4% raise each year. I've asked HR for an explanation as to why I cannot be ""trued up"" on salary to reflect my scope of work vs my peers and they stonewall me and point me to developmental tools/resources that can ""help me get a promotion and raise"".
* This one is a weak argument, granted, but everywhere I look I see articles about Millennials making multiple job moves over their lives in order to seek more pay, better benefits, more job satisfaction. Most of these articles are on how to attract this type of talent and keep them. Conversely, I've been here for 11 years, getting excited over 2-4% every year doing work that is simply unfulfilling.
* Just spending a few hours the last few weekends on Glassdoor/ZipRecruiter I've found jobs paying 20-60% more. These are jobs in the area, either equidistant or closer to home, at relatively well-known companies.
* My kids are getting older, I'm getting older. I find myself valuing time with them more and more. I don't look for fulfillment and definition out of my job anymore. I've come to regard my job here simply as a vehicle to earn a paycheck to let me spend more time with them.

**Hesitations to leave:**

* I've not worked anywhere else but this company for the past 11 years. I'm comfortable, know what to expect, and can perform the work well.
* I technically have a pension (which they stopped offering to new hires around two years after I started), but who knows if it'll exist when I get to retirement age the way things are going...
* Part of the culture here is one of ""stay until you can retire"" and it's a hard thought habit to shake, especially when it's reinforced by nearly everyone. When an employee CHOOSES to leave it's always a big scandal and the rumor mill goes into overdrive. They are regarded by leadership as ""misguided"" and by their ex-peers as ""sad cases"". I don't care what people think about me, but this does affect my thought process for leaving (""what if they're right and that person is going to fail or end up destitute?"")
* The unknown. Who is to say engagement/culture will be any different? Maybe this is just how corporate work is everywhere? ""The devil you know"" and all that...
* I have 401K match (80% of first 6%), HSA match (100% of first $2000), 23 days of PTO available at the start every year (will earn a max of four more days for my entire career here), 50% discounts on products/services (means those monthly bills go up if I leave).
* I don't have a fully-funded (6 months of expenses) emergency fund and per the PF flowchart, it will take some time (\~2-3 years) to do that as there are a few steps ahead of that one for our particular situation.
* Sole breadwinner, wife has GI disease, all of our family is in another state so we have a pretty non-existent support system if I fail. (Failure is not an option).

**Brief financial profile:**

* Income: \~$90K salary with an annual bonus of up to 11% based on company performance. Additional income from side business (more info on that below)
* Debt: \~$85K in student loans (on REPAYE currently but considering SoFi consolidation the more I read about forgiveness not being honored by the Fed); \~$5K credit card debt. That's it. We have worked hard to pay off everything else, only drive cash cars.
* Home: renting now for \~$1800; would like to buy again eventually, but want the payment to be same or lower so need a large down payment or to be eligible for first-time homebuyer programs again. (Sold a home in hometown last year that we were struggling to keep rented)
* Budget: using YNAB, working PF flowchart (currently on the step of paying ""medium to high"" interest debt which for us is two student loans totalling\~$12k). We have a $1K emergency fund. Maximizing HSA contributions and 401K match (company forces us to use FinancialEngines to manage 401K). I also have &lt;$1000 on Robinhood that I am using to ""learn"" and gain comfort in that space.
* Launched 13 months ago: a side business on an eCommerce platform selling handmade items. Profit last year was \~$5K ($14K expenses, $19K revenue). This year I won't have to buy as much equipment and should be able to generate more profit as I learned some lessons the hard way last year. Part of the plan this year is to expand to other platforms and hopefully add some additional production methods that can be monetized. That said, I don't see this as ever being able to let me quit my job. At least not without some massive growth.

(If I've left out anything pertinent just ask and I will respond asap.)

personalfinance,How to pay off my private loans?,"So, the story is that once upon a time (2005-2010) I went to a private college, and ignorantly took out private and federal loans to pay for my overpriced education. 

At some point after I graduated (which was also some time after the housing market fiasco), I defaulted on my private loans because I had no job and ran out of chances to defer them. A company bought the loans from the original creditor once I defaulted. 

Fast forward to today- where I eventually got a job, worked my way up to full time/better pay, worked my ass off to fix my credit, and now am working with “_____ Recovery Solutions”  to pay off my private loans. 

This company has been amazing to me, helped me get on a plan to reduce my interest rates GREATLY, and once in a while they even offer to erase a large part of my debt IF I can pay a lump sum to them. 

The most recent deal I’ve been offered: since I currently owe a total of around 135k, if I pay a lump sum of 30k to them, the original creditor is offering to forgive the 105k remaining. 

It’s an incredible deal, but the twist is that no matter where I look for personal loans to try and take advantage of this , I’m told that personal loans can’t be used to pay off student loans. I clarified with one company that these are PRIVATE loans, not federal, when he stated some kind of law. They responded that because this is a post-secondary education expense, it doesn’t matter whether it’s from the federal govt. or not, I can’t secure a personal loan to pay it. 

Which brings me to my (dumb?) question: How in the hell am I supposed to take advantage of the deal my “Recovery Solutions” company is offering? Am I supposed to lie about the purpose of the loan? Are they actually expecting me to just magically generate 30k in cash?

Please tell me I’m not crazy and that it’s seemingly impossible to take this offer. 

Thanks in advance. ):

Most of the reading I've done in this sub strongly advocates against co-signing, but my read on this situation is that it's a move towards responsibility, whereas most situations shared here... are not. So here goes:

&amp;#x200B;

US

\- Together for \~9 years, living together for 2.5

\- Envisioning a long future together

\- Both university educated with professional degrees

\- Both make 52500 - 56000/year

\- Both working in career-path type jobs (me 5 months in, her 13 months in)

\- Rent is 1100/month plus expenses (not yet properly budgeted/charted out, but this discussion has prompted plans for that)

\- No cars, no kids, no pets

\- I have some small credit card debt (&lt;650 and going down) and personal ""loan"" type debts (&lt;1500, not sure what to call these, but I'm working to pay back some clubs and organizations I've worked with that were lenient with payments when I couldn't pay, no interest)

\- She has \~40000 in student loan debt, \~3500 outstanding for graduate school tuition (graduated 1 year ago), \~10000 in credit card debt and \~7500 in a high interest (27-37%) loan

&amp;#x200B;

THE LOAN

She has asked me to co-sign on a loan for 13,500 with a bank to pay-off/re-finance (is that the right word?) the high interest loan and her credit card debt. She is making payments on everything right now, but considering all of it, not making much headway and only covering the interest. If I'm understanding this all correctly, the bank loan she is applying for will consolidate the highest interest parts of her debt and pay them off. She then pays off the bank loan which will have a much lower interest rate (I was told they couldn't say exactly what number until they pull my credit, but that it would be significantly better than the rate on either the credit cards or the high-interest loan). Apparently the student loan is already low-interest enough that it should be kept out of this re-financing.

&amp;#x200B;

BACKGROUND

Around the time she graduated from grad school (her 2nd degree, upgraded a general degree to a professional one) she was injured and unable to work. I was laid off, and became depressed. Our savings went down over the next few months and we were going to miss rent. Her credit card debt went up, and eventually she took out the high-interest loan to make ends meet. This was around 2 years ago. I didn't really understand the loan she was taking out, and wasn't really engaged with what was going on at the time, but I now get that she was floating the boat. I'm thinking that my savings likely ran out right around the time she took out the loan, but there's a period of a month or two before that and a few months after where she was contributing more financially than I was. We never really talked about it, then or since. We both pay half rent and then vaguely, she does groceries and I pick up the utilities.

&amp;#x200B;

Not all of her credit card debt was accrued in that time. That's been slowly built up over the last decade as she worked through two degrees. I don't believe she was ever irresponsible per se (splashing out, or spending on needless luxuries), I just think that she, like me, hasn't been all that savvy and was negligent enough to let things happen. I now believe that she's committed to taking this on and making things right.

&amp;#x200B;

Shortly after she took out the high-interest loan (a couple months?) we both started working and things have gotten better financially. I've been working a career-path job since the summer (she's been doing the same for a bout a year) and we're now trying to get our heads wrapped around trying to be more financially responisble as individuals and together.

&amp;#x200B;

MY TAKE

Basically, I'm partially responsible for some of her debt. I feel not only should I co-sign to re-finance that debt for better interest rates, but that I should also contribute to paying it down because a) I'm partially responsible for \*some\* amount of it and b) I think I'm in a position to help and if we're building our lives together it doesn't seem to make sense that she has debt (at least aggressive debt) and I don't. At some point I think it should be \*our\* debt so we can work on paying it off together.

So, what do I need to know or understand about potentially co-signing this kind of loan?",finance

personalfinance,Unsure what to do with profit of home sale,"My wife and I are selling our current home and buying a new one. We're going walk away with about $30,000 after fees and such with 20% down on the new house. We've got some debt but we're not sure on where the money should go. My gut instinct is to pay off either the most debt, or the highest interest debts, and then go from there.

&amp;#x200B;

House we're purchasing - $126,000 @ 4.999% APR (this is after the 20% down is put in, purchase price of $156,000

* Student loan - $28,000 @ \~4.85% interest
   * This is actually 11 smaller loans for various amounts, some as high as 6.55%
* Misc credit cards - $7,000 total @ APRs floating between 14-20%

There are also some improvements we wanted to make to the house - bathroom renovation ($5,000 - $7,000) and fencing/gates (sub $2,000).

&amp;#x200B;

My gut instinct is to pay off the credit cards since they have the highest interest rates, then use the rest of the money for the home improvements and whatever is left, use it to pay on the student loans, but I'm hoping for a few opinions.",finance

personalfinance,At what point should I buy a house?,"Hi Reddit,

The question I have essentially boils down to should I pay off my student debt or try to find a mortgage for a multifamily home and become a landlord?

I'm 25 years old living in a small city in Canada where the price of renting seems high compared to the cost of owning. I am currently paying $1060 in rent for a 700sq ft apartment in a central location. A moderate size duplex (~1500 square feet) in a decent area can go for $280,000-350,000 in this city.

I currently make $104,000 per year before taxes (no benefits or retirement plans) and I have about 17k in savings. I have about $30000 in federal student loans at %6.5 interest.


Monthly cash flow as follows:
5.8k per month after tax income

-$1060 rent
-$450 car payment
-$150 Utilities (phone, internet, hydro)
-$250 groceries
-$250 entertainment
-$300 Misc (gas, oil change, dog food, renters insurance etc)
-$600 Loan Payments (both provincial and federal)

Leaves about $2740 left over to invest.


Should I add to my savings for a down payment to buy a duplex and rent out half of it? I would not have any problems filling a two bedroom suite for about $1000 per month as I have many close friends who wouldn't mind moving in. 


I realise the safest option is to pay off my loan as fast as possible but it seems that I could afford to take on more debt, especially if it results in some rental income. Plus doggo would really like a yard.


What do you guys think?",finance
personalfinance,Is there a calculator or a formula I can use to figure out how to maximize extra payments towards debt?,"First off, I know that I should apply extra money towards the debt with the highest interest rate.  My question is kind of confusing and I hope I can explain it succinctly.

I have 5 different debts.  Because I have been paying extra for so long, one of my debts is in a situation where a payment is not actually due again until June of 2021.  With this in mind, I realized that if I cut back on the amount that I am paying on that one and apply the difference towards the account with the highest interest rate I can save money in the long run.  However, I am having trouble figuring out exactly how much to cut back on it.  With the help of excel I know that paying $0 for the next 31 months is not the best way to handle it.  Through trial and error, I think that the sweet spot is to pay somewhere around $100/month on it, and to apply the difference elsewhere.  However, what I really want is to be able to figure out an exact amount to the penny to pay, and my spreadsheet is coming up short.

Does anyone have any resources that you can share with me?

Edit:
Here's where I am currently.

Loan 1
Balance $5545.82
Rate 6.55%
Minimum Payment is technically $0/month, but I have been paying the previous minimum payment which is 355.41/month

Loan 2
Balance $6901.84
Rate 7.75% and growing (variable rate)
Minimum Payment $70.25/month

Loan 3
Balance $15595.12
Rate 5%
Minimum Payment $220/month

Loan 4
Balance $4213.80
Rate 2.99%
Minimum Payment 189.04/month

Loan 5
Balance $17500
Rate 7.25%
Minimum Payment $266.31/month

Total Balance 49756.58
Total Minimum payment $1101.01/month
I currently plan to have it all paid off in the summer of '23.

My question is, since I owe ""nothing"" on Loan 1, how much should I cut back and allocate to Loan 2, and eventually Loan 5, in order to maximize my payments.  By my calculations, paying $98/month on Loan 1 and increasing Loan 2 by $257.41/month will save me ~$344 over the next 4.5 years, but I want to find a more exact answer than that.",finance
personalfinance,Can and should residents refinance their medical school debt?,"Hi everyone -

I took out a private student loan this semester to help with rent, utilities, car insurance/payment. I will receive this disbursement in the next few days in the amount of $5600

I have since found a job that works with my school schedule but don't want to simply give the money back in the case that I lose this job.

I would like some advice and perhaps different perspectives on what should be done with this money.  Am I making the right choice?

I'm very apprehensive about helping her out because of 1. I'm afraid she can't afford to make the payments and 2. because she is not using a loan from a bank. I don't know anything about buying a house, but from what she has told me she is using a 'private lender'? I don't know anything about the lender other than the company name: GG Processing Team. She has told me that the loan would have a fixed interest rate of %6.25, is that reasonable? She is not going through a bank since her taxes don't show the income she needs to make the mortgage payments, but she owns her own business and has stated that her taxes have not been very honest. She has stated that she makes at least $6,000 a month for herself. I'm currently trying to look more into this company, as I don't trust or know anything about them. But I could use some advice! Is this legitimate? Can she make the payments? Any advice would be helpful.

I am in need of a car because my work is pretty far from base, and also cause I'm tired of bumming rides off of people.

  
What I know about buying cars is that I need a loan, I need insurance, and I need to find a car that meets my needs that is cheap enough for a loan. I also learned that no one likes no credit. I do not mind paying a slightly higher interest rate but I also don't want 18% (someone I know currently pays this for a used Cruze).

personalfinance,Looking for advice on whether I should pursue a private student loan to pay off credit card debt while in law school,"Hi all. I posted this in /r/lawschool first but thought I might get some good advice here. I'm at a good law school with ok grades (around the 50% class rank line). 2L hoping to be a public defender.

I went straight from undergrad to law school. In the summer between, I got married (partner is a bartender &amp; musician, so I'm prospected to be the earner; we're now separated but I'm still hoping for/working on reconciliation) and moved from Seattle to NYC, both of which were expensive and maxxed my credit cards. We had no savings due to growing up lower/middle class; my only job experience was working full-time as a waitress for living expenses during undergrad. I stopped working for law school and have been living off my maxxed student loans, which cut my budget lower than when I was working. About $25k/year income. I live modestly but the expectations and requirements of law school are costly.

I've been considering getting another serving job (ideally 2-3 shifts per week) but worry about it because I'm taking 15 credits including a clinic this semester, which is very demanding of my time and mental energy. My rent doubled when my partner moved out and I do not want to move again because I've already had 3 apartments since moving here, moving is exhausting, and I actually like my roommates rn.

I have about $80k undergrad debt because I was a stupid teenager and I'm expecting law school debt to put my total student debt for undergrad and law combined around $200k. Please refrain from comments on this fact as it is immutable and I understand the consequences and dumb decisions that played into it. I've been planning on using public service loan forgiveness when the time comes because currently all of my student debt is federal, not private.

I also have 3 credit cards, with a 10k limit, 1k limit, and $500 limit, that have been maxxed or near maxxed the whole time I've been in law school. My interest rate (around 20% I think on all 3) on all of them puts my monthly minimum payments on all 3 combined around $300. Yes I get charged financing every month as I am outside of the first year 0% perk.

I have approximately $10k per semester of income from my loans. My rent is now about $1200.

I have been considering taking out a private education loan of $10k to pay off my one biggest credit card, which costs about $220 a month in interest. I am looking for feedback on whether this is a good idea.

Thank you for your time.",finance

I have a low interest rate so I was thinking of making $500 payments and saving 1,000k, or maybe not saving (since I have about 8K saved up) and just put the $1,500 towards the loans? I also wants to start investing so I was thinking of putting $300 a month into a Roth IRA or an investment account but I’m not sure if I should yet.

personalfinance,"[Taxes] Owe Hundreds of Dollars, Selected ""0"" on W2","I am a low to middle class income earner (38k for this year) and I'm being slapped with a $700 NC state tax bill and only getting back a laughable a $12 federal refund.

I don't understand how this happened since I always select ""0"" on my employee tax form so I will try to make sure I don't underpay the government.  Last year, with similar statistics although less pay since I only started working full-time in June, I had an $800 refund.  

I did get married in November 2018, but even if I switch the tax software to say ""single,"" I still have the same exorbitant fees.  This leads me to believe it isn't a marriage penalty.  

I did put 20% of my income to my 401k this year, I don't know if that makes a difference.  I am concerned and want to make sure this doesn't happen again, since we are closing on a house in 2 weeks and this is a lot of money to pay.

personalfinance,Private Student Loan Assistance Needed,"Backstory: Entering into college the deal was that I would pay for a portion of my schooling through Mohela and my parents would handle the Navient portion. I have since paid my Mohela portion completely off. 

Current Status: I have had issues in the past where I would get calls about late payments on my Navient loans. I would notify my mom who would then bring them up to date. Annoying, but no big issue at the time. 

Until now. My parents are both retired and adjusting to their new incomes. They are finding it hard right now to pay for my brother’s loans and also mine. I have offered numerous times to take over as I do ok and can handle it.  They finally gave me the information for me to access my loans and look into taking them over. This is when the questions start. 

Dilemma: The loans are under my now deceased grandfather and my name. Also, the loans are at a 7% interest rate which is insane to me. First question is, what happens if they find out my grandfather is deceased? Since he is primary, then the tax forms go directly to, what I would assume, is his last known address. I want it in my name so that I have access to the tax form needed to deduct the student loan interest. Also, I just simply want it all in my name since it looks like for the foreseeable future that I will be the one paying them. Could they call the entirety of the loans due if it’s know he’s deceased?

Second and final question is about the interest rate. That’s incredibly high and plan to lower it. What goes into refinancing? Who should I look to in order to refinance? I currently have a pretty good credit score. 

Thank you for any and all input. I’ve learned a lot just lurking in the sub, but am now in need of some assistance.

personalfinance,Would I benefit from withdrawing from my Roth 401(k) to pay down student loan debt?,"Good afternoon! I was wondering if it would make sense to make a withdraw from my Roth 401(k) to help pay down student loan debt.

Some information about me: I'm 27 years old, and in a relatively stable career path. I'm not having any problems making debt payments, but they tend to be minimum payments due to my financial circumstances. My 401(k) balance is about $26k, and my student loan debt totals a little over $31k (all federal loans). My goal would be not to withdraw everything and put it toward this debt, but instead to target the high balance/high interest rate loans that make up part of my total debt. That way, it reduces my monthly payments, and I can more effectively save for an emergency fund and hopefully make more meaningful regular payments.

Does this sound like a good idea, or am I better off keeping as much as I can in my 401(k)? Thank you!

ETA: Sorry y'all, I was pretty unaware of exactly the options I had on my 401(k), and I didn't realize that I can't really make a withdraw as I thought right now anyway. Thank you for your advice, in any case!",finance
personalfinance,Employer payroll change making it difficult to manage my banking accounts,"So my employer switched to a new DD system and the max accounts we could have in the direct deposit is 3.  Previously, we could have as many DD accounts as we wanted.  This was nice for me because I had set up several accounts as follows:

* Emergency Savings
* Charitable Giving
* Property Taxes
* Regular Savings
* Main Checking Account

and I had my paycheck split up and DD'd into the amounts I specified.


With this payroll change its throwing me off and making it really difficult because I've come to the realization over the past few years that I need to have this stuff set up on auto-pilot otherwise I get in financial trouble.  I am pretty good about not touching the money in the ""Property Taxes"" account until I need it but if I have to rely on myself to manually transfer the money around, I get in trouble (I forget, I say ""well just this once I'll hold onto that money etc.).


What I'm doing right now as a sort of end-run is setting up *another* checking account (without a debit card) having my entire paycheck direct deposited into that account, and then setting up a ton of auto transfers from my CU's side to clear out those funds every payday and transfer them to the accounts I want.  This is kind of klunky because every time I want or need to adjust the allocations I have to tinker with both my bank and my employer DD settings


Combined with the fact that my CU, for all its perks, doesn't have really great interest rates, I'm thinking about moving to some online bank but I'm wondering if there's a bank out there that might do what I'm looking for.  I know that Capital One 360 has a sub account feature that might work really well for my purposes.  Ally has a better savings rate but doesn't really do sub accounts.  Ideally I'd like something that would see the direct deposits come in, make the transfers that I set up, and then sweep the remaining stuff into a savings account.

Any advice on doing this?",finance

personalfinance,New Family w/ Online Business looking to move Coast-to-Coast: Buy or Rent and When?,"Okay - I REALLY appreciate anyone who reads and gives me some opinions. Let's start:

25 yo w/ a 25 yo wife and a 2 year old daughter, another daughter due in April.

I currently rent at $630/month with about $1800 more in monthly bills/expenses. (Includes biz expenses, I have a business coach.)

I have an online business that JUST started taking off in December, it's now looking like I'll average about $5-10k/month.

My wife quit her job to help me in the house last fall.

I have zero debt and a 799 credit score. I currently have about $3k in the bank and about $5k accrued revenue from last month. I'm anticipating about $8k from my tax returns this year and have about $12-15k I can make from selling my two cars, which I will do before the move. I also have about $3.5k in ETF's.

I want to move from Ohio to Oregon this fall. This has been our dream for over three years now. We need 1 more bedroom, want to get some space for ourselves, and just generally love the PNW.

I just had a guy come in from Atlas Moving Lines to quote the moving cost, I haven't received it yet but I am anticipating somewhere between $3-7k. We can easily slim down costs by selling more stuff if we need to.

If we travel by train to get our bodies there, that's another $1400. Airfare is about the same.

To ship our two pets on an airplane as cargo will cost about $200-500.



[SUMMARY]

-Total cost of move (best estimate): $5-10k

-Current Funds (including assets): ~$25k

-Projected Funds by October (ROUGH estimate including assets, less monthly expenses, before taxes): ~$40-80k

I am something of a COMPLETE novice at finance, so point out anything you think I may have done wrong there with my calculations. Thank you!



[MY BIG QUESTION]

With the way the market is looking and the way interest rates are climbing, should I look into buying or renting?


I am tired of renting and would love to start building equity in a house (which I will eventually rent out), even if it's just a small starter house that's only one bedroom more.

However, if the market gets bad I don't want to be stuck with a huge loan and a nasty interest rate. 

Renting would give us more time and flexibility to explore the area and be more selective with the first house we buy, definitely a plus. It would also allow us to save more a buy a nicer one a year or so down the road.

My business is online marketing/web-building/coaching for fitness professionals and coaches. I am not sure how ""market-proof"" it is, but my business depends on there being people in the industry who want to make more money and scale. Not sure how a crash might affect that.

I'm trying as hard as I can to educate myself, get opinions, and form the most accurate picture of total costs.

personalfinance,Weighing options for truck purchase.,"Hello,

I'm going to buy a pickup, but I'm still weighing my options. I prefer to keep vehicles until they're unreliable, or cost-prohibitive to fix. I'll drive it less than 7k miles per year. Some short commuting, some (small) boat towing, some home improvement runs. Maybe adding a small camper in the future.

I have $400/mo to spend, either directly on a payment or through short-term savings.

My dilema stems from long-term cost-benefit and how to best use my money. It's a relatively simple conundrum, I think I just have analysis paralysis. My current needs are met by a mid-size, but I will need to step up to a full-size eventually. The greatest annoyance in my search is the need for a full size back seat, and a 6ft bed. The backseat is for near-future kids, the bed length is for general purpose utility. I basically have 6 options:

Full Size    
-Chevy/GMC 1500 / Crew Cab / Std Bed / $37k    
-F150 - Supercrew / 6.5 Bed / $36k    
-Chevy/GMC 1500 / Dbl Cab / Std Bed / $32k    

Mid-Size    
-Tacoma / Dbl cab / Lng Bed / $35k    
-Colorado/Canyon / Crew Cab / Lng Bed / $30k    
-Frontier / Crew Cab / Lng Bed / $30k    

The Tacoma is cost prohibitive as a mid-size. The 1500 Dbl Cab might be the sweet spot. I need to give it a better look in person.

In terms of new trucks, the Frontier is by far the cheapest. Nissan is offering 0% APR for 60 months. I could put down $6000 and be at my $400/mo max loan. The other manufacturers seem to be in the 4-6% APR range, which also looks to be the standard rate at most banks.

Financing a used truck would entail an APR around 5.29-6.24%, depending on age. Which is roughly a $21k loan ($400/mo max). There's also extreme variability in used truck pricing and stock. CCLB Frontier's are almost impossible to find. Tacoma's are almost the same cost as new. Colorado/Canyon are somewhere in between. Most full sizes are LTZ/XLT trims, which started out in the $40's, and are going for $30's used.

The frugal part of me wants to pay cash for the cheapest truck that meets my current needs, then trade up when my needs change regardless of how frequent. But I'm not sure if that's the smartest long-term decision. Right now, I have the down payment and credit score to get a used mid-size at the prime rate. I basically have 5 options, listed order of when it can happen:    
1. Buy a used mid-size now at a higher interest rate. Trade as needed.    
2. Save longer (~$5k) for a new Frontier, knowing the 0% APR probably won't offset the 5yr depreciation. Trade once to a full-size when needed.    
3. Save longer (~$10k) for a used full-size to keep long-term.    
4. Save longer (~$15k) for a new full-size, and justify the depreciation hit through long-term ownership.    
5. Save longer (~$20k) for cash payment on a cheap-ish (but reliable) mid-size. Trade as needed.

personalfinance,26-2 questions. 1) Roll student loan funds into mortgage/get refinanced self employed 2)Investment ideas outside a 401k,"&amp;#x200B;

About me:  


26  (27 in may)  


Assets:   
Cash/assets for sale currently/stocks/bitcoin: $66,300 (split is 42k cash/1400 stocks-etc/the rest in for sale assets and bank)  
Roth IRA (vanguard 2060 target date) $21,800  
 House: 80,000 equity (200k mrsp, I owe 115k)  
Assorted house stuff (garage gym/tvs/all the other stuff/car): 5000?  


Debt:  
Student loans- 13200$ student loans (I graduate in fall 2018 and no interest accrues until 6 months from january at around 4%). I took them because they were interest free. Haven't used them really aside from making that lump ira easier.    
Mortgage: 115k variable loan at fed prime rate  
 Credit cards: currently 700$ (they pay off every month)  


Current Income:   
\-self employed. 30k a year plus extra (sometimes I have a renter in the house @600/month,-did 45k last year but that was a good one  


Expenses:   
monthly mortgage 584$   
property Taxes/home insurance: around 320 a month   
Utilities around 300.   
Roth ira 480 or so  


Extra expenses: Dog vet bills Girlfriend Gas food etc (say 200)  


Total: around 1800 a month  


I've been out of the nest since I turned 18 and did a stint bouncing around from house to house while working in order to save money. Hence why my assets (cash and such) are high for the income level. I also drive a junky car, buy cheap groceries, etc. My credit cards are always used for max categories and paid off monthly. I save buying on eBay sales/preowned when possible. Shoot even home contractors will knock off a few bucks if you pay cash (got 5% off attic insulation last spring by not using a cc). Pretty frugal.   


I'll settle this into 2 areas of concern:  my mortgage and investing  


Mortgage wise I haven't had enough after write offs to qualify on my own. My father took a loan against his 401k-i put 20% down and that's how we purchased the home in 2015. The issue is this rate is tied to the prime rate. I need to refinance for a fixed rate but have no idea where to start. Would I be better off going to smaller credit unions/paying off more of the principle prior to applying/taking less milage write offs? Would paying myself a w2 vs lump drawing the profits every year or at least scheduling a bank deposit every month be useful? Mileage write offs are huge as I average around 30k a year driven at .52 a mile in my junker Honda. I'm also considering rolling that lower apr student loan $13,200 into the mortgage right now. It doesn't start collecting interest until July 2019 so I'm having trouble seeing the downside. 

&amp;#x200B;

Investing wise I have a vanguard target date 2060 Roth IRA. Current contributions for 2019 are 500 bucks so I still have another $5500 to meet the new limit. I should have about 35-40k to put in the market after moving 10k in emergency funds to a high yield savings account, keeping 10k in business assets usage/checking and keeping the other 10k in personal checking for monthly payments/bills etc. I know some investments are long term and have tax rules on income and such but I have no idea what I should be looking for. 

&amp;#x200B;

All in all I just graduated college and am searching for professional employment so the whole mortgage thing won't be an issue if I can just get a normal w2 this year that shows solid income but worst case scenario that doesn't happen-i'm trying to navigate.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I used the IRS withholding calculator and it says I should claim 8 allowances which may be correct. I will be filing married jointly, 1 job, 1 child and estimated salary for 2019 is &lt;55,000 (range is like 45,000-55,000). I have a few questions on this though.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Does the amount of allowances seem correct?
2. Wife is getting paid for 1st month of January only and then will no longer be working to take care of our daughter. On the IRS calculator I noted 1 job not 2 jobs since she will stop working. This still counts as 1 job for the whole year right? She will only make like 3,000 which I included in the IRS calculator
3. When I notified my employer to change my allowances from 0 to 8 they asked if this was for federal tax only? I answered yes, but was kind of confused by the question. If the IRS calculator tells me to claim 8 allowances do I need to do this individually for federal &amp; state taxes?
4. If my wife goes back to work in 6 months, can I change my allowances again?

Fast forward to now - my credit score is around 740 after paying things off last year. I've received an offer to reduce my interest rate on my car loan to 10.95% from Capital One; payoff is around $8700 on my car. 

Payments would be about $288 for 3 years(or $227 at 48 months) with the new rate and I would continue to pay what I pay now $320(and maybe moreso each month) - should I continue to shop around or are there any banks I should look into(I'm in the Bay Area, CA)


*EDIT* To be clear, if I refinance at 10.95%, I'd continue to pay $320 to chip away at the principal each month.",finance
personalfinance,Thinking about switching from Wells Fargo savings/checking to accounts with a higher APY. Should I go with a credit union or an online bank?,"Hi all. Right now, I have a little less than $2k combined in my Wells Fargo accounts, but I started a new job where I'd be making about $100k yearly with a $10k sign-on bonus on my first paycheck in a week. For that reason, I want to switch away from my WF accounts where I'm offered an APY of 0.01% to another financial institution where I'll have a higher APY. My major concerns are as thus:

* I want to have quick and easy access to funds if I need them. With Wells Fargo, I can access their ATMs at any moment, but they lack a good ATM locator so I often end up just having to drive to the nearest branch, since they'll have ATMs outside even if the branch itself is closed at that time. Any new institution I move to, I would really wish to have a good ATM locator so I don't have to hunt down a physical branch just to get some cash.

* I would like to minimize fees as much as possible. I currently hate that Wells Fargo dings me with an overdraft fee even though I have overdraft protection. So if I have two bills autopay on the same day without me realizing, there have been times where I can easily carry the cost (say an overdraft of $10 where I have over $1k in my savings) but they charge me $15 just to have a server change two numbers in their database. Similarly, because I have tried to keep as much in my savings and as little in my checking as possible in my past, there have been times where I've hit the six savings transfer limit without me realizing it and end up paying $30 just to cover an autopay I set to my savings a few years ago because at the time I didn't have enough in my checking account and didn't realize there was a limit. This latter fee in particular will likely be less of an issue now that I'm more aware of how to get around that fee--perform transfers at an ATM or a bank instead of online--but it's still a concern for me nonetheless.

* Lastly, obviously, I would like a relatively high savings interest rate.

So, as of right now, I'm thinking of several avenues I can go down:

* Because I have a Discover card, they have sent me a marketing email about their savings account with 2.10% APY. This seems to be a rate they offer to everyone, but they also offer a sign-up bonus. Hit $15k in a month, and they give you $150. Hit $25k, they give you $200. In the grand scheme of things, these bonuses don't seem that big--$150 is only 1% of what they require you to deposit to get that tier, for example--and I wouldn't be able to get the $200 bonus in time anyways. That being said, looking online they seem to be ranked alongside Ally as the best option for online-only banking. That, plus the high rate has me interested, but I've seen some complain about how it takes several days for money to go in and out of Discover accounts.

* Another option I'm thinking of, is that tied to my new employer is a credit union built to serve employees of this company. It doesn't have that great of an interest rate (variable depending on the balance in your account, but it ranges between 0.2% APY and 0.45% APY) but unlike Discover, it has physical locations available locally, a national ATM network, and it appears to have partnered with other credit unions to provide services at shared branches nationwide. 

* Yet another option is that I already have a Simple Checking account from a few years back, when Google Wallet was killed and Simple offered $20 to any Google Wallet users who signed up for an account. I only have $60 or so in it and have almost never used it, but the few times I have, the ATM locator was decent and the mobile check deposit process was buggy. It appears that now, if you have $2000 or more in your account, they will bump your APY up to 2.02%. This seems like a pretty high minimum and moving money in and out of the account has been a bit annoying, but Simple also does not charge any fees for my checking account--unsure if that changes for their savings accounts.

* The last option is to split my savings and checkings accounts among two different financial institutions. From what I can tell, there are online-only banks like Marcus by Goldman Sachs that don't offer checking accounts but offer a competitive APY--2.25% in this case. I'm not a huge fan of this idea because one of the things I've liked the most about my current setup is that moving money from one account to the other is instant without having to wait days because banking in America is such a nightmare.

Laying all of that out, I think I'm leaning towards going all the way in on Simple because I already have an account with them, but I'm open to impressions people have of any of these options, and pointing out anything I haven't thought of that may be a concern.",finance
personalfinance,How to get income tax back after repayment?,"So I'm in a weird situation, and I thought I had it figured out, but no luck.

Full story (TL;DR at bottom), I started working at a new employer in 2017. I received a ""starting bonus"" of $10,000, which I just included in my income on my tax returns that year. I only received $6,000, with $4,000 going to the government as income tax.

Jump ahead to 2018, I leave the company and they want their bonus back. Was part of the contract, all good. But they want back what they paid, not what I got, so about $9,300 was taken out of my final paychecks. The other ~$700 was left with me as overcollected social security and Medicare taxes, so I already have that.

So now I'm trying to get my remaining $3,300 of income tax returned to me. I researched and found [this](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p525.pdf) IRS document, which says I should deduct it as a miscellaneous itemized
deduction on Schedule A. I'm using TurboTax, so I go under ""Deductions and Credits"", ""Other Deductible Expenses"", and enter the $9,300 under ""Claim of right repayment over $3,000"". My Federal refund goes up... by $12.

What gives? How do I get my $3,300 back? Did I get screwed over? Any help is appreciated!

 TL;DR: I filed a ""bonus"" as income last year, this year I paid it back, now I want to get the income tax back.",finance
Forex,US national looking to forex to offset exchange AUD/USD rate risk while abroad - missing anything?,"I've been offered a job in Australia that is quite compelling to me. But as I'm sure most of you here know, the AUD has been trending downward and faces further potentially sharp declines in the next couple years due to:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Weakening economy and plummeting housing prices potentially forcing a RBA rate cut
2. Weaker Chinese demand for commodities reducing exports
3. Potential raise in USD rate by the Fed (seems unlikely at this point but you never know)
4. General recession sending money into stable currencies like USD (happened during 2008)

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen estimates that pose as much as a 25-30% drop from .72 to .5. in the next 1 to 2 years. I'm paid in AUD and don't plan to stay in Australia for a long period of time so this would be a huge drop to my salary.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to mess around with forex and TA back in the day, not successfully, of course, but then again, I was day trading and it did give me familiarity with the trading platforms. I was thinking of setting a hedge position via forex to offset some of the currency risk. I have probably 2k I can set aside, and my hypothesis is that the AUD/USD rate will not rise more than 6% from .72 to .76 (probably much lower than that, but still) , so I should set my leverage to be stopped out at that point, and this would give me 8-10k (minus 33% as tax rate) protection should the worst happen and there's a 25% to 30% drop.

&amp;#x200B;

I realize that if the currency spiked up  (as it spiked down recently) it could wipe out my position and then still go down anyway. Also if were to make 100k for example, then a 5% upward move is just about $400 a month in salary gained, so even if it went up for a while and came back down two months later, I would have lost my 2k position while just increasing my salary by $800.

personalfinance,I am 22 and on the fence about living at home to pay off loans or moving out to be closer to work. Please help.,"Hey Reddit,

To make this easier to digest, I will list my story for some context and all of my projected expenses and figures below it. 

Context: I am 22 and will be graduating college in May. Starting in June, I will begin my full-time salary job making $73,500/year before taxes with a $6,000 signing bonus (which will be taxed at some ungodly percentage). My job is an hour drive from my parent’s house, but really more like an hour and a half during rush hour. But not only is it an hour, it’s 60 miles. So not only would I be having a hefty commute, I’d be putting 30,000 miles on my car in one year (my work location changes after the first year). Speaking of my car, I need to buy one. My first beater car saw its final days recently and has been sent to the scrapyard. I am looking at cars with a budget of $15,000-$18,000 which will afford me a reliable, newer car. However, I’m going to load miles on it if I live at home. On the flip side, if I live in an apartment, my commute will be under 15 minutes and within 7 miles but my living expenses will be jacked up significantly. 

In short, if I live at home my newly purchased car will lose value quickly and I will be pretty miserable in the commute, but I could be saving over double the amount possible if I pay to live closer to work. Both options make a lot of sense in different ways, and I have no idea what to do.  

Income: $73,500 annual + $6,000 signing bonus

Projected monthly take-home: $4800

Projected monthly costs*: 3100

Student loans: $30,000
Interest rate: 4.5%

Current savings**: $5800

Goal for monthly savings: $1500

*Monthly costs include generous estimates for the following: rent, utilities, Internet, groceries, car payments, gas, student loan payments, car insurance, renters insurance. 

**Current savings needed for security deposit, and down payment on a car plus a couple months of car payments before my first paycheck. My parents said they would loan me first months rent if I don’t get paid quick enough

Am I just being spoiled for not wanting to make that commute and use my car for what cars are made for? Are one of these options jumping out at more practical or obvious? Any and all opinions are encouraged.

ethereum,I put Compound in simple terms with example calculations and smart contract code,"# What is the Compound dApp - explain like I'm 14

[Compound](https://app.compound.finance/) is a website where I can **give** digital money to other people or **take** digital money from other people for some time.

If I give money one day and take it back some day later, I get (a little bit) more money back than I gave.

If I want to take money, I need to give something valuable (other  money) first, as a promise for people that I will come back with their  money later. I can use the money I got myself, but if my valuable  security is not value enough anymore, some people might take it away.

That was the explanation in simple terms. Now to the more professional.

## What is the Compound dApp?

Compound is a tool where I can lend (i.e. give) and borrow tokens. The logic of the tool is based on Ethereum smart contracts. 

When lending tokens, I get an (changing) interest on my tokens. The interest accumulates and I can withdraw it.

I can only borrow a specific number of tokens, if I had lent more  than 150% of that value as another token. That’s similar to MakerDAO’s  DAI mechanism.

The borrowing interest rate for each market (i.e. token) is always  highe than the lending interest rate, and both rates change each time  somebody lends or borrows tokens.

## How does the user benefit from Compound?

The user either gets an interest (and takes risk) on lent tokens or gets a loan (and pays interest).

## How is the interest calculated?

Theoretically, if 1 person lends 1 token, only 1 token can be borrowed.

Let’s assume two situations:

1. 10 tokens are supplied (i.e. lent) and 1 token borrowed.
2. 1 token is supplied and 1 token borrowed.

In situation 1), both interest rates (i.e. supply and borrow interest  rates) are lower than for 2). Why? Who decides this outcome?

The answer is simple: The interest rate is calculated through a formula:

*Borrower Interest Rate =  a + Utilization Ratio \* b*

where

*Utilization Ratio = Total Borrow / (Market Liquidity + Total Borrow)*

That formula achieves *Total Borrow* growths. That's where  Compound makes money, i.e. a fee. Through balancing a stable market,  i.e. letting both Supply and Borrow grow, the formula keeps the interest  low enough for new Borrowers to come in and at the same time high  enough for more incoming new Supply that again keeps the interest low  for Borrowers. 

Perfect formulae, that optimize the conditions for growths of both the suppliers and borrowers, are the goal.

## The exact interest rate calculation - show me the code, bro!

The formula for DAI and other tokens wary, check out the detailed  formula in the **verified smart contract code** on the Ethereum blockchain:  Line 460 in [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0a97f822272519d5296e21de278a86cd3ce3c96a#code) for DAI and line 463 in [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd25c029a607ee888bdbdbe054515e25ec6f3fff9#code) for other tokens.

## Examples in Total Borrow &amp; Market Liquidity

See how the interest rate is calculated.

[Borrow APR = a + \(Total Borrow \/ \(Market Liquidity + Total Borrow\)\) \* b](https://i.redd.it/kkjn15necbb21.png)

Note that *a* and *b* differ from token to token.

## Risk for the user

**1) Risk for lenders**

She might not get her tokens back. Oversimplified, if a borrower can’t pay back money, the lender doesn’t get back his money.

To prevent that lenders don’t get their money back, 

1. All borrower have a minimum of 150% of the borrowed token value collateralized (in other tokens). 
2. There is a safety ‘equity’ that serves as backup in emergency (shown as ‘equity’ [here](https://app.compound.finance/#Markets))

Worst case scenario for the lender: 

You lend 1000 DAI. 

The prices for all other tokens on Compound crashes (but not DAI).

You can’t get back your money, because nobody can pay you back.

**2) Risk for borrowers**

Your collateral tokens might get liquidated. 

Worst case scenario for the borrower:

You lend 15000 BAT token (\~2000 USD).

You borrow 1000 DAI.

Tomorrow BAT is (temporarily) worth 0 USD. (Maybe the price oracle is broken.)

You lose all your BAT.

&amp;#x200B;

==Current Loans/debt monthly payments (excluding rent)==

15K on 14.9% Credit Card making $350/mo set to be 62 months to pay off with $6,544 interest paid; Payoff will be March 2024 at current schedule

6K on 9.0% auto loan making 250/mo payment set to be 27 months to pay off with $640 interest paid; Payoff will be April 2021 at current schedule

&amp;#x200B;

Total amount available for debt payment in her tight budget is $600 as she using now to pay down these debts.

We ran a Snowball calculatorand looks like the we would pay all the debt off in 46 months just paying the current $600 across both debts. SO that is the timeline we baselined at. 46 months with no changes to current approach. 

&amp;#x200B;

She is accruing no additional debt and has had a year of good budgeting.

She is considering ways to speed up the pay down.

Given she has no more cash flow opportunity we are assessing trying to reduce interest rate on part or all of this debt. The goal is to pay off faster.

&amp;#x200B;

No I cannot not pay off her debt :)

and

No we do not have an opportunity to cohabitate at this time to consolidate housing cost and increase cash flow.

We looked at a personal loan but the rates for her ""Fair"" credit rating are expected to be \~15% per some estimates we looked at.

We looked at a zero balance transfer card but we cannot add any more payoff power to ensure its paid off in 18 months and would end up with as high or higher interest rate then the current card after the intro period.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She has $120K in her 401K so there is the opportunity to get a 401K loan.

So we have turned toward a 401K loan option. This is what we are considering.

We estimated the consolidated 21K loan @ 6% would be paid off in 39 months with $2,142 interest paid; Payoff will be April 2022

She is aware that 401k loans would be due immediately if she changed jobs, but other than that, do you see any other downsides? Good/bad idea?

personalfinance,Is this house within our budget?,"We are looking at a house listed at 365k. We're looking to make a low down payment of \~5% so 15-20k. Our remaining savings will be 9k. We understand that we will have to pay PMI since we have credit score 620. We're estimating the total monthly payment at 2600-2800 (mortgage, insurance, pmi, hoa, taxes) given \~5% interest rate and hoping we can get the cost of the home down to \~330k.

Our current state:

\- Pre-tax income 150k (\~8k/mo after taxes and benefits)

\- 1k other monthly debt obligations

\- factoring in 1k/mo for food/living expenses

\- 850/mo utilities/gas/car insurance

\- after all \~2k/mo left for savings (24k/yr, 25% after tax income)

Some advice says this is okay. Others say it's pushing it. The house at full price is 2.5x annual gross pay, but percentage of takehome pay on total home payments is above 30%. Savings seems reasonable, but paying rent as we are currently will save us 3.4k/mo as opposed to 2k/mo. My feeling is that saving the extra will just go into a future down payment, so the cost of buying now is basically just 200$/mo in mortgage insurance (and we can refinance later).  If anyone can give some solid advice on this situation, we'd really appreciate it. Thanks!

personalfinance,Should we buy the house we're renting?,"In the fall I graduated from a Ph.D program and got my first job, and my landlord asked my husband (31) and I (30) if we wished to buy the house that we've rented for the past 5 years. Currently, our combined take-home pay is $5,650/month. We have $3,697 in credit card debit, $23,300 in student loan debt, and about $28,000 in retirement savings. Our original plan was to continue renting until we had a 20% down payment on a house in the $250,000-$300,000 price range.

Our landlord's initial asking price is $242,000. With that said, he recognizes that the house needs a lot of work and is therefore willing to negotiate the price. We've scheduled an inspection for mid-February. While we currently have no money saved for a down payment, he is willing to sell by owner and carry the loan so that we can avoid extra financing fees. He also said he could do a lower interest rate (4.5% instead of 5%), and keep monthly payments below $1,000.

We're wondering if we should take the plunge and buy this house or if it would be an irresponsible financial decision? If we do decide to buy, should we take him up on the owner financing option or should we try for a mortgage through a commercial lender? Also, if we did the owner financing option, would we still qualify for first time home owner benefits?

House pros: It's in a great location (we can walk to work), it's on a double lot, and it has a garage apartment.

House cons: It's 70 years old, has mold issues, is poorly insulated, and is generally run down.

If we don't buy the house, we will likely have to move in the next 6 months. Currently, we pay $850/month in rent (the same amount we've paid the whole 5 years we've lived here). If we rent a comparable place in town, it looks like we'll have to pay anywhere between $1,200-$1,500/month.

I'm 33 years old and I graduated college in 2008, during our last recession -- most millennials have never experienced one as an adult.  We are overdue for one, and there are some warning signs that this one might hit soon and hit hard.

Ideally, you want your finances to withstand a recession much like would you prepare your home to withstand a major storm or hurricane.   Layoffs are more likely to occur during a recession, and finding a new job will not be easy.  Banks are less likely to lend, and the value of your investments and home might plummet.

So, what can you do to prepare?

1. Pay down high interest debt.  When a hurricane is coming, you want to remove things that might threaten your house, like dead tree limbs.  Likewise, high interest debt, like credit cards, threaten your financial well-being. It's time to remove these threats, quickly and efficiently.  If not, they might bring down your roof.
2. Build an emergency fund - the food and water that will support you through the storm.  You might need to sustain yourself for some time.
3. Things will look different - don't panic.  When you step outside in the eye of the storm, you might notice things look different; they look scary.  Your home is underwater. Your 401K has lost 40% of its value.   Breathe.  The worst thing you can do is to panic and sell your investments.  They will rebound. It will take time.   Do not sell low and buy high.
4. Protect your foundation.  If you are nearing a major financial milestone, like buying a home, or retiring, prepare now by rebalancing your portfolio.  Equities will lose money during a recession.  If you will not need to access the funds soon, re-read step three.  If you are nearing a major milestone, and will need to access the funds soon, it is time to re-balance.  If your time horizon is 0-3 years, cash is king.

Am I able to contribute to a private 401k vs an employer 401k to lower my AGI? If so, how can I prove to MyFedLoan I've made these contributions?

Thank you in advance! I'm happy to provide any income info.",finance
worldpolitics,The inquiry,"Woodrow wilson was a globalist who created wilsonianism which is liberal internationalism. The inquiry was the team col.house and woodrow wilson formed to create wilsons 14 points and to be delegates at the treaty of Versailles which called for the platform of a global government the league of nations covenant. They chopped up europe, immposed penalties including reparations on germany that was unsustainable and tons of other stipulations that hindered germany . Such notable wealthy indivuduals created the inquiry which is known as the council on foreign relations today. Created and funded by jp Morgan, paul warburg,  jacob schiff, otto kahn, allen dulles, david rockefeller, walter lippman, and many other notable figures. The wealthist globalist internationalist bankers in the world created the council on foreign relations, they created the federal reserve, federal income tax, IRS, and controls the state department, CIA and much more not to mention their media empire. The CFR dominates all media. Col house was a marxist who wrote a book called phillip dru where he details the marxist takeover of america, col.house was Wilson's closest advisor. Today the CFR is considered americas ruling establishment,  they are the deep state that has been pushing marxist  global governance since its inception. They have entire committes that makes propaganda . Sigmund freuds nephew edward barnays is known as the father of consumerism and wss a CFR member. CFR founding member  Walter lippman wrote books on propaganda and headed americas first propaganda campain the committe of public information which was created to make americans more pro war and anti germany, and it worked.  Paul warburg of The warburg banking dynasty is considered the father  of the federal reserve, our economy and was a founding member of the globalist CFR, his brother in law jacob schiff was the richest person in america and his family has been partners with the rothchilds since the 19th century, his father was a broker and the family shared a house. Another founding influential member of the CFR is nelson aldrich who proposed the original name of the federal researve, the aldrich plan but warburg came up with an ingenius name, the federal reserve which isnt federal and has no reserves. Nelson aldrich married into the rockefeller family and the culmination of power lead to nelson aldrich rockefeller as vice president of the united states. Bith schiff andvwsrburg married into the kuhn and loeb banking empire. Biden is CFR, bush jr is cfr, clinton is cfr, and bush sr was cfr, every administration has been filled with at least 100 globalist CFR members since woodrow wilson. The CFR is america, they dominate everything and they are considered the secret government. The CFR and its members have control of 2/3rds of america wealth. Their goal has been to destroy america to be a subservient member of their marxist globalist government at the united nations. They have influential members and corporate organizations  throughout america, and like ive said they control the media, whats taught to our children in school, so they have the tools to indoctrinate every one. Jacob schiff gave millions to support communism in russia with the agreement that the bankers are in control over russia overall. These elitist bankers wish for global communism where only they have freedom. Its been going on for a century and has gained massively. The United Nations headquarters in New York City sits on 16 acres of land purchased with an $8 million donation made in 1946 by John D. Rockefeller Jr. Woodrow wilsons 2 closest friends were marxist and white supremacists,  wilson watched the birth of a nation with best friend and director of the movie thomas dixon which is pro KKK and col house gave him a copy of phillip dru which advocated for a central bank, federal income tax, which came to reality through the CFR just a couple years later, he was also a marxist. So woodrow wilsons friends were marxist and klansmen, both bigots

Its clear these elitist are planning a new world order, CFR member, ex president,  and ex cia director bush sr said in a speech that the globalist will be successful in creating this NWO which he admits is the united nations. Hes a member of the deep state, and is a globalist. Theyve worked 24/7 for 100 years and probably spend a few hundred billion to complete their agenda of enslaving the rest of mankind under agenda 21/2030 system. The clintons are hardcore globalist and they are democrats, the bushes support globalism and they are republicans so its clear they have control over our political systems too. These are the people who fund and profit from war, they have enough money to end world poverty but instead spend it on trying to enslave us all under their tyrannical oligarchy. These same banks who have been sucking us dry for a centhry has plans for us,  which is a life i want no part of. The banks were the first instititions to be internationalistic and they want control over the entire planet and its resources snd everyone and everything in it. 70 years ago all this was in the realm of conspiracy theory but today they dont deny it, global government is now legit conspiracy fact. They create policy in favor of globalism,  not american interest which they wish to destroy so were subservient to their tyrannical world government.

The bilderberg group and trilateral commission are both globalist organizations along with the IMF and world bank. According to the grace commission report every nickel of our federal income tax goes directly to the shareholders of the federal reserve for printing money out of thin air and loaning to our government st interest. The fed is not part of the government its a private central bank which id directly from the 10 planks of the communist manifesto, which we have all 10 in place today.

Carrol Quigley was bill clintons mentor at Georgetown and he was allowed by the CFR to research their archives.  Clinton even acknowledged quigley at his presidential inauguration which you can find on YouTube . He wrote the book tragedy and hope in favor of the globalist which he details the scope of the agenda of the CFR. 

“The powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences.” (Georgetown University Professor Carroll Quigley, 

""It is this power structure which the Radical Right in the United States has been attacking for years in the belief that they are attacking the Communists"" - quigley

The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies... is a foolish idea. Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American people can throw the rascals out at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy. Then it should be possible to replace it, every four years if necessary, by the other party which will be none of these things but will still pursue, with new vigor, approximately the same basic policies. -quigley

“There does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international Anglophile network which operates, to some extent, in the way the radical Right believes the Communists act. In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Round Table Groups, has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists, or any other groups, and frequently does so. I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960's, to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its instruments. I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies…but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.” (Georgetown University Professor Carroll Quigley, 

Going through the historical and modern member roster which is full of asses like cheney and Kissinger among 100s of other corrupt elitist, you can see there are very powerful and influential people, its like looking at a list of the ruling class of america.

The fathers of modern democratic party was woodrow wilson and his protege FDR who were both marxist globalist and known to be hardcore bigots, the CFR was the evolution of wilsonianism which the main liberal internationalist organization is the CFR. These people rule america.  George soros is a cfr member who has spent well over a billion in his lifetime to destroy america,  our heritage and culture which stands in the way of their globalist plans. Soros is the democratic party so for democrats to be marxist and globalist makes sense since the founders of modern democratic party were hardcore marxist, globalism  and bigots. The CFR is powerful and they are the deep state which has killed to silence those who oppose their agenda. Wilson helped create the league of nations and FDR helped create the united nations. Both hardcore globalist which makes them anti-American. FDR affectionately  referred to the paranoid mass murderer maniac joseph stalin as, "" uncle joseph

The federal reserve has been connected to the CFR since its inceptions and nearly all chairman of the fed has been CFR members, alan greenspan for example and chairman of fed now is CFR member Jerome powell, both organizations were made by the same people. There has been several president who are CFR member, which barely has 5,000 members, even less back then. What are the odds right? Theres no getting around the fact the richest oligarchs in the world are pushing global government under their control and they are definitley doing slimey things to achieve this goal theyve been working on for a century. Nothing but total control over the entire world. FDRs uncle was vice governor of the federal reserve board. He was one of the five members appointed by President Woodrow Wilson to the first Board. Kinda funny wilson appointed FDRs uncle to this position. Total corruption

FDR illegally seized 20,000 tons all of americas gold from its citizen's with executive order 6102. But of course you were able to trade in actual valued precious metals for worthlesspaper fiat money. Do you know why they did that? To bail out the federal reserve which drive oir economy into the ground in less than 20 years, but dont worry about that just give us your valuables and we eont arrest you. The federal reserve destroyed our economy on purpose than now america had to give up all its gold to the rich criminals who orchestrated the depression.  We have been bankrupt and in debt to the fed since its creation, we do nothing.

Again i reiterate we have CFR member and ex director of globalist CIA, George bush sr gave a speech speaking of the NWO and how they Will be successful which shows me this is a calculated  agenda, he goes onto say the the united nations is this new world order, you cant be any clearer on this, from an elitist himself which was a giant in the deep state . The evidence is here if you dont believe in the NWO than you need to wake up or else beforr you know it youll be living under their system, the same people who fund and profit from war.",finance

personalfinance,Tips for improving credit,"I've lurked for a very long time but now it's my turn to ask for advice~
I am (f)23, I have no credit cards, federal student debt of about 14k. I don't have a car I pay on, I just now started paying on my student loans. About $90 monthly on my student loans.
Currently my credit score is a terrifying 545. I've been embarrassed about it for some time and wish I'd have been more proactive about credit when I was younger but I never had any knowledge of how credit worked until I was like 20. Even then I was freaked out by the number and didn't want to face it. Up until now I also haven't been able to afford any extra bills but I've just got a new full time job paying $15/hr. 
My rent and monthly bills add up to about $700 monthly. So I have quite a bit of extra income that I use to help my fiance pay his medical bills ($100 monthly). I'm the main one buying groceries ($125-150 monthly) and paying for non-essential things. ($200 monthly) I've been starting to save what I can.
Mainly I'm trying to get my credit in order so I can eventually purchase a car, and then a house with my future husband. 
Today actually I opened a secured credit card with my bank, Navy Federal, it's only a $200 credit line but I figured that would be a place to start. If there's any more advice or more things I could be doing to better my finances I would really like to know so I can start preparing for the future.

personalfinance,Need advice on mortgage payment,"I'm in need of advice. My wife and I are looking for our first home. We have been looking close to a year.

We found a beautiful home in a good neighborhood, in the same street our family lives in, as well as good school district. The problem it's listed at 450k, but our realtor was able to get the listing agent to drop it to 440k. 

We are using a VA loan and my loan broker told me that I can qualify for this home for 440k with a 4% interest rate. My take home pay is $6826 and he estimates the mortgage payment will be $2454. We have no other debt besides car insurance. The property is located in a neighborhood with two HOA's. One of them is $321 quarterly and I'm estimating the other one be around $200 quarterly just in case.

personalfinance,A Little Extra Cash Every Month: Where to Put it?,"I've been tightening up my budget and I'll have about 40-100 extra per month. I'm looking to get the MOST work out of this very small sum each month. I'm a full-time college student, I work 25 hrs per week, tutor 2X a week, and starting to do a little freelancing but not banking on that paycheck right yet. Currently, my expected January expenses is \~$1375 and my expected January income: \~$1420. These are likely to fluctuate a little bit by the end of the month, but I'm pretty spot on with my numbers. Right now spending is higher for textbooks/school supplies. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, where should I put the extra money: short term savings, long term savings, or student loans.

&amp;#x200B;

My short term savings is \~$500 right now, and is used to cover three things ONLY, college tuition, medical emergencies for my pet rabbit and car breakdowns/parts. The account was mostly emptied in November, when I finish paying for fall tuition &amp; paid off my credit card. A family member gifted me spring tuition, so I just need about $6,000 for fall. I typically contribute $500 every month to this fund (30% of my paycheck), but did not in December. 

&amp;#x200B;

My long term savings is a new Ally account. I set this money aside to help me with moving costs and first month's rent. I graduate next December, have job prospects with good pay in other cities, and I'm really tired of living with my parents as they are with me after 23 years. Currently, this account has $150. This was part of my Christmas bonus, and a standard $50 I budgeted to go in every month. 

&amp;#x200B;

My student loan total is roughly $65,000, and is looking to be close to 70 by the time I graduate in the fall. I have 9 Stafford loans in deferment (likely 1-2 more in the fall), 2 HESAA loans being paid on by my parents (NJ state), and 1 Sallie Mae loan in deferment. Sallie Mae is $3,600 with interest now and has a 12.875% interest rate. Sallie Mae is the one I went to pay on first, given the IR. 

&amp;#x200B;

My initial thought was to put the money into the loan, the rate is ridiculous and I want to have it paid off before graduation (Dec 2019). Am I better to put is into the short term and top off my school savings first? Or long term since apartments &amp; moving 2 states away is expensive as hell?

worldpolitics,"Donald Trump is the only one who can end the US government shutdown. Here's why, and my suggestion for what I believe is a reasonable compromise.","Trump is the only one who can end the shutdown, and I'll explain why (apologies for length):

-----

**Why can't Dems end it?**

There is a reason why we have a policy that states we don't negotiate with terrorists. Why the official position is that we don't pay kidnappers ransom money. Because it is positive reinforcement, which encourages someone to repeat behavior in the future. If a kidnapper was never paid money, eventually he'd give up or try something else. He would give up even sooner if he suffered negative consequences (i.e., punishment).

Donald Trump is essentially a hostage taker in this scenario. He is holding a figurative gun to the head 800k federal workers, food stamp recipients, individuals and businesses that depend on government services, and others, saying, ""give me $5.7 billion in unmarked, non sequential bills, or I kill a hostage. Every hour you don't comply, I shoot another hostage.""

So, what happens if Democrats acquiescence to his demands. We build a wall, and that's that? Government becomes a smooth oiled machine and never closes again? Of course not! Trump would then know that he had a massive, unbeatable weapon in his arsenal, and he'd whip it out whenever he didn't get his way. Repeal Obamacare or I kill the hostages. Give corporations a bigger tax break or I kill a hostage. Revoke subsidies for green technology and deregulate the fossil fuel industry or I kill a hostage... there would be no end. And if you're thinking, ""Dems wouldn't have to do it a second time..."", well, do you really believe Trump would think that? He'd believe, from experience, that it would just be a matter of time before he is rewarded. He'd never be the one to end a shutdown again.

If someone tries to extort you, and says to pay them or they [insert thing you don't want to happen], and you pay them, do you really think that'd be the end of it? Or do you think they'd keep coming back, because it's an easy, proven source of money?

-----

So, what happens to Trump if he gives up his demand? In his own words, ""I'll look foolish"". His base will be mad at him. He may lose some support (though polls suggest he's already losing a lot of support). It will hurt his image with the MAGA crowd. It will hurt his ego. It may hurt his ability to get reelected.

To put it succinctly, his concerns are mostly personal and political, whereas Democratic concerns are mostly practical.

Now, **don't get me wrong, Dems are being plenty political too**. The way Pelosi and Schumer have said that they will not give one penny for a wall has left them with no room to negotiate. By saying it's morally wrong (which I don't get nor do I agree with), they've made compromising *immoral*. They've made a political calculation that the fallout will mostly fall of POTUS and Republicans, which is fair considering it is the President's last minute demand that caused the shutdown, and Mitch McConnell won't bring any legislation to the floor that tries to open the 87.5% of government that is unrelated to the wall (basically, everything but DHS). But with their absolutist assertions, they have left themselves with no room to compromise, which leaves them with the same personal/political concerns Trump has about looking like they are giving in. And even if they are *winning* politically, the American people are hurting. Regardless of who's fault it is, that should provide enough motivation to be at least somewhat flexible.

Now let's not kid ourselves; Trump is not going to just give up his demand all of the sudden, no matter what. If the shutdown made the economy tank, he still wouldn't give in, because he would never be willing to sacrifice his massive, fragile ego or his image. He'll cause every federal worker to become homeless before he gives the Dems such a clear win, and he'd still say they support him.

-----

**For people saying ""we don't need Trump, just Mitch McConnell,"" while that may technically be true, you're dreaming if you think McConnell will solve this**. Republicans are terrified of crossing Trump, because in most states/districts, he is the king maker or breaker. A bad word from him or a good word about your opponent and you lose your primary. A politicians #1 priority is getting reelected (true for either party), and most Republicans can't get reelected without Trump's support, against his will, or even if they're just perceived by GOP primary voters as not supporting him enough. McConnell is up for reelection in 2020. McConnell is definitely not going to cross Trump on one of his signature issues. So while you're well justified for blaming him and condemning his inaction, you can forget about him doing anything about the shutdown without Trump's approval.

-----

So, how do we solve this?

**Donald Trump must agree to open government, in exchange for *some* action on a wall.** It doesn't *have* to be funding, but there does have to be a commitment of sorts.

There's another big problem getting in the way of negotiations too: misinformation about a wall's *actual effect* on border security. Donald Trump makes it seem like a wall is a panacea that will solve all our problems and is the only possible way to keep our border safe. Meanwhile, the Dems argue that it is completely unnecessary and won't help at all. The truth surely lies somewhere in between these positions.

What we need is a non-partisan group of experts and academics to take a close look at the border, using *actual* data and unbiased assessments, and determine what would be the best way to secure the border. 

I've seen some experts say that when we built the fencing under George W Bush, it was erected in most areas where it was needed and feasible. Most of the areas where there isn't a barrier is on purpose. ***But***, perhaps there are *some* areas where building a barrier would significantly improve security. We haven't had an honest, unbiased, fact-based discussion about it because the topic is so politically charged.

There's also a big problem that $5.7 billion is a number that doesn't seem to be based on anything. Most estimates for the cost of a wall have been much higher, and walls have additional and recurring costs. You don't just build a wall and that's the end of it; you need to build infrastructure to build and maintain it, you need manpower to preserve it and man it, and you have annual maintenance and upkeep fees as well (replacement parts, tools, vehicles, gas, etc.). How much have we spent on upkeep since GW Bush built the fencing? Probably billions, but those fees were never acknowledged or discussed before construction. We need to know exactly what will be built, so we know the *total* one-time and recurring costs.

Still, there is no way that spending all of your budget on a barrier is the best way to protect the border. Fencing is fairly easy to defeat. A ladder, a rope, a tunnel, a saw… I've seen many pictures of people scaling the existing fencing with no assistance at all! You need cameras, you need drones, you need sensors, you need patrol roads, and most of all, you need manpower.

We need a group of unbiased experts and academics to tell us all these things. They need to do some research, evaluate all the factors, and produce a report and a recommendation (or a few alternatives at different price points).

How do we get an *unbiased, non-partisan* group of experts and academics? Democrats and Republicans only need to agree on one person: The leader. Someone who has nothing to gain by favoring either position. Someone who doesn't work in government, and owes nothing to either party. Someone who has demonstrable experience and expertise, and is viewed as a leader in the field of border security. (Perhaps we could even avoid the need for parties to agree all together, and just allow all the experts/academics who have no stake in the decision to vote amongst themselves and choose the most renowned person or people in the field)

Then, allow *him/her* to build a team of experts and academics. Give them some time to conduct their research, obtain facts and data, compile a report, and provide a recommendation(s) on steps that should be taken at the southern border to improve security.

Trump and Nancy Pelosi agree on a name, and agree to accept the recommendations of the group. Then Trump agrees to reopen the government, pending receipt of the group's report/recommendations. If the report says some wall is necessary, the Dems can no longer suggest that additional fencing will not improve security at all. They also agree to drop their dumb claim that a wall is immoral, considering they didn't have that argument when GW Bush did it. Yet, I find it hard to believe a group of unbiased experts would suggest that building a $5.7 billion dollar wall is best way to improve security and a good use of taxpayer money.

The report would give both sides political cover. If the report recommends that some length of wall will be built (and I'm sure it will at least suggest that *some* additional fencing is required), then Dems are not acquiescing to Trump, they are just listening to the experts. Trump will still likely get some wall. But for now, he gives everyone suffering from the shutdown some relief, and he can legitimately claim he hasn't given up, he's just waiting for the experts to delineate the best way to protect the border. He's been promising his base a wall is coming for years, I think they can wait a little while longer. Trump will recover the support he lost by ending the shutdown, and most importantly, we stop the fucking bleeding.

Nobody will really be happy about this, which is how you know it'd be a good compromise. This country is needlessly suffering, it's time for both sides to show a willingness to put the people first. 

Dems can't give in to Trump's demands or he will totally own them until he leaves office, but Trump needs some face-saving consolation in order to end the shutdown.",energy

Forex,Why you will never make it as a trader.,"Ok, a bit of a dramatic headline, but it got you to click. 

A bit about me. 

Trader for about 8 years and I’ve been a broker in the mid market too. 

I used to contribute here a fair amount on a different account but haven’t in the last year or so. But I’ll pop by every now and then. 

Let me tell you why you’re unlikely to make it, but with the reasons why, I’ll provide you with the way to learn how you can. 

Retail, you are too comfortable with charts. 

I see a lot of charts and they tend to be art work rather than anything pertinent to actual context right now. 

We are human, and one of the things we do is to confirm our own biases. 

Most of the time, that is all you’re doing when you are trading purely via a chart. You can argue with me on this one, but I’ve seen it 9/10 - and you will not make money. 

You can try and think that you know where the ‘big boys’ (God what an annoying phrase) are trading, but really it’s unlikely you do... especially when they don’t know where each other are trading. 

I can tell you that from the clients I had who were funds, few ever spoke about what ‘institutions’ or large players were doing because they FOCUS ON THEIR OWN TRADING. 

You have to think to yourself why so many educators sell market opacity - why do they put up smoke and mirrors as to what banks and institutions are doing? Surely not to sell anything...

Let me still chastising and sounding pompous. Really not what I want to do. 

What many miss out on is the essential knowledge of what the market is there for. 

If we’re specific with FX, it is there to facilitate trade, have a functioning economy relative to asset flows and capital. 

With this in mind, what is the one feature that I see little written about here? 

For me, it’s truly in depth analysis of what’s really going on. 

For example, there has been a long narrative over the last year of the trade war + the Fed raising rates in mainstream media. 

While important, this is not what is affecting money markets such as LIBOR, Euribor and USD denominated debt piles in the EMs. 

What is the real priority is Fed balance sheet reduction and the wars the central banks are having with each other quietly. 

Take the PBoC for example. They’ve recently caused an uptick in the total global central bank balance sheet holdings since they’ve been trying to stealthily ease while deleveraging. 

Back in Jan 2018, SHIBOR (Shanghai Interbank Overnight Rate) fell from a high to 50% of the rally from 08. This was a response to Trump’s tax cuts where they thought there may have been credit stress on the interbank, and with high Chinese corporate debt, I think it was a good move then. 

BUT, where is the trade here? 

Look at AUDJPY. AUDJPY is a risk proxy first and foremost, but also a proxy for Chinese aggregate demand. 

If we feel that China is slipping, we sell AUDJPY... but if we go to the root of the issue, it wasn’t tariffs that caused China to have a record surplus in Q3 this year, but the Fed’s balance sheet reduction which caused a Chinese response to ease on their money markets with a corresponding liquidity problem with the dollar (dollar got more expensive!). 

If you know that relationship then you know how to action a trade, and this is an example of what I feel a lot of retail miss out... less spoken about details that are really the main story, but are drowned out by the talking heads. 

You want to be trading in the tails of a normal distribution of fundamentals. 

Find data on countries that isn’t being spoken about but matches with a knock on event that is happening now. This could be political risk, economic, anything that you can get an angle on that others can’t see. Get down a rabbit hole of seeing if your macro thesis has potential, then look at data, data, data. Hell even jump on LinkedIn or Twitter or Facebook and ask people what their opinions are on things happening in their country. ANYTHING to get an edge. 

Now look at your longer term chart. Is there a reason to technically take this trade? Is there a trade that is cheap now? Trading in the tails will have most trades being cheap because you’ll know when you’re wrong very quickly, but have good upside potential since it’s unlikely to be realised by many yet. 

Could you trade it via futures spreading or is an outright FX trade the best to play it via - what about trading an index? An ETF? What about a combination of all three?

I have a small private student loan for $5000 (now down to \~$4200) with a 7.4% interest rate. Everything else is federal and at a much lower rate. I started a job a few months ago that let me start saving money and I've been thinking of getting into some sort of investing (not a damn clue, know nothing about anything yet) but I could also use the money to pay off the loan in full and still have a 3-month emergency fund and a bit extra. It'd bring me back to minimum savings, but it's doable. Is it generally worth it to pay off these things asap, before using money for other sorts of endeavors?

personalfinance,Student loan consolidation,"Hey PF,

It's about that time to where I'd like to consolidate all of my loans (~60k over ~4 lenders) into one lower interest loan. 

What are the best lenders for this, in your opinion? My credit isnt very good (530) and I have 2 credit cards through Capital One that I max out and pay off each month. 

Around February 7th I'm staying a job that will get me 80-120k a year. (1000/week + the amount I make from the load, usually 500 dollars a week)

I currently make 22,500 (or whatever it is for 1800/month) 

My plan was to up my yearly ""income"" to 30 or 35, and throw the rest at my loans  to get them over with.

I'm looking for a lender, decent interest rate, but mainly that would be willing to consolidate my loans with my crap credit, and having a high monthly payment isnt an issue...that's actually the plan.",finance
personalfinance,Investing in Roth IRA is better than Traditional IRA if I’m below the 12k standard tax deduction. Is my thinking right?,"I’m looking to contribute to my 2018 IRA before the April 15 deadline, and am trying to decide if I should invest in a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. I’m currently renting and not paying student loan interest, so my tax deductions will be below the 12k standard deduction. 

My thinking is if I’m not going to have tax deductions above the 12k standard deduction, it would be ill advised to invest in a Traditional IRA because the tax benefits a Traditional IRA gives will already be covered by the standard deduction. This means if I invest in a Roth IRA, I will still be paying the same federal tax rate as if I invested in a Traditional IRA. 

If I’m thinking correctly, it seems like a no brainer to invest in a Roth IRA and not have to pay taxes on the funds in retirement. Does this make sense, or am I missing something?",finance

personalfinance,"20 years old, how can I make sure I set myself up well for the future?","For starters, I am typing this on mobile and I am currently at work. Sorry in advance for the poor formatting. 

I have recently accepted and started a new job that (with overtime, which we are never short on) will gross me close to $50k a year USD. There’s no chance I will work a full year without overtime, but I could volunteer to work considerably more if it means paying my debts off sooner. I am paid by the hour, and paid out weekly, my weekly paychecks will average about $750/$800. Sometimes more. 

I don’t have too much debt, I believe I can have it all paid off within a year, with the exception of my vehicle. Here’s how my debt breaks down: 

Car loan - I owe about $10k still on my vehicle. My payments are $233/mo thanks to my insane interest rate. I bought the car when I was 19, and plan to refinance in February once I’ve had it for a year. 

Student loans - I attended college briefly and owe collectively about $4,000. I can’t provide exact numbers or interest rates due to being at work, but I think they’re fairly average. 

Credit cards - My current balance on my one credit card (Journey card from Capital One) is about $2,500. 

Financed PC - I regret doing this, but I financed a computer through Affirm and the principal is $1,600. 

I had a lot typed out here initially, breaking down how much I’m paying each month towards bills and to what. I think it’s easier to say I’m spending about $1,300/mo. currently on housing, transportation, payments towards debts, etc. That figure will change before long, as I plan refinance my car next month. I’m also going to change how much I’m contributing to debts, as I want to knock them out quickly. Hopefully within the next year. 

I am setting up my 401k soon through my employer and plan to contribute 10%, 6% will be matched.

At a very basic level, I’m trying to figure out what my best options would be to start: A) Eliminating current debts quickly. &amp; B) Saving towards my future. Roth IRA? Simply putting money into a savings account? I know I have some options but I want to make sure I’m doing everything right from day 1.

Also: I know there is a ton of helpful information in the sidebar and I plan on diving into that head first when I have my next day off. I am hoping to get opinions from you all before then.

financialindependence,Why I'm Not Afraid to FIRE Abroad in The Philippines and Live Like a King,"For many British, Australians and Americans, retirement time is just  around the corner. At home, with low interest rates and high cost of  living, the prospect of trying to live on a pension, in old age, is a  daunting one unless you are prepared to substantially downscale your  lifestyle. 

For some, moving to retire in another country is an option which has  been successful in the past with Spain, Portugal, Mexico and Puerto Rico  being among some of the more popular destinations. **But why not consider retiring in the Philippines?**

## The Case for Retiring in a Developing Country

Over the past decade, the Philippines has become a retirement haven  for thousands of foreigners, particularly the Japanese, Korean, and  Northern Europeans. 

Along with Thailand and Malaysia, the Philippines developed  communications, infrastructure, and service delivery systems  specifically geared to meet the needs of foreign retirees. Better yet,  unlike most European Countries and South America, nearly everyone speaks  ENGLISH in the Philippines.

The Philippines offers a **significantly lower cost of living.**  The Philippine Peso (PhP) exchange rate is approximately PhP 45 to $  1.00 or PhP 92 to 1 Pound \[Sterling (GBP)\]. Housing, food, and labor  costs are quite reasonable. 

A One bedroom condominium can be purchased for around $ 72,000 or GBP  37,000 or a Studio for only $ 45,000 or GBP 22,800 and one can dine out  on average at a three star restaurant for less than PhP 500. 

If you hire domestic help, a private driver’s salary is approximately  PhP 10,000/month, while trained housekeepers earn approximately -PhP  5,000/month. These salaries are lower if you live in the provinces.

## Same Comforts as You’d Find Anywhere

Cable Television, Hi-Speed Internet and Satellite Communications are  cheap. One can hire an air-conditioned taxicab for eight hours for less  than $25.00. In a country where a provincial Governor’s salary is only  PhP 28,000 per month, and a Presidential Cabinet Under-Secretary earns  PhP 35,000, retiring abroad makes mathematical sense.  


So, if you have a retirement income of approximately $1,500 to $2,000  per month ( PhP 80,000 to 100,000) you can live quite well in the  Philippines.

### Healthcare Expenses

As for health care, most U.S. Health Management Organizations pay for  medical expenses incurred in the Philippines. Check with your HMO. The  Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs presently has a task force  headed by former Secretary Roberto Romulo working to have the U.S.  government accredit a number of first class Philippine hospitals for  Medicare reimbursement. 

The Makati Medical Center, one of the nation’s best already has such accreditation. 

Unbeknown to many is that for years, citizens of nearby countries  such as Thailand, Nauru, Tonga, Indonesia, and Malaysia have flocked to  the Philippines for medical care, particularly sensitive surgical  procedures.

The quality of medical care at the better Manila hospitals such as  the Asian, St. Luke’s, Medical city, Cardinal Santos, Philippine Heart  Center for Asia, National Kidney Institute, and Makati Medical Center  meets international standards.

 

A Japanese company is building a medical facility in Tagaytay city  exclusively for Japanese nationals within the year. There are now close  to 10,000 Japanese retirees in the country, and the number is growing  annually. The British government recently acquired a large tract of land  in Fort Bonifacio to build a new Embassy. 

The British ambassador explained the larger facility is meant to help  serve the growing number of British nationals retiring there as well.  Japanese and Korean investment groups are buying homes and condominiums  in Manila, and tracts of provincial land for retirees. This has caused a  mini- Real Estate boom in the country. A retirement village exclusively  for Japanese nationals already exists in Tagaytay, and more are  planned. These are strong indicators of what is on the horizon

## Language

English is the Philippines’ official business language. Most of the  people you will meet, from hotel workers, taxi drivers, sales or service  people, government employeesa all speak English, or have a working  understanding of it. The middle class speak English, without exception.  All major newspapers, and major broadcast companies use English. An  English speaking visitor will never get lost in the Philippines. 

It is the universal use of that language that has been a strong  incentive to foreigners. As well, communications links within the  country and to other countries via the various commercial gateways is up  to international standards. For example, the use of cell phones and  text messaging is so common that housemaids, street vendors and food  hawkers can be seen using their cellphones incessantly.

## Adventures

One will never want for adventure and sights to experience in the  Philippines. There is always a colorful Fiesta, pageants, street  festivals, and open public events going on. Lush with bountiful natural  resources, one can enjoy the numerous beaches, resorts, golf courses,  and play just about any sport, except skiing. 

There is an ice skating rink in Manila, though. Scuba diving and  fishing are among the sports which draw the most number of foreigners to  the rich aquatic offerings.

Shopping is the Filipinos’ second most popular activity, the first is  eating. Manila is Asia’s undiscovered shopping Mecca. You will love the  golden purple sunsets, the fragrance of the flowers at dusk, and the  wonderful array of fruit and food. I used to enjoy watching the Sun set  from the bar at the Philippine Cultural Center. 

There, you can listen to the Symphony, check out a play, or enjoy  Grand Opera. There is just so much to explore and discover, specially in  terms of nature, culture, and history. If you’re a betting man, there’s  horse racing, the Jai Alai, numerous first class casinos, and of  course, cok-fighting. Manila is well known for its exciting night life.

She has a good career for the area and makes decent money but has little to nothing to show for it. She has 2 student loans, 2 maxed out cards with high interest rates, a large personal loan with high interest and a payment near as high as a mortgage, a car payment and multiple other expenses. I have been having to make up the difference lately. Paying for her gas to work, electricity, heating fuel, taxes, internet, groceries, etc. Nearly every dollar of her income goes to barely making minimum payments on her debts. She just fell in a hole over the past 2 years. Other than the student loans she didn't carry much debts. But now she is buried in them and I can't bail her out. 

We have a house that will be transferred to us soon (family home) free and clear with land. But with her current financial state we are worried that it is now or never if she is going to go down the bankruptcy route. Because as of right now, she technically has no significant assets other than her car. But once the house is in our names that will change. 

We have no kids and no joint assets as of yet (recently married). Vehicles are in our own names only and our house is still in the name of my family for now. She spoke with credit counseling and they felt that bankruptcy might not be a bad call at this point.

I have tried doing research online on the subject and have only gotten vague overviews of the process. 

So I am seeking input from folks that have experience in the field or who have been there themselves. Is now the right time? Should we be doing anything to prepare?

Summary 

Her family has requested that I be able to match her down payment, in order to be included on the mortgage &amp; title (understandable, just unfortunate timing with my situation...see below).  

My family has offered to help me out, but we aren't sure how to proceed with me acquiring a 40-60k gift for purposes of a down-payment.  Plenty of monies available, but are currently tied up in a before-tax funds (unfortunately not diversified for quick access). 

Details

Currently renting $2500/month (30k/yr) in a downtown environment.  If we break the lease at any time other than at yearly renewal, we forfeit security deposit ($2500) in addition to 1 months rent ($5k total).  

Combined income is around 120k (equal salaries), looking at houses or townhouses around 300-350k.  Looking to put down about 20-40% (60-120k) as a down-payment.  

She comes from a very well off family, and has up to 60-80k cash on hand (her emergency or ""do whatever"" fund) in her name she can use as a down-payment.  No debts, loans, but doesn't own any assets in her name either (ie car).  Perfect credit score.  Retirement fund isn't really an issue due her family's finances &amp; trusts.  

I have a small student federal loan ($8k), no other debts, but also no real emergency fund or savings for a down payment.  I have had some major medical bills come up in the last year that drained me.  The medical bills were major (happened after the ring), due to a not at fault accident, that probably won't be settled for another 2-4yrs (optimistically 80-100k), but will also incur medical costs for many years to come.  Credit score is 700's, have some retirement savings but not maxed out.

&amp;#x200B;

My partner and I have been discussing purchasing a house in the future and I want some advice on whether it's a good idea, what we should do to work towards it, whether we should hold off for now, upsides/downsides compared to renting - basically if it's viable for us moving forward.

&amp;#x200B;

Current situation:

* Me 24M working full time -earning \~$50,000 base pay after tax, but last year it was \~$65,000 after tax including commission.  My income fluctuates so some months I have a large excess of income and some it's lower.
* Partner 23F working part time -earning \~$30,000 after tax
* We also have a 2 year old daughter together now and are considering potentially having another child in the near future.
* We are both fairly bad at sticking to a budget so we haven't saved as much as we would like to have but are working on improving that.

Major Expenses are:

* Rent: \~1650/m
* Childcare: \~800/m
* Food: \~800/m (We are bleeding here and we know it, but both have some pretty bad habits that we are currently trying to break)
* Fuel: \~250/m
* Insurance: \~250/m
* Based on our previous spending there are other miscellaneous expenses which probably total close to $1000/m in the form of subscriptions, gym, and other things which we should probably be cutting down.  I don't have a lot of this in front of me as I'm typing this but will edit with more details once I get back to my budget I have at home.
* This leaves us with a little under $2000 to save each month, though we have had some unexpected expenses recently which have eaten into our excess money.  I know we can do better with better budgeting and we are working on it but we do both have some pretty bad habits to break (eating out and purchasing unnecessary things)

Debts:

* Currently have one credit card with $10,000 limit that has \~1500 left on it @ 0% interest for the next 11 months.  I will be paying this off each month to ensure it is payed off before the interest free period is up.
* Student debt: We both have student debt ($40,000 for me and $15,000 for her) through our government program which has interest rates below 2% (I imagine for inflation).  The repayments in this are taken out as tax, and the amount increases based on income.  In my current tax bracket it's around 4% of my income, which is not included in the above income figures, as it was already taken out as tax.  I am unsure what to do with this as it will be automatically paid off through tax eventually and does not have high interest rates.  Should I throw extra money at this? or just pay it off as tax through the government program?

Assets:

* We both own our cars outright.  I have a 2013 Toyota Yaris Hatchback, she has a 2014 Kia Rio Hatchback.  Both have low maintenance costs and reasonable fuel efficiency.
* No other notable assets apart from furniture and household items/jewellery and technology.

Savings:

* Currently I have $24,000 just sitting in a very basic savings account with a fairly low interest rate (I think it's like 1% or less or something)  I want to do something better with this, but it is the start of our house deposit, and in the past has been used partially as our emergency fund, so I don't want it too tied up.

Retirement:

* Our government system requires employers to put around 10% of income in a retirement account on top of regular salary.  With this, we have around $10,000 each saved towards retirement which is contributed to at \~10% each time we receive a pay check.  This does not take away from the above income figures at all.

House prices:

* With what we are looking for in a house, it will probably cost somewhere around $400,000 to get what we want in an area we want.  If we purchase a new home we are also entitled to a $15,000 grant from the government to help out with the deposit, which is an option we are currently exploring too (New vs. not new houses) We aren't too concerned about being tied to one place as our family all live in the same city we are in now and we are quite content living here for the foreseeable future.

&amp;#x200B;

I checked my credit score today for the first time and it's 746 which I'm told is good but to be honest I'm really new to a lot of this so I don't really know what it means.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just now thinking more about the future and what I want for my family and as I'm very new to the world of personal finance I'm hoping for a bit of direction and advice for our future plans.  What are the next steps for us? What do we need to do to put ourselves in a position to comfortably purchase a house? We have discussed a tentative date for the ideal world where we would purchase a house within 12 months from now if possible but I don't really know how realistic this is.

&amp;#x200B;

Other than work sponsored options, haven't taken a lot of opportunity. Arrival of 2nd child really got me focused. Background...single income household, been at my company a long time, extremely stable and valued member of management. I'm due a yearly bonus of about 20k (post tax). We have CC debt, SL Debt, Boat and Car Loans (high ltv ratio), and a Mortgage (yes, I know...too much and not the most responsible). I contribute to 401k but not up to full match (fixing this year)

Our plan is take care of CC debt using what we have in savings at the moment, throw about $15k in emergency savings, and start snowballing away.

A few questions...

1. Planning to keep some $1K available for immediate transactions in event of emergency. The rest planning to diversify between HYSA and mix between some mutual funds, ETF's, etc... in order to get some solid growth on funds that otherwise would be sitting in my current savings with an awful yield (0.15%). Are there major downfalls to this plan other than pulling out money if needed would shrink my opportunity (lost interest) and possibly immediate availability? As mentioned, my job/company are both very stable and I'm always fielding recruitment opportunities.
2. Snowballing Debt - Planning to use the Dave Ramsey method as indicated which will take care of CC debt in one fell swoop. Next would be student loans but, they mature in about 4 years, have an extremely low interest (3.25%) and a majority of my relatively low monthly payment is going to principle. The question is whether I'm better off snowballing the auto and Boat loans first because of the high LTV ratio and higher interest rate compared to student loans. If we go hard at it, between monthly and yearly bonuses...we can likely have all three paid off in next 2 years. Seems like letting SL loan continue to ride isn't a bad option.

personalfinance,Upside down on our car,"And trying to get out of a payment. Long story short, I needed a reliable car 2 years ago for my out of town clinical rotations and my '01 Audi with 200K+ miles wasn't going to cut it. I now have a '13 Chrysler 300 and my husband's friend who owns a dealership sold it to is for the price he bought it at (around $17K) plus fees, etc. so the total loan was just under $20K.

Well, we're upside down, owe a little over $15K and have a baby on the way any day now. If we can get another reliable car and not have a payment, the extra $300/ month in our pockets will be a blessing. We are about $4-$4500 upside down.

Another car that my husband's friend may want to trade/ sell us is an '05 Audi S4 wagon and apparently has drive train issues but is worth between $4-8K (or so my husband says because ""it has nice wheels). My husband is a mechanic and owns an auto shop and will inspect it before we make any changes.

So, we may try to go through the friend's dealership, have him take in the Audi and Chrylser, work a deal so we get the Audi, and my husband may have to give up his '76 Chevy to ""break even"". I just don't want my husband to give his truck up for a 14 year old vehicle when the Chrysler is only 6 years old and less than 90K miles. My husband sees it as getting out of a payment and having a paid off car but we'll be out 2 vehicles for 1 paid off one. His truck is worth at least $8K but as hubby says ""it's only worth what someone will pay"".

personalfinance,Complete finances - Advice on Credit Card Debt,"Edited : working on formatting, sorry. New to it

My husband and I currently owe about $3000 in credit card debt. About 75% of this was unfortunately brought on by the birth of our first born. I’m considering getting a personal loan to consolidate and bring down the interest but wanted some advice. Is it a good idea? From what I see, a personal loan would be good because:          
*1. It brings down utilization.       
 *2. Payment is in one.           
*3. Interest is much lower. Around 8% at a credit union rather than the 18% on the credit cards.       
          

However, pulling a loan would be a hard inquiry. We hope to buy a house in 2 to 3 years. 3 years is more likely, but who knows, 🤷🏼‍♀️ we may be more fortunate to get it in 2 years.      We are definitely trying to figure everything out with our credit to reach this goal with a good rate. 

 Our monthly income is currently $2400. This could be higher since husband is getting overtime. *(We realize current income is by no means enough for a house. I’m expecting income to be much higher in acouple years as my husband works up in the IT field. He’s already being suggested for advancement. We’re trying to plan ahead so timing could be right if it’s possible )*          
            
         
Here is our monthly financial expenses:          
    
+rent = $300 currently. It’ll be around $200 in April. We’re living with parents while getting caught up on debt.     
+car insurance = $99.      
+gas = around $100 most months, give or take $20.         
+formula = $140            
+other random baby necessities = I’d give around $50 (wipes, medicine, anything the baby ends up needing)          
+car payment = $244.       
+food and other necessities = $160            
+Mattress payment = $21. We’ve got financing through mattress firm for 0% interest for 70 months. We’ll likely pay that off within 3 years after everything is good.          
+cell phone bill = $30.     
+we always may the minimums on our credit card debt. However, right now I have our autopay set to: $250 for discover. $100 for capital one high balance. And $30 for capital one lower balance.             
*Sallie Mae student loan minimum is $220 but we pay whatever we can on top of that. Often close to a grand or a little over a month. We usually pay at *LEAST* $600. 
    

Our current debt tackling timeline has been: private student loan, credit cards, car loan, bed, and federal student loans. We’re tackling our fed loans last since their flexible and low rate, around 5%. We got them on forbearance for a year. The payment is set around $200.        
        
            
 Our current debt =.  
*Discover card = $1900 at 18% interest    
*Capital One card = $970 at 22% interest       
*Capital One Card = $340 at 24% interest.       
*Sallie Mae Student Loan = $7,490 at 10.125% interest.         
*Sallie Mae Student Loan = $4,395 at 10.625% for a total of $11,887.           
*Car loan for our Toyota Camry, $10,700 at 7% interest. We hope to refinance it this spring.       
*We owe $160 for a medical bill that we didn’t know about. It hit my husbands credit report. We’re hoping to get it as pay and delete but still unfamiliar with the situation.         

        
Since July, the private student loan has been our main focus. We went from 18k to what it is now, with hopes to put our tax refund towards it some more to make a decent dent. We’ve focused on the private loan because:        
+1. It’s a private loan and Sallie Mae is a leech lol.    
+2. It can’t be gotten rid of with bankruptcy. Not saying we’d file bankruptcy, but it’s for a peace of mind.    
+3. It was co-signed by my husbands mom and we’d like it all gone.     
+4. The interest is high and it’s variable. We want it gone to avoid it being any higher.         




With all this in mind, we’d like to keep our focus on the student loan but we really want to tackle the credit card debt. I’m wondering if we should seriously consider getting a personal loan through our credit union to pay off our credit cards to ease payments and reduce overall cost of the debt. I’ve also heard of people suggesting opening an additional card to get 0% interest for 1 year. However, I’m wondering how:         
+that weighs with transfer fees and what not, and                
+how it would work with 2 cards in my name and the other in my husbands.            
+Also, that would likely increase utilization which could hurt credit score I imagine.           
++This could get in the way of our hopes to refinance our car loan.            
++And this could increase the interest of the private student loan.

personalfinance,"Struggling with taxes, IRA, and Student Loan Income Based Repayment Program","My wife and I married in 2018. She makes about $37,000, and I make about $84,000. She has no student loans, and I have about $133,000 (law school). When we married she had $5,000 in a Roth IRA that she hadn't been putting any money into for years. Shortly after we combined finances, we decided that we would max out her contributions for 2018 and start putting in $300/mo into her Roth IRA (we have other retirement accounts too, but for the purposes of this question only the Roth is important).

I work for a state government, am about 7 years in, and am planning on taking advantage of public service loan forgiveness on my loans (they're all federal loans and I've been submitting employment verification forms every year). I'm on the Income Based Repayment plan. In doing our taxes this year, it looks like while we get a bigger refund if we file jointly, I'll pay more in my student loan payments by about $300 every month. But, since the IBR payments only take into account the debt holder's income if you file as married filing separately, our refund drops $1,000, but I'll save about $3,600 over the year in loan payments for a total net benefit of about $2,600.

So, no-brainer, file as married filing separately, right? But how does this impact the Roth? I've read online that in order to contribute to a Roth when you are married filing separately, you have to have a MAGI of less than $10,000. Obviously, my wife doesn't fall into that category. Can we re-characterize the Roth contributions as traditional IRA contributions and avoid penalty (google seems to think so)? Can we just take the money out? Her IRA administrator is Vanguard if that matters.

Is this complicated enough that we should hire a professional? If so, would hiring a professional be cost-effective?

personalfinance,"I am in a unique situation where I am paycheck to paycheck, but my salary is $160k/year, and my company is going public soon.","Hi /r/personalfinance.

I need some advice about what to do with my money short-term/long-term.

I make $160,000 in a big city (think LA/SFO/SEA/NYC). I am in my twenties. I support someone else, and my rent+household costs are &gt;4k to be close to work and the airport. Moving anywhere else is more expensive or worse off. I don't come from a rich family, so I've had to fund myself. I went to a public school where tuition was less than $8,000 per year. I graduated with $24,000 in debt from loans. I've taken advantage of all employer's matching and 401k offerings.

1. Maxed out 401k every paycheck ($19,000 for 2019). My employer matches 100% up to 6%.

2. Max out FSA up $500. Maxed out HSA $3,500. My employer matches 100%.

3. I can't contribute to a Roth IRA, because I make too much.

4. No car, no car insurance. It's cheaper to rent/uber/lyft. Company pays for all meals. Lots of other benefits.

5. I have vested equity/options in my company that could be worth somewhere between $700,000-$900,000 the first day. I joined about 5 years ago. I think the company has a bright future, virtually no competitors, so maybe selling shares too early if there is a lock-up would be devastating in the long run? If the company grows 4x its valuation, rough math means the equity could be worth $3.5-4 million dollars.

6. I buy short-term treasuries with the rest of my leftover cash after payday to earn interest. My bank's savings account interest rate is worse than what the government offers.

7. No company will buy me out when I tell them my equity situation. One company offered to pay everything in 100% cash salary, but won't adjust for future valuation of my current company.

So the problem is I am pretty much living paycheck to paycheck. I have enough to pay for groceries, gym membership, and 1 treat myself day a month. That's usually a bottle of wine and a movie. I feel like I'm doing everything right, but I am not enjoying myself. I want to spend more, but it feels irresponsible and putting the cart before the horse. 

If I sell the shares or the company goes public, I don't have the money for the tax bill, I think. If I get injured or my partner gets injured, I might have to take on a lot of expensive debt, which I can't afford.

Am I going in the right direction?,"First I just want to say that I am looking for advice/tips/discussion regarding the financial steps I've taken, not necessarily about homebuying (although feel free to leave whatever advice you like).

So my husband (29M) and myself (26F) have finally gotten to a spot where we can start saving for our first home. We started saving in June 2017  and currently have a hair over $5k saved. We are fortunate enough to be able to contribute even more to savings this year and we have estimated that by the end of 2019, we will have about $12.5k before any interest we accrue (and barring any emergencies, but more on that later). Currently we are at 2.2%. Edit: we plan to take an FHA loan and put down 3.5%, our budget is around $200k. We intend to buy a home in 2020.

We also recently decided, after much deliberation, to take a debt consolidation loan for our credit cards, which thanks to previous poor decisions were near max for some of them (it's worth noting that we haven't touched any of the cards after we started saving last June, only paid on them). The interest rate for that is quite a fair amount lower than the lowest APR was on any of our cards. We have also planned to pay nearly double the minimum payment, which is easily doable for us, and estimate that we will have it paid off in 3 years. 

Now we realize that a lot of people get right back into trouble after debt consolidation, but we haven't touched our cards in more than 6 months, and even locked them away in a safe. Should anything extremely urgent come up we could use those, but other than that they are now paid off. We intend to purchase a small item on each one (there are 4) on a monthly basis that we would normally have budgeted for anyway (like laundry detergent, dish soap, cat litter, etc.) and then pay them off so that we don't let any of them close, which could affect our credit scores. 

Thanks to the debt consolidation loan, our credit scores are quite good and our debt-to-income ratio is 20%. 

What other steps should we take? Are we in a good spot? Are we doing anything glaringly wrong? Any tips, advice, thoughts, concerns?",finance
investing,Questions about Corporate Bonds,"Been doing a lot of reading but still have a few questions.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Whenever I read about bonds there's always a doom/gloom warning about rising interest rates. But I also read (and suspected, link below) that this is utterly irrelevant if you hold the bond to maturity.

h[ttps://www.quora.com/Do-bond-prices-matter-if-you-hold-them-to-maturity](https://www.quora.com/Do-bond-prices-matter-if-you-hold-them-to-maturity)

For people like me (more of a buy-and-hold than a daytrader), seems like if I were to buy a corporate bond and hold to maturity - it's a reasonable investment.  (bond fund question coming below).

&amp;#x200B;

2)

[http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/BondCenter/BondDetail.jsp?ticker=C642059&amp;symbol=DTEGF4307780](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/BondCenter/BondDetail.jsp?ticker=C642059&amp;symbol=DTEGF4307780)

Am I reading this right - here is a high-yield bond with an original coupon of 6.5% selling now for about $105. Because I'd have to pay above the (assumed) original offer price of $100 per bond, my effective rate (also listed on the page in the link) is 5.096%.  For every $100 I put in, I will get $5.09 per year until 2026.  Starting in 2021 T-mobile could call the bond only paying me $100 for every $105 I put in.

Am I reading that correctly?

&amp;#x200B;

3) Also all the bonds on Finra seem to be listed as originally offering at $100 - somehow I expected $1000 per bond.  Is $100 or $1000 common denominations for bonds?

&amp;#x200B;

4) The T-mobile bond I linked above is ""high-yield"" aka ""junk"". Now I can do lots of research into T-mobile's debt and projections, but I'm assuming smarter people than me already did that and gave it the rating it has. In other words, the bond rating is short-hand for that research - correct?

&amp;#x200B;

5)  If I buy a Bond fund - I no longer get the ""hold to maturity"" protection against interest rates because I don't have control over when the fund manager decides to buy or sell or hold-to-maturity. This makes actual bonds more interesting to me in that if I definitely plan to hold to maturity - I definitely get the interest and my principal back.  A bond fund feels like a  play against interest rates and a hedge (in certain types of markets) against stocks. It seems very unlike an investment of a hold-to-maturity bond purchase. Correct?

&amp;#x200B;

6) Risk - I totally get inflation risk but I could argue that it's not dissimilar from owning a stock. Hold-to-maturity Bond purchases will not chase inflation where stocks will tend to, but it doesn't seem instantaneous in the latter case.

The other risk I hear is ""and you're screwed if the company defaults - never buy high-yield unless you know what you're doing"".  Again I'm concerned this is an  overblown concern. I say that because **in case of any default, bond holders get paid before shareholders**. I never hear anyone say ""Be careful buying that stock because the company might go bankrupt!"".  Maybe with penny stocks but my example above is T-mobile. Is there some extra concern buying a T-mobile high-yield bond over just buying T-mobile stock?  Seems like the default risk is small in any case but actually higher for the stock than the bond !

personalfinance,Repayment of Bonus,"Hello all,

I'm about to file my taxes but I have a bit of an issue. I started working for the federal government in 2016, and part of my sign on bonus was $5,000 per year paid directly to my student loans (Nelnet). The stipulation is that I had to work there for a minimum of 3 years, lest I have to repay the amount in full. I worked for 2 years but I got a really good offer from my current job so I left in April of 2018. I had to pay the $10,000 back in full which I did as soon as I got the letter in May. I'm curious if there's a way to claim this on my taxes as I had to pay taxes on the bonus when I got it, but then I had to repay it all. Any information or guidance would be very helpful for me.",finance

As reads on tin; I was terminated from my workplace last month, on December 11, 2018. My Account for my 401k was closed out and cashed out on January 16, 2019, with a Federal Tax of 20% removed. Are there still other taxes to be paid on it, and if so, will these taxes be on my 2018 Tax Filing this year, or will they be considered as part of my 2019 income, and charged against my 2019 taxes, next year?  


Any assistance in this matter would be appreciated, as I do not wish to accidentally over or underpay.

personalfinance,Is there some way to replace my federal sick leave with an insurance policy when moving to the private sector?,"In about a month I will be leaving my federal job after 13 years for a job in the private sector.  In general, I am getting well compensated for the move.  However, I will be leaving with 3 months of unused sick leave, which by law I will not be paid for.  The only way I could ever get it back would be to rejoin federal service, where it would be credited.  

This amount of sick leave is in theory worth \~$40k-50k.  I was only ever supposed to use it in case of extended sickness.  Many people at my job cheated the system by using sick leave when they weren't really sick (to get out of work for a few hours), I was one of the honest ones and didn't do this.

personalfinance,I Feel Like My Taxes Are Broken,"So, first time posting here, and also not sure how receptive people are of tax talk, but I digress. I'm dealing with two W2s and a decent amount of deductions but I'm being stumped by my tax bill.

I have one primary occupation that shows as follows on my W2: $66k of wages, tips, and other compensation, with $72k of social security income, with a total of $13k($8k federal income) withheld. This yields a return of a couple hundred dollars, so it seems withholdings were spot on. 

As soon as I add a second W2 for my side job that's just over $15k income with tax withholdings of $1500, my tax bill jumps up to $4k, which implies a nearly 40% tax bill on that $15k jump.

With over $16k in deductions (I bought a house and three cars throughout the year and made charitable donations) my bill is still $2k. Is there some simple error I could be making that's causing this, or is my innocence being taken by the dirty hands of lady liberty?",finance

I have paid off all credit card debt since last year, and I'm ready to take this head on and get debt free. Should I seek credit counseling, or am I starting off right checking online for a loan to consolidate these?

The loan has a $50 initiation fee and an interest rate of 6.5%. Employer contributions would continue regardless of the loan. My plan would be to pay off the majority of the loan off with my tax return in order to minimize the impact of the loss from paying back the loan with post tax repayments. 

Am I missing something? It seems like I could do this every year to maximize the IRA contribution and only be out the 50 dollar initiation fee for the loan.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

Savings: \~$6500 combined (I have like \~$2800, she has nearly $4000)

She saves about the same

I have a car payment of $263/month with an interest rate of almost 5%. I am currently paying at least $100 extra each month. I owe just over $5k on it.

* Focus on getting the car paid off (pause saving and resume once finished)
* Continue on the same path
* Other?

* My budget is based on 2 paychecks but I have 26 pay period a year.
   * With my schedule I should get a ""3rd check"" in May
      * I think this may already be spent though, need new tires and 6 months car ins
* We are also planning on saving an additional $5k for an elopement/honeymoon Summer 2020

personalfinance,Need Budget/Investment Help!,"I just turned 25 and bought my first used car - very excited. However, it destroyed my savings (I still have $1,500 cash) but I really want to save a significant amount before I move out. Yes, I still live at home because it makes the most sense for me to save money and I am waiting for my girlfriend to finish nursing school next year so that we can move in together (she also lives at home). 

I have been recording every single purchase I made in an excel sheet since sometime in 2017 to collect data on my spending habits. I did this knowing I would eventually make a budget, but didn't limit myself to see my ""worst"" spending habits. And boy did I...Since it's the start of a new year (and the big purchase) I figure now is the right time. 

I make ~$2,000 a month after taxes and after my 401k contribution. I contribute 22% of my salary to my 401k with a 3% company match so essentially a quarter of my paycheck. I know this is high but I read everywhere that you should put in as much as you can, especially when I am living at home where I don't pay rent, utilities, or food. I am debating if I could bring this down to 12% of my paycheck and still get the company match for a total of 15%.

Here are my AVERAGE monthly expenses from 2018 plus the new car expenses:

Expense | Amount
---------|----------
Car Payment | $200
Car Insurance | $90
Roth IRA Contribution | $500
Student Loan Payment^(1) | $300
Gas^(2) | $80
Restaurants | $300
Bar/Alcohol | $200
1. I only need to pay about $90 on student loans a month, but I am trying to pay them off quickly. My highest interest rate is 4%, which is what I am targeting.
2. This was the gas I was putting in for my 20 year old car so I am hoping my newer one, which is much more fuel efficient will reduce this cost.

Before anyone starts laying in on me for the restaurants/bar expenses...I KNOW. Honestly, I couldn't believe I spent that much and hate myself for it. Again, I had no limits on myself to see how bad it would be. I will of course dramatically decrease these numbers, but I wanted to put my most expensive things out there. I do want to note that these numbers include friend-group dinners that I will pay for the credit card points and then they will Venmo me. I consider Venmo spent-money that I can use at later dates when I owe friends money. It basically saves me from inputting another record in my excel sheet.

personalfinance,"Condo eating 700$ per month, can't sell, future projections are bad. Please help/advice.","Hi everyone,

I have a condo.

Mortgage = ($1425)/month (2.54%, fixed rate) (around $700 interest)

condo fees = ($465)/month

property taxes = ($130)/month

rent = $1350/month

overall = ($670)/month = ($8040)/year.

&amp;#x200B;

Mortgage = $300.000

price to sell = $260.000

payment to broker (to sell) = $10.000

penalty for selling early = $3.000 (before 2021)

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion - can't sell, losing 8300$/year on nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Future perspectives:

rate is increasing: bought at .75, now it's 1.75, three more increases are being considered, When I'll renew my mortgage in 2021 the rate will be around 2.5%, which means higher mortgage interest rate (2.5% -&gt; 5%), higher payments (up to $400/m). The rent price is not being planned to increase since the general economy in the region has a tendency of stability. Thus, in 2021 my anual losses will be aroun $13.000/m

&amp;#x200B;

My plan.

Strategy 1. Keep the condo, make more money, sell the condo in 2021. Selling now means $50.000 loss to save $16.000 over 2 years. On the other hand, I'm using these money for investments I'm managing to cover the losses, even with a small plus.

&amp;#x200B;

Strategy 2. There's an expectancy that 2019/2020 - will be the period of recession. Condo and rent prices might go down which will increase the losses more than expected now. Thus - better spend 50.000 now, close the loss, get back on positive balance sheet and recover in the next 3-4 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone, please help me with some suggestions how could this problem be solved ?

&amp;#x200B;

My friend told me to write here and maybe some better strategies could be found.

Thanks in advance !

&amp;#x200B;

=============

UPDATE 1.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks a lot for all your comments and help and involvement !!

After your suggestions, I'm considering:

\- keeping the condo and selling in 2021. I will lose money anyway, but selling in 2021 has the least loss. Plus, if comments are correct, during a recesion rent goes up. Plus, if recession occurs, is strong and price goes down more - I'll have some more money (made with these 50K) to cover the losses.

\- renegotiating interest rate with the lender before 2021.

\- shortselling (capital loss can be carried forward as a capital gains loss and can offset any other capital gains, further reducing tax liability \[[adoodle83](https://www.reddit.com/user/adoodle83)\])

&amp;#x200B;

The decision to buy this condo wasn't only mine. I asked around. But we are biased. Bying the condo was a mistake, a serious miscalculation, I was played very well. Thanks to Daniel Kahneman's and Robert Chaldini's books - I now understand better the biases and the persuasion methods and I found the methods that were used on me. Most important lesson from this - always talk to other people who would be less-biased and non-involved.

&amp;#x200B;

THANKS !

&amp;#x200B;

============

UPDATE 2.

After a discussion with [pdoherty972](https://www.reddit.com/user/pdoherty972) an intriguing idea has come up:

&amp;#x200B;

after the condo is paid (in 25 years), the final price will be 320K + interest 4%/year average, by 25 years = additional 320K. So the real price for this property is 640K. Additional repairing + special assessments + unpredicted things - have to be considered, let's put 1000$/y = 25.000$, final value = 665.000$.

Rent now is 1350/m, 16.200/year, this is 2.5%/year from condo's real value. Over 25 years (mortgage duration), the rent will pay around 62.5% from condo's value.

In a best case scenario, rent increases by 1%/year, that's additional +13$/month. Condo fees also increase hopefully not more than 2%/year (-9$). the difference of 4$ gives additional 1200$ over 25 years. Meaning - nothing significant that would compound the mortgage+condo fees +property taxes losses.

Finally, over 25 years I will have a property that costs 665.000$ this property was paid by the tenant with 416.000$, thus 250.000$ will be paied by me alone.

Probably, this would mean that property's real cost is 250.000$. If considering a rent of average 1400$/month, this would mean a return of 6.7% per year.

 A 6-7% return would be in line with today's return from low-risk state bonds and it really seems that real estate investment is worth a risk. There are probably some errors in these numbers though. Additional analysis would be needed.",finance

I'm a little lost about some aspects of filling this out though.  So, my questions are as follow:

* Are there exemptions for being taxed on the interest of my savings bonds when paying federal student loans?
   * When I originally filed, I noted how much interest I had paid on student loans that year.
* I've gotten married since I filed for the 2017 tax year--does this affect my exemptions when filing this 1040X?
   * It reads ""Complete this part only if any information relating to exemptions has changed from what you reported on the return you are amending. This would include a change in the number of exemptions, either personal exemptions or dependents.""

Making $58k per year in a low COL midwest city.

Take home: $3200 a month

Rent: $400 (brother rents a room)

Mortgage ($95k @ 4.25% owed): $850 a month

Student loans ($67k\* federal owed @ 6.3% average): $281 a month

Car loan ($20k @1.8% owed): $300 a month

Utilities and other unavoidable expenses: $600

Savings: $20k increasing at about $5k per year, though I don't do an exact budget of anything just seems to be the trend

Retirement: $7k is contributed by my employer with no contribution by myself (TIAA CREF).

Here's the rub: I bought a house a few years ago for $118k that is now worth $175k. I owe $95k as I said above. Long story short, it's an older house and I've been having issues with some shoddy construction and plumbing (I suspect the house was flipped) and I'm very very tired of the stress of home ownership. I'm not cut out for it. I hate mowing the lawn, snowblowing, the upkeep and repairs, painting etc. The retaining walls are crumbling all over and those need to be replaced, the garage is too small for my car. I'm over it all.

So my questions are these: Am I fool to sell such a cheap living arrangement despite me not liking it? If I do sell and lets say after the realtor fees I end up with $65k, should I pay off the car or the student loans? Should I rent for a bit (this is what I'm leaning towards) since real estate, including condos (not buying another house) is so overpriced ATM?

I want to simplify my life--80% of the stuff in this house is going to be sold/given away. I want my living condition to be effortless. I'm also cognizant that a recession is probably coming and I might massively regret this. I also think this is a good time to cash out on the equity I have before another bubble pops. Rent on the apartments I'm looking at are $1700, brother would be paying at least $600. I'm 29 and I have no kids nor will I ever. I have no credit card debt or debt other than listed above.

Any thoughts, pros and cons would be great. Thanks!

personalfinance,How to approach shared loans after a breakup? Please advise,"How to approach shared loans after a breakup?

New poster to reddit so be gentle! My question pretty much stated in the title, but story is:

My ex and I have shared loans that we refinanced together through a bank when we were engaged.  Our set up has pretty much been I pay my monthly portion (~30% of total loans) and he pays his (the rest of it) into the joint account.  To clarify, these are student loans.

Given that he has more loans and with this break up being the last go, are there any other choices I have? I spoke with the banker during the first break up and she said the only way we could do this is if i offer to pay a large sum upfront to him and he is agreeable to refinance under his name alone. The first time I brought this up, he was not amenable because interest rates were higher and he was “a good guy so he would still never do anything that would hurt/jeopardize me in this way”. I am now in a position where I can pay the entire portion of my loans (if I dig deep into savings and emergency fund), but interest rates are still slightly higher than what we signed for. I am moving out from our place which is currently under market value for rent, and will be paying about 3x more and taking primary care of our puppy.  So I am trying to get my finances in order to take this hit.

I haven’t brought it up to him again yet as the break up was recent. Although I do plan on asking him again as we get our logistics in order, I want to plan ahead and see if there was anything else I can do? What if he isn’t agreeable? He isn’t a bad man in that I think anything would happen, but I do not want to be financially liable for his larger portions of the loans should anything happen esp since we are no longer together.

Thank you all in advance!

I know SWVXX offers an interest rate comparable to a savings account, and I also know it isn't FDIC insured. 

My question is, with a savings account, I can transfer it back and forth between my checking and not incur and taxes on the original amount. However, if I buy money market account shares, and I suddenly need to access that money, will I be taxed if I sell those shares and move that amount to my checking? Even if it's the original amount I put in? Doesn't that give an advantage to holding my funds in a savings account assuming I might need access to it at any given time?

It says:

&gt; Unfortunately, you don't qualify for the Retirement Savings Credit for the following reason(s):
The Retirement Savings Credit isn't a refundable credit. So if your tax is already zero, then the credit is zero. The total tax due on your federal return minus any other credits such as the Child Care Credit must be more than zero for you to be eligible for the Retirement Savings Credit.

I *do* owe money on this return, about $5,500. (Pay is 1099 so I don't have automatic withholding.)

The only other credit I've taken is the lifetime learning credit, which only came out to $623, so I clearly still owe a lot.

Any ideas?

The only other thing I see is on the ""credit limit worksheet,"" it has $623 on line 1 and line 2. It then says on line 3 to subtract line 2 from line 1, and you're ineligible to take the credit if that comes out to $0, which it does. I can't find anything that shows how line 1 is calculated.",finance

personalfinance,"[Debt] Looking for different ways to pay for college as a returning adult, any suggestions?","tl;dr:  what’s the best way to pay for 8-week college courses that my employer reimburses me for?

I already have an associates, and now want to complete my bachelor's. After a long and way-too-analytical search, I finally gave up on picking ""the perfect school"" and went with a school that has a tuition deferment agreement with my company. so my company sends the check directly to my school after I complete each class.

After having taken two classes (I'm taking one eight-week class at a time,) I'm looking at the rest of the degree program, and God does it look hideously boring.  So I'm contemplating searching for another school that has a degree program I'd enjoy. So there goes the deferred tuition payment agreement.  But I'm a established adult with a credit score of over 800, so I'm not too stressed about losing the deferred tuition.

My question is, what are the most financially sound ways to pay for each class until I receive a reimbursement check from my company?  I considered getting a cash-back credit card to use for school only (tuition + expenses.) I figured this wouldn't be a bad option because each class is just 8 weeks long.  So depending on the interest rate to cash back ratio, it might not be too bad.  If  anyone thinks this is a good option and can recommend a card for this, I'd appreciate it.

Then there's the part of me that says ""Credit card, what are you, crazy?""  So Perhaps a loan would be better. But I have a daughter that's starting college, and goodness, that whole loan thing looks like a nightmare. You're basically signing your life away. She and I recently had a conversation that left me wondering if we still had usury laws in the US.

Lastly, I considered taking out a home equity line of credit on my home.  I figured this was the best option since I can write the checks at my leisure, and pay back each class as I receive my reimbursement check from my company.

My last question is, what are your thoughts on Sallie Mae and government loans? Are they as bad as they seem? Should I avoid them as best as I can, or do they have a value that other methods don't have? (I just saw the PF student loan section on the right, I’m checking that out next.)

The Perkins loan debt seems to have been sold to Reliant Capital Solutions, and they have recently started contacting me (constantly).

I don’t believe that.

Are there any downsides to having my parents as a guarantor? I understand the risks but considering my wife and I have stable jobs and reasonable incomes I don't really see an issue.

For anyone with the time and energy wiling to chime in, I'm looking for some tough-love and constructive criticism on how I can begin to get my finances in order, no need to be gentle here.  I come from a very blue-collar family that's never had much income, I have nobody close I can ask for help in this regard.  I'm very grateful for all the support they've given me thus far, but they are unable to help me in this arena.  This is a unanimous account because I have people close to me following my other account, I'd prefer them to not know my finances.  Let me preface all my financial stats below by saying I am sure I'm doing some things wrong, or could have been done better, where I am now is based on figuring everything out on my own as I went along over the last 3.5 years since college graduation.

* General
   * 27 y/o single male, no significant other, no kids
   * Career - highly specialized medical provider, no fear for job security
   * Living in NYC renting a 1BR apartment
   * Credit Score 750
   * $0 Credit Card Debt
* Income
   * Job 1 - Full Time (4 days/week) - $130k annual salary (close to approaching glass ceiling for annual salary)
   * Job 2 - Per Diem - $600/Shift - Averaging 6 shifts per month
   * **Total Income $10k/Month take home**
* Expenses
   * Rent - $2450 - I realize this is astronomical and I'm pissing money away, but it's a non-negotiable cost
   * Student Loans - **Total Balance $120k**
      * 20k Wells Fargo @ 11.5%
      * 14k Sallie Mae @ 10.5%
      * Fed Loan 11k @ 4.5%
      * Parent Plus 109k @ 5.0%
   * Expenses continued below, the following table describes my plan to pay off student loans...

**I am expecting to be approved within the next 10 days for a consolidation/refinancing loan for 120k x 10 years @ 3.55%** \- The following table shows what my minimum payment would be, if I added additional payments, and how it effects total interest payed out, and pay off date. These calculations were used w/ loan calculators on bankrate.com

|**Monthly Payment**|Interest Over Life of Loan|Total Payed Out|Pay Off Date|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$1200 (min)|23K|143k|Jan 2029|
|(+$800)|12k|132k|Aug 2024|
|(+$1300)|10k|130K|June 2023|

(A $2000 / month payment seems to be the sweet spot were I get a major decrease in total interest paid and sooner pay off date, doesn't seem wort it to kill myself to pay $2500/month for 2k saved on the life of the loan)

* ...Expenses Continued
   * Dog - $1000 Month (I realize this is another astronomical cost, but again is non-negotiable)
   * Groceries - $400
   * Laundry $50
   * Gym $100
   * Clothes $100
   * **Total Expenses $7000** (I added an additional 1k of expenses for hidden costs/things I'm sure I forgot)
      * Around 2k in the black monthly
* Current Assets
   * $18k in a single checking account
   * $1300 in 401k
* Current Retirement Savings Plan
   * Company 401k
      * 50% match up to 8%, fully vested after 2 years
      * Currently contributing 6% into the ""Retire by 50 years old"" bracket - I did not make any specific selections
      * Current balance $1300

&amp;#x200B;

My questions and where I could benefit from everyone's advice

* Based on the above, what kind of balance should I be aiming to have in emergency savings, I've set an arbitrary goal of 20k for emergency savings, but unsure if this is enough? 20K would cover me for 3 months.
* Should I prioritize aggressively paying off student loans, or increasing retirement contributions? I know I'm not contributing anywhere near the max amount allowed.
* A known weakness is I'm not good at actively saving, I do better when everything is on auto-pay or auto-deducted, I do the best/save the most when I have minimal access to my own money, or when I have a major financial goal I am trying to save for/achieve.
* I have no idea how to make my money work from me, I know absolutely nothing about stocks, 401k, Roth IRA, these are all household terms I'm familiar with, but don't know what they mean/are.
* Is there anything else I should be asking? I know there are somethings I should know, but don't, Im sure sure are many more things I don't even know that I should know.

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know if I can provide any additional helpful information.

I come from a pretty low income household and have never had any real money before. My parents don't budget and can't handle money well. However, I really want to be smart with this money.

For context, I live in South Africa. (1 USD = R13,83) 

I'm going to receive R100 000 from this scholarship, and am not limited in how I can spend it. My total tuition comes to R37 090, leaving me with R62 910. My textbooks will likely come up to R8 000 (a prudent estimation). I'm now on R54 910. This covers all of my university-related expenses.

I don't have my own car, so I plan to Uber around this year. My mom works at the university, so I can get lifts with her every day. An Uber from my house to uni would be around R35, if I needed one. I budgeted R800 per month for transport costs, hoping I'll need less each month. Currently, I get lifts everywhere with either my boyfriend or mom.

A *very* prudent estimation of pocket/spending money is R1 000 per month. I currently spend about R300 per month, some months less, others a bit more.

This puts us at R33 310 left.
I want to deposit R25 000 into a savings account for 13 months at an effective interest rate of 8,41%. This is the best deal I could find.

This would leave me with R8 310 in my current account. I need a new monitor, bookshelf and desk chair, which I budgeted R4 700 for altogether. This leaves me with R3 610 in my account that I don't have any plans for - to be used in emergencies where the R1 000 p/m won't cover it.

My estimations are all quite prudent, so I'm hoping to end up with a bit more than the 3.6k at the end of the year. I plan to keep my marks high enough to receive the scholarship again next year, and buy myself a car for around R40 000.

I am currently sitting on $180K cash and am looking into purchasing a home. I made some money through the sale of my previous home and that is where I built this cash capital.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I am staying with my parents and just paying a small amount of cash on rent (they won't accept money from me). My base salary is $80,000 and I also do some freelance consulting work which brings in an additional $15,000 - $20,000 of pre-tax income per year.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, should I purchase a home now as RBC (a large Canadian bank) most recently cut it's interest rates by .15%. Or, I can continue staying with my parents, keep saving and wait for this expected recession which is supposed to be hitting us later in 2019 / 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of possible home buying scenarios I see one of the following:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Purchase a small townhome in the $500 - $600K range without any finished basement or anything, put 20% down (as I no longer qualify for the first-time home buyer's incentives) and invest the remaining $50,000 into stocks or perhaps a second investment property (another condo perhaps).
2. Purchase a detached home in the $775 - $825K range with a finished basement (they rent for roughly $1,100 - $1,300 in my area). This additional rental income should be enough to offset roughly $200,000 in mortgage payments per month.

What I'm curious about is if there's any way I could apply for a HELOC instead, pay off the debt with that, and then somehow just remove my ex's name as a co-borrower. I know I'd still need an appraisal and I'd need to go through a bunch of underwriting with my current lender, but it'd obviously be really nice to keep my current rate and avoid the closing costs associated with a refi. 

Is this a pipe dream, or is this something I could actually accomplish? Thanks very much for any advice.",finance
personalfinance,HELP!! I think I forgot to account for RSU taxes!!,"Hey guys

I had stock vest in 2018 - and I sold them upon vest. I assumed that the broker automatically holds certain stock back to pay taxes so that all the stock that was deposited in my account (and sold immediately on vest) was tax-free.

When I got my W2, I realized that the federal tax withheld box only seemed to have my employment wage amount and not the stock amount (stock amount was very significant) - even though the stock award amount was included in my wage amount (I think). I am now totally freaking out!! 

Can someone tell me if brokers do automatically withhold money to cover taxes on vest? Or not?",finance

personalfinance,I think reddit gives bad advice about cars and car purchases. A case against the 2 year old Honda.,"What’s the most common advice we here: buy a 2-3 year old Honda or Toyota. While I have done this in that past, it’s a very narrow view that is not the best for everyone. 

Let’s say Jim and Karen live in Lansing, Michigan, have 4 young kids, and need third row. They drive 10,000 miles a year, and generally don’t do their own maintenance.

Reddit says get a 2 year old Toyota. The Highlander is to my knowledge the cheapest 3rd row they sell. 2 years 30k your looking at $30,000 for a mid trim package. You’re going to pay a higher interest rate due to buying a used vehicle, and the car is half done with it’s factory warranty.

Or you can buy a brand new Dodge Journey sxt for 15k out the door (don’t look at Msrp, use autotrader) you going to have more warranty, pay less in interest and insurance. In ten years when it has 100k you can catch it on fire, buy a new one and still have less invested then you had invested in a 2 year old Toyota. 

On top of regular depreciation, you have Michigan rust which is brutal and expensive on older cars, the fact that kids are going to destroy the interior, and it’s nice driving a new car and not one that’s 15 years old. 

I’m not saying it’s bad advice buying a 2 year old Japanese car, just we’ve Ecco-chambered it so long as fact that we fail to recognize other options that maybe just as good or better.",finance

* 26 years old and married. 

* Own a townhome in Northern Virginia, a HCOL area. 

* No debt besides mortgage- but paying $2200 a month. 

* About 45K of cash currently sitting in saving accounts (plan to invest soon)

* Currently making $62796 per year as a GS8/8 

* Wife is just now starting work as a personal trainer and projected salary will be determined after next week

After graduating, I worked some part-time state park jobs and decided to apply to the federal government on a whim. I was exceedingly lucky being accepted at my age and skill-set, but now that I am in the system and have begun to financially plan, I am having some major ""grass is greener"" thoughts, especially after my recent discovery of /r/financialindependence. 

Federal employment has always been a dream, as my career does not have a private sector equivalent. Additionally, my contract includes out-of-cycle promotions for the next few years until I hit the GS-11 spot, so I know raises will be coming soon. 

But the pay- damn, does it sting living in Northern Virginia and seeing what the contractors make. My wife and I have been mortgage poor for the last few months, but we decided to take that risk knowing that the raises are coming. But as I look around and see the extra wealth people have, I get frustrated considering that I could be making more *now*, and preparing for retirement even earlier. Additionally, part of me already wants to leave the DC area behind and never look back. 

Is this just youthful naivety? I certainly will not be saving 50% anytime soon, but my thinking is that the pension will off set that. On the other hand, part of me thinks to just work here for 3 or 4 years (3 is the minimum to be competitive when reapplying to fed), and finding a LCOL area where we can live and work.

personalfinance,Need to develop a more targeted game plan.,"A bit about my situation:  

Auto:  paid off, but will probably need to replace in the next 1-2 years.  Max I will spend on a new car would be about 15k over 3-5 years.

Home:  I own a 1 bedroom condo with a fairly cheap mortgage of $690 with a $180 HOA.  

Recurring monthly exspenses:  cell phone $104, electric about $100, auto insurance $60, gym membership $25, gasoline $150, groceries $400, subscriptions $17

Credit Cards:  I have a combined total of about $5500 in cc debt on a 0% apr.  

Student loans:  this is where it hurts: 55k in federal student loans.  I'm on the pay as you earn plan, but I'm in school again so loans are on deferment.  Also I've been working for a University which recently went from for profit to a non profit, so I can qualify for student loan forgiveness with 10 years of employment and payments.

Income:  I make about 48k before taxes.  From my 9-5 and my 1099 side gig combined. 

 Considerations:  My job does come with a pretty decent benefits package.  I pay 0 out of pocket for health insurance with a 1500 yearly deductible, then 90% coverage after that.  I also get education benefits which I am actively using to finish a business degree before moving onto an MBA.  As noted above I can also enroll in the student loan forgiveness program.  

2019 exspenses:  I desperately need to remodel my bathroom as I am concerned it's current condition will or already is resulting in damage.  I've ball parked the costs for that around 4k as I really only have to do the bathtub and shower surround, which I wont go overboard with.  
Additionally I have a trip planned for the fall which should cost around 800-1500.  

My current plan:  I plan to focus on the CC debt first.  In February I'm going to balance transfer all of my cc debt onto a single card with 12 month 0% apr and use that as my timeline to pay it down.  I should be able to run at it fairly hard and make roughly $500 monthly payments to knock it out in 12 months.  For student loans I want to enroll in the forgiveness program and make the minimum required payments regardless of deferment status.  This just leaves the bathroom remodel to contend with and I'm not sure how I will finance it.  

I'm not in a desperate situation, but I'm not where I want to be.  I have a little savings, but enough to live on for more than a month.  I do have a fair amount of credit I can lean on if I need to, but I want to get more cash in the bank and start building some actual net worth.

personalfinance,Typical financially illiterate medical student about to graduate with ~$394K in loans @ 6% interest,"Title says it all.

I accrued about $67K in federal loans while I completed my undergraduate degree. I went straight through to medical school and have accrued the remaining during this time. I recently got my final addition and the total from the past 8 years is $394,003. From what I can tell, they all have different interest rates ranging from 3.4% to 7.3%, but the composite rate is 6% as listed on the federal student loan website.

My main concern comes with the interest that will be accruing during my residency. If the total interest rate is 6%, that comes to about $23,640 per year. My goal would be to keep everything at the principle value, that way I can pay it off as quickly as I can after the 4 years. During residency, I'll be making anywhere from $55K-60K each year before taxes. Is keeping it at the principle even a reasonable goal with what my salary will be? Depending on the area I live, with cost of living, it almost doesn't seem possible. 

Any advice is appreciated.

Long story short I realized I am in a very privileged position and I am not using it to its full potential. Without going into too much detail I have around €300k sitting in my bank in those shitty low interest rate accounts. I have ZERO debt. I spend around €1.3k a month and my monthly income amounts to around €3.7k. My actual job pays me €1k a month but I have e lifetime pension from the government of around €2.7k whether I work or not. So I am left with around €2.4k at the end of the month that I just keep putting in my main account. My plan is to first make an emergency fund for €13k (1 year living expenses) although I'm not sure if this makes sense given I have this government pension. Second, just put those €300k into stocks and bonds, probably a 60/40 portfolio. I guess my question is - should I just keep putting the left over money into stocks and bonds or use this it to fund vacations, maybe a new car in 10 years and keep putting 15% of this left over money into stocks and bonds?

personalfinance,22 Year Old Doing Taxes -HELP!!,"Hi everyone. 

I recently was employed in January of 2018. 
There was about a week where they were “feeling the waters” to see if I was a good fit and then I was hired as an employee. 

Today, I got my W-2 and to my surprise - a 1099. I had no clue what this was so I brought it home to my dad to ask for help. He’s stumped too. 
He said that he thought I would be getting about 600+ on this refund with the way the new laws are set up. 

My Turbotax says I owe around $350 instead of making any money. It also says I’m “Self-Employed” and totally disregards the W-2. My dad says this is because it’s just holding onto the fact that I got a 1099. 

My income was around $18,000
My federal tax income withheld is $781.00. 
My state income tax was $667.58
And Medicare withheld is 268.54

My 1099-MISC says “Non employee compensation” is $1084.13 referring to my “week long trial period”. 

NOW, HERE’S THE QUESTION:
I didn’t sign up to get a 1099. I don’t want it. Why should I be paying $350 dollars for my company to get a tax break off of me? I’m not an independent contractor and didn’t sign anything saying that I wanted to be treated as so (tax wise). So, how do I fix this? TurboTax and H&amp;R Block are both saying I’m owing money. Is there any way I can fix this?? Thank you!",finance

business,China’s Clogged Financial Arteries: What Are the Risks of a Financial Crisis in China?,"On September 15th 2008, the day on which Lehman Brothers collapsed, the global financial system suffered a heart attack that nearly destroyed the global economy. If we analogize the economy to the human body, than the financial system is like the circulatory system pumping capital to where it is needed most. In 2008, Wall Street, the system’s beating heart, failed spectacularly. In recent months, I have seen [scores ](https://warontherocks.com/2018/10/chinas-coming-financial-crisis-and-the-national-security-connection/)of [articles ](https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2163897/could-china-find-itself-centre-next-financial-crisis-because-its-mounting)suggesting that China’s has the same types of clogs and leaks as Wall Street, and could be the epicenter of the next financial crisis. In today’s podcast episode, I am going to explore the Chinese financial system to get a better gauge of its health. I will discuss the massive state owned banks that dominate its financial sector, the rapid rise of the shadow banking industry, and the governments response to the massive buildup of debt in recent years.

To go back to our analogy of to the circulatory system, one can think of the Big 4 Chinese banks as the arteries of the system. Although these state owned giants have lost their monopoly on the financial system, they [still control](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1578249) around 40% of the total assets in the Chinese financial system. The Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Agricultural Bank of China all rank as among the ten [largest companies](https://www.forbes.com/global2000/#4e72f0b4335d) in the world. While the big four banks are massive, they serve do not serve the private sector well as [three quarters](http://www.chinabankingnews.com/2018/11/09/private-sector-accounts-25-chinese-bank-loans-yet-60-economy-cbirc-head/) of their loans are given to other state owned enterprises and suffer from high rates of non-performing loans. All of these problems aside, China’s control of the financial system allowed it to rapidly respond to the collapse of global trade after the financial crisis. In November of 2008 the Chinese government announced a [massive stimulus](https://www.economist.com/asia/2008/11/10/china-seeks-stimulation) program of $586 billion, around 7% of GDP and much more ambitious in scope than the American stimulus. While the stimulus was successful in propping up the Chinese financial system, it had unforeseen consequences for the financial system .

Chinese local governments used stimulus money to borrow massively for the construction of $2.3 trillion worth of roads, highways and other infrastructure. Local governments then packaged this debt into financial products (similar to mortgage backed securities in the United States) to sell to local investors. The Chinese government has long forced banks to keep interest rates [artificially low](https://piie.com/publications/policy-briefs/financial-repression-china), often below the rate of inflation. However, because the Chinese government was eager to revive investment, they allowed these financial products (known as wealth management and trust products) to offer much [higher yields](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-firms-load-up-on-opaque-investment-products-1516532400). Savings rapidly flowed away from traditional state owned banks, forcing them to create their own financial products. Since these financial products offer depositors higher interest rates, the banks must make loans with higher interest rates. As a result, a shadow banking system emerged where banks either made high interest loans to a capital starved private sector or to other financial entities. The shadow banking has grown at a spectacular rate, and now controls [$20 trillion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-greatest-challenge-1508137030) of assets or about 87% of GDP. To shadow banking system acts as the capillaries of the system getting money to individual private sector businesses. However, the capillaries are deeply imperfect as many of the ordinary savers investing in wealth management products are mislead into believing the products are [fully insured](https://fundselectorasia.com/report-chinas-usd435m-wealth-management-scandal-unfolding/) by the state, and financial entities have lent lent money recklessly in the assumption they would be.

It should therefore be hardly surprising that China has seen a worrying build up in debt. Chinese debt as a share of GDP has grown [from around](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/scary-statistic-chinas-debt-gdp-ratio-reached-257-percent-22824) 150% of GDP in 2009 to around 260% of GDP. Both the US and Japan had seen [debt buildup](http://planning.lfsplans.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/US-Recession-vs-Japan.pdf)before their respective financial crisis and lost decade. However, unlike the US and Japan, the government of Xi Jinping has acted aggressively to reduce the risk of a financial crisis. The increased scrutiny on the financial sector has fallen hardest on the shadow banking sector which has seen its share of [total credit](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/06/14/chinas-tighter-regulation-of-shadow-banks-begins-to-bite) decline from 45% in 2014 to under 20%. The crackdown has fallen hardest on the private sector, and it is difficult to tell whether this is because the shadow banking sector was in desperate need of reform or because of a broader ideological [disfavor ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-09-11/china-turns-to-state-companies-to-bolster-economic-growth-again)of the private sector by the current administration. Complicating an already complicated situation is Donald Trump’s trade war, which like the great financial crisis, is hitting export sectors [hard](https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/chinas-manufacturing-pmi-weighs-on-risk-sentiment-early-on-545169). The Xi administration will have to decide if it must end the current financial tightening and return to the stimulus of a decade ago.

To return to the original question, the Chinese financial system is suffering from the equivalent of high blood pressure and cholesterol. The government is changing it’s diet and taking its medicine. While the situation is worrying, a financial crisis is far from inevitable. At the same time, China has a financial sector that struggles to get capital to the private sector, the most dynamic part of of the economy, and suffers from systematic moral hazard. Continued rapid growth will likely require fundamental reform. What is certain is that China’s financial system is so large today that a sneeze, much less a heart attack, will have a profound impact on the global economy.

The crackdown has fallen hardest on the private sector, and it is difficult to tell whether this is because the shadow banking sector was in desperate need of reform or because of a broader ideological [disfavor ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-09-11/china-turns-to-state-companies-to-bolster-economic-growth-again)of the private sector by the current administration. Complicating an already complicated situation is Donald Trump’s trade war, which like the great financial crisis, is hitting export sectors [hard](https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/chinas-manufacturing-pmi-weighs-on-risk-sentiment-early-on-545169). The Xi administration will have to decide if it must end the current financial tightening and return to the stimulus of a decade ago.

To return to the original question, the Chinese financial system is suffering from the equivalent of high blood pressure and cholesterol. The government is changing it’s diet and taking its medicine. While the situation is worrying, a financial crisis is far from inevitable. At the same time, China has a financial sector that struggles to get capital to the private sector, the most dynamic part of of the economy, and suffers from systematic moral hazard. Continued rapid growth will likely require fundamental reform. What is certain is that China’s financial system is so large today that a sneeze, much less a heart attack, will have a profound impact on the global economy.

personalfinance,Should I pay off Student Loan in full now or later?,"Hey peeps,

I have a current balance of $11,400 in my student loans. My interest rate is 3-4%. I have about $20k in the bank so I could pay it off entirely if I wanted to. My question is should I though? I know making on-time payments on a loan is a good way to build credit which is something I want to do as well. For context my credit score is in the 770-790 range as of now. 

Is it financially savvy for me to pay off the loan in one piece in my current position, or should I keep my auto-payment plan running so I could have more funds for other things?

personalfinance,Transferring 401k to Roth IRA question,"I have around 6800 in a 401k from a previous employer and plan to convert it to a Roth IRA with vanguard. I'm reading from a website that I should try to get it transferred directly (from principal) to vanguard, but it looks like principal will 'cut me a check' to send in. I'll lose 20% for tax purposes, and it says I have to deposit the full amount (including the 20%). So I'll get to deposit the 5440, but then come up with the additional 1360 of my own money correct? Will I be able to avoid that if it's sent directly?

When I do this conversion, how much should I withhold for federal taxes? I know nothing on this, but I should withhold enough to avoid penalties. I'm reading 10% is a reasonable amount for low tax brackets (I make 35k a year), should I just go with that?

Edit: also, when I roll this over, this won't affect how much I can contribute in a year right?",finance

What to do?","I have been reading here and on r/FinancialIndependence about the benefits of saving more towards retirement, so I started upping my 401K but it looks like I went to far.

personalfinance,Advice on savings and student loans,"Hey guys,

I was wondering if you all could offer me some advice on repaying my student loans.

As it stands, my OSAP loan is at a little under $25K. I've been saving over the last 4 years with a seasonal job (May-December) where I make under $24,000 per year. I get laid off after December but I am able to get EI and get paid around $650 biweekly. In terms of my loan, I have made sure to put myself under repayment assistance whenever possible. I just applied again after getting laid off and luckily they are allowing me to pay $0 over the next the next 6 months.

I have saved a little over 22k and have put that money in a TFSA. On occasion I've had to take money out of it to help out with the family (such as vet bills or a broken AC). I also have 5K in a chequing account. I have to keep that account above 4K in order to not get charged a fee. 

Including my savings and chequings, I am currently able to pay off my student loans. It would however leave me with around 2K altogether. Since I dont have a job right now I'm unsure if it would be a good idea to pay everything off.

My next option would probably be to invest some of the money. But that also feels risky considering how close I am in paying off my loans. Alternatively, I was thinking of moving my money elsewhere (such as another bank account). Is a TFSA the best place to have that sort of money? It would also be greatly appreciated if someone can offer some other alternatives as to how to handle this situation.

Some other things to note:
- I live with my parents as we both agreed that I should stay with them until I pay off my loans.
- I have paid them $300 a month to help with any costs at home and also helped pay for other miscellaneous things (such as groceries or mortgage payments). But that has stopped since I got laid off in Decmber. But I still help with groceries and such.
- Current interest rate for my OSAP is 6.45% Floating
- My TFSA interest rate is at 0.50% and I have set automatic transfers that send money from my chequings to my savings (mind you it's only a couple bucks every other day).

Sorry for the long post. Thank you for any advice that you guys can provide.",finance

personalfinance,Looking for advice on getting information on how to pay off my student loans.,"I don't know what a lot of the information I have on my loans means and am looking for help understanding it and what I need to do to get them taken care of and avoid scams. I have two or three student loans totaling up to $5963 or $6599... or more? not really sure. I've looked them up on the department of education federal student aid website and was given [this screenshot of seemingly hieroglyphic information](https://i.imgur.com/NuE4BpD.png) I believe I cropped out the damning info. I'm not entirely sure what defaulted, forbearance, or forgiveness means or what exactly an ED is. I'm under the assumption I need to call my current ED servicer to start paying back my student loan, however I was told I have to be very careful when contacting them because they will likely try to scam me or trick me into putting my loan into some state making me have to pay them more than I owe. and that I actually want to contact the original company that my loan was given to me through instead of the company that it says owns it....

Could someone explain what all this means and possibly give advice on how I should proactively pay off my student loans that I've been ignoring for 5 years?",finance
litecoin,Lambos for Grambos?,"A bit of jest but also a serious question: how old do you think we will all be when we finally get our Lambos?  I got into crypto (and LTC) just weeks before the Coinbase listing at the very end of 2016.  The funny thing about the ride from that point was that for a total noob I scoffed at all the, ""Wen Moon?"" and ""Lambo,"" posts - but then sure enough the wave surge of 2017 started to build.

And lets not forget that while Charlie never promised us Lambos - he had awesome positive comments, like when we were rocketing up past $100 he was saying that we hadn't even left the launch pad yet.  Those were pretty fun days.

Fast forward to now: The institutional money STILL isn't coming to the table (are they?), Baakt is delaying (indefinitely or it won't make much of an impact right); - so there is no real GAS to throw on the fire.  As far as I can tell it is going to be a long slog in the snow for a while.

So given the above, what are people's thoughts for how long it will take to get your Litecoin Lambo? 5 Years / 10 / 50?",cryptocurrency

financialindependence,Should more of us be making 401k to Roth IRA conversions under the new tax law?,"I was listening to [an episode of the Jill on Money radio show](https://youtu.be/ngvNAm9XE3I?t=2221) today, and she had a tax expert on as a guest. He was encouraging listeners to take advantage of the historically low rates in the new tax law over the next 8 years, because he thinks it's likely they'll never be this low again (for a variety of reasons, but including increased Medicare spending and higher payments on the national debt as interest rates rise).

This boils down to two main recommendations: leaning toward Roth IRA / Roth 401k contributions versus pre-tax contributions and considering making 401k to Roth IRA conversions (if you have the cash on hand to pay the taxes and can do it without bumping into the next tax bracket). This makes intuitive sense to me, but I'm wondering if there's anything I'm missing from the FIRE perspective. 

Since most of this group is focused on keeping spending low, is it unlikely that higher future tax rates are going to have a big impact us when we're drawing down in retirement? Since many of us will have to make conversions as we get closer to FIRE age anyhow (in order to access retirement funds early without penalty), does it make sense to just think of us this as bumping that process up to happen sooner than expected because taxes are currently ""on sale""?",finance
personalfinance,Dodgy lender: Home loan offset account applied incorrectly?,"So I'm one month into a home loan and query if my offset account has been applied incorrectly to my linked home loan account.

Loan amount: $525,902.00

Deposit amount in offset account: $525,997.97

Interest rate: 3.85%

Loan term: 30yrs

So, ah yeah, I do have that amount in my offset account. I expect my interest payment to be $0, and for a monthly principal payment to be made on my home loan deposited from my offset account.

Now a payment has been made off my home loan account, and it's been made from my offset account, and there's been no other payment made (i.e. no interest paid to bank). But that amount is $2,466.26, a lot more than I would have expected for just a monthly principal payment on a 30 year loan.

What I'm thinking is; have they applied an interest payment made against my home loan amount? That is, an amount equal to the expected interest payment (if I didn't have it offset) and paid that off my home loan (instead of as a traditional interest payment).

Email inquiries with the bank have so far resulted in replies of reassurance (that I have no net loss, which is true) without any explanation.",finance

Does anyone have a contact number for EA in the UK? All I am able to find is the US telephone number.

The reason I ask is the email address and telephone number on my account are years old and I can no longer access these (I've contacted Microsoft who can't help as the email address is 10+ years old and I cannot remember the security questions. O2 also can't help as the telephone number has been recycled and is no longer available).

I've contacted EA on their Live Chat feature on numerous occasions and to be honest, they're the most helpless customer support there is. I have filled out 3 ""Account Recovery Forms"" with all of the required information (home IP address, purchases, in game stats, in game purchases, win/draw/loss record etc) and every form I get a generic automated email response. Live chat told me to email directly back to the generic email so I did and I got the same generated email back.

Safe to say I'm fed up after 2+ weeks of trying to get my account back, all I want to do is play weekend league on a different Xbox as I'm away from my home Xbox every week.

Yes, I can login and play offline as I know the email and password for the EA account - It is 2 step authentication which is stopping me as I need the 6 digit code to connect to the servers.

Anyone have any ideas which could help?

personalfinance,Please give me advice on loans,"Hi Reddit, I come to you once again in my time of need. I(20) need $2300 to pay for previous and next rent and my credit card. Reason why I owe so much is because both me and my roommate(undocumented/illegal) had trouble finding jobs since we were let go from our separate temporary jobs. He works a spring/summer open bar that pays really well and I accepted that while he works a lesser job during the fall/winter, I would probably pay more than half/all the rent which he would pay back later. It was completely doable with the cafe job I had at the time but I rashly quit the job to try something new which was a temporary summer construction job. Now I'm finally being hired to an annual salary job of about $24,000 starting next week. Problem with that is, after some googling, most loans require employment and a good credit score/history. Regarding my credit score, I literally just got my credit score and unfortunately, it is 656 since I've only been making minimum payments over the past four months out of the six that I've started building. The best option for me from my own researching is Avant with a 35.95% APR and 30.63% Interest Rate. The plan is to have everything paid off and in the following months, devote all cash into paying rent and loan which should take about six months to pay off the loan if all the math is right but I need to know if Avant allows early/extra payments.

**TL;DR: What's the difference between APR and Interest Rate when it comes to loans? Is Avant truly my best option? Does Avant have prepayment penalties?  Does 35.95% APR mean 3% extra on current balance per month? What else do I need to know?**

* **$2300 Required**
* **$24,000 Annual Employment starting next week but need rent sooner**
* **656 credit score; 6 month credit history**

investing,Mark Zuckerberg’s mentor handed the feds an argument that could be used to break up Facebook,"The hypothesis that came to mind was this: Consumers are giving up more value in data than they receive in services. This appears to be true both in the moment and over time, even if consumers are neither aware of it nor troubled by it. If the hypothesis is valid, the price of internet platform services to users has been rising for more than a decade. In the context of anticompetitive behavior against suppliers, advertisers, and competitors, the Chicago School would find that situation to be in violation of its antitrust philosophy. Does it matter that users are not complaining about the “price” of their data? Possibly, but not necessarily. Antitrust is a tool of economic policy designed to balance the interests of multiple constituencies, of which users are one. In the Microsoft antitrust case, for example, the Department of Justice acted to limit anticompetitive behavior, without any pressure from users.

personalfinance,Mother is a Financial Disaster -Advice Needed,"My mom is 74 years old, is living only on SS and struggles daily to make ends meet. I supplement her income monthly with cash gifts, which I have given freely for the last 20 years (yes, I started giving her monthly gifts when she was 54 and I was 25...they have increased in amount since that time). She never asked for gifts, I just wanted to help her because I know her financial situation (note: I grew up in pretty traumatic poverty and climbed my way out with lots of support from her and others along the way). She was widowed at a young age and spent her life raising her children, sometimes working low level jobs along the way. Several years ago, I sat down with her to go over her monthly bills and income, mostly because she asked me to be her executor of her ""estate."" She owns a home, and is paying on her third mortgage (yes, she paid off the house twice and took out a third loan to bail my brothers out of jail and is now paying that loan back). Her monthly income falls considerably short of her monthly bills...her interest rate on her home loan is above 7% and she can't refinance for a lower rate because of her poor credit. I now provide her a monthly cash gift to cover her mortgage and some living expenses, in addition to her SS. She has approximately 10 acres of land in the midwest, with her modest farm house (not the fancy farmshouse style of Chip and JoJo). I have 2 brothers who are pretty useless (in and out of jail over the years, drug users, users in general) who have modest mobile homes on the property as well. They purchased the mobile homes, but do not pay anything for the land they sit on. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's probably way too much information, but it does create a sense of the issue at hand. I feel like I am throwing money at a situation that is not improving and I have some decisions to make. Let me first say, I will not abandon my mom, even knowing that her terrible financial decisions have led to this point. With that in mind, A) I can keep paying the mortgage and in the case she passes before it is paid off, the house would go to the estate and likely be sold to cover the amount owed to the bank (she has no other assets and no savings, so estate is only the property), with any remaining funds to be split with me and my siblings. B) If she passes after it is paid off, she can ""will"" the property to me, but that isn't likely because my two brothers have houses on the land. But, at that point, I would be fine with just walking away and never looking back. C) The other option is for me to pay off the house with a lump sum payment, have her sign it into my name, and then I get to deal with the property after her death (but at least we wouldn't be paying over 7% in interest). D) And, a final option, I have offered to help her sell the home and property (after moving my brothers off the property), and then use any funds profited to purchase a new home in my name for her to live in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Special note for those who I know will ask: My personal finances are stable. My spouse and I earn considerably high salaries for our area and live modestly (our house purchase price is less than our annual combined income; we vacation 3-4 times per year; we contribute the max to our retirement plans (spouse is in a pension plan and I fullly contribute to my company matched retirement plan; other than our own modest home mortgage, we have no debt)).

personalfinance,"Recent Graduate Looking For Budget, Retirement, Loan Repayment and Savings Advice","Hi all! I (22) recently graduated with a Bachelors in Economics and am now trying to transition into ""adulthood"". After lurking for a while, I wanted to reach out for advice on my particular situation and insight into any topics I may be unaware of. Here's some general information about me as well as some specific questions I have.

&amp;#x200B;

**Income**: I work at a startup doing Market Research and earn $50k annually. I get paid 2x a month, which is usually around $1800. I don't have a health insurance or retirement plan through this job. (I am under 26, so still qualify for health insurance under my parent's plan)

**Loans:** I currently owe about $33,000 in student loans. The highest has an interest rate of 7.6%. I have deferred payment until June, but plan on making payments each paycheck regardless. I also have a $15,000 car loan that my mom is helping with by making the monthly payments on as of now.

**Savings:** I currently have about $10,000 in ""savings"". About $4000 of this amount is saved for my rent until August. I recently opened a high yield savings account with Ally and are transferring $5000 of this savings to that account. I plan on depositing $500 every month.

**Retirement:** Since I don't have a retirement plan through my current employer, I want to open a Roth IRA. I want to try and deposit $500 every month, which will let me reach the $6000 limit by the end of the year.

**Budgeting:** I want to start budgeting and managing my money better. I worked as a contractor for my current company from May 2018 - December 2018 and earned *$15000,* and I just realized I have no idea where all that money went.

&amp;#x200B;

Some general questions I have as of now:

1. Where should I open a Roth IRA? I'm new to investing and such so I am thinking I'd like something more hands-off where I can add money monthly and let it accumulate. I've been looking into Vanguard, Schwab, and Fidelity since those seem to be the largest ones.
2. Should I focus more on savings, or repaying my loans? I have that $5000 just sitting there, I am not sure if I should dump the majority of that into my loans and make a dent in it, or save it for emergencies.
3. When should I start saving for a down payment on a house? My boyfriend and I currently rent an apartment together, and plan on renting a house after our lease is up. He wants to wait until after we pay off our loans to start saving, but I think we should start sooner.
4. How do you manage your money? I am currently trying out YNAB, but willing to try any other software or apps.

I appreciate any and all advice you have!

personalfinance,Why is having a car loan the default plan?,"Long time lurker, first time poster. As the title states, I am curious how we (in the US) have gotten to the point where the default thinking pattern is that everyone should have a car loan at all times. Just scrolling through on personal finance, a huge percentage of people in financial distress are in the position they are in at least partially because of car loans. It blows my mind how many examples I see on here of people that make $50k a year and purchase $30k+ cars. The part that really gets me though is that while even though people that come in and give advice say the car is too much, it seems the prevailing mentality on here is that car loans are entirely acceptable and normal, those people just spent too much. 

I think a lot of times posters on here get too caught up in the numbers game and math. Basically it usually goes something like this “well the bank gave me 0.9% interest and I can get 8% on the stock market so this is basically free money”.   I have several issues with this line of reasoning, which I will outline below. 

1.	 Getting a loan encourages people to spend more money then they have. I put this one first for a reason, because I think it is by far the biggest issue. None of these people making $50k a year would ever buy a car so expensive if they had the cash in their bank account and had to actually part with that much money. The concept of “well the monthly payment is only $450, I can afford that (for now)” lulls you into spending upwards of 50% of your yearly salary on a car.   If you had to separate with thousands on your hard earned cash right there on the spot would you really upgrade to leather and GPS?
2.	 Are you actually going to put that money in the stock market?  The above example of “I can do better on the stock market” only works if you actually put the money in the stock market. Basically if you want to buy a $20k car, in order to come out ahead you need to have $20k in the bank, but instead of using it on the car move it to an investment account. I doubt many people are actually doing that, instead I would be willing to bet the vast majority are financing the car because they don’t have the money to buy it. If that is the case, then regardless of how low the interest rate is you are just paying interest, not “getting free money.”
3.	 Financing a car impairs your ability to sell the car if your situation changes. Cars are a depreciating asset, so unless you put a very large down payment toward the car, there is a good chance you will spend a large amount of the loan duration upside down. There are countless examples of people on this sub who are underwater and therefore feel they can’t get rid of the car because they would have to pay to sell it. If you own your car outright you can always get money out of it by selling regardless of depreciation. 
4.	There are costs beyond just interest rates. This has been beat to death on here so I won’t go into it further, but I think we all know it’s not just the interest that adds to the price of the car. Insurance is more expensive if you have a loan, etc etc. 
5.	You can buy a bike and lot of uber trips for the price of even a cheap car. We (again Americans) seem to have a mentality that a car is a requirement not a convenience. While everyone’s situation is different, there are a lot of people who could get by without a car for a few months or years while they save up for one. 

And to people who say that reliable cars and expensive these days, I say absolute hogwash. I have a 10 year old car with leather seats(feels like a luxury car to me), AWD, totally reliable and guess what the retail kbb is on it?... around $7-8k. Could be had even cheaper with more miles or a little older. So if you had $2k for a “down payment” and saved $500 a month that you would have put toward a car payment you could afford that car within a year. I simply don’t understand how people act like it is an impossible task to save up and buy a car.  I rode the bus in college while working to save up and bought my first car (around $5k or so) in cash. It just really isn’t that hard to do if you eliminate the mindset of having a car loan is the default and normal option.  I wish the advice given in this sub was more “avoid a car payment if at all possible” instead of how it seems to me to be “get a car payment, just don’t go overboard”

Anyway, as you can tell this is a bit of a soap box for me, I just hope I convince even one person to actually save up for a car or at least actually consider the full purchase price when choosing a car.",finance
personalfinance,Income Driven Repayment plan for federal student loans...,"With the US Federal Government shutdown my income driven repayment plan paperwork isn’t getting processed. I filed the paperwork just days before the shutdown and my monthly payment is estimated to increase by almost 400%...that is a financial burden I cannot undertake, what should I do?",finance
personalfinance,"This was my first year filing my own taxes. So, I tried 3 different “free” tax softwares to see which company offered the best service.","I’m not here to promote one service over another, but I do want to help other first time filers out there. As I said above, this year was my first year filing my own taxes, after getting charged almost $300 for H&amp;R Block to do it for me in one of their offices last year. Because of this, I decided to enter my taxes on three different “free” tax service websites- H&amp;R Block, TurboTax and Freetaxusa. At the end of the day, my primary goal was to distinguish which product was the best bang for my buck. 

I did this not only to ensure I was getting my maximum refund, but to also see which was the superior service, as I had seen all 3 recommended frequently throughout the sub.  As someone who is completely new to filing their own taxes, Freetaxusa was by far the most enjoyable all around experience (as enjoyable as doing your taxes can be, at least.) I would recommend to anyone here that plans to file their taxes themselves to use their service. And yes, I realize everyone’s tax situation is different so the “best” service is slightly subjective. This was just my experience! 

 It was far and away the cheapest option for my situation, as it actually honored the free filing option for federal and only cost $12.95 for state filing (10% discount if you enter FREETAXUSA10 in the promo code section at the the end). H&amp;R and TurboTax both shot up to between $80-$100 total cost to file my federal and state returns once I entered in my 1098e, 1099-MISC, 1099-INT and DIV etc. They also hounded me to upgrade to an even more expensive service throughout LITERALLY the entire process. 

Freetaxusa walked me through the process very efficiently and painlessly. They went through every possible type of income, credit and deduction I could have.  And most importantly (for me at least), they were true to their word of being a free service. They didn’t steadily increase the price as I entered more information and they didn’t try to get me to buy additional products and services I didn’t need. Hope this helps anyone else out there new to the process, without a doubt will be using them again next year! 

EDIT: Someone asked if there was a difference in the amount of my refund (should’ve included that in the original post, sorry!). But, for federal, no. They all came out exactly the same. For state, yes. Freetaxusa found an additional $33 on my state refund that H&amp;R and TurboTax did not find. 

EDIT 2: As mentioned by another user, if you go through Ebates you can get an additional 25% off the state fee and it should be stackable with the 10% off promo code. However, I did not try this personally. Was unaware at the time!  And some states give the option to file for free through the state. I did not find where my state offers this service, however. 

EDIT 3: I have seen a few people say they were able to get the free service through TurboTax and my post may be a little unintentionally misleading in that regard. Yes, I did go through the Free File Portal with TurboTax like I did with the other services. However, once I began entering my income information, that is when I was disqualified from the free service and I was automatically placed into a paid service. TurboTax DOES OFFER free filing, but only if you make less than 34k a year or are a military member that makes less than 66k a year, and I’m neither! Sorry if I mislead anyone! 

Also, it makes a difference in price with H&amp;R and TurboTax if you have a 1098e/1098t, self employment/contract labor income, savings account interest, an HSA, investment income etc., and Freetaxusa doesn’t charge for entering these forms. Some of these things DO apply to my 2018 tax situation, which is likely a major reason it was so much more expensive to file with  H&amp;R and TurboTax. As I said in the post, everyone’s tax situation is slightly different and I’m not trying to promote certain products over others! Just wanted to provide my personal experience! 

FINAL EDIT (Hopefully): A lot of people are under the assumption that you HAVE to wait until the 28th to file, but that is not the case. If you have all of your documents you can file earlier. The IRS may even accept your return early to use while they test out their system. I completed mine yesterday and actually got an email from Freetaxusa a few minutes ago stating that my refund had been accepted by the IRS and I would be getting my refund within 21 days. 

Much requested TL:DR: For my tax situation, which included several sources of income, I would recommend Freetaxusa. The interface is very user friendly, the cost of my service remained free and did not increase as I entered more information, I was not pestered to upgrade into a more expensive service throughout the process and I was able to get an additional discount on my state filing cost.

personalfinance,How I Got A 0% Loan And Refinanced My High Interest Student Loan Debt,"EDIT\*\*

LUXURY CARD TERMS HAVE CHANGED, NO LONGER VIABLE

That being said, it was completely legitimate when I took advantage of the plan outlined below. For context I did this almost two years ago. I only mentioned it now since i was skeptical at first, but after almost two years, it has worked out well for me.

I was curious to see where some of your comments about this being a lie came from, and so I went to the Gold Card website to view the interest rate terms, and it seems like the Luxury Card Gold Card terms have been edited since last year. When I originally got the card, it was a permanent 0% interest, and it was in the contract. I made sure of this before I went through with the shenanigans below. I should have done my due diligence before posting, because I wasn't aware the card had changed its terms.

I definitely  fell into a loophole, and I apologize for making this public too late. I  didn't realize it had changed. That  being said, it was a permanent 0% APR when I got the card, and I'm still pleased with how things have worked out. I have uploaded a current screenshot of my statement showing the repayment terms and interest rate as proof that I'm not an idiot making a giant financial mistake. [Luxury Card Interest Rate Hack](https://i.imgur.com/XjbOpEr.png)

For the concerned, I now have more than enough to pay off this balance immediately if I  should choose to do so, however the balance is still at 0% APR, and I'm  taking advantage of inflation to draw out the repayment process as long  as possible.

Original post below --------

I have a bit of a process that allowed me to get a large 0% interest loan, and I wanted to share.

Bottom line up front: you need good credit, and it cost me $1000, but you can move a potentially high interest debt into a 0% interest loan that will stay at 0% until you pay it off.

Essentially, I got approved for the Barclays Luxury Card Gold Card, which is a luxury credit card with a $1000/year fee, but with a 0% interest rate. Now, to clarify, this isn't an intro rate. It's a no-shit 0% interest rate. That's important, because it means that if you cancel the credit card line of credit, the balance will revert to the maximum interest rate on the contract, which is 0%, and then you can make the minimum payment until the remaining balance is gone.

So I got the card. The card boasts a 2% cash back reward on everything, every purchase. This is important. Normally student loan companies will NOT allow credit card payments, probably for good reason. You can get around this by using the online payment service Plastiq, which will charge your credit card, plus a 2% fee, and then send a check in your name to anywhere.

I used this service to send an $18,000 payoff amount to a student loan company that was charging me 13.9% APR on my debt. The charge went through, Plastiq hit me with the 2% fee, which i recouped immediately due to the card's cash back feature.

I then called Barclays and closed the credit card account later that year (I used it in the meantime, but cancelled before the year-end mark when the $1000 fee was due again.)

So in a nutshell, I shifted $18,000 in high interest debt, into a zero interest loan that will remain at 0% interest until it is gone. I am paying around ~~$55~~ $150 a month. This cost me a flat fee of $1000, which is what I paid to the credit card company for the year in which I had the card. I then cancelled the card, and the remaining balance stays at the 0% rate.  It has already saved me at least $5000, if my rough math is correct.

I hope this helps other folks who have good credit but are dealing with high-interest loans!

personalfinance,How is gross income calculated for marginal tax brackets?,"Hi all,

I know that tax brackets are marginal, but how is your total gross salary calculated to be applied to those brackets?

For example, let’s say:
- My previous job was gross $80,000 in 2018 and I had 50 weeks of work paid at that salary. 
- My new job was gross $100,000, but I only had the last two weeks of 2018 as work paid for that salary.
- In 2019, the new job is still gross $100,000. 

Would my taxes (fed and state) for the last paycheck of 2018 be calculated using a gross pay of the full $100,000? Or would it be using a gross pay of something like $80,769, which is factoring in the $80,000 gross salary plus 2 weeks of pay at the $100,000 rate increase?

I’m asking this because I started a new job at the end of 2018, and the gross salary hasn’t changed, but my tax deductions in the first paycheck of 2019 were drastically higher than the last paycheck of 2018. More so than just 2018-2019 IRS tax bracket adjustments.

btc,Cryptocurrency Needs a New Direction,"Where should we focus for 2019? No matter how you look at it, 2018 was a horrible year for the entire cryptocurrency scene. Bitcoin was at the forefront of all of this. Frankly, it doesn't matter what top 100 market cap coin you're invested in. The price movements between the coins correlate massively. You can see this by observing the entire market cap. There is no such thing as pure diversification in cryptocurrency. 

The events of 2018 have destroyed the trust of many. There is apparent manipulation. There is a lack of spending within the cryptocurrency economy. There is a lack of production within the cryptocurrency economy. The price movements have been entirely driven up due to manipulation from a select few. This speculation is foolish and it has done no good for the cryptocurrency community.

In what ways are we actually better off from the substantial rise in price? We've seen companies refuse cryptocurrency as a payment option. People have stupidly bought into the hype. There has been losses attributed to cryptocurrency. The news coverage has never been more bleak. 

It's easy to blame external forces. Blame the government. Blame the federal reserve. Blame what you want. It does nothing to solve the fundamental problems that cryptocurrency has. I believe the problem isn't with the government. The issue has everything to do with ourselves and cryptocurrency itself.

In its current form, to call cryptocurrency a 'currency' is a stretch. There was a $600 billion speculation on the entirety of cryptocurrency. The actual exchange of goods and services using cryptocurrency wouldn't even be 10% of that. Who is actually using cryptocurrency as a 'currency'? Let's be honest, nobody but a dedicated few. Most people are in cryptocurrency to make a short-term profit. So much for Bitcoin taking over the world. The people who use cryptocurrency want to sell out for USD, the allegedly doomed currency.

The increase in market cap was entirely down to speculation. We're supposed to be against stupid bubbles. Bitcoin was itself a response to the 2008 Financial Crisis caused by the pumping of the real estate bubble. The boom and bust cycle does nothing for real growth. Indexed, we're only marginally better off than we were in 2008. In regards to the cryptocurrency economy, the same applies.

The responsible way to develop the cryptocurrency economy is to look at the fundamentals. People are too focused on unrealistic and frivolous projects to grow the cryptocurrency economy. I embrace the knowledge economy wholeheartedly, but not at the expense of the production, resource or service economy. These basics have been overlooked by the cryptocurrency sphere. Why do we need 50 coins (forks) which do the same thing? There are plenty of coins pegged to a USD in the CoinMarketCap 100. There are plenty of coins which do the same task as Bitcoin. In what way do these so-called projects increase the practical reach of cryptocurrency into the lives of people?

We have to be realistic and practical about the issues cryptocurrency faces. The ideology of sitting on your thumbs, doing nothing, has failed us. Passiveness is a failure. By no means am I advocating for central-planning or economically authoritarian measures. I'm advocating for fundamental capitalist principles. Supply and demand. The needs of consumers.  The development of an economy. The richest economies on earth are capitalist, yet they have rules. By no means are these countries a failure.

If we want a reasonable increase in market cap, cryptocurrency needs to accommodate for goods and services. It needs to function like an economy. Fortunately we have solutions that already address the issue of goods. A good example being OpenBazaar. The issue of services is more mucky. I believe we need to prioritise services over goods. Most goods sold aren't done on a business-to-consumer basis. It's largely business-to-business. Where cryptocurrency can gain its own value is by service creation. 

Service creation is a no-brainer for cryptocurrency. We can improve the value of cryptocurrency by simply expending time and energy to create utility. People will request services, they will be rendered, this will increase the value. As the quality and category of work improves, the value will too. As jobs will require more knowledge and effort, we will see this reflected in the overall price and size of the cryptocurrency economy. This doesn't require the flooding of dollars to pump up the market. It requires ingenuity and the hard-work of others. The resource that the cryptocurrency will be fundamentally based on is people. This will make it independent and stronger than currencies like USD which is heavily dependent on debt than resources or manufacturing.

Not only does rendering services create value, it will inspire people to better themselves to create quality products. They will utilise skills the have and offer them. If you can do the job, you're part of the solution.

The type of work needs to be based in the real world. The digital gig economy is severely limited in categories and scope. Where can you find a person to walk your dog? Where can you find someone to mow your lawns? Where can you find a mechanic? It's most certainly not on a website like Fiverr or Freelancer. It's not even an option online, aside from some classified boards. 

When applied on a global scale, services and cryptocurrency has the fundamental power to change the economy of the world. People will have a chance to offer what they're good at, at competitive prices, to a wide range of customers. Not only will workers earn, they will also be consumers for other products. As spending increases, and more services are rendered, the overall economy will increase and this will be reflected in the market cap. Again, you don't need to speculate to grow. This is fundamental basic economics.

personalfinance,Figuring out your overall budget for financing a used car.,"So I have been checking out a car for a few weeks. It was priced about $15,790. I thought for sure that was within my budget. When we started talking about price the dealer finally offered me a payment of $373 a month for 66 months with $2500 down, which works out to $27,118. I was stunned. 

I had them remove the warranty and I pointed out every last little little thing wrong with the car and I pushed and pushed, and the lowest I could get them was to $275 for 72 months which is 19800, but that was with $3000 down. So that's 22,800 for a 15790 dollar car? How could that be?

My interest rate is 6.99%, which as far as I can tell is actually a pretty good rate for a first time buyer purchasing a used car in New Jersey (it was a 2012.) Then there's the tax. And the dealer had some kinds of their own fees.

Of course I turned it down. Who is their right mind would pay 7000 on top of the price of the a 16,000 car? 

So what I'm asking is, I obviously don't have much experience in this. Is this just the cost of buying a used car or was this dealer blatantly screwing with me? 

In other words, I thought my budget was 16~17 grand. I knew there would be tax and interest, but I thought that might total 2 - 3000 tops.

I'm trying to look for other cars but honestly I don't even know what my budget is anymore because I don't know how much that gets marked up. 

I could try to get a loan at a bank or credit union, maybe I'd get a slightly lower rate but I don't think it'll make that huge a difference. 

So I guess I was prepared to pay about 19000 tops. 275 a month was really the most i wanted to pay but not for 6 years. 

So how do I find a car that will actually cost less than 19000? What's price should I be searching for? I can't figure this out.",finance

I have a mortgage = $1260/month, 3.875% interest rate
Car payment = $450 (downgraded recently but had to have a good size / dependable car as it is primary transportation for the family, and I have a 60 mile total commute for work).

Personal loan #3 = $200/month ($5200 remaining, payoff 2022)
Personal 401k loan = $200 / month ($8000 remaining, payoff blah)
I took out those loans to consolidate credit card debt at the time, almost entirely lawyer fees from my divorce. It was important to me to get custody of my child, so I don't regret that even though it's hurting now. 
Credit card #1 = $13000 total / $370 a month minimum payment (debt from marriage that I had to take)
Internet/TV/Streaming stuff = $120 / month (I have to keep fast internet for my job, and I've cut down a lot on entertainment but with two kids it's hard having nothing)
Utilities = $200 / month (sucks)
Five store cards = $500 / month total (mostly no interest, will pay off by next spring)
Student loans = $400 / month ($45000, until I die)
Cell phones = $170 / month
Car insurance = $90 / month

I think that covers most of my monthly bills.  This doesn't count things like annual vehicle registration, school fees for the kids, medical bills etc.  Also costs about $180 a month for gas for my vehicle. My fiance pays for a lot of the groceries with her child support payments, but between the expenses for her child, her gas etc she can't help with any of my bills right now.

I clear about $5000 a month, after all is said and done I'm spending about $5200 a month, so while I'm paying off debt I'm also accruing more debt which is currently going on to another credit card that fortunately doesn't have much of a balance right now.  

Alllllllllll that being said, I got a mail offer from Meridian Home Mortgage Corporation that has an offer to pay my mortgage and x amount of credit card debt and roll it into a new mortgage with them.  Of course it'll raise my mortgage but (without actually going to their website) they're offering essentially $39,000 cash above and beyond the mortgage which would pay for almost all of my ""bad"" debt which would save me about $1300 a month in those payments, while increasing my mortgage payment by about $300 or so, freeing up about $1000 a month which I'd mostly apply to paying down the remaining debts.  I feel like this is the nuclear option at this point, I know it's not a GOOD idea, but what am I missing here? I've reduced my monthly payments as much as I realistically can.  Moving isn't an option, and I just got a promotion to make what I'm making now so I'm unlikely to get additional income in the next year or two.  I'm looking for any advice I can get, I really just need to make the next two years without defaulting on anything and I should be in the clear. Those who have had debt and financial issues know the health impact it has from stress etc, that is where I'm at now. Thanks in advance and sorry this was so long :(",finance
personalfinance,Need advice getting out of debt!,"As post states, I need some advice on becoming debt free. I want 2019 to be my financial stability making year.

I am 25 y/o. My fiancé and I have 2 children. She just started a job at a nursing home and I currently am a federal employee. I make $~23/hr and she makes $9.50/hour. So our combined weekly salary before deductions is right aroun $1,300., which comes out to $5,200 monthly. After deductions, I figure on us netting approximately $3,400 monthly. Our current total debt is right at $28,000. I told her that my goal is to have everything paid off by the end of the year, or at least as close as we can get it. Having children, we can expect $300 more cost per month, including diapers, wipes, baby food, clothes, etc... 

I have several small loans (yes the local loan shark company types) that I screwed up and got because I was irresponsible. I am behind on my car loan and a small bank loan I have. I still owe taxes from 2017, but that should be intercepted out of my federal return this year with ~$800 left over that I plan on throwing at one of the loans to pay it off. My fiancé’s return will be about $2400 federal and together our state will total a little over $1200. So we have $4,200 of tax money that we can put towards trying to narrow our bills down and make our monthly income a little bit more stretchable. 

Our budget is as follows (not including behind payments):
Loan sharks: $800
Bank loan: $250
Car payment: $400
Vehicle insurance: $140
Cell phone: $250 (I broke my phone and had to buy a new one on installments due to no savings.)
2017 taxes: $300
Monthly expenses (food, gas, etc...): $600
Child expenses (diapers, wipes, etc...) $150

Total: $2,890

That leaves about $510 for anything else, include expenses we only have to buy on occasion, such as laundry soap or toothpaste or whatever it may be. So realistically, we may only have about $200 left over every month, IF we are homebodies and only go to work and back. After we get taxes and pay a few things off, that amount could potentially increase to about $800 monthly right off the bat.

What I’m trying to ask, how can we throw all of our money, including tax refunds, towards our finances in order to make it the most effective towards my year-end debt-free goal? Are there any suggestions, such as pay off the smallest things first? Or should I got for what has the shortest or longest loan life left? Catch up my payments that are behind? I just need an idea of where to pitch my extra funds to get it rolling where I’d like to see it going.

Edit: we are staying with my parents currently to cut costs on babysitting fees (mother watches them), fuel fees (my father and I work together), and I help with bills when I can, but like I stated we only have about $200 left over every month and that is usually our entertainment money.

Edit 2: I forgot to mention a credit card, it’s total balance is around $950 and $35 monthly payment, so total payments monthly is $2,925...",finance
personalfinance,"0 exemptions, Owe 3 Grand?","Hey folks,

&amp;#x200B;

I searched around and found some information but nothing that quite matches our situation. My wife and I started doing our taxes this year on turbotax and came to find that we owe about $2000 to the feds and $700 to the State of Oregon. we make about $45,000 per year each and were certainly not expecting to owe that much. We both claim 0 dependants on our W-2's can anyone help give us some insight into why this could be?   We have no children. Turbotax has the following statement about why we owe this much ""The $2,110 you owe comes from the $7,278 of tax you're supposed to pay for the year, according to current tax rates, minus the $5,168 of tax you already paid."" We'll probably hire a PCA at some point to see if we can make this any lesser but figured I'd check here first.

personalfinance,Please Help Me Understand My Unemployment Weekly Reward (California),"Hi.

So I was laid off in early January, and filed for unemployment. I received my statement from EDD today, stating that I will be receiving a reward of $404 a week. Now, I'm not trying to spit in the face of free money, but based off of what I've read regarding amount minimums, it seems to me that I should be getting more.

They calculate your weekly reward based off the highest sum of four, three-month quarters. My highest earning quarter was apparently $10,504, which is what they used to calculate my weekly reward. Now, google keeps saying the federal mandate is that you will be rewarded at least 60% of your weekly income, up to your state's earning maximum. By my calculations 60% of my weekly income from $10,504 would be in the ballpark of $520. $404 is barely 50%. California's maximum reward limit is $450, so how am I only getting $404 weekly from $10,504? 

At some point I will probably call EDD and talk to them directly, but I'd appreciate it if someone could point it out to me if I've missed something obvious, before I call them and make a fool out of myself, haha. 

Thanks for reading.",finance

personalfinance,Help me work through this train wreck,"Good evening, r/personalfinance

&amp;#x200B;

A series of lies and bad ideas have led me to be in charge of somebody else's finances. Basically, I tried to help them out by making them an authorized user on my credit card, and they proceeded to run up about $4k of debt in my name. Like I said, bad ideas were had. We're very close, so we came to an agreement that I would have full control of all their accounts AT LEAST until my card is paid off. No matter how idiotic this person is, they will always be my idiot, and I want to do everything I can to set them on a better path.

This person:

•	36 years old. Recently employed full time, 75k/year before taxes

•	Rent: $1100/month, all utilities included (not a bad deal where they live)

•	Auto insurance: $100/month

•	$182k student debt, all private loans, interest rates ranging from 5.7 - 11.5. $3k past due. My mind is blown, too.

•	Bank account is hovering around $0 until first paycheck arrives

•	Old credit accounts have gone to collections. I see $25/month payments being auto-debited for that.

•	Credit is shot for obvious reasons

•	I think there's a 401k, no idea how much is in it

•	Savings are not a thing

•	Budgeting has not been a thing up until this point. I'm allowing them to continue charging gas to my credit card (and I get the points), and putting $50/month in a separate account for other needs. They're going to eat beans and rice until my card is paid off, and then I suppose I'll establish a budget for them. Advice on what this budget should look like is very welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

This person is obviously epically bad at money. Their whole family is bad at money. I know I can't do everything for them for the rest of their life, but I would like to hear your ideas about what I can do for the foreseeable future to at least point them in the general direction of financial competence. I've browsed military employment opportunities and perused debt relief options -- but I don't have any in-depth knowledge of any of these things. If this person were you, what would you do? If you were me trying to help this person, what would you do?  


Edited to add: Those of you who are telling me this person needs to learn for themselves, and that I can't help them forever -- yes. We're on the same page. I'm in charge for at least a little while because I'm pissed about the credit card debt my friend ran up under my name, and my top priority is making that go away. But I don't walk away from people I love. This is the last time I'll ever authorize my friend to use my credit; but I'm not ditching them with all their problems NOW, when I actually have an opportunity to influence their situation significantly. Maybe it's hard to imagine yourself being me -- understandably. Pretend it's your child? Your spouse? Your parent? I don't know. But I'm asking for guidance: what would you do to help, besides letting them flail?

personalfinance,"Car Loan Payment Missed Through Auto Bill Pay, and Hit My Credit","Hey all, just wondering if anyone has any experience with this situation.  So my loan (Lease) is through Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation.  When I got the lease I setup automatic bill pay with my bank (Arizona Federal Credit Union).  In the beginning I watched it like a hawk, but then I got lazy.  Well a little over 2 years into the loan (December 2018 to be exact), I got a notice from my bank that they had not received a bill for this month.  Well I logged in and sure enough, it hadn't been paid.  In addition, it hadn't been paid for November.  I immediately logged into the portal on the Nissan site, and made a payment manually for the November and December amounts.  The next day I received a call from collections, and explained I had already made the payment, and that I was upset about the credit hit.  The person I spoke to was super nice, and opened a dispute with Nissan regarding the credit report, and also reversed the late fee.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today, I received in the mail a denial of my request to adjust my credit report to reflect that I paid the bill on time.  One other important detail is that when I setup my account on Nissan's site (a few years ago right after getting the loan), I setup digital delivery of bills.  I received the email saying thanks for signing up for digital billing, but then never received a bill via email.  When I made that manual payment, I changed my billing to be mail only, and have since received a bill.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is two fold.  First of all, how are bills handled through bill pay when it is setup from the bank, vs setup on the payee site.  I have a list of the bill history from my bank which clearly shows a gap in November and December, and then picks back up in January.  Just on a side note, I have always had much more than the necessary amount in my account, so it wasn't that the money wasn't there.  So when a bill gets ""sent"" how does that happen.  Is it possible that my bank didn't process it properly?  Is it technically my fault for not monitoring it closer?

&amp;#x200B;

Second question.  Do I have any leg to stand on to try and fight this?  It seems like if they never sent a bill, can I still be held liable for not paying it?  Can I ask for proof of the bill?  Maybe a copy of the email, or some other form of proof?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Online bill pay (through my bank) didn't receive a ""bill"", and so I now have a 30 day delinquency on my credit.",finance

personalfinance,"Investing with my Roth IRA, need a bit of handholding to make sure I'm not screwing things up.","When I first opened a Roth IRA account with Vanguard, the money automatically went under Federal Money Market (Settlement find) VMFXX.

This is probably a stupid question: my account will still be a Roth IRA account when I exchange VMFXX for the mutual fund of my choice, right?

I want to put that money into a different Vanguard mutual fund, but I find the the Vanguard interface to be a little confusing, so I'm worried I'm trying to do something stupid. So, could someone just help make sure I'm not shooting myself in the foot?

My input into Vanguard's interface:
1) Where is the money going? I picked my mutual fund of choice.
2) Where's the money coming from? I selected my Roth IRA and entered an amount.

Is this right?

2. Investing into low risk stocks.

I currently have $3,200 in CC debt on a high interest basic bank of america card. This thing is really messing me up and I've only been able to budget the minimums the past 6mo and the interest is so high that it almost negates it. I haven't missed payments but since maxing it out my credit dropped to the low 700s from 790. 

I also have $500 left on a low interest car loan that i'm putting $60 toward each month (minimum). But, I have $300-400 in registration, plate, and late fees on it that i've been avoiding due to lack of money.

I'm a 3rd year with a full ride grant/scholarship to my uni for engineering but I haven't been able to work due to my course load. Thankfully this quarter i'm only taking 4 classes so I was going to pick up a job and chip away at this debt and into the summer where i'll get a paid internship.


I guess my question is how do I deal with my CC? I feel like I should balance transfer it onto a better interest rate card but I haven't really done enough research on it (everything's been on the back burner with school). 

Just been stressed cause i've never been in debt like this but had to max it out due to some family and health concerns.

personalfinance,Federal employee; has anyone gotten loans/concessions from BOA?,,finance
investing,No Pay Stub? No Problem. Unconventional Mortgages Make a Comeback,"&gt;...a flavor of mortgage once panned for its role in the housing meltdown a decade ago is making a comeback. These loans, aimed at buyers with unusual circumstances such as those who can’t provide the standard proofs of income, are growing rapidly even as rising interest rates and higher home prices crimp demand for mortgages.

&gt;Lenders issued $34 billion worth of these unconventional mortgages in the first three quarters of 2018, a 24% increase from the same period a year earlier, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry research group. While that makes up less than 3% of the $1.3 trillion of mortgage originations over that period, the growth is notable because it came as traditional home loans declined. Those originations fell 1.2% over the same period and were on track for a second down year in 2018.

&gt;During the financial crisis, many unconventional loans soured after borrowers misstated their incomes and lenders didn’t ask for documentation, earning them the nickname “liar loans.” Today, industry executives say the new unconventional mortgage, now referred to as “nonqualified” in industry jargon, has changed drastically from its crisis-era predecessor and is far safer.

&gt;Even so, some regulators, consumer advocates and others worry that the growth in this type of mortgage and rising competition to make such loans could lead to renewed risks for the housing market.

personalfinance,Can YOU answer How much will I pay TOTAL at 27% Interest,"&amp;#x200B;

Ok lets say the card interest rate is 27%

I purchased 4 different priced item in same day.

$15

$20

$30

$35

My TOTAL that I owe now is $100 balance.

I buy nothing else and wait for the statement closing and bill due invoice arrives.

Am I charged 27% interest on EACH item that I purchased that day until bill is due OR

Am I just charged on the TOTAL balance of the $100 TOTAL?

(Lets say I started on the 1st day of billing cycle and I waited on the due date due.)

So which is it?

&amp;#x200B;

What am I looking at to pay?",finance
personalfinance,Is consolidating debt this way a smart idea?,"My wife and I make good money, but we have about $15,000 left on our car payment, $9,000 in credit card debt, and a $15,000 home improvement loan. Interest rates vary from 5-10%. 

We currently have a 30 year mortgage with a 3.25% interest rate. Would it make sense to refinance our mortgage to consolidate all the debt under one umbrella? I.e. we owe $206,000 on our mortgage and would refinance for ~$240,000, using the extra to pay off existing debt. $240,000 is still below the value of the home, and the interest rate on the refi would be the same (3.25%).",finance
personalfinance,Raising credit limit when I don't need to? Advice on negative items?,"Looking at my credit score on Chase's website (part of my account information). It has a section for ""negative score factors"". Now some of them I am working on, but one bothers me. ""Your largest credit limit on open bankcard or revolving accounts is too low""? If I don't really need it why does it matter? I think my largest credit card limit is 10k? I don't recall going over 4k on a single card in the last decade. Should I raise the limit on my primary credit card? 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to offset the hit I will be taking as I kill some of my unused cards. Just closed a yearly-fee Frontier Barclay card last night. I have not used it in over a year so why pay $69/year for a card that has a higher interest rate than the one I use regularly that is feeless AND I get credit back on (Amazon)?

&amp;#x200B;

Negatives below. Working on the outstanding debts now. I let my Amazon balance creep up a little. As I just paid off my car I can throw a few hundred extra per month towards it and a 3k line of credit debt at by credit union. Should have them cleared by the end of the year. I also have a small 401K loan that I just remembered, but should be cleared soon as well.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Your largest credit limit on open bankcard or revolving accounts is too low (as stated above)  
&gt;  
&gt;Total of all balances on bankcard or revolving accounts is too high (credit card and line of credit debt totalling about 7k)  
&gt;  
&gt;The balances on your accounts are too high compared to loan amounts (not sure about this one?)  
&gt;  
&gt;Balances on installment accounts are too high compared to their loan amounts (Examples given were auto and student loans. I assume this is my student loan as I paid the car off and it was a 6 year loan paid off in 4 so the balance went down quickly.  As it is in deference I owe the full amount. I do not know why this hurts me as it IS in deference while I attend classes.)

personalfinance,2017 State Tax Refund Never Received (GA) - What options do I have?,"I filed my 2017 taxes in April of last year just before the filing deadline through TurboTax. I got quick confirmation that both state and federal were accepted, and my federal payment went through quickly (it's easy when you owe, right?). The GA DOR was reporting processing times of &gt;90 days, so I put it out of my mind.

I've since followed up with the GA DOR multiple times, and keep getting the response that it is taking a long time to process refunds and please be patient. I just received that answer again over 9 months after filing my return. I have gotten confirmation that they received my return and that it has not been issued/my account shows a credit (so my return was not stolen), and it has not been flagged for any issues as far as they will tell me.

1) Do I have any options to get my money? While not life changing it is a rather significant amount (more than $1k less than $5k).

2) Am I right in assuming that since it was not paid in 2018, on my federal return for 2018 I can list my state return ""income"" as $0?

3) Do employers typically have an option to continue withholding federal taxes as normal, and stop withholding state taxes? I feel like I'm never going to receive last year's refund, am worried about this year's refund, and am debating creating a situation where I will ""owe"" for my 2019 return since I do have confirmation that they would take any owed money against my credits. Of course, this is a last resort since I'd really like to have my money now.

Any guidance?",finance
personalfinance,Car and student loan debt - What to do next?,"Hi there! I'm trying to make things less stressful for myself in trying to figure out my finances regarding my car and student loan payments. I've also posted in r/StudentLoanSupport regarding my loan for some insight on how to deal with that. I've recently received a bonus so I'm now making $17/hr. Hopefully this improves my situation.  I'm 25 and live with my dad, paying rent/groceries, on top of my normal bills (car insurance, health insurance, phone, etc). When I bought the car, my credit score went from 745 to about 660? It's at 668 now, my student loans starting to hit it.

About the car: My dad used to work for Mazda and when my old car officially broke down, co-signed for this new car for about \~$14k and I was given a car lien as of Dec 2017/Jan 2018. My payments are \~$245/mo with a 4.95% APR with Wells Fargo. CreditKarma's been suggesting refinancing it for lower payments and rates.

About the loans: Despite getting a ""full ride"" with my dad's GI Bill, I still had to take $11k in fed loans out and since I've been struggling financially (until now), haven't been able to afford payments and the interest has brought it up to about \~$14k. The minimum payment is $154, and currently on forbearance until July of this year. This is also from the fraudulent Art Institutes and my particular school closed down on  12/26/18, in which I did attend when they got busted for their fraud in 2011.

I also have ER bill that the company won't help with financial assistance. I've submitted an application with them 11/20/18 and never received anything after their ""promised"" 30 days of them getting back to my case. They keep giving me the round-about (numbers to call to no avail/ ""can't be helped"") to this day, and I'm still at $3600 left on it (this is the self-pay option of $7200, originally $14k), at $201/mo.

So right now, I'm sitting at \~$30k-ish debt. I've considered getting a personal loan to pay off everything at once (if that's even possible) and just make one big payment instead of all of these small payments back and forth with different interest rates. Should I attempt to refinance my loans and car? Should I even attempt the Borrower's Defense Claim Act? I could really use some suggestions/insight, I'm just feeling extremely overwhelmed lately and can't see myself even moving out or getting on with my life with this debt.

Edit: Updated some info.I've been in and out of jobs and temp jobs until this past year, haven't been able to even afford an IBR. I'm giving it a few months during the forb to see how my new paychecks are before re-applying.

Second Edit: I finally got through to a financial servicer for my ER bill, but apparently there's a time frame from the time of service for requesting assistance-- in which it was never offered to me from the beginning. They said they're going to contact their corporate level and try to see if they'll still accept assistance coming up on the 2 year mark. Fingers crossed, here's to hoping.

Third Edit: They can't help me because it exceeded the allotted time, so I'm stuck with the $3600 bill. Kinda sucks because I was never given a financial assistance option at time of service and didn't even know that existed until last year.",finance
personalfinance,Pay off personal loan?,"My husband and I currently have a personal loan and an auto loan. We pay off our credit cards in full every month, and don't carry any other debt. We are in position that we could pay off the personal loan (owe $8000 on original $15000 - interest rate is 8%). The only hesitation we have is the drop in credit score from paying off the loan, as well as having one less type of credit.

We will be applying for a mortgage in about a year. My gut tells me that that taking the hit now will give us plenty of time for scores to bounce back, but I since you have all been so helpful in the past, I figured I'd ask :)",finance

We don’t love her for her boobs, Rocksteady, it’s because of her strength and personality, her intelligence, kindness, and *independence*.  She is her own superhero, but according to Rocksteady she’s just someone to rip around like a ragdoll so the storyline gets another character to defame. Her death and the reaction to it was the thing that mattered, not her character, which is a complete waste of potential. PLOT TWIST she’s alive at the end! Great, so she’s still a damsel in distress, and used as bait for Gordon, and of course, gets saved by Batman to get everyone excited. Pointless Damsel in Distress: 2

Finally, let’s talk about Selena Kyle.  Bad-ass, quick-thinking, combat-oriented Catwoman.  THEY LITERALLY PUT HER IN A COLLAR you’re kidding me.  You. Are. Kidding. Me. What’s worse is that she is kidnapped by the Riddler! Since when is the Riddler capable of doing anything noteworthy, much less able to kidnap The Feline Fatale? It’s ridiculous.  She’s literally bait in a collar. Pointless Damsel in Distress: 3

Last but not least, we have Harley Quinn.  Her entire backstory is gut-wrenching.  Anytime I hear a little girl say she wants to be just like Harley Quinn, my blood boils.  I’ll keep that out of here for now (cause we all know I could talk about that for HOURS) and instead mention how *stupid* it is that in a game where Harley actually seems to be doing things on her own as the leader of Joker’s old gang, she still is worthless. Again, it’s awesome that she’s the leader of Joker’s old gang. That part made me really excited. She even puts up a good fight against Batman and Robin, which is great! She doesn’t have to win; that’s not the problem.  It was all ruined  when some random prisoner grabbed Harley and BAM she’s suddenly a hostage.  So… Harley can fight both Batman and Robin and take care of herself in combat just fine, and then when some random old guy gets a gun, she’s done for? Spare me.  Pointless Damsel in Distress: 4.

Rocksteady puts every single female character in the game in the damsel in distress position.  Every last one of them.  Not a single character is used for their character traits, rather is simply pushed as an object in a competition between other characters in the game.  The idea of any of these women saving themselves is thrown off the table, because of course our hero in black BATMAN has to go do it for them.  Sexist, misogynistic, and awful. DC has created some amazing female characters! However, if you look through Rocksteady’s interpretation of them, they’re nothing but pretty pieces of meat on collars for big buff Batman to go save.

They ask for your taxable income and non-taxable income. My husband makes about $70,000 before taxes. We fully fund our HSA. He contributes to his 401k. I don't know the percentage, but it ends up being about $375(really between $247-442 depending on the hours). 

I do have 2017's tax returns in front of me, but his income did go up since then. I see that the state had his taxable income at about $35,000, but the federal taxable income was about $26,000. So which would you use for Chase? Or how could I estimate 2018s? Or should I do 2017s now and then update the income when we do our taxes? 

How do I know what the non-taxable income is? Is it the AGI(about $50,600) minus the taxable income(and again...which taxable income number do I use?). How do I estimate that for 2018 unless I wait until we do our taxes?

He came back from a deployment with six months of unpaid mortgage and utilities. Pay day loans. Insane auto loan interest rates. Selling belongings for chump change. He had absolutely no control over his finances and she left him destitute, and would then blame him for not making enough. 


He and I have been together six years now. I’m the one who helped him file the bankruptcy and get back in his feet.

personalfinance,Should I put 100% focus into snowballing my debt and put off retirement savings?,"This is an update from a post I made about 7 months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a job last May making $24.04/hour ($50,000/year) plus any overtime. I've made progress but also some of my information was wrong when I made that last post.

&amp;#x200B;

My current assets are:

* $5,780 in my checking account (saving for a down payment on a car in two months).

My current debts are:

* $16,100 in student loans divided up between 6 loans ranging from 3.51-4.2% interest. (When I made my post 7 months ago I said I only had $12,000 which was wrong).
* $13,000 in the car I am going to buy off my lease in two months. I have not figured out financing so I don't know an interest rate or minimum payment yet.
* Cell Phone $610
* $0 in credit card debt (down from $1,500 seven months ago).

My current expenses are:

* Rent $570/month
* Water/Sewage/Trash \~$7/month
* Internet $20/month
* Electricity \~$45/month
* Auto Insurance $140/month
* Gas \~$65/month
* Spotify Premium $13/month
* Hair $25/month
* Cell Phone $0 (I got the one year of Sprint for free if you are a new customer and bring an unlocked device)
* Car Lease Payment $207/month
* Food/Entertainment/everything else (Budgeted but flexes +/- $100 month to month) $900/month

Total Expenses = ~~$1,785~~ $1,992

My take home pay varies greatly because of overtime. However, $2,900/month is pretty average.

This leaves me with ~~\~$1,115~~ \~$900/month left over each month.

I want to snowball my debt and get it payed for ASAP. However, I'm afraid of the time it will take to finish off almost $30,000 of debt. Even if I can put ~~$1,250~~ $1,000/month into my debt it would still take about ~~2~~ 2.5 years to pay it all off. I'm currently contributing to my 401K at 4% (\~$115/month) just to have something in there.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I increase my 401K contribution if it means that it will take longer to pay my debts off?

investing,Tesla downgrade by RBC means more analysts on Wall Street have 'sell' ratings than 'buy' on stock,"Tesla was downgraded to underperform by RBC Capital, which said that the electric car maker has finally started to give some straight talk to investors about its future growth, but many are still not listening because they are still too enthralled by the company's founder and CEO Elon Musk.

&amp;#x200B;

Analyst Joseph Spak writes:

""It's not that we don't believe Tesla can grow over time, our model shows solid LT growth. But the current valuation already considers overly lofty expectations. For instance, let's assume 1mm \[Model 3\] units @$55k ASP, 12 percent EBIT margins, no interest/equity raise all by 2025. This is undoubtedly solid earnings, but at a more 'mature' 15x P/E, the discounted back value is \~$195, meaning even in an optimistic case at least 1/3rd of today's price is an 'Elon premium'.""

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla shares fell 1.5 percent in premarket trading Wednesday following the call. Through Tuesday, the stock was down 10 percent on the year to $298.92.

""The company seems to be more tactful with messaging which is a long-term positive, but means downward pressure to growth expectations - which in our view are too high to justify current levels, let alone to add to positions,"" wrote Spak.

In the latest round of cost-cutting measures, Tesla [said last week](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/18/tesla-to-cut-its-workforce-by-around-7-percent.html) that it would cut 7 percent of its workforce and discontinue production of some other models to focus on the Model 3. Musk also said that the company likely achieved a ""tiny profit"" in the fourth quarter.

""For years, Tesla sold the dream of transportation disruption and fantastic growth. This served the stock well turning Tesla into a top 6 (at times top 3) valuable auto OEM despite delivering a fraction of units of others and nary a profit,"" wrote Spak. ""A stock should of course discount future cash flows and the market took the promises of Tesla and their future growth potential to justify lofty valuations while Tesla took capital needed to support their endeavors. But the rubber appears to be hitting the road as the realities of Tesla becoming a volume player, the challenges to scale and deliver high volume at high ASPs/margins are coming to a head.""

RBC lowed its price target to $245 from $290. With Spak's rating change to underperform (the equivalent of a sell), there are now more analysts on Wall Street that say sell Tesla, than buy it. Eight analysts say ""buy,"" seven say ""hold"" and nine now say ""sell,"" according to [TipRanks.com](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla/price-target). It's rare for a stock as popular as Tesla to have a majority of analysts that say sell. The negative rating is still relatively rare, with most analysts typically using a ""hold"" rating to voice their displeasure with a stock. For comparison, Apple has zero sell ratings, according to TipRanks.

""Whether its cutting the price of their lineup by $2k/unit, admission the federal tax credit expiring will hurt, acknowledgment that Tesla can't sell at $35k Model 3 profitably and costs need to come down, or language around full-self driving - we'd classify recent commentary and actions by the company as more realistic,"" stated the RBC note. ""This is likely to cause a review of model assumptions leading to negative expectation revisions.""

Putting all of it into the 401k will hit the yearly cap.

Or just put it into stocks/saving account or something.

Really hoping for some insight and guidance into whether or not I should consolidate my student loans or keep them the way they are. I graduated with my Master's in Industrial-Organizational Psychology at the end of May 2018.

Its been a tumultuous job search process and it's still ongoing. Part of why it's taking me so long is that I was very restrictive in what city I was applying in, and that severely limited my options. The good news is I relocated to another city that is the IO Capital of the USA, so interviews have been steady and I am optimistic. Of course, the IO capital of the USA happens to be DC, which has been severely impacted by the gov't shutdown, so things are slower than usual. All of that is to say that I am optimistic that I will be able to land a job somewhat soon.

For those not familiar with IO, it is one of the highest paying avenues for Psychology majors, and the avg. entry-mid level salary is from the high 60's to 80k. For example, my girlfriend who also graduated from the same program is making 70k+ for her first ""real"" job. That, and familial financial limitations, ended up impacting my overall loan total (for example, I got a full ride to undergrad and chose a small state school for financial reasons, but lack of financial education both my own and my parents', led to us taking out 22k in loans for housing and stuff). For grad school, I took out around 40k.

&amp;#x200B;

Total loans: **$66,518.51**

|Direct Loan- Unsubsidized|$21,034.33|6.000%|

&amp;#x200B;

Since I currently do not have an income, I've heard that I should apply for consolidation, to lower my interest rates. I've been putting in around $300 a month to stagnate the interest, so at least it's not growing. I'm also currently enrolled in the revised pay-as-you-earn repayment program.

I would really appreciate any advice any of you have about whether or not I should pursue consolidating my loans. This is a major headache for my GF and I, and we're trying to get a good handle of how to deal with this loan amount. Any other advice that you can offer us is also incredibly helpful.

* I was charged income tax in my state of residence through the year which appears on my W2
* I'm charged income tax by my state of employment at tax time
* My state refund from the previous year is factored into my AGI
* The net result is the income tax I paid to my state of residence (which is higher than the state I work in)

Now it looks like the following is happening:

* My previous year state refund is included in my AGI (in this case it's \~$10k added to my total income)
* My current total tax burden is being added ($16k income tax state of residence, $9k income tax state of employment, total of $25k in income tax with both states combined)
* The income tax burden is being capped at $10k total, resulting in a massive decrease in my itemized deductions despite the refund I got existing to cover the taxes to another state.
* This means that the $10k I received to pay for taxes to another state is being taxed by the federal government without there being any kind of deduction available anymore for the additional taxes paid to another state.

Is there something different I'm supposed to be doing for living in one state and working for another now? I know my $16k state tax burden is being culled to $10k now, but what's happening with the other feels like I'm getting double taxed.

Is there someway I can more accurately have the correct amount withheld throughout the year so that I don't get hit with this big bill every April?


For context, using rough figures, my straight salary is ~100k/yr, and after bonuses, 401k contributions, insurance premiums, etc... my taxable income comes to almost exactly the same. This is why my wife and I file separately - she is on the PSLF program to (hopefully) repay her student loans after 10 years of teaching, and if we file joint then she no longer qualifies for the program due to my income. This also means I cannot deduct my own student loan interest from my tax bill for some absurd reason which, coincidentally, would take a significant amount off the amount I am told I owe.",finance

investing,90 years of Contrarian Asset Allocation,"tldr Variable Contrarian Asset Allocation has outperformed all X% stocks and 100-X% bond portfolios over the last 90 years

With interest rates rising and CDs and short term bond yields being competitive with longer term yields for the first time in 10 years, its seems an act of insanity to stick to a standard 70/30, 60/40 or whatever passive investment. You are taking duration and interest rate risk for very little extra yield.

It got me thinking, what if you adjusted your stock, bond, and cash allocation based on market conditions relative to history. So if stocks CAPE is high, reduce stocks. If bond interest rates are low, reduce bonds. If yields are low and short term CD/bonds are competitive(within 1% yield) switch from long term to short term CDs/bonds.

I took this idea and back tested it over the last 90 years. Unsurprising this value/contrarian based asset allocation strategy performed really well. It outperformed 100% stocks with less draw down than a 70/30 allocation.

Below 15: Add 10% Stocks

Below 10: Add 20% Stocks

Above 20: Reduce 10% Stocks

Above 30: Reduce 20% Stocks

**If 10 year treasury yield is:**

Below 6%: Reduce bonds 10%

Below 3%: Reduce bonds 20%

Above 8%: Add 10% Bonds

Above 12%: Add 20% Bonds

**If difference between 10 year treasury and 3 month tbill is less than 1% and 10 year yield is less than 3%, switch bonds to tbills. If yields are less than 6% switch 50% of bonds to tbills**

investing,Economist: The euro area is back on the brink of recession,"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/01/22/the-euro-area-is-back-on-the-brink-of-recession

&gt; The euro has been an economic fiasco. GDP growth in the euro area has lagged behind that in other advanced economies, and in the European Union as a whole, throughout its life—before the financial crisis, during the global recession and its euro-area encore, and even during the recent #euroboom. Perhaps the area would have done as badly without the single currency. But attempts to estimate euro-zone performance relative to a counterfactual world sans euro suggest not. The past decade has been especially brutal. A list of the world’s worst performers in terms of real GDP per person since 2008 contains places suffering geopolitical meltdowns—plus the euro-area periphery. Greece has been outgrown by Sudan and Ukraine. Cyprus and Italy have been beaten by Brazil and Iran; France and the Netherlands by Britain.

&gt; ...

&gt; The price of German support for crisis-addled economies was a revision to the “stability and growth pact”, which is intended to keep budgets in line. The new fiscal compact struck in 2012 requires governments to keep net borrowing to no more than 3% of GDP. Though that may not seem particularly onerous, it also requires them to maintain a structural budget deficit (adjusted to take account of the business cycle) of no more than 1% of GDP if debt is “significantly” below 60% of GDP, and no more than 0.5% of GDP if debt is above that level. Governments with debt above 60% must also take steps to bring it back below that threshold; those approaching it can no doubt expect stern warnings. Countries in egregious violation of these rules are subject to penalties. In Italy, which has public debt of around 130% of GDP, populists were carried into office by frustration with the status quo, but cowed into budget sobriety last year after the EU threatened to impose such penalties.

&gt; In effect, Europe has denied governments the ability to use their budgets to boost demand. These fiscal shackles would be less worrying if the ECB were better positioned to boost private spending by easing monetary policy. But its effective interest rate is already negative. The slowdown in 2018 came despite the ECB asset purchases continuing, albeit more slowly than in 2016 and 2017. Foreign spending could keep the euro-area economic engine turning over. But it is fickle, as the currency bloc is learning. It was only a matter of time until an ill wind caused the euro area’s sails to slacken, exposing its inability to maintain domestic demand without external help. The shift from boom to gloom was inevitable.

&gt; It need not be permanent. Europe could loosen its fiscal restraints. Better still, it could make use of its combined fiscal potential by mutualising some debt and creating a euro-area budget big enough to offer meaningful stimulus. These reforms would require a big shift in the balance of power and thinking within Europe. Such shifts have occurred before, in the throes of crisis. But if the past ten years of #eurogloom did not demonstrate the pressing need to maintain an array of demand-boosting tools, it is difficult—and frightening—to contemplate what ultimately will.",finance
personalfinance,Trying to come up with a formula for determining the equity I'll have in my house after X years.,"So, sorry in advance if this isn't really the right place for this. I've been Googling, and can't find exactly what I'm looking for. I understand the theory of it, but I'm having a hard time calculating the specifics.

Basically, I want a sort of plug and play formula for determining how much equity I'll have in a house after so many years of paying my mortgage payment.

So, if my initial loan is X, interest rate is Y, life of the loan is Z, if I pay the minimum payments for A years, I'll have B equity in the home. Also assume traditional mortgage, fixed rate, and 20% down ( so no PMI ).

I want to calculate for B, so I can get a rough idea of how much I can expect back when I sell the house. 

I know there are cost associated with selling the house, and I may get more/less than I paid for the house, but I've found resources for calculating that part.

personalfinance,Best advice for paying off $2700 in credit card debt?,"Hi all!

I'm fairly new to this subreddit but would love some advice. 
I am a masters student and I currently have about $2700 in credit card debt.

I have 2 credit cards:(1) local credit union CC with low interest rate and (2) uber visa with high interest rate

The $2700 is all on the credit union credit card. The interest rate is  15.4% APR. I rarely use the UBER visa and have never paid it late. I pay it off in full every month but I usually try to avoid using it. 
I guess my question is, what should I do about this debt? I'm about to finish grad school and am currently recruiting for full time positions. Currently I have a part time job working about 15 hours a week at $17/hour. This is already a lot considering I have 4 courses and a ton of school work, so getting another job isn't really an option at the moment. 

I have to pay my rent each month - around $530. I fill up my tank about twice a month for ~$30 each time. I also pay for any restaurant foods I eat. I am lucky enough that my tuition and food expenses are paid by my parents.

Would love some input/advice on how I can pay it off the fastest or if I'm mostly doomed.

personalfinance,Student Loan + Travel Abroad Opportunity,"Hi All, 

&amp;#x200B;

Uni Student in Nursing in the US nearing graduation (december 2019). I have managed to keep all of my student debt to 4k.

&amp;#x200B;

I am immensely proud of how I've handled my finances given that my entire family is in copious amounts of debt that they may never recover from. I saw that, and decided to do everything they didn't in order to keep myself from such a demise. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I am nearing graduation, I've been provided with a travel abroad opportunity that I am super interested in. It's part of my clinical requirements. It's a course I have to take either way. However, for an extra 2k, I can take it in another country over a span of 10 days with much less work and a much more enjoyable experience, or I can take it at the Uni over 15 weeks, with much more work but for 2k less.

&amp;#x200B;

That 2k will have to be on loans. I keep a tight budget, and I can come up with everything outside of that (4k) from my job and a scholarship I received to go. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, that puts me at a total of 6k debt upon graduation at 5.05% interest rate. With a 60k salary, I can pay off that 6k rather quickly, approx. 6 months. With a sign-on bonus most hospitals will provide, I can potentially pay it off in 3-4. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts on this? I would love to go. It's in Asia and it'll be such a great experience. However, I've become so accustomed to a certain frame of mind that it's hard to deviate from what has gotten me to this point, and I am struggling so much to justify paying for a trip with a student loan when I could just save 2k by not going at all.

personalfinance,W-4 Withholding Calculator showing odd results?,"This is probably something obvious I might be missing, but please bear with me. I recently got married (last May), and my spouse and I tried to calculate what our new withholdings should be for 2019. We used our first pay stub from 2019 to do the calculations.

For some info: we're filing jointly, have a combined income of around 160k, and both claim 0 on federal, 1 for state.

We have no dependents, no home ownership, and no other income.

Somehow this returns a result that we'll owe $7000? I tried on turbotax's calculator and it returned the same results. We also tried using 2018's numbers and it said we'll owe $6000 (nothing changed other than marital status). The IRS website recommends we keep the allowances at 0, and also note an additional combined $259 be withdrawn from our paychecks per month.

Is it normal to have to owe taxes even at 0 allowances? We noticed that after we changed our W-4 from single to married, we noticed the net pay went up by a some hundred dollars (probably due to income bracket changes). Not sure what we could have missed, any suggestions on what we could have missed would be much appreciated. We started filing our tax return and it looks like we're still getting a refund, which confuses us.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Adjusted the numbers. Re-read the results and instead of $23,000, we'll owe the difference of the withholdings and what we're supposed to pay, which still leaves us with ""If you do not change your current withholding arrangement, you will have $15,876 withheld for 2019 leaving $6,993 due when you file your return.""

* **$29,286.05 Unconsolidated Student Loans**: A combination of direct subsidized and direct unsubsidized loans with an average of about 4.2%.  Because they're on an income-based repayment plan I haven't had to make any payments yet, but come August I'll have to start paying these in earnest.
* **$160,578.34 Direct Consolidated Loan** (was a Parent PLUS Loan): I've been paying this for about a year and the interest rate is 6.625%.  The interest is accruing faster than I can pay it off, which is obviously concerning.  This loan is technically in my father's name, but I made a commitment to pay it off.  The payments are based off of his income and are currently at $527.86.

I'm looking specifically for advice on how to manage this debt moving forward.  I can currently make the monthly payments on the consolidated loan, but things will be tight once I have to start paying for the other loans.  I'm also worried about my dad's income going up, since that will increase the payments that I have to make on the consolidated loan.

&amp;#x200B;

My current plan is to consolidate the loans in my name and hope for a lower interest rate, but I'm not sure if that will help much.  I'm also not sure how loan forgiveness works with the Direct Consolidated Loan since it's in my dad's name and I'm currently not even on the paperwork.  That loan is supposed to go up to nearly $2000/month in 10 years and I'm not sure I'll be able to pay even that.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also concerned about retirement and savings right now, since I'm living paycheck to paycheck as it is and don't have extra money just lying around.

personalfinance,"To primarily focus on paying off my loans, or not?","Just for reference, I grew up during the Recession which in my mind has very much impacted my thought process with regard to money. I am afraid of debt, and if I have it I pay it off on time or (if possible) early. My upbringing was very much lower middle class, and we were only a few months from being homeless. It was to a point where the only thing keeping the heating on in the spring was a state mandate to the power authority. Mainly what I mean by ""or not"", is whether I should put paying off my loans over saving up for a vacation or taking a job abroad for less pay than I'd get stateside. Pretty much should I make it my absolute primary concern.


I am currently enrolled in a politics program (3rd year, on time to graduate), and am taking courses in Android and iOS development to potentially aid in finding work post-grad. Financially, I have under $1,000 in a checking account, $250 in investments that's lost half it's value (thank you marijuana stock hype), and roughly 65k in student loans that are at last I checked a 4.5% interest rate. My parents are helping pay off some of the loans, but I personally see them as chiefly my responsibility and consider their contributions to be helpful but not necessary. I do not have a car, and prefer to not drive/live in dense areas if it's possible. 


In my mind, I'll be graduating with this debt and should pay it off before it gets to be too big of a problem (my plan is to have it gone within 5 years, or before I'm 35). i currently do not see myself getting a 80k job as a developer due to not having a degree and being right out of college. From what I've heard from friends, family, and here on Reddit, the industry is closing up to people without a CS degree. This might just be hyperbole and not hard fact, but that's how I see it from the outside looking in. 


So, the options I feel like I'm left with are Peace Corps, teaching English abroad, working on the Hill, working at an NGO, working at a think tank, retail, or something else in the private sector. If I can find an app development job or something similar awesome, I just don't think it is very possible. I always hear people talking about their 20s as though it's a great time when you're still young and don't have family, to not ""waste it"", whatever that really means I guess is up to the individual. 


The TL;DR of this I guess is should I take risks and do something like go abroad to teach English, work in the Peace Corps or at an NGO or some other job that doesn't pay relatively very much and put my loan concerns aside, or get something that's relatively high paying to the ratio of saving and focus on paying them off? I realize that English teaching can be very much in the camp of high pay to savings ratio, but it can also not be that fruitful depending on a number of factors.",finance

I was recently accepted to graduate school (Physician Assistant). While very exciting, I am also very nervous about the amount of loans which will need to be taken out.

Here is some basic info about my finances:

* Current Income: $51,765 per year ($1388 biweekly post tax/401k/medical/dental/STD)
* Expenses (rent, utilities, food, gas/insurance, misc.): ~$2200-2400 per month.
* Cash saved: $18,000
* Outstanding undergraduate loans (all federal): $46,950 (3.4-6.8% interest rates)

The total tuition for the program is $98,520 over 2 years. The average starting salary in my geographic area is $90-115k/year, however, possibility of &gt;130k after 3 years depending on specialty (per published salary report). I applied to a total of 9 schools, and unfortunately, it appears that I was accepted to one of the more expensive ones. I will also have to take out money to cover rent, which will be around $1900-2200/month (split with my wife, so $900-1100/month). She will be working during this time.

* Total estimated loan burden (undergrad + grad): Approximately $164,000.

This number scares the shit out of me. I know with a starting salary of &gt;$90k I will be in a decent place to tackle this over 7-10 years, hopefully. I will also like to add that I am getting married prior to school (wedding costs taken care of by fiancee's family) and will likely have money gifted to us which will help us float as well.

I am mainly looking for advice on what I can do to make this as painless as possible. Should I pay down my current loans with my saved cash and leave ~$10,000 as a emergency fund/cushion? Should I continue to save aggressively for the next 8 months and take out less loans? Any other advice is welcomed.

personalfinance,Purchasing a rental property with cash or line of credit (US),"Hi,

I am looking to purchase a rental property (single family home) and I am trying to figure out the best way to do it. I have enough cash to pay for it out right, and would still have enough in reserves to be fine. 

I also have a home equity line of credit which has an interest rate of 5.5% and is good for 10 years. The payment on the HELOC is just interest.

For this particular investment I am looking at about 3.5 years for the ROI.

So the question pay for it with cash or the HELOC and why?

If the answer is cash then when are good times to use the HELOC?

Thank you for any insight you can provide!",finance

personalfinance,Moving My debt to a '0%' interest rate credit card to reduce costs,"So after a while of 'bad months' i've finally managed to get my spending back under control. The issue is that, despite this i'm still nearly 2k in debt on a CC and touching the floor of my overdraft. The charges from this (a high interest CC that i got when i was 19 and rarely used until a few years ago) and the overdraft are costing me alot.

I've checked my rating on Experian and should be able to get a 0% CC with balance transfers but i'm struggling to understand how it actually works. For example, most of them will say it's 0% for 28 months but still quote 19.9% APR and that the 0% is only available for the first 60 days.

This seems completely condritory to me? how can it be 28 months But only 60 days?

&amp;#x200B;

What i'm trying to work out is would it be cheaper to move my balance to a 0% (simply to reduce cost of servicing it) and then transfer enough money into my bank to eliminate a need for an overdraft?",finance
personalfinance,Advice for first-time investor,"Hi everyone, a relative recently passed away and I am a named beneficiary. General amount I should be receiving this year, before taxes, will be about $450,000.

I'm meeting with a financial advisor tomorrow but thought I might get some advice here to compare against his.

I know the general rules - don't pay off my house or college loan, pay off higher interest rate loans, invest the rest. Here's what I'd like to do:

- $25,000 to $50,000 in each of my kids' (2) 529 accounts for college
- Roth IRAs for my husband and I ($5500 a year each, yes?)
- Pay off small high-interest rate loans (approximately $15,000, one is a debt consolidation loan that we're halfway through paying off, about $10,000 left on it, the rest are small $1000ish accounts for furniture, etc.)
- Approximately $50,000 to us for some home renovations, down payments on 2 newer vehicles, a Disney vacation, etc (and the $50,000 includes what I'd pay in taxes for taking that amount in cash too. so net idk $30,000?)
- the rest in various investment vehicles for retirement, preferably something that I can't withdraw from until I'm at least 59 1/2 (I'm currently 43).

Is this a decent plan? Obviously the best thing would be to invest the lot of it but mama wants a new car and this is the only time in my life I'd be able to get a fancy one :)",finance
personalfinance,Pay off student loan with a personal loan?,"Hi. I have $6855 remaining on my fedloan with 6.88% interest rate. I have excellent credit. Should I take out a personal loan with a lower interest rate to pay this off in full? MA if that matters. 
Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Filing Taxes in IL,"I just filed my taxes in Illinois the other day. I'm 19 years old. This is the fourth time I've filed in Illinois. This past year was the most I've ever made. I'm a student and I work part time. I made roughly 10k. I get for some people that's nothing but I was pretty proud of it! Anyways, every year I look forward to getting money back after I file (I use turbotax). In the past, I haven't worked nearly as much, so my total refund (fed and state) has always been less than $500. This year when I was filing, I got a refund of $622 from the government. It made me excited to file in Illinois and I was thinking, oh, maybe I'll get close to $1000 back this year. Nope! Apparently, I get nothing back from Illinois, despite paying them over $600 in taxes. I mean, I get that the more you make the less you get back yadda yadda, and I also get that Illinois taxes suck. I just find it hard to believe that I'm already at the point where I get nothing back? And also, does this mean that next year I might have to owe money? I plan on working a lot more this year so that's a concerning thought. Anyways, I was just surprised by the fact that I came out owing $0 and getting $0 back from Illinois. It just doesn't seem right? I don't think there's anything I can do now because I've already officially filed my taxes, but seeing people post here about taxes made me wonder if maybe I should've asked about that here first.",finance
datascience,Landed an internship at a hospital's lab. What can I do to help them with their data?,"- Hello everyone, I'm a 2nd year CS student who has some theoretical knowledge but no hands-on experience on data science and machine learning. Today thanks to the help of one of my professors, I had the chance of getting an interview for an internship at a local hospital's biochemistry lab. Thankfully they seemed to like me and wanted to give me a chance to work on their data. They didn't ask me for any specific task, so I have the freedom to think about any kind of project that would mutually benefit both me and them and I will hopefully have their support on whatever ""project"" I come up with. I'm very happy and eager to learn about data science but as a newbie in this field I need you guys' guidance on what I can do. 
- The hospital is a public hospital in a developing country, and I’ve noticed that they are mostly using older technology for their data related work (storage and analysis). I will have access to their patient data to some extent, which I imagine could be fed to some machine learning-driven system to aid them in their analyses? Maybe there’s some new software I can introduce to them that may boost their quality of life in terms of the way they handle their data?

Male, 25, not married - High school teacher at an urban school 

18k in 403b and 2k in Roth IRA - putting in 250 per pay to 403b and 50 per pay to IRA. 9k in savings.

I just started my Master's Degree program to become an administrator, so I have two options for payment IMO.

1. Cut my contributions to retirement in half and put them in a separate account for my tuition

or

2. Use my savings until it runs out, and then get loans. 

The loan amount won't be too bad because I have 3 semesters saved, and my summer job will pay for two more. So I am looking at around 3-5k in loans. If I cut my contributions in half, it wold take me about two years to get the necessary amount of money to not have to take loans. Is it worth it to stop saving as much for retirement if it means I don't get more loans?

I am imagining this has a lot to do with interest rates and growth rate of investment, but can someone more experienced than myself give me a little help?

personalfinance,2018 Retirement Savings Contributions Savers Credit,"When I asked about the Retirement Savings Contributions Savers Credit, I was previously told on here not to worry about it because I make over the limit (63k portrayed on link below). I just got my W-2 and it says I made 57k and 8k in federal income tax withheld. I maxed out my Roth IRA for 2018. I can’t find anywhere on this link if the 63k is for both my wages and federal income tax withheld combined, or just my 57k number. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Should I transfer a traditional IRA for a different account that has a higher interest rate?,"I had a 401k from a previous employer and it was rolled over into a traditional IRA with an interest rate of 0.35% and there is a $25 yearly maintenance fee.

There is only $1695 in the account and the interest it made last year was $3.57.  I feel like there are better options out there, but don't know where to begin looking.

personalfinance,Roll over 401k or cash out?,"Hey guys, 

So I just discovered that I have about $6k sitting in a 401k account from a job that I worked a couple years ago.  Was 25 at the time and didn't think anything of a 401k, but had no idea it had amounted to $6k.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is what to do with it.  I can cash it out, and face a 20% federal tax withholding, 10% early penalty and walk away with about $4.2k.  Another option, that I am less educated on, is to roll it over into an IRA(?) with potential to invest without the penalty off the top.  I've always been interested in investing, but never really felt that I had the capital to invest.  Now it seems I'd do better investing this money and not lost approx $1.8k to penalties and taxes.  

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have a personal experience with this and could possibly give me some helpful advice?  Thanks in advance.

Work and income situation: my husband is the consistent bread winner. He brings home $45k/yr. I work as a real estate agent and have a fluctuating income. On average, I would safely say $1500/mo. I'm also a part-time stay at home mom to a 1.5 year old. 

Debts:
Boat: $12,000 - monthly payment of $195 (can't sell as we're upsidedown on it for the next year, at minimum). Interest rate is 7%.
Two car payments: $6k owed on one (monthly payment is $152, 6% interest) $7k owed on the other ($190/mo and 18% interest).
Two credit cards: $5k on one ($180/mo @24.99%), $2k on the other ($70/mo @3% interest).

I also have 3 accounts in collections due to not having a good budget when I first became 100% commission.

Mortgage - $995/mo
Daycare costs - $1200/mo

personalfinance,Wanting to build a house (East TN area). How much should we save?,"I recently got a new job that pays very high for the area, and this allows us to finally get into saving for a home. I am leaning towards building because of how picky I am about everything that goes into a home. Especially in East TN where you see a beautiful house, but the bedrooms are all 7x7 ft, and the plumbing was installed in 1846 by someone's papi.

Here is a small blueprint that I drew up in regards to the home I would want to build. Leaning towards hard edge squares so that it can be added onto later (feel free to suggest turning it into a two story home, I am unopposed.)

https://i.imgur.com/sIY0jFH.jpg

This above picture is a very quick rough draft blueprint at what I would be looking for as far as size.

From my research I've found that it would be best to save $30,000 for a job this size. Of course I'd need to acquire property and pay appropriate fees. Is there anything I am leaving out here? I'm kind of ignorant to what taxes I need to pay, what documents I have to file, and any contracts that need to be drafted.

I'd probably go through a mortgage lender rather than my bank because my bank currently has shitty interest rates. I'm interested in living out in the country of Piney Flats, TN near boone lake.

personalfinance,Looking for Advice Moving Forward,"Long time lurker, I've found and used a lot of suggestions from this subreddit over the past few years, and for that I am VERY thankful. Now I feel like I'm at a point where I've followed the ""general"" advice typically posted here sufficiently well and need some specific help with my next steps.

​

About me:

Age - 28 (male, single)

FICO score - 775

Income - $105,000/year (working in stable industry, very low risk of unemployment for an extended period of time)

Cash in Bank - $20,000 ($15,000 in BoA savings account, seems to be a relatively low interest rate)

401k - currently $40,000 and contributing 10% of paycheck (no employer matching)

Rent - $1,000 per month (including everything)

Car - currently owe $13,000 making $350 monthly payments

Outstanding Debt - only debt is the car, no student loans/credit card debt

​

So my question is about what should be my next ""step"". As a young college graduate I didn't really care about saving money or thinking of the future, but once I grew out of that phase the long term goal has been to buy a house independently. I'm now second guessing purchasing a house since I really don't need one as a single guy and the average price of a house in my area is much higher than a lot of other places (around $400,000).

The credit union told me today that they would want my parents to be the main borrowers and me to be the co-signer. Is this normal? Are my parents being put into any more  risk by this? 

I put all my debt in an online calculator ([unbury.me](https://unbury.me)) and it says I can get it paid off in about 5 years, which is how much I have this loan for, but my current interest rate on all of it is about 19% and with the loan I could get it down to 10%. I have reason to believe that my job is pretty secure at least for those five years and I won't have a problem making the payments on the loan and maybe get it paid off early.

Current minimums are personal loan= $620 (33 months left, 10.59%), $325 (student loan, 18 years left, 3.25%), credit card min. $275 a month (about $9k at 12.35% and $8,800 on 0% until June). So, that is about $1220/month which leaves about $1013 a month which could go to debt repayment, car savings, and/or a car payment. * Edited to correct numbers 

I am not going to pay off the student loan early- it is as 30-year loan and almost all the interest is already paid (12 years in) so there is no benefit to paying it off early. So, that will remain a static payment.

Experian FICO 8 from a hard pull a few months ago is 750, but TransUnion Vantage score is reported shifting 715-720. I have about $140,000 in my 403b accounts- a mandatory 13% of my pay goes to that. I also have about $7k in a Roth, which hasn’t been in long enough to withdraw and is a combo college/retirement savings. 

So, here are the choices I am entertaining:
1)	Just keep slogging it out this way. In three years the personal loan will be paid off, in five years I should be able to knock out the other credit card, and although it isn’t a lot to work with, there is enough there to save for a car until the current one dies and pay a car payment after it dies if needed. This seems hard. I feel like I can do this for three years, but five is a stretch. Also, I will pay more interest, which seems dumb.

2)	Do a balance transfer of some of the credit card- I have a $10k limit on an empty card with an offer of 0% for 18 months, but it does have the balance transfer fee. I also don’t want to run it right up to the limit, because that will lower my credit score for car possibilities. And, I don’t want to have more minimum payments to juggle. But, it would stop that portion of the CC that is currently at 0% from going to 12.35% in June and lead to a bit quicker paydown.

3)	Looking into a loan on my 403b. I would have to call to find out how this works, as the information doesn’t seem to be available online. My job is stable (I have been here 12 years and am on my first year of a three year contract and I will almost surely be renewed). Not sure if I should borrow the full amount of the consumer debt or not if this is the route.

A little more info…
Got into this mess when we had higher expenses because kids were in daycare and I suddenly lost my 2nd job. Kids are no longer in daycare, and after 3 years without the 2nd job, I have negotiated increased responsibilities to get a 25% raise at my real job which got me about back up to where I was before, but now expenses are lower. So, if I can dig out of the hole, I should be okay. I have also been trying to do things for extra money like selling things around the house. I will pick up extra money where I can, but I do already work about 45 hours a week and have kids. I only work about 10 hours per week in the summer, but don’t have and can’t afford child care. SO also took over some bills that I used to pay but is now at the max of what he can do. 

So, am I missing anything? Which one would you do?

personalfinance,Help me with some Interest Rate math,"Local bank is offering:
1.35% for a money market account
But they will offer 2% if I open a checking account (no interest) with $2,500

What amount of money is needed in the 2% money market account to off set the $2,500 that is not gaining interest?

Here is the math I did:  100 * 0.135 = $1.35 (interest per year) divided by 12 equals 11 cents  (so thats the amount of interest generated per month on $100) - is my math done correctly?

Now if its 2%, then its $2 per year or 16 cents per month (using the same formula as above).

so $2,500 would get me $2.75 per month at 1.35% or $4 at 2%.
so its a difference of $1.25

Now I'm a bit stuck and not sure what to do with the numbers I got.

personalfinance,"Full-time student. Recently unemployed, advice needed.","Hi reddit, most of the info is in the title. I am a senior level college student pursuing a degree in Economics with a Concentration in Business Administration at an accredited university in a city with a relatively strong job market. I financed my first year of college through student loans, my 2nd and 3rd year through a lucrative job waiting tables where I was making over $20,000/year before taxes from tips alone. I was able to support myself with this income, as my parents co-signed and placed a down payment on a townhouse instead of renting an expensive apartment in this area.

This past December I lost my job at the restaurant. It was an unhealthy environment, and I think this change has facilitated a desire to really start looking for a post graduation career, so I don’t feel that it was entirely a terrible thing to have happened. However, nearly two months later I have burned through nearly all of my (admittedly rather meager) savings. I have a large amount of available credit, but I am concerned about the interest rates applied to the growing amount of debt that I have been accumulating on my credit cards from gas and grocery expenses. I don’t have the means to generate income until I either:

(A) Land a full time position upon graduation in May or,

(B) Work a part time position during the next few months as I finish school, with the potential negative impact on my final grades. 

I was hoping for general advice here, or maybe potential resources that are available to people in my situation. In addition to the above, tax season is coming in April and I would love to hear any advice for a student with the income that I had this past fiscal year. Last tax season I owed nearly $1,300, which is an amount that has caused me some concern. Thanks so much in advance guys!",finance

personalfinance,Canadian Tax: Is transferring money from RRSP to RIFF then withdrawing it to get Pension Income Credit a good strategy?,"My dad read this article for a strategy to set up a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RIFF) with money from your RRSP to claim extra tax credits. I don't know much about RIFFs and wanted to get any advice on whether this is a good strategy?

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure what relevant info is needed but my dad is a Canadian citizen, 65 years old, making about $45,000 a year, with no current plans to retire, and contributes a few thousand dollars to his RRSP every year.

&amp;#x200B;

**Article Blurb:**

&amp;#x200B;

Here’s how it works: You transfer $2,000 from your RRSP to your RRIF (check to see if your institution charges an annual RRIF fee). Then you withdraw that $2,000 from the RRIF. You’ll pay regular income tax on your withdrawal at first, but you’ll be able to claim the Pension Income Tax Credit, which will eliminate 15% in federal tax, plus between 4% and 11% in provincial tax. As a result, you’ll save between $400 and $500 in taxes each year, says RBC Wealth Management’s Allison Marshall.

&amp;#x200B;

If you’re in the lowest tax bracket you’ll effectively pay no tax at all on your first $2,000 in annual RRIF withdrawals. If you’re in a higher bracket, you’ll pay between $202 and $382 (federal and provincial) on that $2,000.

&amp;#x200B;

You could then deposit the $2,000 back in your RRSP, get a refund of the taxes you paid on the RRIF withdrawal, and keep the credit. Just remember that you will have to pay tax on that money later when you withdraw it again from your RRIF. This can be a good option for people like Powell, who is still working and might be in a lower tax bracket after retirement.

&amp;#x200B;

**Article:** [https://www.moneysense.ca/save/retirement/get-money-out-of-your-rrsp-tax-free/](https://www.moneysense.ca/save/retirement/get-money-out-of-your-rrsp-tax-free/)

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**

Recommendation if you're between 65-71 and not receiving income from pension:

1. Transfer money from RRSP to RRIF
2. Withdraw it from RRIF to take advantage of the Pension Income Tax Credit.
3. Put that money back into RRSP and claim a tax deduction

Reason: Government gives you a big tax break on the first $2,000 you withdraw from your RRIF each year.  

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice or resources would be really appreciated!

personalfinance,HSA Over Contribution: Reinvestment?,"A payflex rep was telling me about this strategy that would allow me to take my 2018 HSA over contribution and not pay tax on it or get a fee. I could not understand the exact details and I am unable to find more information about it on google; however, it seems like there may be some merit to it due to #3 below. 

What I recall from the conversion: 
1) If you over contribute to your HSA, fill out an over contribution form and get a check sent to you. 

2) Wait 60 or 90 days or call  payflex to have them void the check. 

3) The money that was being refunded never became income as it was never cashed in 2018 but is now being added as untaxed funds for 2019. 

4) Adjust your HSA contribution so do you not over contribute next year. So your HSA max minus your 2018 over contribution is your new target. 

This would avoid tax and fees on it. 

Anyone ever heard of something like this? 

From google, I read you can do 2 things with and over contribution:

1) Remove the excess contributions and the net income attributable to the excess contribution before they file their federal income tax return (including extensions). You’ll pay income taxes on the excess removed from your HSA. 


2) Leave the excess contributions in your HSA and pay 6% excise tax on excess contributions. Next year you may want to consider contributing less than the annual limit to you HSA to make up for the excess contribution during the previous year.

personalfinance,Help me understand Uncapitalized Interest.,"Either I'm missing something fundamental, or everyone on the internet is wrong. As much as I like to joke about having a huge ego, the first option is more likely, so please let me know what I'm getting wrong.

This is in the context of student loans, specifically Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and since I don't have any anymore, this is purely academic for me, but I'd still like to know.

As I understand, while you're in school, in the grace period, or in deferment, your loans are still growing, but the interest is not capitalized. You're being charged interest on your principal, and all the accrued interest gets thrown in the uncapitalized interest bucket where it sits and does absolutely nothing. You're not being charged interest on your interest.

In other words, your principal is costing you a 6.6% interest rate, but your uncapitalized interest is costing you nothing (0% interest).

Once you're out of your grace period/deferment, all your uncapitalized interest become capitalized. Now, both your principal and your capitalized interest are both costing you 6.6%.

Now, let's take a student that has found some money in his last year of college. There are three options on what he could do with it:

1. Keep it all in savings until the end of the grace period/deferment.
2. Pay down the uncapitalized interest. If the student has enough to pay off the uncapitalized interest, keep the rest in savings.
3. Assuming you have more than enough to pay off the uncapitalized interest, pay it off, and as much of the principal as you can.

Every source I've read online stresses the importance of option 2. If you have the money to do so, pay down/off the uncapitalized interest so that it doesn't capitalize.

I think that option 2 is the worst possible option of those three. You take your cash that should be earning no less than 2.2% to pay off a 0% loan, but don't do anything to pay down the principal that's costing you 6.6%.

I think that option 3 is the best if you can make a significant dent in the principal, otherwise stick to option 1. If you do option 1 and have a stable job by the time you need to start making payments then either pay a bunch of it down before capitalization to give yourself smaller payments, or immediately after capitalization to push the due date back. If you don't have a stable job by the time interest capitalizes, make minimum payments until you have that job, then throw money at the loans.

Now, I grant that there may be something psychologically helpful about getting a student to get used to pay off student loans early. It'll reinforce good habits to pay off the money they borrowed. However, mathematically, I don't see any advantage to option 2.

Furthermore, the sources that say to pay off uncapitalized interest include Sallie Mae (which obviously wants to get you pay back your loan so they make money), Student Loan Hero (which only states that your balance can balloon out of control if you don't pay your interest), and the Houston Chronicle ([which states that mortgages use compound interest](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/difference-between-interest-capitalized-interest-23512.html)). Investopedia gives a good definition of uncapitalized interest, but makes no editorial statement on the urgency (or lack thereof) of paying uncapitalized interest.

All in all, I think I'm right on this, right?


tl;dr: Uncapitalized interest is costing you 0%. Paying that off should be a low priority, right?",finance

Boss A had me fill out a W-4 prior to working. I have been paid thru him via direct deposit and have all my federal, state, Medicare, SS taxes taken out each paycheck like normal.

Boss B had me fill out a W-9 (which i had no idea about at the time). He pays me via personal business checks. The only taxes i had withheld from this were for SS and Medicare. 

I received a W-2 from each of them. I am a total layman when it comes to taxes, but i realize that i have not been paying any federal or state taxes from my income with Boss B. 

I went to file my taxes online and noticed something strange. I entered my w-2 info from Boss A and saw a refund amount. Then i entered W-2 from boss B and my refund amount dropped significantly. 

I am concerned that boss B classified me as a contractor and not an employee. But i am still puzzled why i received a W-2 from boss B if i filled out a W-9. 

I am an at-will employee for both - i signed no contract, paid hourly, report every day at the same time although the hours are flexible and technically can report whenever i need to if i have a doctor appointment or something like that, etc. 

Boss B filed taxes quarterly and not withhold any federal or state tax for me. I owe state tax because of this and my federal tax refund I’m getting a very small amount back.

I have about $143,000 in student loan debt (combined over 13 different student loans) with an average interest rate of about 6.65%, and about 9 years remaining on each loan (assuming I continue making the same payment every month). I make about $185,000. I have a credit score in the low 700s. I think I can refinance my loans into a 7 year loan with an about 4.7% interest rate. This will increase my monthly payments moderately (which I am ok with) and would save me about $22,000 in interest over the course of the loan. My only other credit accounts (outside of the loans) are two credit cards, which I pay down fully each month. I have had the loans from 5-10 years each. I have had the credit cards for about 5 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am worried that refinancing my loans will hurt my credit score, and thus my opportunity to get a large mortgage with a good rate. Because I live (and want to live) in a high housing cost area where a 2 bedroom 2 bath easily goes for $1.2 million, I am going to need a very large mortgage, even if I put 20% down. So the ability to get a good mortgage with a decent rate is important.

And isn't the average age of your accounts a small factor in your credit score? So won't my credit score drop? And won't the hard pull that is done to approve the refinancing also drop my score slightly? Given that my credit score is only in the low 700s, even if my score drops 10 to 15 points, wouldn't that probably result in either (1) a higher mortgage interest rate or (2) not being able to get a jumbo loan? I'm just wondering if the $20k or so I'd save refinancing my loans is not worth it if it will impact my ability to get a mortgage or good interest rates later.",finance
personalfinance,"$40k home equity loan at 5.9% interest, with $400 / month interest payments","Hello everyone, I am a bit of a finance novice here, and have not been able to figure out if my bank is somehow screwing me here or not.

A few months ago I took out a home equity line of credit to remodel the kitchen in my house. I calculated id need about $40,000 to complete the work, and was given $80,000 worth of credit as a home equity line of credit from my bank. I ended up spending about $41,000 on the renovation, and paid for it using that line of credit. After all work was complete, I decided to lock in a 5.99% interest rate on the loan, instead of leaving it as a variable rate, seeing as rates have been on the rise, and are unlikely to go any lower.

Now I am repaying this loan, and I am paying about $600 a month towards it. The loan term is for 10 years, and I want to pay it off early so I am paying more then the minimum each month. I went to look at the payments that have posted to the account, and noticed something that did not make sense. Of my $600, $400 was going to interest and $200 was going to principal (using round numbers for simplicity).

Now I thought this was too much interest, and according to every amortization schedule calculator I have looked at, these numbers should be reversed with $400 going towards principal and $200 going to interest.

Am I totally missing something here, because it feels like way too much of my payments are going to interest every month for this balance and interest rate. Is the bank correct, or should I start asking questions?",finance
personalfinance,Can someone ELI5 H&amp;R Block's 0% APR Tax Advance Refund system?,"To my knowledge, if I was to be approved for one of the four amounts ($500, $750, $1,250, or $3000) I would receive a pre-paid card with the funds available to be spent at my discretion or transferred to my bank account (a one-time transaction so I would need to move it all if I chose this route). 

I'll ask my question using an example:

If I was slated to receive a State + Federal tax return **total** of $2,000 and received $1,250 the day I file via the Emerald Card, is it correct that I would: 

(a) later receive my $2,000 tax return, at which time

(b) $1,250 would be deducted to pay back the bank which loaned the advance of $1,250 via the Emerald Card, meaning 

(c) I would be left with any unspent funds on my Emerald Card + $750 from the remaining tax return? 

I've read a lot of bad things about some of the tax advance programs, but many of the horror stories come from businesses that have a huge interest rate; however, H&amp;R Block advertises no interest whatsoever at 0% APR (*until Feb 28th*)

I originally figured this was a brick-and-mortar business' way of combating free online tax returns, but I want to make sure I'm not screwing myself out of my full tax return. I'm having trouble finding the downside in this so any info is appreciated.",finance

I’m a 29-yo software eng and have been going back and forth on whether to tap former employer’s 401k to wipe out credit card debt. I’d love a fresh start but am concerned about the long-term effects / penalties etc.

Current situation:
—-I have about $72k spread across three former retirement accounts. They’re averaging typical returns. 6-7%

—-I also have cc debt tipping $39k, however $11k of this is in no-interest promotion. The remainder ranges anywhere from 14-25%APR

—-Paid off car note

—-about $26k of low interest fed student loans remaining. 3-5%APR

Starting a new job with salary around $130k however it’s based in a high COL location where I currently pay around 3k a month for a small modest 1bd 

Should I halve the retirement account and wipe out CC debt , and then try to recoup by doubling or tripling my retirement contributions? What would you recommend?",finance

personalfinance,"Getting retired soon, needing some advice.","Hey PF.  Long time reader, first time poster.

So I'm in the military and am getting separated for medical reasons, I have 13.5 years in and i'm totally okay with it because I do have issues.

I am being given PDRL (Permanent Disability Retired List) at 40% from the DoD. So I keep my Tricare benefits, I get a retiree ID card. I don't receive a check from them like I did 20 years though.

Also, I'm getting 100% from the VA. Which will come out to $3691.17 a month for the rest of my life, tax free.  

The last 3 years I have grossed roughly $71k a year.  I have a mortgage, car payments, child support, child care, credit card. So I'm taking a large pay cut. 

My question is.  I have an option to appeal my DoD findings for a lower percentage and possibly get severance (under 30% is severance pay).  It comes out to around $69k after federal taxes withholding. I would keep my VA benefits but have to pay back the severance pay from my VA check, based on the percentage they give me, I would also lose my Tricare insurance, however my wife is still active duty and I'm still covered under her Tricare benefits.

The severance would pay our vehicles off and my credit card which would alleviate about $1400 a month in bills. And if I stay at home and do not work we will save on daycare which is $1060 a month.

Obviously taking insurance benefits, a check for life and running are good.  But paying down debt with severance is also a plus since I'm taking a pay cut and I don't have employment when I separate.

We are 25 and 26 years old and still trying to get a strong foothold in our careers. Both of us came from immigrant families that lived check by check so things like stocks, investing, bonds, savings, indexes, IRAs, etc. are like alien language. We want to start building good habits now. 

&amp;#x200B;

To get started, we are opening up a savings account with Discover. I know the interest rate is not significant but we want to just have the habit of putting aside money. The money we put away will also be our emergency fund. We're still building it.

&amp;#x200B;

In the meantime, we want to learn how to get involved with investing, retirment, etc. We've read some online as well as on the wikis of subreddits but are really looking for books. Can you make some recommendations?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I should start with insurance, retirement, or investing. I just hear co workers talking about how they made money investing in something and I'm like....""uh how does this work?"". Growing up, I looked at families who had some money (assumed by looking at cars, homes, vacations, colleges kids went to) and I just knew that they were smart with their money, meaning they made their money grow with their existing money. Kind of want to join the group lol.

personalfinance,"Need Moving Money, ASAP","tl;dr: I got a fancy new job, but I need to find $2500 to move cross-country ASAP and I don't want to sell my stocks at a loss; what do?

&amp;#x200B;

I work in the Video Games Industry, and just managed to secure myself a much better job in the Robotics Industry.

However, the new job is on the west coast (Bay Area), and the current job is on the east coast (Orlando).

&amp;#x200B;

Due to previous military debts, and some minor student loan debts, as well as a handful of recent emergency charges (surgeries &amp; car troubles), all my current credit cards (3) are very near their limit and my savings is pretty thin as well.

&amp;#x200B;

My current plan is to move just myself and my pet to the Bay Area and stay in a cheap AirBnB I've found until June when the school year ends, then my wife will move the rest of the family out so the kid doesn't have to miss any school. This gives me time to scout the area, find good housing, look at different schools for the kid, and save up a bunch of money for when everyone else moves, with my new shinier salary + moving reimbursement.

&amp;#x200B;

However, my estimate of how much I need for just MY move, I'll be driving on the 3rd through the 9th, is roughly $3500 (hotels, gas, food, and first month on the AirBnB). But I'm having a hell of a time locating the funds.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried applying for in increase on my 2 existing CCs, and I opened a 3rd. The 1st card declined, the 2nd I'm supposed to hear back on today, and the new 3rd card only opened with $1000 limit.

&amp;#x200B;

I DO have just over $5000 in company stock that I could sell in my ETrade account, however, I feel like this is my option of last resort, as Games Industry stocks are down right now, and I hate selling this at a loss.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any option to get some temporary money for this move that I'm missing?

**Edit:**

After checking around online, it looks like I can get a small personal loan through a few places, like Upstart, which would get deposited the next business day if I accept their offer before 5pm.

Is this a reasonable solution, considering I could pay it back in full on my first paycheck?

Example 4k loan through Upstart:**14.68%** *—* APR $4,000 $94mo

* 60 months
* Origination Fee: $238.16
* Total Repayment: $5,333

I could go lower than 4k, of course. 3k would be more than enough.

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit 2:**

If I do go after a personal loan, would it be better to use an online option like Upstart or try to look into bank options (Wells Fargo, Citibank, etc), or a Credit Union (Navy Fed, etc)?",finance
personalfinance,"Married, filing taxes and for the first time ever I owe. I have a few questions..","So last year I played around with allowances; I went from zero to 1 because I read that was the better option and for the last month of december I upped it to 2.  The goal was to receive as small a refund as possible. 2017 it was around $800 fed, state $100. Now turbo tax and credit karma are saying that I owe $549 fed and $148 state (when filing separately). Was adding an allowance that big of a deal? It resulted in like $25 more each check. How is such a small amount (and a small yearly raise) enough to drop me $1300 into the negative? 

Also, my husband's w-4 still lists him as single. Will this cause issues? (I already told him to get HR to fix it). 

When I do test runs, his return, filing separately, comes to $1000 fed (but he owes $80 in state tax). So, for this year we're going to file jointly and just take the $300 check I guess, but was there something I could have done differently? He likes getting a refund, I'd prefer not to (but I'm also not cool with a $550 bill). 

Whats the deal with ""Married but withhold at higher Single rate""? Should we be doing this? I used the calculator on the IRS site and it said we should be at 0 allowances withholding an additional total of $11 each check to break even. So should I simply do that and see what happens next year? I make 54k, he makes 36k (before taxes) no kids, not home owners.

Thanks in advance for any assistance!",finance
personalfinance,Sanity Check: Pay off student loan or do something else with the money,"Looking to begin aggressively paying off my student loans and want to know if this is a smart decision or I should take the money to be used and put it elsewhere:

&amp;#x200B;

Loan status:

Amount: \~$35k balance at a current interest rate of 6.370% (***variable rate***)

Monthly Payments: $650 (I can currently make these payments easily)

Current Payoff Timeline: 5 years 4 months

&amp;#x200B;

Frankly, my wife and I just started using YNAB (shoutout to r/ynab) and we're tired of looking at this amount.  We have a nice sized emergency savings, we're both contributing to retirement accounts to hit the employer match and a little extra (not maxing out the overall 401k/403b accounts though) and we have all of our extra savings in a high yield savings account with a rate of 2.1%. Due to work and our child, we're staying put in our location for another 3 to 5 years so this payoff money would be coming out of our house savings and feel that we could build this back up with our improved budgeting (again, thanks for YNAB).

&amp;#x200B;

Decided to post here mainly for a sanity check to see if this is a solid move.  The only thing really holding me back is thinking is it better max out our 401k / 403b's now (flip side to that is to do this payoff and use the savings each month to up our monthly contribution on a pretax basis to hit our max).

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance.

personalfinance,This is what 10 years of paying off student loans looks like.,"https://i.imgur.com/8XBWvdG.png

*Context:*

I graduated with a BA in Political Science in 2008 (great timing!). I spent the next two years of the Great Recession occasionally unemployed or underemployed. I made small token payments when I could, but had to rely heavily on forbearance to keep my debts from defaulting. During this time, accumulated interest began capitalizing into principal, which meant that despite putting some money into my loans, the principal owed largely stayed the same.

I finally got a job worth talking about in 2011, but quickly saw how near I was to my earnings ceiling. I decided to go to Grad School in 2013.

I worked in various temp jobs &amp; paid internships while a grad student and paid every spare dime into my student loans. After graduating in 2015, my first real job came with a 50% raise over my last pre-grad school job. Over the next couple of years, I got a couple of raises/promotions and am now finally in a financially comfortable position. I consolidated my remaining loans to a good fixed interest rate with my credit union last year and I'm on track to have my loans completely paid off in the next 3.5 years.

*Numbers to date:*

Initial Loan Disbursements: ($78,941.37)

Capitalized Interest: ($13,313.27)

**Total Interest Paid: $19,520**

Rebate Credits: $302.25

Scholarships: $8,500

Re-characterized Loans*: $10,646.09

Tax relief from Student Loan Interest Deduction: $3,218.88

**Total Principal &amp; Interest Paid To-Date: $79,368.47**

Remaining Balance in Dec. 2018: ($29,643.37)

*Final Thoughts:*

The capitalized interest was a huge killer. It ballooned my principal and accelerated the accumulation of interest. This kept me down during the most financially strained years of my early working life. A slight silver lining of the recession was the low interest rates that came with Quantitative Easing, which kept my variable rate private loans from accumulating even more interest.

The fact that I have paid more into my loans to-date than the cumulative initial disbursements were worth with $29K to go is discouraging, but I can at least see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Had I known the kind of long-term financial brake these loans were going to have when I was 18, I would have done things very differently. However, what's past is past and I can only control the present. All I can do now is take care of my debts, advocate for change to this terrible financial situation for higher education, and put extra money into my daughter's 529 to mitigate/eliminate her own financial burden if/when she goes to college.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading!

*By ""re-characterized"" I mean grad loan leftovers that were immediately used to pay down undergrad loans with higher interest rates. You can see this by the stair-steps up &amp; down in 2014 on the chart.

New UK fire blog [https://www.moneymage.net/mortgage-free-retire-early/](https://www.moneymage.net/mortgage-free-retire-early/)

May not be as applicable in the states, I am not sure, but in the UK I am not sure I agree with overpaying a mortgage so aggressively given historically low interest rates. In the UK you can heavily contribute into a pension for tax efficiency (up to £40K pa.) so it would make more sense to do that.

Seems to be arguing that  mortgage overpayment is the only way which isn't the case. 

Also misses that rental market allows flexibility in location for higher paid work. I am sure you can rent a tiny apartment in NY/SF/Seattle and earn big bucks, then move away. Also seems to not like the 'retire early' bit of FIRE.",finance

personalfinance,Trying to find a way to pay for multiple home repairs,"My AC unit just took a crap last week and apparently had been leaking in my attic which started causing leaking in my living room ceiling. 

Luckily my appliance insurance will pay for a new unit and the labor, however I have to pay for the new platform, gas permits, testing, etc. and this comes out to $1,665.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that, they will not pay for the water damage that was caused in my living room ceiling. And my roof (shake roof)  is beyond its last stretch of life and is being strongly recommended to be replaced before they install the new AC unit. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I am looking at having to pay the $1,665 for new AC, plus around $2,000 to get the living room attic replaced, plus another $10,000 - $15,000 to re-roof my house.

financialindependence,One observation from the (USA) government shutdown: widespread FIRE could give laborers more political power against exploitation,"I've been furloughed for 34 days due to the federal government shutdown.  One thing that has been shocking to me is the reluctance of ""essential"" employees (such as TSA agents) to walk off the job.  They haven't been paid for a month of work!  I've told friends and family I won't go back if I'm recalled, and I have the resources to do so.

Federal employees who are currently ordered to work without pay are prohibited by law from going on strike.  Depending on the agency, they have a few options for refusing to work, including sick time, annual leave, or a hardship exception.  But based on some conversations I've been having, a lot of them are fearful of walking out for any reason due to the potential harm to their careers.  Basically, they are fearful of retaliation.

FIRE savings are called ""fuck you"" money for a reason.  If you have a bigger cushion, you can bear the risk of taking a principled stand against exploitation.

Seems like this principle could work on a wider scale.  With the decline of unions in the US, and with our very stingy laws regarding paid, sick, and parental leave, FIRE could be a way to slightly tilt power and influence towards the worker.

personalfinance,Looking for Third Party Opinions...,"Hi Everyone - 

First off, thanks for taking the time to read this! I tend to think I have a good head on my shoulders, but I'd like to see if outsiders have any other perspective I may not have considered. Thanks :) 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start by saying I've always been very money conscious, my 401K has been invested at 10% since I started working, and 17% of my net income has always gone straight into savings, and I have some stocks and bonds that I monitor. I'm only 25 years old, so I certainly never had tons of money laying around, but I was always comfortable and had plenty of emergency funds. My family recently had a really really bad situation and unfortunately a ton of the financial burden (mortgaging a new house for a year and a few months, on top of my rent for the apartment where I live) fell into my lap and majorly depleted my savings/checking accounts. Not looking for any sympathy - just want to get things squared away moving forward. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because I had all these unexpected expenses my Savings/Checking accounts are now down to a balance of about $2,200. I had always paid my credit card bills in full, until this situation when one of my cards gave me a 0% APR rate. I now have a balance of about $4,000 with a 0% interest rate through Nov 20th 2019. 

&amp;#x200B;

I no longer have the extra costs starting in March, so my new expenses per month are as follows:

$1,200 - Rent

\~$150 - Utilities

$368 - Car Payment (still have a year and half on this, reliable Toyota RAV4 purchased at a good deal, hauls all my kayak and bikes around regularly so trading for a cheaper car not really an option I want to consider) 

$92 - Car Insurance

\~$120 - Gas

\~$200 - Food

\-$70 Gym Membership

&amp;#x200B;

My net income per month is $2,824. When I move, my income is going up significantly, so I should have about $3,880 net per month to work with. My rent will stay near the same, if anything would drop by $100 - $200.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my question - I am relocating for work in April, and I am getting a $3,000 check for this. I essentially have everything I need to bring, and can do so with the help of family and friends for about $500 as opposed to hiring a service. My gut reaction is to take the check from the company to help pay down my credit card, and then after a few careful spending months (but before I lose the 0% APR in Nov) I should be able to pay the remaining around $1,500 balance off and not have any credit card debt left. The advice I am getting from some family members is to put the $3,000 partially into a new couch for the place (currently don't have one) and put the rest into my Savings fund, and just put more towards the credit card each month. Because it is 0% I understand the logic there, but think I would feel better about the situation if I didn't have any looming debts over my head. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just looking for some opinions. Thank you!

personalfinance,"I scuffed the rim of my leased car - should I pay to fix it now, or include it in the damage coverage amount at the end of the lease?","Hi everyone,

I'm a college student who commutes to school. Today when I was driving there, I was waiting to turn in the right lane, someone cut close in front of me and I moved the car to the right and curbed my front wheel. Still obviously my fault, but I'm not a terrible driver, I promise. It's not horrible in any sense, but it's a big scuff on the edge of the rim (6-8 inches long around the circumference). 

I work part-time, and so I will definitely pay for any repairs to the car. However, it's a leased car I share with my parent and so it's relatively new making the repair expensive ($350 for a factory rim, $40 for installation), and apparently because of the kind of rim it is it can't be repaired without replacing it.

I don't know how exactly the lease inspection works, but I know there's an inbuilt cost in the lease to cover any of these sorts of damage at the end of the period. That being said, should I pay for the repair now (now as in when I save up enough to do it) and get it over with, or just count it as part of the coverage with the lease?

Thanks.

I'll post a picture when I am able to get to the parking lot, I'm currently sitting in class.",finance
personalfinance,Best way to payoff credit card debt,"Hey guys, so I’ve accumulated quite a lot of credit card debt over the past year (\~$9400). I furnished a new home this year and put all of those purchases on a credit card with a 15 month 0 interest promo period, with the expectation to pay it off before it ended. 

To make a long story short, I was relying on a bonus this year from my job to cover paying off the entire balance of the card, but for various reasons, that bonus is not coming. 

The zero interest period on the card is expiring in March, and I’m trying to create a game plan for paying it all off this year, without incurring a ton of interest. I’ve thought about applying for another zero interest promo period card, and transferring the balance over while I make monthly payments large enough to pay off the card before it expires, but because I’ve opened a few new accounts this last year already, I’m not sure this would be the best option. 

I’ve also seen services like Payoff where they essentially loan you the amount needed to pay off your debt at a fixed interest rate that’s lower than most credit card APRs, but opening a loan account seems like a dumb way to payoff credit cards. 

Any tips would be appreciated! I’m cutting out a lot of my monthly expenses to free up some income to knock this out before the year is over, just want to figure out the best way to pay it down.",finance
personalfinance,"Was given roughly 10K, what is my best option?","After the death of my Grandmother I found out she gave about 10K to each of her grandchildren. I'm trying to weigh my options for what would be the most prudent thing to do with it. I have what feels like enormous amounts of debt, so my first inclination is to pay some of that off. My parents have advised me to use it to buy a house, but I don't know if I'm in the best financial place to buy a house, not sure if I want the responsibility yet, and I may go back to grad school in the near future.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a rough breakdown of my current liabilities:

60K in student loans

25K in private loans, 5% interest

35K in federal loans, 3ish to 6ish % interest

Additional private loans for debt consolidation

18K at 17% interest

9K at  17%

Auto loan

28K at 6%

Credit cards

10K on various accounts between 0% to 16%

No real liquid assets, but do have 401K/403b, roth-IRA and the like totaling about 31K

Roughly 80 to 90K per year in gross income. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know....I'm not proud of my financial situation at all. Helpful advice appreciated.

Bitcoin,Personal TA: USA Federal Offices in shutdown since the 15th of December - look at them charts 🥺,[deleted],cryptocurrency
personalfinance,My 22-yr old sister has $10k of student loan debt on a credit card,"My younger sister just came to me asking for financial help (i.e. money) because she is struggling to make minimum payments on her student loan debt, which she *somehow* put on her boyfriend's credit card. She said they began to struggle with the payments because her boyfriend lost his job (one of his jobs?) some time ago and the debt is really destroying his credit. As far as I know, he works part-time as a teacher/coach and she has a full-time job.

**She has about $10k of debt on a Discover Cashback card, which has a 21.24% APR.** This really hurt me to hear because I actually work at a financial technology company and know the dangers of debt! Also she borrowed a few hundred dollars from me a few months ago to buy a vacation cruise for her boyfriend... She paid me back pretty quickly.

Here were my thoughts on how to help her by making her first take responsibility over her finances (I don't really want to provide her with a FULL personal loan from my savings because I don't know when she can pay me back and there are opportunity costs with me loaning that much cash to her):

* 1) Increase your income. Start looking for a part-time job. Both you and your boyfriend.

* 2) Create a budget and reduce your spending. Know where your money is going and come up with a realistic amount to put towards your debt every month and stick to it.

* 3) Find a loan with a lower interest rate to pay off the credit card. I'm actually not sure how this works since I've never had to do this nor have I had any unmanageable debt / personal loans. Would appreciate any additional thoughts / advice here!

I was thinking that as I see progress from her that she's putting effort into improving her financial health, I can loan her $2k at a time or so to help her get on top of the debt. I would appreciate any feedback to know if this is a bizarre approach to take with her!!

I DO NOT need any advice about how she should create a budget nor do I care to share what her actual cashflow looks like, I would just like to know if this sounds like a reasonable approach to help my younger sister out! I believe her when she says she is struggling with debt and I don't believe she spends excessively.

For reference, we live in different parts of the country so I don't see / talk to her that regularly.",finance
personalfinance,2018 Illinois state tax return status in question,"Hi,

I'm wondering if I am okay to move forward with filing my 2018 tax returns with one of my state returns seemingly still in limbo.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background: I grew up in IL, moved to MI for school and have only worked in MI - never worked in IL.

2016 was my first tax season and I filed federal and state returns (only in MI), everything was accepted.

2017 was my second tax season - I also filed federal and state return in MI like the previous year and it all got accepted.

&amp;#x200B;

However, for some reason I was somewhat confused whether or not I needed to also file in IL due to still being a permanent resident there, technically, even though I never worked or made any money there. The return was rejected, and they said that I needed to print some form out with certain small changes being made to it and to send it somewhere to have it changed before being accepted. On my TurboTax account page, it changed from Return status: ""Rejected"" to return status: ""Printed"" some months ago, but I never received any notification about it being accepted officially, even though I'm sure I wouldn't get any returns since I didn't make any money in that state.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: what is happening to my IL return, and am I ok to proceed forward with filing my taxes for the 2018 year, or is there something else I need to do first? Would I get in trouble if I didn't reconcile this, or is it essentially meaningless since I have never made a dollar of income in Illinois?

personalfinance,"I know, I know, ANOTHER budgeting post- HOW do we budget? So defeated.","Ok, so I've been searching for budgeting tips, guides, apps (just d/l Mint but ...wat...?), subreddits, replies, literally everything, and it's almost too much info to process. I (we) legit need help with trying to figure out how to and how much to budget with my and my husband's income. We don't budget now, love the idea, but have no idea how to jump in. Like, do we make a budget category for each expenditure (dog food/meds, gas for cars, car maintenance, etc.)? Do we lump it all into one? How much do we budget for each? Ugh. We usually just end up putting everything on credit and paying it off either that week or latest- end of the month. Need new tires? Ok, Costco, here's $750. Vet bill, $400? Ok, here you go. Ugh. 

We have only one installment of debt- my car note, and some retail (AMEX plat and USAA credit cards) maybe totaling 5k combined- we typically pay these off every month (well amex we have to), but usaa very close each month because we try to use them almost as debit cards so we amass points. We have a joint checking for bills (autopay) and a joint savings, but otherwise have separate ""day to day"" accounts.

We live in a very high COLA area (D.C.)- but have chosen to live in the 'burbs in a different county (Prince William) because my husband has a southern commute and I have a northern commute. We're about smack dab in the middle of our respective places of employment. He's in the military and I'm a Fed (and very, very fortunately not furloughed). I feel like we never have to ""worry"" about money, but I know we need to be doing *better, much better.*

The sitch-

Me:

$86,000 gross (this includes $18k tax free) a year; however, I am getting a raise in May, putting me at $99,000 (still including $18k tax free)

I currently put 17% of my paycheck into my TSP which equates to \~$900/m

Really, it comes down to- after my taxes and what not, net pay of $4600, so \~$55k net/annually

Husband:

$76,000 gross (including $23k tax free for housing \[BAH\])

\-puts \~17% MONTH into TSP (as high-3, not blended), about \~550/m

His net is about $5300, or \~63k net/annually

&amp;#x200B;

We have the following bills (and if you guys see something that we should adjust- holler! I have no idea how much we *should* be spending vs actual)

Rent- $2100

Utilities (water, gas, sewer, electric)- \~$200/m

Car note- $350/m (2.99% with org. 19.5k loan, have 13k left)

Vanguard- $400/m to admiral

Fidelity -$400/m to something like admiral lol

Car insurance (just mine)- $508/6 m. (SUV, good driver, no accidents, with USAA, but I feel it's high?)

Rental insurance- $16/m (USAA)

Personal Property ins.  (rings)- $22/m (USAA)

FIOS Internet- $65

ATT/cell- $160/m 

Netflix/Hulu/HBO/PS4- \~$65

My med ins- $110/m

Grocery- i have not idea- but we probably spend too much, including eating out- maybe $900-1000???

Gas- we both fill up our tanks weekly- so probably $400-450/m

Car maintenance- no idea how much we should budget 

Dog insurance- $179/m for a senior perfectangelbaby and a 4 y/o getintoeverythingthenshiteverywherebecausehehasallthegastroissuesGermanShepard

Dog food/med- $125/m

We really like to travel- like, really really. We're the couple that ok, so we wanna find a cheapo flight to Denver to go snowboarding for the holiday, ok! Go surprise my little sister at her apartment for Thanksgiving because she can't afford to fly home? ok! We're here! We are more the experience type people than tangible things (though when Nordies has a pair of Prada's on sale for $100, sometimes I just buy). 

I'm sure I""m forgetting 4,326,888 things. I just am SO confused on how to start, what to do, how much to budget (do we do a cash thing like Ramsey? Do we put all expenses on our joint checking? Merg. It really leaves me so defeated. I know we're frivolous (me \*much\* more so than him), but I know, truly, I am disciplined enough to make and adhere to a budget- I just need to know where to start.

financialindependence,[Trophy Earned!] Positive Net Worth!,"**TLDR**: From the age of 21 to 25, I spent way too much money as a young professional, saved no money, and incurred way more debt than I needed to. While I regret some decisions, I made, I wouldn't change a thing, because I've learned so much from those mistakes. I've learned to use credit in an effective way (travel rewards, etc.) and how to live well beneath my means as I pay down all that debt I took out. Today, I can finally say I'm feeling slightly above worthlessness!

https://i.imgur.com/1B7RXZY.jpg

Background:

As you all may know by my one other post, I've been lurking in /r/financialindependence and r/personalfinance for a long time now. Over that time, I've been able to learn so much more about my finances, how I should handle them, and why I should view them as a tool to set up a great future for myself and my SO.

**My story**: Prior to discovering these two subs, I was always somewhat knowledgeable about personal finance, but I kept making mistakes. 

When I graduated college in 2013, I had $15K in student debt and landed a job paying $35K per year. Well, I just had to keep up with the Joneses, so I decided to get a certified pre-owned 2011 Honda for $15K at a 6.99% interest rate! I know! Looking back at my 22 year old self, I want to slap him in the face for even thinking of going to a dealership.

Thankfully, I was able to refinance the car at a rate of 4.25% just six months later, but that car purchase was the first of many mistakes that I made. But by the end of 2013, I had $30K in debt on a $35K salary...not a good look

Three years and a couple meager raises at work later, I decided to go to back to so that could boost my earnings. While I don't regret that decision, it piled on another $10K in debt. So by the end of 2016, I had about $40K in student loans, debt on my car (which I refinanced again at a rate of 2.99%). All on a salary of $50K and no emergency fund. And that lack of an emergency fund came back to bite me in the second half of 2016. 

I blew out my left knee in June of 2016 and had to undergo reconstructive surgery which put me another $4K in the hole. Given the fact that I was making slightly above minimum payments on all my debt, all progress I made on my total outstanding debt that year was effectively wiped out. So by the end of 2016, I was still $45K in debt, but I had a modest salary of $55K. 

At that time, I thought to myself enough was enough. I wasn't going to get anywhere with my debt if I didn't make sacrifices. My family has historically been bad with money (whether it's blowing every last dollar earned, having no savings, or going along in life without making a budget). I wasn't going to let that happen to me.

I moved out of my apartment in downtown and found a place to rent 25 minutes outside of town at a much cheaper rent price. In addition to that, I stopped going out to eat every other day at lunch and then again on the weekend (I had no clue how much of a hole those costs were burning in my wallet). Lastly, I sat down and made a rock-solid budget...every dollar was to be appropriately accounted for.

With those changes set in place at the start of 2017, I had a goal in mind to pay off all $45K of my outstanding debt by the middle of 2020. Getting used to all those changes at once was much more difficult than I expected, however, it was all worth it. Being able to pay down my debt and finding ways to have a good time with less was a challenge I accepted and really overcame. 

My SO noticed the change, people at work noticed the change, and my family noticed the change. I kept telling them, that it will all be worth it in a few years. To be free of all my debts and not have to worry about missing a paycheck would be a much better feeling that going to vacation in Hong Kong, Australia or Disneyland every year.

By the end of 2017, my debt was down to $35K. However, the very few assets I had (my car, my retirement accounts, etc.) amounted to $15K. At this point, I wanted to get even more aggressive with my goal. I went through my budget one last time and found a couple hundred extra dollars to put towards my debt in 2018. Additionally, at the end of 2017, I got a raise up to $62K. I was not going to let lifestyle creep get in the way of my goals, so every single cent of that raise was allocated towards debt.

Though there was a lot of sacrifice made in 2018, it was worth seeing that outstanding debt number dwindle lower and lower, while seeing my net worth number slowly creep up. By the middle of 2018, I relocated to a low COL area and got another raise. Of course every cent of that raise went towards my debt. By that time I was able to live off of $2,500 a month (everything excluding debt), while putting nearly $1,000 a month towards my debt.

By the end of 2018, I was oh so close to a positive net worth (I blame the volatility of the market in Q4 2018), but I knew I would get there in January 2019.

And as such, as of two hours ago when I received my latest direct deposit from work, I hit the positive net worth milestone with about $1,500 to spare. It may be a small milestone, but I'm so damn proud of it. Growing up where I did and seeing my family make much worse mistakes than I made, makes this so much sweeter for me, because I'm still in my mid 20s and have my best days ahead of me.

So with that said, I wanted to thank everyone here in r/FI, r/PF, r/frugal, and r/leanfire for posting such great content over the past two years as I've made this radical change to my lifestyle. All of you redditors and the team at ChooseFI have motivated me so much to pursue wealth and financial independence. Though, I'm just starting on my journey, the first milestone is out of the way.

They also don’t even plow the snow and ice in the parking lot. I slipped in the parking lot right in front of the daycare while holding my child and hurt myself a little. So I decided we need to make a change and find a better environment for our child. We found one that we like and would like to start soon, but they said they need to keep the deposit as we haven’t stayed with them for 6 months. Is this a reasonable request from them? Should we just eat the $1,300 loss? Regardless I don’t feel comfortable that my child is left on floor for many hours a day without being taken care of.

personalfinance,"I'm trying and failing to participate in my local Utility Discount Program for low income families, and I don't know if I can prevent a power shutoff","TL;DR: Catch-22: the Utility Discount Program that would save my ass and keep my power on does not allow retroactive participation. My income qualifies and was variable in 2018, so I couldn't provide documentation of eligibility in advance. Is there a loophole or similar program for someone in my situation?

Backstory: 

I live in a city bordering Seattle, WA, and my power is supplied by Seattle City Light. My water/sewer/garbage are included in my rent, so my only utility bill is electric. I was let go by my employer after over 4.5 years of employment at the end of Mar 2018 when my position was dissolved and outsourced. I had about 2 months of expenses in savings at that point, and was in a depressed, anxious, scary bad place mentally by the time my employment ended. I couldn't bring myself to re-enter the same field, so I decided to try making a living with my hobby at 24 with no seed money or adequate savings (I can hear your groaning and eye rolling from here, and I know I was in no position to attempt self employment). After a lot of fruitless effort to get my business up and running and a lot of ""whatever it takes"", I'm finally on track to become self sufficient by March of this year. Until this point, I've used up my savings, sold used items, and gotten help from family I helped out back when I was in a better place to make ends sort of meet. I also used up my $1.5K credit limit, and I'm not willing to apply for a second card. I plan on waiting till im self sufficient and getting a no interest credit account to pay things off over a year without accruing more interest. All that to say, I spent all of 2018 not knowing what my monthly or annual income would be and only had predictable pay and documentation of pay for the first quarter of the year.

Utility Discount Program:

I paid my (expensive) electric bills through May 2018. After that, I didn't have any way of paying and have racked up a debt of almost $550. My apartment has baseboard heating, large aluminum frame, single pane windows, and a hot water leak that wasn't repaired until this month, so my efforts to save electricity have had limited effect on the cost. There is a utility discount program that reduces the price by 70% if you fall under the income limit they set and can document your income in your application. I applied for the program requesting retroactive participation for 2018, documenting my varied income month to month, and explaining my financial situation for the year. I've been told that they do not allow retroactive participation despite that fact not being noted on the application or any documentation I've found about the program and it's policies. They said the discount can only be applied to future billing 1-2 cycles after approval (4-6 months). It's highly unlikely that I will still qualify in 4-6 months, and it would have been impossible for me to prove my qualification 4-6 months before Jan 2018 despite my income qualifying for all of 2018. 

Is there any local, state, or federal entity I can contact that could help me through a different program or help me retroactively qualify for this program? I can't afford to pay anything at this point while still paying rent for February, and a power shut off will make it exponentially harder or impossible for me to keep my business going and have any form of food to eat. I can't afford to eat prepared or fast food and I can't cook or refrigerate ingredients at home without power. I've mainly been eating rice with soy sauce or lettuce with dressing, and I can't cook rice or store lettuce without power.

I know I've royally fucked up this situation, and I should have to pay full price. My last Hail Mary will be asking SCL for a payment plan that gives me until the end of Feb to pay off most of my balance and hopefully get my tax return for Jan-Mar '18 in Feb to make that possible, but I don't know if they'll allow a payment plan without a down payment. If I could get the UDP discount retroactively, my payments from 1/18-5/18 would more than cover my total for the year, so I was really hoping that would be possible now that I have documentation of my varied income.

I feel like a spoiled/choosy beggar for even asking for help with this (hence the throwaway account), but I don't know where to go from here. If you have any info or advice on how to get out from under this, I'd greatly appreciate it!",finance

So just like many other millennials I went to college, without realizing that I couldn't afford it. At the time I didn't understand debt and salary potential of my chosen career (social services). After school I worked low paying jobs for about 6 years, and then went to a tech bootcamp. Now my salary is 43k, but my ceiling is significantly higher.

The debt: 
Most of the debt came from my original colleger loans, though I took out an additional 10k for the bootcamp. While I was working after college I put off paying student loans, because I didn't think that I could afford them (usually making &lt; 30k) so interest has built me up to where I am now. I'm starting to repay on all my loans, and I'm just not sure how to cope. I have a mixture of federal and private loans across 5 different institutions all with different interest rates. I'm looking a way to get some sort of handle on it as I can't afford to give each lender the 250 per month that they want, and if I go any lower I feel like I'm just covering the interest.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,spring cleaning and found Series EE bonds,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

Mom was doing some spring cleaning and found 5 Series EE bonds:

&amp;#x200B;

|Bond #|Original Amount|Purchase Date|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|$50|1993|
|2|$50|1993|
|3|$100|1993|
|4|$100|1994|
|5|$200|1994|

&amp;#x200B;

So I will be turning 26 this year which makes #s 1-3 about 5 years away from reaching full maturity. My mom also found a little brochure that explains the 4% compounding interest rate semi-annually and different issues affecting taxes but nothing about redemption. I checked an online calculator from [treasurydirect.gov](https://treasurydirect.gov) and it looks like they're worth about $660 as of 01/2019.

Question: should I hold onto them until they reach their 30-year maturity date? I'm seeing varying responses both online and on reddit about their interest rate and just want to make the most of it. Even if it was $500 cash it could help right now but figuring I want the best value even if I have to wait a bit.

**edit: for background info, currently out of school, working full time, just over $70k salary, contributing 7% into company 401k.**

I don't have any other investments at this time except my company 401k and a small Sofi Wealth account made up of a few vanguard funds. My Ally savings is getting 2% which is probably where I'd put this if I redeemed them now.

personalfinance,Removing Serious Delinquency Before 7 Years?,"Long story short, I took out loans to pay for freshman year of college. After I finished year 1, I went and lived abroad for 6 months. Having just turned 19, stupid me didn't realize as soon as you withdraw from school the payments begin.

&amp;#x200B;

After living abroad, I come back home to a stack of collections papers. I turn my phone on (I used another phone while international), and there's dozens of missed calls from FedLoan and debt collectors. My parents gave me a lot of  privacy growing up so they didn't bother to tell me I had debt collectors hunting me down. They just took any mail with my name on it and threw it into my bedroom until I returned from my trip.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 2019, 3 years later. I've graduated from college and getting my feet into this whole ""adulting"" thing. My credit report reports a serious delinquency. Back in early 2016 I tried calling FedLoan to explain the situation, but they said nothing could be done since they attempted to collect the debt so many times. I don't mind waiting 4 more years for it to drop off, but I wanted to know if it is possible to get this removed? I hate checking my credit score and seeing ""SERIOUS DELINQUENCY (160-190 Days)"". Makes me feel a piece of crap.

Is it worth calling back (3 years later) and trying again? I've enrolled back into college so the payments are still deferred for the next 1.5 years.",finance
personalfinance,ELI5: how did the new tax laws affect us? (USA),"For 2017 we each claimed married+multiple exemptions and were able to itemize. Our federal refund was $95. Assuming there would be a potentially significant difference for 2018, we both changed to married and 0 exemptions at the beginning of 2018. I knew the 2018 standard deduction was going to be higher than what we typically have for itemized deductions. But I guess I didn't understand and did not plan for the elimination of the personal and dependent exemptions and what impact they would have. We are still waiting for some forms/statements to come in but we could be looking at a significant (to us) federal tax bill (over $1500).

I tried to do my homework but obviously missed some things (or misunderstood them). Is there a simple (ELI5) explanation of what the tax law changes did to us? I don't want this to turn political of course, hoping to get educated.

In 2017 we paid our property taxes before Dec 31, 2017 to be able to claim it on 2017 taxes knowing we would not come close to the new standard deduction in 2018. Our deductions in 2017 were $21k but that included $2400 of property taxes that normally would have been paid in 2018. Our 2018 deductions were $15k (paying the 2017 tax bill in 2018 would have bumped it to $17.5k).

Seeing that IRA contributions made before April 15, 2019 can help us now, is that something to consider or should we just go forward with doing more for 2019 taxes by increasing contributions to 401k and/or opening an IRA? What other things can we do?

personalfinance,balance transfer question on credit cards,"I have a little over 8k in credit card debt ranging between 18-24% apr, I have been trying to aggressively pay this down but obviously the interest payment each month hurts. I applied for a Citi card with 0% apr for 12/mo with a 3% initial fee of total transfer amount. It had a 2k limit, so with the fee I was able to transfer a little over $1,900 (from the 24% card, which will now have a $0 balance come payday, woohoo!). 

I was hoping for a higher credit limit so I could reduce my monthly interest rate further while I pay this off. I wish I knew what the credit limit would be before submitting the application, not after, but it is what it is. Should I keep applying for cards with this 0% apr on balance transfers for X/mo with the rest of my 6k-ish debt? It definitely seems worth the transfer fee so long as there's no annual fee after that. 

Just curious what your opinions are. Is having too many cards a negative even if the overall balance doesn't change, just gets shifted around?",finance

personalfinance,We got offered to take a Voluntary Severance at work at I'm at my wits end on whether I should take it or not,"Trying to determine what the best course of action is here. The company I work for, pulled in 300 people with the word manager/director/executive into a call this week and stated:

&amp;#x200B;

""We understand there may be people who don't want to work here and don't want to help with the future of the company. If this is you, we are offering the chance NOW to take a Voluntary Severance package. If this is not you and you want to help with the future of the company, please ignore the agreement and considered yourselves employed going forward. Only 50 people will be allowed to take this and you have 45 days to decide""

&amp;#x200B;

Now before I start, it is a long post, I will say I don't mind being there. There is a LOT of work to do and I've been involved in some major things to help improve the company and will be doing so this year again. However, it is overwhelming at times and I'll get to that in a moment but will share the rest.

We all got the offers within the same day and it was for 3 months, it was based on years of server and job title/salary with cap on the title/salary.  I've been there almost 20 years but for me it was based on salary of course as I am a Manager. The did not include ALL managers though and wish it did not include me as the type of manager I am is more of a technical role and last year, I asked my boss if he could help me change the title and get rid of the manager behind it since I did not feel comfortable with him and I having the same exact title (obviously he never did it). Customer Service type managers were excluded in this, due to losing so many employees the past 2 years through 6 rounds of layoffs which I have survived time and time again. Obviously my big concern here is that there will be a huge round of layoffs following this and I won't be offered or given this during that. I suspect the company is weeding out more people to try and sell itself to a larger corporation or vendor that they deal with. They are owned by an equity firm. With that said, the wording of my severance package is:

&amp;#x200B;

""Payment of $19,683.42 (being 12 week (s) of the Employee's salary at the time he or she submits the letter of resignation) less applicable federal and state deductions and income tax deductions required by law. The payment of this 12 week (s) of salary shall be paid in periodic equal installments according to the regular payroll of the Employer begging after March 9th, 2019""

&amp;#x200B;

3 months just did not seem fair to me, and I was expecting 6 or more based on my years of service so I'm a bit surprised here but understand the cap. My boss, who also got offered the same exact deal,  begged me not to take it because he needs me for the ride and flat out said he can't do it himself. The company is offering to pay the 3 months of COBRA insurance at the current cost of what we get now. They are also offered a free 2 month ""Career Transition Program"" as they coach you through finding a job and what to do with resumes, where to do job searches, updating LinkedIn Profiles etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess my big questions here: Should I take this or not? Or should I chance it and wait until closer to the end of the 45 days to decide and see what happens between now and then and risk 50 people out of 300 not taking it by then? Additionally, what is the likely thing to happen afterwards? Based on their wording, they did not sound like they were hinting at a layoff and just giving this to folks who just don't want to be there. But in the same sense, I know it's the customer service managers that actually want to leave since they are basically ""stuck"" now due to the position they are in.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is keeping me here:**

* The money. Without this money, it will be extremely difficult to pay off $50K worth of credit card and loan debt. I recently consolidated into two loans which will be paid off in the course of 5 years, and this was done just last year. It is saving me about $600/month though so I see the extra in my savings which goes right towards important bills and other debt. If it was not for this, I'd have to live off the 3 month severance + 401K cashout which would actually get me close to 9 months of living (just in case) like I had a ""day to day"" paycheck. My debt is better than it was 2-3 years ago but still a bit to go. I just don't know what happens if I can't pay debt any more and I'd hate to file bankruptcy, as that definitely looks bad on a job search.
* Remote work. After so many years of traveling 40-45 miles daily EACH WAY (in my state that's easily 2 hours on the road in the morning and another 2 in the evening),  I have been fortunate enough to work remote 90% of the time the past 2 years. It's VERY helpful for me and I can get a LOT done this way. I also have a leased vehicle with a very limited amount of miles on it. 10K in a year. I'm actually just above 6K now due to me being remote and that 1 year mark hits in March, so I do not think it would be more than 10K by then.
* The People. Ironically, I like my co-workers and my boss too and his bosses as well. The people who report to me as amazing and just such hard and good workers. They are just as overwhelmed as I am with the work they do and I don't know what I would do if one of them quit and found another job, but I would never be able to handle their work. That is a big fear of mine is that something happens to one of them and I just don't know how to handle or even do some of the work they have (I spent a lot cross training but it's never enough and we've reduced in staff). They are all remote workers and I talk with them daily about issues while trying to manage my own work. However, that fear can also be enough reason to push me out the door.

**What can push me out the door:**

* The work. I'll be honest, the job is overwhelming. I'm responsible for a huge part of the company where it generates easily 100+ million in revenue over the course of the year. If it ever goes now, then I'm dealing with a chance where I will never be able to recover from it. On top of this, imagine you are in a room in the middle and 3,000 people are screaming at you asking for something at the same time. This is exactly my situation. Last week, in 1 day alone, I was asked to do 35 different large tasks. I wrote them down as they came to me and determined each task was one hour long. That's 35 hours worth of work and this is what I get DAILY. I can't even offload it or designate it to the people who report to me because they get the same amount. Our 8-10 days easily turn into 16 hour days on many days. We can't even automate it all. The work will only be more and get worse due to lack of resources. They may offer us off-shore resources, since they seem to be going this way lately, but it definitely won't help. The company's thinking is ""We can hire 5 off-shore resources to do the work of that 1 person and it will still be cheaper""
* My Health. This is one that I'm not sure belongs here but I'll explain. On one hand, having health insurance is very important to me. I deal with a chronic illness and fortunate for me, it's treatable and my treatments are in the form of a clinical trial that does not use my insurance. Unfortunately, those end, so there is that chance it can end before I have health insurance again and now I'm stuck trying to find ways to get treatment. Luckily for me, it goes until 2021 should an adverse event take place, I need health insurance. Additionally, last year, for the 2nd time in my 20 years I've been here, I thought about suicide and how about death was a better option then the work I'm doing. The last time I considered suicide was driving home a few days back in 2011 when my old boss was an utter jerk to me and pressured me to just do too much. Thankfully, lots of friends talked me out of it and helped me get the help I need. Those thoughts stopped after 2 weeks last year and I feel like I'm in a ""better place"" mentally now more than ever but this is always in the back of my mind. Then there is all the anxiety, constantly checking my phone throughout the night to make sure I look at the emails and make sure nothing is going on and then thinking too much about ""what is coming up tomorrow and what I have to do"" when I go to bed. It's like this daily and I can never live a normal life because of it. I'm also extremely out of shape and nowhere near what I used to be. Think 50lbs overweight and I'd love this time to at least get myself back on track to get healthy again and get back in shape.
* My Home life &amp; Feeling Burnt Out. I guess this goes hand in hand with the above with health in some ways.. I am in my early 40s, never married, no kids, live on my own but have a great support system through family and friends but in the same sense, I am often ""doing it by myself"". There are days, though, because of the work, I just can't do it by myself and have nobody to really physically help. There have been times where I have not been able to bathe or change my clothes for 3 days straight due to getting up, going right to work at 7am and not stopping until 10pm. In many years, I've never had a normal job here where I could come home and just not have to worry about my work until the next day. I'm always worried about it, day and night, due to the type of work I do. Meanwhile I see friends who end their work life, go home, have a happy home life and get to spend time with their significant others and kids and that is what I want but I can't get that because my job stops me from it and the only way I can do it, is if I put the job on hold and do no work at all. There are times when I have not done dishes or laundry for 2-3 weeks. I've missed out on so much in my life and experiences as well due to all this work I've done. I've often dreamed about taking this break, if anything, just to get my home life back on it's own track. Ideally, what I need is a ""break"" first before going back to job hunting. The severance would allow me to do this, as it would lead into a planned/paid vacation I have already and I can start with the extreme job hunt after that. However, only 3 months severance is risky here.

Anyway, I came here for extra advice to see what everyone thinks. My family and friends say ""Don't take it, look for another job in the meantime and see if you can find one closer to the date so you can get severance as extra paychecks as well if you can still take it in March. Also find one closer to home"". Obviously, a lot easier said then done but with the extra paycheck that would have huge tax dollars behind it and may put me into another tax bracket, so I don't know if that is the smartest move but I do agree about finding another job especially witch so much uncertainty now. I'll respond back to some messages/questions later today as I need to go finish up my taxes now.

personalfinance,"Downside to not owning a home, long-term?","I am 34 and make $91k per year with a fairly stable job working for the federal government. My situation is that I live with my girlfriend of 10 years in a home that she owns outright (no mortgage). I pay no rent; our unspoken arrangement is that she pays the property taxes and utilities and I pay for ""everything else,"" such as groceries, meals out, concerts, vacations, etc. We are both happy: she would have to pay her taxes and bills regardless, and my ""expenses for us"" do not come close to what a monthly rent or mortgage payment would be in our HCOL area.

We have no plans to get married, which is her preference. In my view we should get married if nothing else to make things easier in the future if someone gets sick, etc. But whatever--that's a r/relationships issue. My question here would be the same if we were married and had a pre-nup under which we would keep our own assets in a divorce.

That question being, I obviously have a sweet deal right now living rent-free with her, but is there any downside to not building equity in a home myself? I am just envisioning, if we split up in 10 or 15 or 20 years, that would be pretty late in life to take out a mortgage, it seems to me.

My thinking is, it makes more sense just to invest my extra money. If in 5 or 10 or 20 years I needed to pay for a place for myself, I could either rent using my income, or use my invested money to put down a hefty down payment (or conceivably buy something outright, I guess). Buying a property of my own now just as a back-up plan seems like an invitation to a lot of stress and hassle. As someone once said, ""Your investment account will never call you at 2am because a pipe is leaking.""

I max my TSP and IRA every year and generally have money left over to add to my taxable investment account. I feel I am in a very good and fortunate place, but I am just wondering if anyone thinks I am risking anything by not building equity in a home of my own. Hopefully we will stay together forever and this will be a non-issue, but I know this sub favors self-reliance so I am interested in others' thoughts.

personalfinance,Question about W2 and employer not taking out state tax.,"So I just received my W2 from a previous employer I had in through the third quarter of 2018. I had put down 2 allowances on my W4, which are visible, but it appears that my employer did not remove any state tax (im in california btw).

&amp;#x200B;

When entering information online to file my taxes, I realized that there wasnt even a number in the box that should have shown how much state tax was taken out. I logged into my ADP, and it appears that not once was state tax removed.

&amp;#x200B;

So, to my question. Is there any reasonable action I can take to mitigate the money I will seemingly owe the state. Some people close to me have suggested I see a tax professional to sort it out, and to see if they can wiggle anything through deductions, but im not entirely convinced that would even balance out. How much would a tax professional cost vs the amount I could potentially save?

I guess with my current situation, Im trying to figure out how I can reduce or break even instead of paying out the wazoo.

financialindependence,A couple problems with FIRE,"The notion of retiring early is rather attractive to me, as it is to most millennials, but I have a couple of issues with it. Maybe y'all can clarify what's wrong with these arguments against FIRE.

***We're financially incentivized not to retire early***

Most of us live in the USA, a country with very progressive income taxes. This progressivity inherently incentivizes us to work more years, not fewer.

You pay much less in taxes on $50K gross earned each year for 10 years than you do on $500K earned in 1 year: $72K vs. $176K in California.

If your gross income is proportional to hours put in, then you should seek to spread out your hours in time as much as possible in order to minimize your tax burden.

***FIRE limits one's positive impact on the world***

When I'm fed up with my job, I feel like there's nothing that I'd like more than to be able to quit and be done with it - I'd much prefer, say, chilling on a beach in Hawaii than working more.

But on reflection, responding this way seems almost unethical.

&amp;#x200B;

My thoughts:

&amp;#x200B;

Get a roomie, get a second job, but even calculating that doesn't cover minimums for CCs. 

Refi using equity to get out of debt?

bigger 401k loan? he's not going anywhere and makes decent money with this job for where we live.

&amp;#x200B;

I think snowball is the only appropriate method. He wants to go on a friends trip this year. He has so many bad habits to break. 

&amp;#x200B;

My idea time wise is:

&amp;#x200B;

1. quit smoking or switch to vaping (smokes 2 packs a day, vaping is much cheaper)
2. stop eating out but one meal a week (would be a huge difference)
3. This doesn't even bring him to making enough to pay for all his minimums on his CCs.
4. Tax Return for smallest balance card.
5. part time 2nd job and roomie to pay off next lowest balance CC's

OR does he do a bigger 401k loan (sigh) or even crazier, a refi to get equity out of his home?

&amp;#x200B;

I worry because he hasn't addressed these spending behaviors and probably needs to see a mental health professional? I dunno.

personalfinance,Questions about 1098-T form. How should I treat taxable scholarship income?,"My wife and I both work full time and have W2 forms from our employers. 

I plan to file my Federal taxes using Credit Karma (no state tax where I live).

I am confused about the Education Credit. My wife attended school full time for most of 2018. She earned scholarships of around $12k (box 5 1098-T) in the form of Pell grants and a few private scholarships. She had qualified expenses of about 9500 (box 1 1098-T plus a few hundred for required textbooks).

She did not receive a W2  from her university, only the 1098-T.

Should I create a separate W2 (in credit karma) and list the $2500 difference as ""wages, tips, and other income"" with the employer being her school?

Do we still qualify for the $2500 American Opportunity Education Credit even though her scholarships exceeded her qualified expenses?

Should we claim the entire scholarship amount as income? 

I expected a refund of around $2500 but the education credit represents half of the return, increasing it to $4900 per credit karma. Our only other deductions are 2 small children and a few hundred in student loan interest (plus standard deduction).


All this is making me think I should go to H&amp;R Block or something, I dont want to screw up.

personalfinance,Leaving a federal job.,"I have been at my federal job for three and a half years now and have absolutely hated my entire time here. Since I have friends/family/coworkers that don't understand why I would leave a federal job to go to state, I will explain it first before continuing. I have an extremely demanding job with manditory overtime and what I feel isn't enough pay for the work. Also, the biggest factor is the new job offers free schooling and plenty of opportunities to move up or switch craft/careers. I feel I am not a typical millennial and afraid of hard work, but I can't stand being abused. 

That being stated, in the last year and a half I've contributed $3,500 to my TSP. I have an option to withdraw withhout penalty and looking here for advice. I was thinking i have the option of withdrawing and putting it towards a 401k that I'd continue to contribute to, put it towards a mutual fund, or leave it be. I don't know a whole lot about mutual funds so not to clear on how good of an investment it is compared to starting the money off in a 401k.

personalfinance,Tax Help for a huge bonus that I have to return,"Disclaimer : People have advised against TurboTax because I am an international student, so TuboTax generally doesn't work perfectly. People recommend something for students called Glacier Tax which is paid for by our school.

I was interning in 2018 in New York. I was supposed to join the firm Full time in Feb 2019, but decided against it. I was paid a joining bonus in last week of December 2018.

I received only 60% of the bonus amount, and paid nearly 40% (22% fed tax, 7.6 FICA, 9.6% state tax) tax on the bonus received. The firm would want me to return their money including the tax that they paid, which means I'll have to pay them back more than I have in my account today.

 Now the complication is, which forms do I need to file what? The second complication is that they withheld FICA tax, which isn't applicable for me since I am on Student Visa. From what I read online, I can approach the firm and ask them to return my FICA tax that they withheld, but now that the year has changed, would things be more complicated? 

I believe the bonus would've increased my income bracket too. Before the bonus I had made close to 25k in the year, and now suddenly my annual income was 60k.

I've read online that people can refuse to pay the company back joining bonus bla bla, but I don't want to go down that road. That's not my money, and I would want to give them all of it back.

**TLDR** : Received bonus in December 2018 for joining the company in Feb 2019. However I have decided against joining them back. 40% of the bonus was withheld in taxes, and now they want 100% of the bonus back.

So I preordered anthem on PC after making sure that I would be able to cancel the preorder after the the demo. Bottomline, I enjoyed the Anthem demo a lot and AT THIS TIME intend to buy the game, likely on release date because I will be bored with no other games that I am really interested in playing at the time of Anthem’s release.

Background: I’ve played a good amount of looter-shooter games. Destiny 1 &amp; 2, The Division, Warframe. So far, I regret nothing about my purchases…except maybe Destiny 2. The only games I have preordered are all Assassin’s creed games since 2014 and Division 1. I regret nothing about those pre-orders either. I am a student and have very limited time to enjoy games.

I know EA has been pretty shitty especially in the recent years. However, I really like the way Anthem is looking. I know this is the demo, and loot drops will probably get nerfed a la Destiny 1 demo to full release transition. I expect a lot of positive and negative changes to be made. Someone give me a good reason that I to cancel my preorder that I cannot argue with.

Im told its for the retirement and the benefits, but when I run the basic numbers, it doesn't seem that desirable to me, especially when I compare it to my private sector friends making much more both in take home pay and in matching 401K contributions from their employers.

My parents were obsessed with federal jobs, and how they were the golden achievement of their time.

I see according to the FERS calculator:

Top three ( assuming I make 100,000 at top three ) x 30 years x 1% = 30,000 a year ( of course we would need to adjust for  inflation )

I dont actually see 2,500 a month meaning that much for 30 years of service.

personalfinance,Tax Question Regarding 1098-T,"I'm filing my taxes for 2018 and I'm comparing two tax services (TurboTax and TaxFreeUSA).  After entering my educational expenses on both sites my returns for each site are drastically different.  TurboTax gives me a federal return of $1500 while TaxFreeUSA gives me a return of $2500.  Each tax services asks about my educational expenses a little different and I think that's what is causing my return to be so different.  

TurboTax was fairly straightforward while TaxFreeUSA seemingly asks the same question multiple times and I get the sense that I'm double or triple counting certain expenses and scholarships.  

For instance, TaxFreeUSA asks if I ""received any Pell grants, scholarships, or fellowship grants for educational expenses paid during 2018"". I've answered this question about 3 times so far and as an experiment, I've used different numbers for each question to see how it changes my return.  I would think that the answer to this question should just autofill based upon my answer the first time, but that's not the case and  I can't figure out why it needs this information this many times. I know my 2018 form 1098-T didn't include some tuition from 2018 so I've been going through my student bill, but at this point, I don't feel confident that my tax return is going to be accurate at all.    

Then when I get to the section about how much of my grants and scholarships went towards room and board it says that ""You told us that you had **$XXXX** in Pell grants and scholarships that were used for room and board or other noneducational expenses. Be sure to include this amount below. 

Enter any taxable scholarship or fellowship grants you received, not reported on a *Form W-2""*

Is this supposed the be the difference between something?  Would it not be the difference between the amount used for room and board and my total scholarship and grants??  But it says to include room and board so I feel like this is basically asking the amount I received for my scholarships and grants which I've answered multiple times already.  I'm really confused. My only scholarships and grants were received through my school and through the VA since I'm a vet.

---

I make a little over $15 an hour as a Visual Merchandiser at IKEA. My raise is only 3% a year, and there's no promotion I'm interested in. (See edit) I've kept an eye out for a better paying job, man I don't see one.

I have: a debt consolidation loan through BestEgg, 18k in high interest credit card debt over 2 different cards, and only 4k remaining in student debt.

I have tried and failed to qualify for a second debt consolidation loan to stop bleeding out from interest. Last week I successfully applied for a 0% interest balance transfer card. It only accepts $750 in balance transfers, and it's interest free for 15 months. A drop in the bucket and I didn't want another card, but I'm struggling so much with this interest I had to try.

My credit score is 680. I have never been late on a single payment. I've been struggling with this debt for years since leaving a financially/emotionally abusive husband, and I'm exhausted. Because I live paycheck to paycheck, I sometimes feel I have no choice but to use the high interest card for emergencies (plane tickets to see sick relatives, for example). I have *nothing* in savings. Saving feels impossible and has for years. Sometimes I'm late on my rent. I don't own a car or a computer, but bankruptcy still feels like a bad idea.

In September, my debt consolidation loan will be paid off. My current plan is to apply for another debt consolidation loan at that time with the hope that it will lower my interest charges and whittle down my debt more.

I live a simple life and I don't need to feel wealthy. I'm frightened of retirement, and frightened to have no savings.

I am so open to advice. Lordy. 

**Edit:** Thank you so much for all of the good advice! I feel I have a clearer sense of direction now. 

My parents live across the country and both are in poor health - sick is a classy way to say possibly dying, so for my life priorities that does indeed qualify as an emergency. And no, I'm not going to take a management job that would make me miserable every day for the sake of paying off my debts more quickly. I see the burnout rate and I'm not interested. It is already a balancing act to keep my body healthy enough to earn income, let alone adding that level of stress for a few bucks an hour.

But I appreciate the guidance about different approaches to managing debt. You've been very helpful, thank you so much.

**Edit again:** I was trying to avoid this type of share, but - I have several chronic health problems that make taking a second job or adding to my stress more of a risk to my earning potential than it's worth. 

I understand all of you who are reading my story and calling me lazy or spoiled, or unwilling to leave my comfort zone. I already have FMLA coverage for days when my body won't let me get out of bed, and although I can't afford to use them I often have no choice. I don't know how else to say it - my body creates very real limitations for me. Yes, that gives me discouraged emotional reactions about my livelihood.

I've used a friend's computer to look for opportunities to work from home, and I can't find anything that justifies the debt of buying a computer. 

I was raised an only child on a farm, adopted by older parents who didn't have much. I have worked since I was 16 years old. In college, I worked three jobs in addition to attending classes full time. I always had savings before I got married. My clothes are all from thrift stores. I live in a shared space situation that costs me only $450/mo, incredible for Philadelphia. I eat red lentils, roasted vegetables, and rotisserie chicken. People at work comment about how I always bring my lunch and it's always the same, lol

There is not a promotion merrily dangling in front of my face that I am too good for. To clarify, part of why I am not interested is because I am not qualified. My current payband is the same as any management position I could compete for within the company. IKEA has made drastic paycuts.

No, I'm not scrolling through Indeed with Princess Face saying no to jobs that ""aren't good enough"" for me. I literally can't see a career path I feel qualified for where I can make more.  I have been a janitor, a server, a tick farmer, a graveyard shift shelf stocker. I am not too good for things, I never have been.

Someone mentioned working in insurance - I'll look into it. I never see posts for that type of job online, I'm not sure where exactly I should look.

I hear a lot of people saying I should file for bankruptcy. I'll look for a lawyer I can speak with.

personalfinance,Need help starting out with my retirement plan.,"Hey there everyone!I  recently finished college and got a job that actually has benefits and  I'm really confused since all the paperwork was given to me on day one  and is expected that I submit everything really quickly. That being the  case I have a few doubts and find myself in a position where I have no  one to guide me or who I can ask questions. I was wondering if anyone  could give me a helping hand so that I can make the best decisions  possible?

So for the sake of simplicity  and protecting my information I won't use actual numbers but use  something close when asking the questions hope that doesn't make things  difficult.

So let's say that:

1. I'm 25
2. Have $0 in retirement.
3. Current  have about $1,000 left in student loans debt. (I haven't saved for  retirement since I kind of took jobs during college to make sure I could  tackle all of my student loans)
4. Will make $100,000 a year.
5. Have monthly expenses of about $1,500.
6. Could max out my 401k, IRA and HSA
7. My employer has a match for the 401k
8. No dependents, medical issue, etc
9. No other debt

So my questions boil down to the following:

1. Can  I contribute to a 401k and IRA at the same time? Could I max them both?  Could both of them be traditional and be used to help tax wise?
2. Is  it smarter to go for a Traditional or Roth variant of these? If having  both is a possibility would it be smart to have a Traditional 401k and a  Roth IRA or just both in Roth?
3. When  you contribute to a Roth type of account does the taxes get deducted  form the amount going in? (For example if I contribute $19,000 will the  account get $19,000 and I pay the taxes out of pocket or will the  account get $19,000-Taxes?
4. In  the event that you can have all 3 (401k, IRA, HSA) should I max them  out? or should I just max the 401k to the match point, max out the other  2 and save the rest elsewhere?
5. I  know for the IRA we get a bit more freedom with the amount of  investments we can make but how can I know if the ones offered in my  401k are worth it? (I could list them if someone would be willing to  give me their perspective)
6. Is it worth it to have my 401k managed and just pay the fee? or should I do it myself?

I  would really appreciate the help I'm new to this and don't want to make  too many mistakes since I hear a lot that the best time to save is  while you are starting out. Will appreciate any and all help.

I'm Canadian but spent most of my career working in Australia.

What I have:

- 50% in Australian superannuation that I cannot access until I'm 60. 70% Australian equities, 20% bonds, 10% cash
- 10% in Colonial First State Australian equity funds outside of superannuation.
- 10% in Canada. 10% vanguard Canadian equities, 10% vanguard US equities, 80% vanguard fixed interest
- 20% in Vietnam corporate bonds @9%
- 5% in Vietnam stock market just for fun
- 5% in Vietnam cash deposits @5%. This is about 3 years living expenses

Capital preservation is my main worry. The October to December run last year hit my Australian equities pretty hard. Most of that is locked in for the next 7 years so I'm confident things will recover by then.

I'm exposed to Vietnam inflation/exchange rate. The state bank seems committed to 4% inflation but interest rates here are climbing. We are coming from double digit inflation not that long ago. Australian exchange rate is my most exposure right now.

What would you do differently?

Any other risks that I am exposed to and how would you hedge?

Anything I need to know about investing in Vietnam? I can't own property here but my girl can which would be another risk to have it in her name.

TIA

Edit: thanks for the genuine concern about moving to Vietnam and marrying a local girl. That part of this plan that I am confident in.

gaming,Frustrating Ubisoft Support Experience,"Hi!  Sorry if the format gets all weird and my grammar is not the best, not native speaker and I'm on mobile.

A few days ago I got my girlfriend Just Dance 2019 for her Switch. She was really excited to play since she loves dancing. 

Everything was going okay, we were already aware that there is the unlimited subscription and i was going to gift it to her once i had the money and it was then when we noticed that there is a free trial offer for a month and she decided to test it. On her end it looked like she had it active and running.

When she goes to see all the songs she was supposed to be receiving she noticed that she still only had the ones included with the basic version (51), the other 300+ were nowhere to be seen and the timer for the trial was still running.

Since I work for Tech Support in another game company so I kinda know the drill when things like this happens. I was positive that this was just an entitlement issue but i decided to perform some troubleshoot first, reset the cache of the system, update the switch and game, set another pair of DNS and when none of those issues fixed we reinstalled the game.

Since I was sure this is an entitlement issue I told her that we should contact Ubisoft for this and they should quickly fix it. Little did I know that getting to contact them in a live chat was something next to impossible so we just started to contact them through the case offer they have on the website.

Once I get in contact with them after a day we submitted the case a fella told us to first submit some pictures of the subscription and the songs not appearing and after that that its a connectivity issue, I was like no its not but still was open to try it. After we were changed to a second agent all of the sudden, we proceeded to do a portforward and he told us to send screenshots to confirm we did it right and that it did not worked. I opened the ports necessary they display on their website (80 and 443) but it did not fixed it. At this point i was fed up.

After that we were switched to a third agent which advised us to do a DMZ on the switch so it could open the ports, thats when we started to get a little annoyed by this since the portforward would have fixed the same issue if a dmz was the solution.

I told her that and that everything points out that its an entitlement issue. The next message was the one that almost made me go insane.

A fourth agent gave us what basically is a full website of basic troubleshoot (ie turn off the console, reinstall game) as if he does not have access to the previous messages

I do not want to ve the annoying customer over a free trial but damn something so simple was made basically an Odissey

personalfinance,Wanting an outsiders perspective on some credit card debt and our next steps?,"Seeking a little help here....

We racked up a little credit card debit. Balances rounding up to the nearest thousand:  


Card #1:  12,000 @ 18%  - only use this for our payment plan for medical bills.  Medical bill that hits this card is $250/mo - and we usually pay $300-400/mo on this card.  


Card #2: 6,500 @ 25%  - been paying $300/mo here estimated.  Had this card paid off, but racked it back up when our child was born.  


Card #3: 10,000 @ 18% - paying minimum balance here.  Do not use this card at all!  


Card #4: $800-$1000 balance depending on month - no interest here, pay it off monthly and use this one for our weekly spending.    This is our low limit card.

Credit scores are still in the mid 700's for both of us.  My student loans are paid off, wife's are not.

We do have $3,000-4,000 stocked away in a savings account for an emergency fund that is readily available but stays untouched.  Also have other funds that we could touch, but not without penalties (CD, Retirement, ect) that we do not want to touch unless a dire emergency.  We do have equity in our home too, but would rather not impact the house at this time.  


Do we look at doing a personal/consolidation loan to attempt to lower the overall interest rate?  I'd consider a balance transfer card, but not sure if we'd get a high enough limit to make a big enough dent - and not sure if 12months at 0% is long enough to really do what we need here.   


Just seeking some outsiders advice on which direction to take!  Just want to make sure we're doing this the right way.",finance

personalfinance,Can I adjust my W-4 at work to take better advantage of the American Opportunity Credit?,"I just started focusing on my education again after graduated high school almost ten years ago. I was looking into potential tax credits and what I might qualify for. I was looking at the American Opportunity Credit but wasn't sure if my idea is as simple as it seems or if I'm missing something somewhere.

So The American Opportunity Credit states that only 40% of the $2,500 credit is refundable ($1,000). Since I'm already getting a refund on this years taxes my assumption is that I would only be able to take advantage of 40% of the credit for next year (in order to offset my education costs). If I adjust my W4 so I pay less tax throughout the year would I be able to use up more of the credit that is not refundable in order to offset it?

Basically, if I use this years tax return as an estimate for next year, my $2,000 in education expenses will only net me a $1,000 return on top of my existing expected return. BUT... If I adjust my W4 so I would OWE around $1,000 instead of getting a return, then the credit cancels that out as well as refunding me $1,000.

Possibly helpful info:

- I work full time, 40hrs/wk. Swing shift so plenty of time for morning classes

- Started going to a local Junior College this semester

- 10 credits this spring, planning on taking 10-12 in the summer and fall

- I plan on transferring to a CSU for a Bachelor's Degree after 2 years/60 credits

- Current refund is going to be $738 Federal, $99 State

- Estimated cost of tuition+books for this year is $2,000

- First time I would be utilizing Federal aid (including scholarships, FAFSA, other educational tax credits)

- I make around 45k/yr

- Same employer for the last 3 years

- Located in Sonoma County, California

personalfinance,"Currently in a debt restructuring program, am I making the wrong decision?","Background: I am 23 and have about $28,000 in debt. These are all multiple credit cards with large limits and high interest rates. I have a son and I am a full time student with no job. We are living with my parents who are very helpful but would never pay off this debt. 

I decided to try and get approve for a debt consolidation loan to reel this in but I wasnt approved because my credit score has gone down due to the balances being at nearly 100%. I was approved for a debt restructuring program though. Basically I pay them each month and they contact the creditors to get them to lower my balance. This also means the creditors are getting their money faster.

Fast forward three weeks and I noticed that my margin interest balance is higher than expected. I call and find out they had removed my margin rate exception the day after I got it without notifying me resulting in me paying a higher interest rate. In addition, I checked my balance today and the total amount I owe in interest is several hundred dollars more than it should be even with the standard interest rate.

personalfinance,"$24k in credit card debt, $10k in savings. What should we be doing?","We have somehow found myself in a ridiculous amount of credit card debt. I personally had $8k in credit card debt that I had been chipping away at. We arrived at $24k in October by blowing our wedding budget by double (please don’t tell me how stupid this is- I am well aware). All of the debt is on one card, our other credit cards have $0 balances. We realistically have about $800-900 a month we can apply toward paying it off. The interest rate is 22.6%

We have $10k sitting in savings which is our rainy day fund. I have realized that it is silly for us to have this money just lingering so-to-speak with such high credit card debt.

My question is how much of this should we put toward this credit card? We know we don’t plan on draining our savings but we are having trouble deciding on a reasonable amount to apply toward this debt.",finance
personalfinance,How much of an emergency fund should I have?,"Preface: I’ve broken this post down into three parts of increasing length to hopefully make it easier to digest. Thanks in advance!

Main question: How much of an emergency fund should I have?

Medium sized question:

I know the book answer is 3-6 months of necessary expenses. But how do I know where I should fall in that?

I think I’ve set myself up pretty well trying to follow the PF advice here. As I’m turning 30 this year I have a little more than 1 year’s salary saved in retirement and continuing to add to my employer sponsored 401K plan. I bought a home I am renting out for about $500 more than the mortgage and I’ve just bought a second home. Both my fiancé and I have stable full time jobs with similar salaries and no children (unless you count the dog). 

6 months of mortgage payments alone would be roughly $24K. That much in cash just seems nuts! And that’s not counting any other expenses like food, vehicle, medical, etc. 

When it comes to an emergency fund, should I treat things individually (one fund for one house, one for the other, and one for other life expenses) or can I think of a more combined cushion? If the latter, do I need 6 months of total expenses or can I start to assume that it would be highly unlikely for both my fiancé and I to lose our jobs and have the renters walk out all at the same time, thus lowering the amount of emergency funds required? If so how much? And lastly, while not the first resort, I’ve heard mention the potential of a Roth IRA to be used as an emergency fund. How should that be considered?

Here’s my background:

I’ll be turning 30 this year, just ended my career with the Navy in Sept of 2018 and started a new job in CT as a Safety and Training Officer as a chemical plant making $100K before taxes.

I have two retirement accounts: the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) which is essentially the military’s 401K where I have a little over 100K saved as of today with a roughly 50/50 split between Roth and traditional retirement accounts in a 2050 target date fund (I’ll be 60). Having more than my current annual pay, even after the 2018 dip, I feel pretty good. Separately, I have another Roth IRA in a 2045 target date fund (AROIX) with a current market value of 33K (20K are contributions). 

Before separating from the Navy, I bought a house in Fernley, NV, with a 30 year conventional loan with a 4% fix interest rate coming to $955 per month. It’s now being rented out through a property manager where I net $1440 per month after the property manager takes their 10% cut of rent. The deductible on the house insurance is about $2K. I created a savings account that only has the monthly transaction of Rent in and mortgage out each month and have built a savings of $4400. That savings account is now earning 2.2% APY. I do not take any money out for personal gain, expecting that sooner or later, something will break, and I’ll need to repair it. So far it’s simply gone up in value about $500 per month. Is there a point I should consider taking that $500 per month out and invest it in something more?

After separating from the Navy and moving to CT, I bought a house with a 30 year VA loan with a 4.375% effective internet rate with a monthly payment of about $3K per month. Once again, I’ve set up the same type of savings where I deposit $750 per week and withdraw the $3000 per month to do just slightly better than breaking even, maintaining a $6K buffer of additional funds. 

Last bit of background. I am engaged with a fiancé who makes a similar income and we split our bills pretty evenly. Thus we are living the Dual Income No Children (DINC) life, at least for another year or two, but children are likely in our future before too long. We’ve taken on about $30K in debt on 0% credit cards with some initial home improvement (Hardwood floors, fence for the dog) and wedding expenses. We have full intention of paying it off before any interest hits.

Now that I have fully exposed myself, what say you? Thanks for all the help!",finance
personalfinance,"US: 23 years old, $50K in savings, 17K in personal investments (index funds), ~20K in 401K and company stock. About to move out of parents basement, need advice for what to do with my money in the “real world”.","Hello! Thanks for visiting my post. Need some advice on a few different topics, feel free to ask for clarifications or details within reason. Sorry if there are any dumb questions :)

I'm a 23 year old living on the east coast in a nearly high to high COL area (think Boston, Washington D.C., Miami levels of COL). I've lived with my parents since I started working full time and have saved up a nice nest egg of funds. I’m fortunate enough to have no debt and my monthly expenses total around $30 currently, so the idea of a budget or watching what I spend is something I haven’t had to think of until now. Since I'm getting ready to move out I’d like advice regarding how I should target my investments and budget. 

**Salary and Rent**

I'll start with my current salary, which is $84,000 with a 4-8K bonus per year depending on performance. I'm hoping to move jobs within a few months of moving out to increase my salary and make the cost of rent hurt less. My target salary when I move is around 95K or more. What should I target for my rent costs? I've read that 30% or less isn't necessarily the ideal rent target anymore as prices for housing in many areas have risen, but should I still try to meet this target? I'm hoping to find at least 2 roommates to lower the overall cost of rent, hoping for around $1000 or less in rent costs if possible. Currently rent in the nicer areas around me (that are still public transport accessible and near restaurants, bars, etc.) are anywhere from $1,200 to $1,800 depending on amount of roommates.

**401K and Losing My Unvested Employer Match (Also ESPP)**

Currently I have a 401K that has a 6% employer match, however if I leave the company before June 2019, I'll lose any funds that aren't vested (around 7K currently). Would an increase in salary to my target mentioned above be worth losing that 7K company match? I'd keep the match that I own and roll it over into a small IRA I have set up. Personally I'd rather leave the company sooner, but if it's well worth it in the long run to stick around and keep that match, I will consider staying. I also have an ESPP that I have about 4K worth of stock in. This ESPP gives me a 15% discount on stocks of the company that I purchase (only while working there, of course). Should I cash that out once I leave the company or sit on it? In terms of 401K investments moving forward, should I still target 6% or will I need to lower that investment since I'll have more ""short term"" expenses? (rent, food, etc.).

**Savings**

I've got 50K in a savings account with a 1.34% interest rate. I feel like this is losing me money in the long term, as even if I move out I can't see 50K being 3 month's expenses (the suggested emergency fund amount). Should I move some amount into my investing account instead and sit on it for the long term invested in index funds? Not sure what to do with it otherwise.

**Budget**

Not having to worry about rent has made me also not have to worry about budget. I've got an account set up on Mint tracking my purchases, but for the most part I just buy something when I want it. I don't think I'll need a strict budget just yet (but I could be totally wrong), but are there any budgeting tips for someone who's gone from not really having to worry about expenses like rent to suddenly be thrown into it?

I think those are all the questions I had for now, thanks for taking the time to read my post. If I have anything else I'll be sure to ask in the comments.",finance
investing,"Worth forming an LLC to ""hide"" investments from personal tax returns?","I am in an expensive graduate program and rely on federal loans and scholarships to pay tuition and living expenses. Some scholarships I currently receive (and others I'm hoping to apply to) require a copy of my annual tax return. I currently have something in the range of $25-30k invested in a variety of savings accounts, stocks, ETF's, etc. I also run some side gigs in my spare time, like selling stuff on Amazon, walking dogs, etc. When I filed taxes last year, there was a full accounting of my investment returns and work earnings.

# **Apple, Microsoft and Amazon could drive the market in the next wave of earnings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/apple-microsoft-and-amazon-are-in-the-next-wave-of-earnings-.html)**
*****
&gt; The earnings season is about to get a lot more interesting with about a quarter of the S&amp;P 500, nearly half of the Dow Jones Industrials and three of the four biggest companies in the world reporting in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Mega-cap tech companies Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon report respectively on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. There will be heavy focus on them, not just because they are the biggest stocks — Microsoft first, then Amazon and Apple fourth — but because they represent growth and have been market leaders. Facebook, the sixth largest stock by market cap, also reports on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; The bar has already been lowered for Apple, after its warning of a revenue shortfall.
*****
&gt; ""They're really important for a variety of reasons. Number one is their influence on the market. But also they're multinational companies, and they'll give us an idea of what's going on overseas. Growth is slowing dramatically and these overseas businesses are not going to be immune,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group.
*****
&gt; About 72 percent of the companies that have reported earnings as of Friday morning have beaten expectations. In terms of revenue, however, there are just 58 percent that beat forecasts, down from about 70 percent in recent quarters. That means a much higher 42 percent have missed revenue expectations so far, according to Refinitiv data.
*****
&gt; Also concerning in the earnings data is the fact that first quarter earnings growth expectations have been shrinking, and are now nearly flat — at only 2 percent growth seen for S&amp;P 500 earnings in the current quarter, ending March 31. That number had been more than 5 percent on Jan. 1, and while it had been expected to slow, flat growth was not in most analysts' forecasts.
*****
&gt; The coming week's reports will come from a wide range of industries, including big energy with ExxonMobil and Chevron Friday; industrials like General Electric and Illinois ToolWorks and drug makers Merck and Pfizer.
*****
&gt; Earnings growth expectations for the fourth quarter have been just above 14 percent, including forecasts and actual reports of the companies that already reported.
*****
&gt; Lori Calvasina, RBC chief U.S. equity strategist, said tech will be an important group to watch. ""This has been one of the most problematic sectors since Dec. 31, in terms of earnings downgrades. There's been a lot of chatter out of semis this week. That had been the group in tech that was most derisked from an earnings expectations perspective. Expectations have really come down since last August, and since November came down very sharply,"" she said.
*****
&gt; Semiconductor stocks rallied in the past week, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 4.4 percent for the week, as of Friday. A number of semiconductor names, like Xilinx and Texas Instruments beat earnings forecasts, though sector heavyweight Intel was disappointing.
*****
&gt; Calvasina said she is concerned that earnings expectations for some other tech sectors may not have been adjusted downward enough. She said hardware company earnings forecasts had begun to come down in the fall, but there weren't many cuts to software sector profit forecasts. Calvasina said the companies where revisions were strong paved the way for a post-earnings stock pop, if the companies could beat lowered guidance.
*****
&gt; ""In the first two weeks of January, the market tone was buy the dips. It's been a bit more of a cautionary tone this week. One of the things people have been cautious on, and are worrying about is whether the market can continue to climb higher, if it's favorite sector is seeing earnings downgrades,"" she said, pointing to the technology and communications services sectors.
*****
&gt; ""I felt a lot better about that after hearing from financials reporting in week one. I read through those earnings call transcripts, and what I was seeing was there was a storm int he markets, there was a storm in fixed in come market in Q4 but that was not in the underlying economy,"" she said. ""In the first two weeks of January, nobody wanted to touch the financials, but now with the leadership rotation it does seem possible to me.""
*****
&gt; The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF was up 1.2 percent Friday, and is up 9.5 percent since Jan. 1.
*****
&gt; Some of the biggest names in the market are also, by default, among the most widely held names in many mutual funds portfolios. In a December RBC report, Microsoft was listed as the most widely held by large cap core, growth and value stock funds in the third quarter. Second was Alphabet, which reports earnings in the following week, and Apple was third.
*****
&gt; ""When crowded names miss, they tend to be psychologically devastating. You always want to be extra vigilant on crowded names heading into reporting season,"" Calvasina said. ""Misses tend to get people off guard when they happen.""
*****
&gt; As for big tech earnings, Apple has already warned that its iPhone sales in China took a big hit, and analysts have lowered their expectations for earnings this quarter. They also expect iPhone sales weakness to continue into this year.
*****
&gt; Microsoft, on the other hand, has far less exposure to China, and Piper Jaffray analysts make a case for it to beat estimates, based on its historical performance.""The combination of top line outperformance and cost discipline has allowed for Microsoft to materially outperform on the bottom line. Although a repeat of performance is not guaranteed...we model a scenario in line with historical averages that supports EPS outperformance relative to guidance of ~$0.12 or EPS of $1.20,"" they wrote in a note.
*****
&gt; Cowen analysts expect Amazon will see revenue growth of 19 percent, to $72.1 billion, driven by e commerce, web services and advertising.
*****
&gt; The firm reiterated its outperform rating on the stock. ""We also forecast 4Q18 Operating Income (GAAP) to be ~14% above the high end of guidance, with ~17% incremental margins driven by AWS, the ramping high margin Ad biz and 3P mix shift,"" the Cowen analysts wrote. They also have a target of $2,250 on the stock.
*****
&gt; Besides earnings in the coming week, the Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, but it is not expected to take any rate action. There is also the January employment report on Friday.

# Why Tom Terrific Might Not Be So Terrific For Stocks

&gt; The Super Bowl indicator suggests that stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner comes from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team wins, stocks fall. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but the data don’t lie—the S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 52 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it’s worth noting that this didn’t work last year when the Eagles won the Super Bowl, and the S&amp;P 500 lost 6.2% in 2018.

&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC—and ignore the history of the franchises. This similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 5.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 63% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/What-SP-500-Index-does-for-the-year-depending-on-which-conference-wins.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Would you believe the numbers actually get worse when the Patriots are involved? That’s right—the S&amp;P 500 has gained only 2.2% on average in years when the Patriots play in the big game. What about since Tom Brady has been the quarterback? The S&amp;P 500 is down 3.0% on average! “Pats fans might be ecstatic that Tom Brady is starting in a record-breaking ninth Super Bowl, but market bulls don’t want to see the Pats win, as stocks are up only 1.5% for the year on average after a victory versus up 2.9% if they lose,” saidLPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Tom might be terrific, but maybe not in all markets.”

&gt; We would like to reiterate that we realize these calculations are in no way relevant to investors—but it sure is more fun to talk about the Super Bowl and stock market returns ahead of the biggest NFL game of the year than snowfalls and freezing temperatures. We hope everyone has a great Super Bowl Sunday and we wish both the Rams and Pats luck!

# Stocks Bounced, Now What?

&gt; The big bounce off the December 24 lows continued last week, as the S&amp;P 500 Index added 2.9% for the week. In fact, it has gained 2.9%, 1.9%, 2.5%, and 2.9% over the past four weeks for a total gain of 10.5%. Of course, the S&amp;P 500 did have its worst December in 87 years and worst fourth quarter since the 2008-09 financial crisis, so stocks were historically oversold coming into 2019. Still, this bounce is quite impressive.

&gt; Just what could this extreme strength be telling us? “Here’s the catch: Stocks have been up huge the past four weeks, but history also tells us that being up more than 1.5% for four consecutive weeks actually tends to see continued outperformance going out the next three months. Don’t fight the trend is another way to put it,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&amp;P 500 tends to continue to outperform after similarly strong four-week stretches. Since 1950, after being up 1.5% or more for four consecutive weeks, the index’s average return going out 8 and 12 weeks has been more than double its overall average.

# Main Street’s Uncertainty Climbs

&gt; Recent U.S. economic data have been sending a lot of conflicting signals, and Wall Street’s economic outlook is more clouded than at any point of the cycle. Because of this, we thought we’d provide some direction from Main Street via the latest Federal Reserve’s (Fed) Beige Book survey, which was published January 16 and compiled in the weeks before January 7.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Main Street is finding it more difficult to characterize current economic conditions and set expectations. While sentiment is still healthy, mentions of uncertainty in the Beige Book climbed to the highest in at least four years, while strong and weak words both declined.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Beige-Book-Mention-of-Uncertainty-Hit-Four-Year-High.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Respondents cited uncertainty around trade, politics, financial markets, and global economic conditions. Recently, this uncertainty has bled into economic data. Gauges of manufacturing activity, which are leading indicators for the U.S. economy, have slowed sharply as businesses delay expansion plans and capital investment while they wait for resolutions to the headwinds. To us, though, all the fundamental pieces are still in place for a continued expansion.

&gt; “The growing uncertainty has been tough to ignore, but Main Street’s view of the economy remains relatively upbeat,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “We still see a compelling argument for moderate economic growth due to strong consumer demand, modestly accelerating wages, and a robust labor market.”

&gt; As mentioned in our Outlook 2019: FUNDAMENTAL: How to Focus on What Really Matters in the Markets, we expect U.S. gross domestic product growth of 2.5%–2.75% in 2019. Capital spending growth is an important part of our economic outlook (as it leads to increased productivity and contained labor costs), and we still expect business investment to increase this year. We see trade tensions as the primary roadblock to sentiment, and we expect the United States and China to reach a deal soon, eliminating a great deal of current uncertainty and allowing companies to resume their expansion plans.

# February Almanac: Small-Caps Tend to Outperform

&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is not all that stellar. February ranks no better than seventh and has posted paltry average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.1% in February since 1979—just the seventh best month for that benchmark.

&gt; In pre-election years, February’s performance generally improves with average returns all positive. NASDAQ performs best, gaining an average 2.8% in pre-election-year Februarys since 1971. Russell 2000 is second best, averaging gains of 2.5% since 1979. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000, the large-cap indices, tend to lag with average advances of around 1.0%.

# Pre-Election Years: Best Year of Four-Year Cycle

&gt; Presidential elections every four years have a profound impact on the economy and the stock market. Wars, recessions and bear markets have tended to start or occur in the first half of the term while prosperous times and bull markets, in the latter half. This pattern has contributed to solid average gains in many pre-presidential-election years. Compared to the average performance of All Years, Pre-Election Years have enjoyed approximately twice the returns.

&gt; In the following charts, Pre-Election Years, All Years and 2019 year-to-date are presented. After a bumpy start to this year, the market has shot higher off of December’s lows. As of yesterday’s close, DJIA was up 4.62%, S&amp;P 500 5.03% and NASDAQ 5.8%. At this early stage of pre-election year 2019, this performance is comfortably above average. If economic growth can remain firm, the partial government shutdown comes to an end, the Fed isn’t overly hawkish with monetary policy and some reasonable resolution to the trade war can be reached, 2019 could live up to expectations.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week ahead?

Have a fantastic trading week ahead r/stocks! ;)",finance
personalfinance,"Taking out a student loan over the ""cost of attendance"" at my University: Can this affect the financial aid I receive from the State/Federal Government?","Hey all, I've done some research but can't seem to find what I'm looking for.

I am from West Virginia and I attend a school (West Virginia University) where the estimated cost of attendance is $22,xxx and I have an expected family contribution of $0, so all of my cost of attendance is covered by some sort of government aid such as state grants/scholarships or federal grants and loans.

This semester, I am on a study abroad trip and although my cost of attendance hasn't changed, the cost of living has. It is significantly more expensive here in the UK than what I'm used to and I've only got very little in the bank to last me for the next 6 months. Yikes. 

Therefore I have decided that maybe I should take out a private student loan. I can't do a normal because I don't have a way to pay until after I leave my study abroad trip as my student visa does not allow me to work and as mentioned, I receive no family support.

However, taking out an extra private student loan would technically mean I am receiving more in financial aid then what my cost of attendance is.

personalfinance,H&amp;R Block inconsistent results for 2018 taxes and child tax credit,"So I've entered all my W2 information for my wife and I. Long story short is that H&amp;R block says we'll be taking the standard deduction since my itemized amount is $20K. This is where the problem starts. I owe the IRS $6K this  year but the ""Tax Summary"" and the ""H&amp;R block Refund Reveal"" do not agree. I'm not an accountant by any stretch, but I expect those numbers to match up top to bottom and they do not. The ""H&amp;R block Refund Reveal"" says ""Based on your income and deductions, you owe $33K in federal taxes this year"". This SAME summary says ""Since you don't qualify for any credits, the amount of taxes you owe didn't change."" Bullshit. I have two dependents under the age of 17 and in the interview portion of the entry process, the software CLEARLY indicates I qualify for $4K in child tax credits. My wife and I do not make &gt; $400K AGI lol.

The other says ""Actual tax due"" is $29K. But according to the other screen, it's $33K.

Something is wrong.

personalfinance,Advice/tips on how to offset tax bill when MFS in TX? Newly married + student loans,"Hi, all,

This subreddit has always been super helpful when planning, so thanks in advance for any advice that I receive.

My husband and I were married in October of 2018. He has always received a somewhat sizeable tax refund due to claiming one allowance and deducting work-related expenses (tools). 2018 income is $52k.

I, on the other hand, have always received very small refunds. I claim two allowances. 2018 income is $36k.

We both have federal student loans. His balance is $25k and he's on the RePAYE plan (we will likely switch to another plan when it's time for him to recertify in April). He won't be seeking any forgiveness and our plan is to pay this off after other higher interest debts in the coming years.

My student loan balance is $40k and I'm also on the RePAYE plan. The plan is to switch to PAYE after we file separately so that my monthly payment does not consider his income. I am seeking PSLF. My monthly student loan payment went up $200 when his income is factored. 

With all this being said, MFS seems to be a better option for us because we will save more on student loan payments versus the tax breaks. However, it seems that going this route will result in a tax bill for myself (again, minimal compared to the loan payments). I have not yet ran his numbers, but my question is this: how can we offset the disadvantages of MFS when we lose on so many of the eligible deductions? Should we adjust our allowances? Increase our charitable giving?

Will appreciate any insight and can give more detail if needed.",finance
personalfinance,Can't make my credit card payments anymore...,"Hello,

I have two credit cards, one with about 15k and the other 10k.

I lost my job 2 months ago, and haven't been able to get anything since. 

I just started my own side business to try and make ends meet, which is working, but only making enough to get food, pay cell, and rent. 

I don't have any loans.


However, I can't afford my credit card payments now.

I tried calling them and let them know I was going through finical difficulty, and both credit card companies were no help.


They simply told me they can't lower my interest rate (this alone would help)

My credit isn't the best to begin with (it was at one point)

I'm thinking I should just let them default to collections, then hopefully by then I will be in a better spot and maybe pay off collections at a lower rate.


I'm literally lost &amp; have no idea what to do.


I don't even go out anymore, I canceled all services besides the gym ($10 a month).

Any suggestions would be great.

investing,Reversed dollar cost avg. with low-interest loan -- good/bad idea?,"I have about $30k in cash, which is a low interest student loan. I have to pay it back in monthly installments over 20 years. The interest rate on the loan is currently 2.1%, and while it is expected to increase over time, as central banks increase rates, it is likely to remain below 3% for several years. I am no longer a student and have a good job.

At the time of writing, I simply have the money in cash in a high interest savings account (about 2%).

What do you guys think of this idea: invest all of the money in VOO, and withdraw a small sum every month, to pay back the loan as slowly as possible. I can't figure out the math as all compound interest calculators I can find assume that you ADD money per month, instead of withdrawing money.

==========================================================================================

Option 1: Pay back $30k immediately.

Option 2: Invest $30k in VOO. Assuming a conservative return of 5% per year, and monthly withdrawals to pay down the debt (3% interest). After 20 years: $3,436 (and no debt).

Option 3: Keep the cash over 20 years in savings account (2% interest), waiting for elusive opportunities. After 20 years: -$11,022.

Option 4: Invest $30k in VOO. Using job income to pay back the loan (188.84 per month).   
a) assuming 4% annual return on investment: $66,677.46 Final. excluding loan payments: $21,355.86  
b) assuming 5% annual return on investment, outcome after 20 years: $81,379.21 Final. excluding loan payments: $36,057.61  
c) assuming 6% annual return on investment, outcome after 20 years: $99,306.13 Final. excluding loan payments: $53,984.53

Option 5: Pay off debt immediately and invest $188.84 monthly (using job income) at various returns:  
a) assuming 4% annual return on investment, outcome after 20 years: $69,493. Final. excluding principle: $24,170.99  
b) assuming 5% annual return on investment, outcome after 20 years: $77,943. Final. excluding principle: $32,621.41

I did contribute in those years, but did not max out for both my wife and I.  **Seems almost too good to be true.**   I did some research and it seems that form 8086 would be used, but I could not confirm the ability to contribute to IRAs on past returns.

Max out ROTH contributions for 2018 during that process.  Max out 2019 ROTHs contributions as well.

In the siege of Atlanta, where union soldiers captured the city and tore through the countryside destroying all buildings and equipment to cut off resources in the south, your character is sent off to burn down an empty barn. You find the confederate soldier, other character, hiding inside crying. He explains his story and you sympathize with him, letting him join you and lying about who he is to the others.

I’ve got about $10,000 saved but no other liquid assets (house is too new to refi). My credit isn’t great but is decent, low 700s last I checked.

A word on how I got here: I recently got divorced and the split left me in less than ideal financial shape, then I got laid off and lived on savings for a bit. Plus I’ll admit my ex and I were both spenders. I’ve been pretty reckless with credit cards- (the small one is basically tuition for a semester where I maxed out student loans but the $10k one is simply years of blind accumulation, a vacation to try to save the failed marriage + random dumb shit). Please don’t tell me how horrible I am at budgeting- I know I need to overhaul my spending and do better- which is why I’m asking you dear redditors for advice on what to tackle first.

I’ve cut back on all the obvious things- no internet + cable, I cook almost every meal at home, not even coffees out. I’m considering a roommate but the house is really small so that’s a later option, and am actively looking at taking on a side gig. Am only about six months into my day job in marketing, and our office is really fiscally conservative so I’m not poised for a raise yet. I have learned from other posts on this thread that I must read YNAB and DR- going to the library for these asap.

Some options to tackle my debt:
Do I keep a little in the bank and use ~$7,500 of my savings to knock out the 10.25% card and pile that monthly payment on the larger 13.5% card?

Or take that $7,500 and pay off most of my car, which is a POS? (Don’t get me started on this- my ex convinced me to buy a lemon and this thing has cost so much in repairs just in two years - new AC, transmission trouble, etc.) Trade it in with a little equity for something more economical. Kelly Blue book puts my trade-in value around $8k. I probably wouldn’t want to sell it privately.

Or take my full $10k savings and split it between the credit cards, dropping the debt to available ratio in half, hopefully improving my credit, and then try to open a balance transfer card?

*Final note, tuition is covered by my employer but while in school I can take out about $15k a year in federal unsubsidized loans to help pay for qualified living expenses (if I did this, I could replenish savings with the first 50% dispersement sometime in August/ September, and again next February.

I am a junior in college currently with braces to prepare for lower jaw surgery at the end of the year. My orthodontist and surgeon want to do it over winter break. This will be covered by my Blue Cross Blue Shield FL insurance, however, our healthcare has about a ~$7900 deductible for individual which I will need to pay on the day of my surgery.

So far, I have not taken any loans to pay for my school and have saved $9k in the bank that I am living off of right now. In the past two years, I've worked 20-40hrs/wk while in school but this semester I had to quit my job because this semester is extremely important and intense in my program. I live as frugally as I can (expenses are about $950/m + my braces payments ~$177) and my parents unfortunately have no funds to help me out.

So with that said, I am trying to figure out what the best course of action is for me to pay for this surgery. I need my savings to live off of (although I intend and hope to get another job over the summer). 

I qualify for about $3250+ of federal loans per semester, a mix of unsub or subsidized. Again, haven't used these before, but I am considering beginning to take these out to have them saved and ready to make the payment come this December. I know interest rates are often the best for student loans, plus I won't have to make payments until I graduate (but I know they can't be bankrupt). 

TLDR: Should I use federal student loans to get this surgery payment, or is there something else better out there for this?",finance
personalfinance,Help with a debt decision,"This is long and detailed.
I have a delimma I need help solving. Here are the details... you may need a pen and paper to follow along lol.
We are preparing to buy a home in about 6 months and we have veeeeery little debt compared to most people our age (30 and 31)... Less than $2000 in credit card debt and about $17000 remaining for a truck we bought back in 2016 and $2100 for a SUV we got in 2013. Aside from that, we have no other debts.
I have about $10500 across 4 savings accounts that I have worked super hard to get to. I have one account in particular that I have a goal of 2 month's income set for and that is only about halfway to that goal.
My husband just got a new position where he will be making about $700 more per month than his current job (yay!). We intend to continue living as we are and taking that extra income (probably an extra $500ish after taxes come out) and putting it in savings and towards debt.
All the info given.. aside from the truck, our total combined debt is about $4100. Should I bite the bullet and pay it all off (car and 2 credit cards)  now with my savings or pay it down as we have been? I'm concerned about my car because when my student loan account closed after I paid it off, it seemed to negatively affect my credit score temporarily. I dont want to pay it off right before buying a home, which I'm scheduled to do, and have my score drop because of it. I figure 6 months is more than enough time for it to even out again, but I hate dipping in to savings even with knowing we can bounce back quite easily with the extra income and our tax return when it comes. The credit cards I dont want to pay on too long bc of the interest rates being at 14ish percent each. Its wasted money, but its money coming out of that hard earned savings as opposed to paying it down with our budgeted bill money. My issue is that the future isnt guaranteed... so spending savings gives me anxiety, but I really want to set us up well to buy a home...
What would you do? What do you feel is the best route to take? My husband is no help because he is clueless when it comes to money management. Thanks of you've made it this far

Edited to add that we are using a VA loan to purchase so we dont need to save for a down payment",finance
personalfinance,Young Married Couple Looking For Financial Advice,"Hey Reddit, 

My spouse and I have been married for about a year, and I'm looking for some financial advice. (note, this is a throwaway account for privacy reasons.)

So, long story short, we both just turned 26, and have recently found that we fall into the ""high income earner"" category. We don't come from wealthy backgrounds, and we're kind of in uncharted territory here. Ironically, our parents say we are saving too much, and are encouraging us to spend more and upgrade our lifestyle (damn baby boomers) We are maxing out our 401k's and ROTH IRA's, but are trying to decide on the next best place to park our extra income, with an eye towards long term growth and stability. I grew up poor, and I want to build real wealth in my lifetime, so my kids don't have to experience what I did. 

I am a government contractor, and currently earn around $115,000/yr, however only $66,000 of which is actual taxable income. (foreign work, tax haven, etc). I am guaranteed a pay increase every year, typically around 5%. 

My wife works in healthcare, and earns $40/hr. and is full time. Considering she works a few overtime shifts a month at time and a half, she clears about $7,000-$7,400/mo, or a projected ~86,000 for the year. She will receive a $7500 bonus in a few months for hitting a particular work goal, so that brings her to a projected $93,500. 

All things considered, we expect to earn around $209,500 for 2019, but only $159,500 is taxable, which turns into ~135,500 after our standard married filing jointly deduction.  

So, with this in mind, I am currently maxing out both of our ROTH IRA's, and our 401k's (which is ROTH option, since I anticipate a pension in retirement, and my wife may receive one as well.) That's $50,000 a year going into retirement. 

That leaves us with our rent, which is $2500/mo (coastal California, and this is a pretty good deal where we live. Relocating is not an option.)
And my student loans, which are as follows:
$449/mo to a loan at 2.9% APR with ~10k remaining
$300/mo to a loan at 0% APR with ~25k remaining (school financial aide package, yes I know it's weird)

We own both our vehicles and pay liability insurance. We aren't changing this anytime soon, and when we do, I'll buy another craigslist Honda, cash, like our current vehicles. All told, our monthly expenditures, including rent, utilities, mobile phones, cars, gas, food (we like to cook and don't eat out much) are around $4,000/mo, with a lions share of that being rent, and utilities eating another $200 or so, and then student loans and food competing for the next largest expense. 

As CA residents we will pay about $44,000 in taxes, considering CA state tax, Medicare, Federal Taxes, etc. 

Lastly, we donate exactly 10% of our income to charity (not mormon, just normal Jesus followers. And no, we don't just give it all to our church)

This leaves us with a projected ~$47,000K excess income for 2019 with which to invest, AFTER all living expenses, maxing out our 401k/ROTH IRA, charitable contributions, and paying all projected state and federal income taxes. 
(50k retirement + 20K charity + 48k expenses + 43k taxes) = 162k. 
209k gross income - 162k expenses (everything) = 47k left over.

What do we do with this? We are not homeowners yet, but I'm scared about the current market. Prices have been rising for 10 straight years, and currently properties in our area are still more expensive than I'm comfortable with. We also have no kids, so a 529 plan isn't really an option. 

We have a 2 month safety net in cash, but I don't think we need more since I have a guaranteed federal contract and I'm practically guaranteed not to lose my job unless i commit a felony. 

So what do we do? Just dump the excess into Vanguard ETFs? The market seems volatile right now, so I'm paranoid about asset allocation, and unsure as to where I need to be investing. 

I've read through this forum and I'm still at a loss. 
We don't want to put money into a tax advantaged healthcare savings account because i have an excellent healthcare plan, and even if I didn't, my spouse, being a healthcare worker, does as well. And even if we didn't use it for healthcare, I don't think I'd want to use it to save for retirement, because I feel like we're putting enough into retirement already. I feel the same way about the Mega Backdoor Roth IRA. 

We want to save for a downpayment for a house, but we don't know when we'll buy, we're sort of just waiting for the market to move or stabilize. I'm currently putting the excess income into the Betterment Smart Saver account, which grows at around 2%, until I can find a better place to put it. Is this a good option for saving for a house downpayment? Are there better places for use to be putting our money? Maybe a shoebox? 

I just want to make the right decision, and I'm new at this, so I'd love your advice and ideas. Thanks in advance for your help!",finance
personalfinance,Help with how much I should be receiving in my tax refund?,"Hello all,

I'm 19 and I can't figure out these damn online tax refund calculators. I am 19, dependent on my mother (she's the head of household and the main source of income). I reside in Florida and have been employed by two different companies this year, not overlapping however. Combining information from both jobs W2's, my totals are: 

Total wages made: $12877

Federal income tax withheld: $996

Social security tax withheld: $797

Medicare tax withheld: $190

Was medically insured except for the last two months of 2018, I believe through Medicaid.

Additionally, I am a student at a nearby college, which I pay absolutely nothing for and financial aid covers the classes and books, and typically I have some amount of money left over. I have received a 1098-T form from them, the values being

Box #1 ""Payments Received For Qualified Tuition and Related Expenses"": $5096.80

Box #5 ""Scholarships or Grants"": $8,275.00 

Box#7 **""**Checked if Amounts Included For Academic Period in January through March of Future Reporting Year"": Yes 

Box #8 ""Checked If At Least Half-Time Student"": Yes

Box #9 ""Checked if a graduate Student"": No   


All in all, how much should I be expecting? I tried to fill in an estimate on some websites and it said I should be receiving $900 back but that doesn't seem right, the system didn't account for the financial aid/FAFSA money I receive. 

Can anyone help out? TIA",finance
personalfinance,Advice on US and IL income tax,"First, let me preface by saying I checked the wiki and rules, but if I missed something and this question doesn't belong, I'm sorry and let me know. I've made a few mistakes, no doubt compounded by time, but I'm hoping to get advice on how I can figure out this mess. 

For the past few years I have neglected to file my IL state taxes when I ended up owing, and last year in a further stretch of idiocy I decided not to file my US return when I ended up owing on that too.  My annual income is &lt;$55,000. The state witholding has never been far off, with me owing no more than $70 on that return, some years lower. The only missed federal return was last year's (for the 2017 tax year). As reported on a 1099-SA, I drew funds from an HSA to cover an emergency expense (non-medical, non-qualifying expense) resulting in a final tax due of around $400 on that return. 

&amp;#x200B;

While I don't exactly have the funds to immediately pay my tax debts, I'm certainly prepared to make whatever arrangements necessary to take care of state and Federal within the coming months- I just don't even know where to begin. I'd appreciate any advice.",finance
personalfinance,Pay off car payment or credit card debt first?,"Hey everyone. 

Due to an educational tax break, my tax returns are a bit bigger than expected so I wanted to pay off some debt

I am planning on using the money to pay a huge chunk off of either my car payment (currently $3,500 left) or to pay off the remainder of my credit card balance ($2000). I'm just wondering, which one would be the better option to pay off first? Does it really matter? As of now, my credit card is not amassing any outrageous interest fees ($2 a month) and my interest rate on my car is 5.8%

personalfinance,Tax Return Question,"To start I’m a 19 years old in college and this is my first time doing my tax return by myself (grand father helped me last year). 

So I made a little over 6k last year working part time. I paid about 700 in federal taxes and about 200 in state taxes and about 60 in local taxes. When I started filing my taxes through credit karma only with my W-2  I was gonna get about 200 back from federal taxes but after I put in my 1098-T my federal refund went up to 1200. Which is more than I paid in federal, state and local taxes. So I’m not quite sure how this makes sense. Can anyone explain this to me?",finance
personalfinance,Is there something wrong with my state tax withholding?,"I live in Connecticut and for after inputting everything for my 2018 taxes, I owe about $200.  I had some pretty significant interest income last year, but the above figure is what I get when I subtract it. When counting the interest income tax, I owe almost as much as I do for my federal tax, which is just for the interest income.

Some details:

* AGI: $65,119 excluding the interest income
* State tax: $3,172
* Withheld: $2,975

I had no other income other than the interest income, which is not included in the above for these purposes. On my CT-W4, I have withholding code ""F"" selected, which is what I've used all had selected all my years working.  Also, as far as I can tell, my withholding seems to have been correct all year.

If it's not my withholding selection, I can think of a couple other things:

* I did get a pretty large bonus but a quick and dirty calculation using the instructions on the state website seems to indicate that the withholding was correct
* I did change my 401k contribution selections several times last year. Could this have screwed things up?
* Were there income tax increases in CT last year and they just didn't update the withholding tables?

Any ideas on what I may be missing? I am fortunate enough to be able to afford it but I'd like to see if there's any way to mitigate it to some extent next year, to get closer to $0 (not counting taxes for interest income).",finance

personalfinance,"How to invest inherited money (debt, savings, other)?","Hi everyone. I've recently been informed that I will be receiving approximately $8k as inheritance money. My grandmother's home is being sold by the aunt who manages it and, per her will, portions of that money is to be dispersed. 

My question is, once I actually receive it, what is the smartest way to invest it? I figure I have a few different options:


1: Auto loan, which has $13k left.

2: Student loans, $20k. 

3: Put in savings until upcoming wedding / honeymoon June 2020.

4: Put in savings, leave it alone until we are ready to put a down payment on a home. 


I stay on top of my credit card debt, so nothing there. My car and student loan interest rates are about the same, so really no difference regarding which is accruing faster. My initial thought is to put it towards the car, since that will be the fastest thing to pay off, and therefore one less thing to think about moving forward, however I'd love to hear anyone's thoughts that have more experience with this than I do.

I'm quite new to saving, and over the last year I have being putting my money away each month into a monthly saver account which finishes next month, meaning I now have around £3000 saved up. What I was looking for advice for now is what I should do with this money, seeing as ISA's and what not have such low interest rates (like 0.20%)

Part of me want's to put a small amount (maybe £1000) into a premium bond where it has a (very low) chance of winning me some money.

I was wondering about normal bonds for the other £2000, but I wanted some more information about the risks of bonds, or even if I can with such a low amount.

In the mean time, I think I'll probably open up another monthly saver (2%) and put away another £2-3000 this next year.

Any advice or information would be greatly appreciated, I'm pretty new to this so any information or advice is helpful. Thank you.",finance

Might take of for another 10 years and the big risk is investing in the winner and avoiding the loser. Wether people hate crypto or not it is happening, just like the internet. Well thats if the article is true.

https://money.howstuffworks.com/currency6.htm

Since money is really just a representation of value, it didn't take long for people to realize they could just send information about money by telegraph or other electronic means, and it was just as ""real"" as sending the money itself. After World War II, banks would record information about the day's transactions onto large magnetic reels, which were taken to the regional Federal Reserve Bank. This system eliminated the need for the large denominations that were printed prior to the war to facilitate these large-scale transfers. Today, the $500, $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000 bills printed during this period are very rare, though some are still in circulation.

Later, wire connections were established between the banks, so the transfer information could be sent directly.

By the early 1990s, all transfers between banks and the Federal Reserve were done electronically.

There are three other important steps in the history of electronic money

personalfinance,Payoff Student Loans vs Retirement Savings,"I know this question of debt payoff vs retirement savings gets asked all the time around here but I feel like our situation is right on the border of paying down quickly and investing. Here are the details and options I see;

* Personal Info
   * Wife and I are both 30. One kid currently, another one due in August.
* Loans
   * Student Loan 1 - Balance $62,358 Variable Interest 5.94% Min payment $875
   * Student Loan 2 - Balance $15,546 Variable Interest 5.25% Min payment $591
   * Total monthly payment - $1466
* Retirement

   * 90-100% stock portfolios
   * Wife's retirement balance is $80,435  and mine is $48,194
   * Total monthly savings -$1400
   * Wife gets profit sharing of 3-10% each year regardless if she invests anything
   * I get pension automatically and 3% employer contribution regardless if I invest
* Option A)
   * Continue current plan, paying off debts at the minimum payments. Payoff calculation says 3/2024. Assuming no further increase in interest rates, which seems unlikely, interest paid is roughly $12,000
   * 401Ks continue to grow with contributions plus whatever market return is for the next 5 years
* Option B)
   * Drop retirement savings to $0, pay roughly $2800 towards loans. Payoff calculation says 7/2021. Assuming no further increase in interest rates, which seems unlikely, interest paid is roughly $5542. Savings of about $6500.
   * 401ks balances only grow on existing balances. Lose/Gain whatever market return is for next 5 years
* Review of options
   * So I am having trouble with this because I know they say the long term average of the market is 7%, our interest rates for our loans are already around 5.5%, likely to probably end up around 6-7% with rate increases.
   * I am leaning towards paying off the loans as fast as possible, since the loan interest savings is a guaranteed, where the market isn't guaranteed to return 7%. Could be -10%, who knows. For example, in the last 12 months, my retirement account lost 6.4%.  But also could lose out on returns if market pops to the upside.

personalfinance,Student Loan Consolidation Question,"Hi All.

Thanks in advance for the help. I'm a 34 year old guy with around 81k in student loan debt.

I have about 26k in Federal loans and 55k in Private loans. Is it advantageous to consolidate the Public loans with the private? People have told me not to, but I am not to sure based on what I've read online. I won't quality for Public loan forgiveness as I work in the private sector. The only hang up for me I guess is the income based repayment plans should something happen to me?

I've been preapproved for loans that have 1 to 1.75% less in interest, so it seems like a no brainer to me.",finance

personalfinance,"Currently Financing a 2013 Hyundai w/ $10k left @ 65k Miles, Interested in 2016 Hyundai w/ 14k miles @ $15.4k (Retail $18k) Trade-In/Financing Options?","So I've seen a 2016 Hyundai that is pretty much what I want. (Standard, Sporty, 2door instead of 4)They are both hatchbacks, and they both will drive crap in the weather of my region (New England). That much i'm aware of and ok with. Please bare with me because this is the logic I have in this purchase, and am wondering if its an overall ok move

(as this is a ""want"" based purchase nothing is 100% ok about it, but looking to do this with minimal impact to my existing payment amounts. I'm aware this will basically ""restart"" my loan but the monthly payment amounts may be close to the same since the interest will be nearly halved if I can get the advertised rate)

First off, I have decent credit (723 Fico checked as of this posting) So compared to when I got my 2013 I think I can do this mainly to refinance the remaining debt of my 2013 vehicle while trading it in and lowering it.

On the dealer site its offering 60mo @ %3.49 for a 15.4k loan (also assuming they will add tax + registration fees this may be 17kish.).

If I trade in my vehicle, and can get at least 2.5k put towards the purchase of the car + a cash downpayment of 2.5k I can reduce my remaining owed on the loan for my 2013 to about 5k. (keep in mind, this loan is at %8.95 interest)

That 5k turns the \~17k loan (for the new car alone) to about 22k (with the remainder of the loan for my old car)for a retail price 18k car and a lower interest rate that will keep my payments similar if I can get a 60mo loan.

\*Thoughts\* - If I can get a 72/84mo loan with a similarly low interest rate I can get a lower ""required"" monthly payment and put the same amount I would pay if it was a 60mo loan. That way I have wiggle room to reduce my monthly payment if life issues arise but still pay the note ""in full"" every month if needed (essentially aggressively paying down a lower interest higher principle loan for the first 2 years to cover the gap of money accrued when the initial purchase was made)

Is this something I can negotiate with the dealer/bank/finance company?

Or is this just not something possible in reality? I'm not well versed in how standards of finance agreements work with used cars so I'm trying to think what my best leverage here is",finance
personalfinance,Help with math on interest savings--paying down debt as aggressively as possible.,"My wife and I, without really knowing what we were doing, refinanced our mortgage and took on a line of credit to take on a major renovation. After the refinance paid out part of the debt, we were left with an overall LOC debt of +$20 000. 

A year ago, I converted that LOC debt to a personal loan at a lower interest rate. It was a ""blended"" payment arrangement, where interest and principal payments remain the same (adjusted yearly with interest rate changes and early payments factored in). We now have a balance of around $17 500. 

We are tired of being in debt, and looking to get out as fast as possible. With that in mind, I took a couple of actions (included are some relevant details):

\--applied for, and received, a balance transfer credit card with 0% interest for 10 months. (1% transfer fee on any balance transferred). It has a credit limit of $8000.

\--converted the loan back to a line of credit, with a 1% lower interest rate (7.86%).

\--the above seems risky, I know, but it did give us the lower interest rate, and we are committed to paying more than we previously paid per month ($415 was previous payment, committed to $600/month) on the loan.

My plan is to transfer $8000 (minus 1% transfer fee of +/- $80, of course), and make the minimum payment (not sure how much that would be?), and use the remainder of the $600 we've budgeted for monthly debt payments to pay down the line of credit.

Can somebody help me do the math on what I would save by comparing these two scenarios?

A) Starting principal of $17500 on a LOC with 7.86% interest. Payments of $600 per month. What would my principal balance be after 10 months? How much would I pay in interest in that period?

B) Same starting principal as above. Transfer $8000 to balance transfer card (0% interest, 1% transfer fee). Make minimum payments on balance transfer card, and rest of $600 monthly debt payment budget on remaining LOC balance. At end of 0% promo period, transfer remaining balance from balance transfer card to LOC. Again: What would my overall principal balance be? How much interest would I pay in that period?",finance
personalfinance,"Student Loan Forgiveness for Schoolteachers, X-Post from StudentLoans","Hello all, I also posted this in r/StudentLoans but I thought the larger audience here might be helpful.

My wife is a public school teacher. She switched majors during college, then went to grad school, so for a school teacher she has what I think would be considered an absurd amount of student debt, about $80,000. 

She is in her 40's and our finances are in pretty decent shape now (finally). She went to a seminar her union put on about forgiveness programs and was told step 1 was to consolidate the loans under Fed Loan Servicing. 

We did that and we asked about forgiveness programs. They said to try for forgiveness we would need to pay recalculate our monthly payment and that it would go up substantially, then after ten years of on time payments she would qualify to ask for forgiveness. 

So without forgiveness we would be lucky to pay these off before she dies. We could possibly make the higher payments, but when I research this I can't find much evidence the forgiveness would ever occur. I find claims that 90% of claims don't qualify? So I am very wary of making ten years of higher payments only to get denied at the finish line.

Has anyone ever personally done this or tried it? If not does anyone know any more about it? I am very wary of anything we are told by the loan companies, her previous loan company blatantly lied about her eligibility, I presume so she wouldn't move the loans to FedLoan.

Any advice will be greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,$35k in consumer debt - debt management or snowball?,"Hello r/personalfinance!

So, I am a mess. I am 29 and, as of this moment, over $35,000 in consumer debt. I went to college in NYC and lived off cards, got laid off a few years ago and lived off cards, and had a moderate spending problem which all went on cards. I'm trying to decide whether or not to look into debt management or if I can handle this myself, but I keep getting too panicky looking at the numbers and just shut down. So this is like my third attempt to try to get this together. 

Thankfully, I've got a few clean aces: I now have state employment that pays me pretty well and that I'm unlikely to get laid off from, I have a car that's paid off and unlikely to need repairs in the next 6-12 months, all my accounts are current, and I have identified my issues with spending enough to finally feel ready to stare all this in the face. 

Income:

Bi-weekly take home: $1133.58 - $75 of this I have automatically put into a savings account that I pull from only in crises. Which, as you're about to see, is fairly frequently lol. 

I also run a (very small) candle business that nets me anywhere from $50-150/mo, but it's erratic income that I use more for pocket money than anything. I do one fair/market a month usually, business picks up in the fall/winter, the money from which I then use for Christmas gifts. 

Resources:

Savings account: $130

Checking: $75

(I have an IRA floating around somewhere and contribute to a pension, so I'm not worried about retirement stuff yet.)

Expenses:

Rent: $580

Electric: $65

Gas: $34

Phone: $165 (my mom gives me $100 for her share of our family plan, which is technically more than she should, but it's her way of trying to do me an assist lol) - this also includes my $39/mo payment for my current phone, which I still owe ~$399 on.

Car/Renter's Insurance: $90.33

Cable/Internet: $63.10

Pet care: ~$20

Subscription services: $31.51 (Sephora Play, Spotify, Hulu)

Food (groceries/eating out): $440

Household: $20

Manicures/Haircuts/Massage/Waxing: $100 (I do one of the above, not all every month) 

Student Loans: $68.53 (in the Public Service Repayment plan)

Gas for car: $30

Prescriptions: $30


Total: $1637.47/mo

Oh, but then there's the minimum payments on the debt...

Card 1: $1705.56 @ 20% - $36 min

Card 2: $6851.06 @ 16% - $162 min

Card 3: 1995.40 @ 24.5% - $61 min

Card 4: $19613.06 @ 10.9% - $400 min

Personal Loan: $5173.93 @ 10.9% - $200 (fixed)

Total: $859.

So my expenses and minimums are over my income to the tune of several hundred bucks a month. In a moment of crisis, I inevitably end up using a card or pulling a small cash advance from one of the cards (never more than $200) which I know is the bad bad and I want to curtail this immediately. 

I have a few good things coming up: my tax refund is $1300 (already processed according to the IRS website, supposed to come in this week) and I have a three-pay month in March. I want to stash at least one month's rent into my savings between the two of those, but other than that, I'll have some room to try to make some dents in things. 

Upcoming possible money drains: I'm going to Minneapolis and Boston in March. I'm going to try to do them as cheap as possible - for Minneapolis, I'm going to be splitting a room with a friend and cashing in my coin jar for a Southwest gift card to pay for the flight. Boston isn't set in stone, so I could possibly cancel it. I have two candle shows scheduled before those trips, so I can try to use candle money to cover those. 

Other notes: I can't sell my car (she's only worth $4500 KBB and my city's public transit is notoriously terrible, my 20 minute commute would turn into an hour and a half) and I can't move at this time. I just KonMari'd my apartment and anticipate with selling items I'll have another $150 to work with in the next month or so, but that's it. I used YNAB for a while but just got like frustrated and depressed so stopped using it lol. Other than that, I haven't used any kind of financial tracking software aside from paying attention to my balances/transactions. 

My question is this: do I snowball or do a debt management plan? Debt management is appealing due to being able to get a lower monthly payment right away. If I could get down to a $650-800/mo payment, I could maybe get some savings figured out. But can I do the mechanics of debt management myself? I've never asked a company to decrease my interest rate or my minimum payment. Would it manage to make that much of a difference?

Thank you so so much if you took the time to read all of this! I'm at work so there might be a slight delay in my responding to comments, but I promise I'll be back!",finance
personalfinance,Stuck at dead end job and at my wits end. Seems to be no hope and no oppurtunity.,"I only make a pathetically paltry 35k a year, with commision for ever sale I make (around 3-400 a month, so yearly net is about 37k).

I have 8k of student loan debt. My POS car I had broke down recently and I bought a newish used car, which still put me 10.5k in debt. Car is still worth about that much as I bought it after it ate the 2 year depreciation.

Problem is I have an absolutely, despicable worthless degree: *Political science*. My current income only gives me about 2100 a month to live on. That is just barely enough to suvive where I live, and absolutely not enough to save much of anything decent. I only have about 5.5k saved up, and will be focusing on paying off my entire auto loan within the next year ( has a ludicrous 7% interest rate) and then my student loans. My student loans are also less of a priority has it is only $80 monthly, where my cars minimum is $180. I could always sell my car and only pay off the loan enough to get market value, then buy another POS outright, but I just got so tired of living like a pauper while all my friends got to drive brand new cars bought by their rich mommy and daddies.

I am currently living with my dad since my income would not let me save anything up at all while also paying rent. But I absolutelt despise living there; the house is in a constantly dilapidated state, he never cleans, and he already owes me 2k from when he had to take money from me to pay a sewage repair. We currently have a mold problem in the basement but we are totally fucked because mold remediation is unbelivably, stupidly expensive and clearly not meant for poor people. I am starting to get afraid the conditions of the house are affecting my health but there is nothing I can do.

I don't know how I am supposed to escape this terriboe situation. I work a shitty sales job that shouldn't even require a degree. I have applied to 200+ jobs and the only ones who reply are 15 an hour customer service jobs. I am at wits end and feel there is no escape.

I could apply to law school as my current stats would let me attend my state flagship for close to if nout outright free, but I would likely have to wait a year anyway and I am just sick and tired of working dead end jobs which, considering rhe legal, is all i could get out of my state school. Anything higher would require hundreds of thousands of debt.

I am sinply tired of the lack of oppurtunity. I regret my decisions every day and curse myself for not majoring in a STEM field. I worked and interned every year I was at school and have nothing to show for it. I, evidently, have no employable skills as I dont get any interest for an interview.

personalfinance,Purchased a car @ 4% and now they are wanting to up to 9%,"My wife needed to upgrade to a larger vehicle to accommodate to our youngest aging up to a larger car seat.  We could not fit all 3 car seats in her current car.

We made the decision to trade the car in and due to the mileage on her current car, we knew it would have negative equity.  After their trade in offer, which was comparable to the other 5 dealerships we test drove.. we accepted and decided to purchase from this dealership.

They initially offered a 9% interest rate and we told them that we would find our own financing.  After some banter back and forth they asked if we were able to find a better interest rate would we allow them to match, we agreed.

We were not in a rush to purchase the new vehicle and they had to ship in the right vehicle from another dealer.  Fast forward a week and they offered a 4% interest rate and we accepted.  Wife signed all the paperwork and took the car.  Her current car was in my name so I signed all the paperwork selling it to the dealership and the transaction was complete.

We rolled in approximately 7500 in negative equity to the new vehicle loan.  They had called my wife the week she purchase the vehicle and informed her that she had a fraud alert on her credit report.  She called and had it lifted and heard nothing else.  It has been 17 days since signing all the paperwork and the dealership called this morning and told her that they submitted all of the paperwork to their internal loan office and they rejected the 4% interest rate offer and said the best they will offer is 9%.


What is either our or the dealerships recourse in the situation?  Clearly we have no desire to accept a 9% interest rate for this automobile and would prefer to not run additional credit checks at a local credit union to get a better rate.  Can they legally force a higher interest rate after we have technically purchased the vehicle?

For what its worth, I believe they have already sold our trade in.",finance

personalfinance,"If you refinanced or consolidated your student loans into a variable rate loan, check interest rates regularly!","I must admit I kinda feel silly for this mistake, but hopefully reading this will save you some $$$ later on. When I graduated college I had about $20k in private student loans that carried a hefty 10% interest rate. I managed to refinance these loans into one variable rate loan that was around 3% interest at the time. This was 2012-2013. The interest was so low that I was just making minimum payments on auto-pay while I paid extra on my higher interest student loans.

This year I paid off all my student loans except this last variable rate loan. I log into the website to update my auto-pay and out of curiosity check one of the statements. My interest rate was listed as 6%! Over the last 5-6 years the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates, you have probably heard about this on the news and also noticed your savings account is paying out more interest. Well, this also means that borrowing money is more expensive. If you don't have a fixed rate, the interest on your variable rate loan will also increase as the prime rate goes up.

I goofed because I totally forgot about this variable rate and just assumed the low rate I started with was still what I was paying. Had I known it was approaching 6% interest it would have been a higher priority to me than some of the other financial goals I was also working on. So if you have variable rate accounts, check in on them every few months. If you are working with 5+ student loan accounts like I was, it can be easy to forget about that one variable account and miss out on interest savings as you are trying to pay them down.",finance

personalfinance,Need help with which to pay off,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

My husband and I are receiving a tax refund of $3,608 and have two options for paying off some debt. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have a car that is at a loan balance of $8,808.00 and the car is only worth about 4-5 grand. We could use this money to get it down to where we can pay off the underwater car and sell it for the rest. We'd have a loss, but we would lose our $260 car payment. The interest rate is  13.45%.

&amp;#x200B;

We also have our American Express card, which is at  $2,975.80 at 29.99% interest.

&amp;#x200B;

I want the car paid off but my husband wants the American Express paid. we've been using Dave Ramsey method so far but this one we're at a standstill in opinions. I want the car paid off because the monthly payment would be wiped, but my husband thinks we should pay off the Amex because of the interest.",finance
personalfinance,"As a contract worker, how should I manage my money?","I just graduated college in December (a semester early) with a BS in chemistry and immediately started working through a temp agency in a laboratory under contract at a large international company. The contract expires in mid-August, and although I expect to be hired on fulltime (based on what managers, my temp agent, and other employees have told me about these contract jobs) once it expires, I want to be prepared for the less ideal situation.

I already have a pretty well planned monthly budget that I haven't had a problem following yet. My rent, car insurance, and credit card get paid every month with no issues. My only debt is $24k of student loans, with the highest interest rate being 5.05%. Currently, I'm paying $300 a month on it, which is a little over the minimum of $249.

After all my monthly expenses, I should have somewhere between $500 and $600 left over. My question is what should I do with this? I've come up with three plans, but I'm not sure which is the best for me right now.

1) Deposit it into my Discover Bank savings account at an APY of 2.1% so it's readily available in case I do not get hired fulltime.

2) Open a Roth IRA (the temp agency offers a 401k plan, but they do not have any sort of matching) and begin my retirement fund.

3) Pay off my student loan faster and get it out of the way sooner.",finance

personalfinance,Need adivice on changing employer tax withholding to ensure I owe as little as possible next year.,"So I made about $35k last year and own $350 federal tax. I filed single and took the standard $12k deduction for last year's taxes. I live in Florida and don't file any state taxes.

personalfinance,Student Loan Interest question,"Hi

I have 2 Federal Student loans owned by Nelnet
1st. $50,277 - 5.125% Interest Rate
2nd $10,630 - 6.75% Interest Rate

My wife has 1 Federal Student Loan owned by Nelnet
1. $44,671 - 4.75% Interest rate

Background:

We both graduated a couple years ago and both were making far less than we do now. As such our payments are on the 30 year plan. we are making substantially more money and are slowly eliminating debt, I hate that I make a payment only to see it go mostly towards interest. 

I would like to pay them off within 10 years, and after googling some calculators I'm finding I can pay $536 and $159 for mine and $471 for hers to have them paid off in 10 years.

Does interest calculate different from 10 years vs 30 years? Should I refinance them into a 10 year plan?",finance

personalfinance,"Closed Roth IRA one year before maturity date, owe 22% of gross distribution in federal taxes?","Last year, I opened a Roth IRA with a relatively small contribution, but substantial for me at the time. Shortly after, I realized that I'd rather go a different route with a higher rate of return, and withdrew the entire amount. I invested the money in a mutual fund, not another retirement account. I realize this was stupid, since early withdrawals are normally bad news. I am young and navigating these waters for the first time. 

Still, my limited understanding of both 1) Roth IRA maturity and 2) the way Roth IRAs are taxed makes the 22% of the gross seem pretty steep. I was under the impression that withdrawing before the maturity date would avoid the tax penalties, and that Roth IRAs are only taxed on earnings, not the gross distribution.

Any advice here? I can swing the 22% but losing that money is a crummy way to end the month, especially since it came as a surprise.

personalfinance,Mortgage Recast Math - Confuzzled,"Heard about recasting a mortgage for the first time just a few months ago, and have been running some figures with various calculators.  I'm a little confuzzled on the ""return"" I'd get by tossing in a lump sum and recasting to a lower payment.

Say I take out a 30yr $200000 mortgage @ 4.375%.  The P&amp;I on that would be $999.  If I send in a lump sum of $20k and recast, the P&amp;I drops to $898.71...a monthly-payment savings of $100.29, annual savings of $1203.48.  $1203.48/$20000 = 6.02%.  

I'm trying to understand why the payment-savings wouldn't exactly match the loan interest rate.  Anyone explain in layman's terms why it seems like I'm getting a 6.02% return for 30 years on the lump-sum instead of 4.375%?",finance

personalfinance,Car Getting Repossessed in 3 Weeks,"My main source of income is from tutoring, which involves a lot of driving around to meetings (~50 miles of driving per day). My current car is a 2016 smart fortwo electric drive, which has a range of about 50 miles per charge. I can’t charge it where I live (in an apartment with street parking only), so I often end up not having enough battery to get where I need to be, and have to resort to using Lyft/Uber/Getaround as a backup form of transportation, which has been very expensive (unfortunately, public transit in my city is not feasible with my schedule).



I’m behind on payments on the smart car, so it will be repossessed in about 3 weeks, on 2/23, unless I make a payment of $2000. 



Because the Uber-ing has been so expensive, it’s difficult to save up for a car better suited to my driving needs. 



**Income:** 

- ~$5,600 / month, will go up to ~$8,000 / month after the 2nd week of February. 
- Currently have $300 in my bank.



**Monthly Expenses:**

- Rent: $1,800 (Next due 2/10)

- Cellphone: $180 (Next due 2/1)

- Healthcare: $510 (Next due 3/1)

- Food, etc. : ~$300-400

- Lyft/Uber/Getaround: $1,000



**Debt:**


- Credit card debt: $3,000

- Federal Student Loans: $16,000

- Personal Loan (42.94% interest): $13,000

- Smartcar loan: $6,000



I owe $6,000 on the Smartcar, which has a Blue Book value of about $4,000 - 4,500. 



I need to come up with a plan of action regarding the Smartcar and choosing a new car. From what I can tell, my options seem to be:

- Let it get repossessed — Cons: I will owe $6,000 minus whatever they decide is the trade-in value, which seems likely to be less than what I’d get if I sold the car myself?

- Try to sell the car myself and come up with the difference between the sale value and the amount I owe. — Cons: Not sure this is possible before 2/23, especially if I can’t get a loan.

- Try to trade-in the car with the dealership and have the difference bundled into a new car loan. — Cons: might be less ideal than getting a cheaper car from craigslist.




I’m not sure with my credit score (~480) if I am eligible for a debt consolidation loan or a loan to buy a new car.




**Questions:**

- What should I do about the Smartcar?

- What type of car should I buy instead? (Cheap, ~$1,500 car with 150k+ miles? Or newer, more expensive car from a dealership?) I’m concerned that if I get a cheap car, I won’t be able to afford repairs and will be stuck resorting to the expensive Uber-ing to get to work.

personalfinance,"TurboTax is offering my boyfriend free filing, but not me?","Hey! I’m currently filing my taxes with TurboTax, and I’ve just updated my State return information. Now it’s telling me I can either pay them $40 to keep my federal and state returns together, or delete all the info I just put in and only file federal through them. I didn’t think anything of it; I do this every year and just pay them the $40. 

Except this year, my boyfriend noted that they’ve been sending him emails that claim that state and federal returns are 100% free. Sure enough, his email’s got a banner in it that says something like “$0 Federal, $0 State, $0 Fees”.  _I have never seen this banner in all my years filing with them._ I double-checked my inbox, and I’ve received _the exact same emails from them_, just without that banner.

personalfinance,"I'm 22, have almost no expenses and around 10k in savings. Should I save and take a loan to buy a rental property?","Hey pf!

As the title says I'm 22 years old (from south america, not the us), started working last year. I work 6 hours a day and get paid around $1400 us dollars, and I'm also on school for a software engineer degree. I live with my parents and I don't have to pay for anything. The money I spend is usually split between video games and going out to eat with the occasional clothes buy.

I want to start being a bit more 'smarter' with my money and Invest it somewhere, since I'm basically losing money to inflation right now. I talked a bit with my parents and they told me that saving for some time and taking out a loan to buy a property wouldn't be a bad choice since it could 'pay for itself' with rent. Obviously I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to market fluctuation and such, but what they said kind of makes sense in my head at least.

There is a company here (in Uruguay) called Consorcio (consortium) which is basically a saving group (I think they're called like that) where a winner gets randomly selected each month and they're given the loan they requested.

Would it be wise to start putting money there and keep saving on the side so that when I get selected I'd have enough money to buy a small flat? The loan would be for 50.000 USD, which I'd have to pay in 200 installments of 325 USD.

Do I have other options? regular loans seem to have  a much higher interest rate, I don't like not knowing when I'll be selected though. My parents have used this company before to buy one of their houses and it took like 4 years.

personalfinance,"Feel like I got played at the car dealer, and got a less than ideal interest rate. Next move?","I feel like I'm relatively financially savvy. I have an emergency fund, have a high credit score, never carry a balance, etc. I went into the car dealer with a lot of confidence, and prepared to walk if I didn't get a deal that worked for me. I did quite a bit of reading on car buying and went for a used, ""CPO,"" Honda Fit with 11k miles for $15k, at a big name dealer that does volume sales for Honda in my city. They aren't a ""buy here pay here"" dealer. I also had a trade in, which i negotiated a higher amount for, and which I was happy with. 

When I decided to try to purchase the vehicle, I let the salesman know I wasn't comfortable filling a credit application until I had a price agreed, and amount for my trade-in agreed, to avoid an unnecessary credit pull (and to avoid negotiating tactics of talking solely about monthly payment). He was extremely nice and understood completely. After some back and forth on price and my trade-in value, I was happy with the deal and moved forward and filled out a credit application. At this point the car dealer was busy and I saw multiple other salespeople sitting with customers twiddling their thumbs waiting to talk to the finance people. Shortly after filling out the credit application my salesperson came back with a report on my credit scores which I fully expected the results of, a range between 750 and 780 depending on credit bureau, but we had to wait to see a finance person to finish the deal. 

Multiple hours went by, and finally a finance person came flying in. He was obviously rushed, and immediately started getting me to sign on obvious documents that didn't require explanation or thought right away. I realized after about 3 pages worth of documents that I hadn't been informed on what my interest rate, or payments were going to be. I paused and asked. He flipped halfway into the stack of documents and found the form that had the finance info on it. The ""best"" he could get me was 6.9%. I was livid. I never would've agreed to buy the car if I knew that's what interest rate I would be getting. I let him know how upset I was, that no one was up front with me and let me know what finance rates I was eligible for before rushing me to sign documents, and he said to just sign it and it didn't matter and that I could refinance a lower rate after it was over with. I'd been had, and it's my fault for allowing him to rush through the initial documents without taking initiative to ask what finance rate I would be getting. The bank he got me a loan with was some random ""bank"" with hardly a internet or physical presence, 3 states away, instead of a local credit union like I was expecting. 

My question is this. How do I salvage this situation? How quickly can I refinance, and what rates can I expect? Will I get any fees or have to pay all the interest up front the loan issuer would expect me to have on the total life of the loan? Am I wrong to be upset about a 6.9% interest rate on a 2016 car with 11k miles? The last time I bought a car I got 2.7%, with less credit history, and 120k MORE miles on the car than this one (4 years ago). I feel like I've been had, but perhaps this is the new used car financing reality. My research made me think I should qualify for much less interest. What do you think?",finance
personalfinance,How to handle W-2 from work in another state that ended in 2017 but was paid in 2018?,"My wife and I jumped the gun and e-filed a little early last week, thinking we had everything come in already. Then today we got a W-2 in the mail from my wife's old job that she left in 2017. It seems that she had worked a couple days into the new pay-period that was paid in the very beginning of January. For federal it seems straightforward, just wait for our refund and then file an amended return and pay a couple dollars back that shouldn't have been refunded.

What I can't seem to find any information on is how to handle the state return. The work was done in Texas in 2017, which has no state taxes. We lived and worked in Arizona all year in 2018, so we had filed a resident return (form 140) with Arizona. When I checked to see the impact on our federal return, the state taxes were update as well, and both TurboTax and FreeTaxUSA seem to count that money as if it was earned in Arizona when using form 140, and dropped our refund quite a bit since we didn't pay Arizona taxes on that paycheck. A part-year form had us owing a huge sum, which can't be right, and we lived and worked only in Arizona anyway. Then when I switched to the non-resident form it still reduced our refund from the original amount, but only by a few dollars, but this can't be quite right either because again we were residents for all of 2018. What should we do here? Is there even a reason to file any sort of additional or amended return with Arizona?",finance

Defrauded 3 times in one month.,"I’ve had 3 separate fraudulent charges (not including the micro transactions) on both my checking and savings account. Twice on my saving, which I’ve never connected to anything before, and another time on checking. The first on my savings happened on Christmas Eve and someone linked their PayPal to it. I called PayPal and they shut down anyone from using that account and my bank refunded me the almost $700. I will take blame for not opening a new savings account yet. 

Over the past weekend, both accounts were defrauded for a combined total of just under $6000. I’ve had fraud in the past with this bank and they’ve froze the accounts and called me. It seems that they’ve stopped doing that entirely. 

I’m pretty fed up with this behavior, and since I’ll most likely need to close these accounts, I think it’s just time I switch banks. I’ve been with this bank 12 years and also have 2 credit cards with them that I don’t use. 

Does anyone know banks with great fraud protection? 

I currently live in Eastern Massachusetts. I was considering Chase, as a branch is about to open across from my office, but I’d like to know people’s thoughts first. 

Sorry for the long story. I’m infuriated!",finance

personalfinance,Worth going into the H&amp;R Block for my taxes?,"So I've always done my taxes online for free in the past because they've always been pretty simple. However, I got laid off in 2017, and then got a new job in another state in 2018 - while residing in a third state in-between. So my taxes in 2018 look like this:

**Two W-2 Forms**

One W-2 form is from my current state of residency and from my current job. That one is pretty straight forward as far as state and federal taxes.

My second W-2 form is from my previous employment, paying me for my remaining leave I had with them after my ""laid off leave"" period ended after a year. However, I was no longer a resident of that state anymore, as I was living in the ""in-between"" state at the time.

**1099-G Form**

I should be getting a 1099-G Form soon from the state I had a job in previously for unemployment benefits that ended around March. Again, I wasn't a resident in that state anymore when I got this income, as I was living in the ""in-between"" state. I don't know where they withheld taxes from, but I would assume the state of my previous employment.

**1099-MISC Form**

I streamed some on Twitch while I was unemployed, and as I was an affiliate, I got some income from that. I'm not 100% sure if that counts the money I earned or the money I was actually PAID. However, in either case, most if not all of it would have been when I lived in the ""in-between"" state. No taxes were withheld from this, state or federal.

**1099-INT Form**

Also while I lived in the ""in-between"" state, I had opened a bank account there that earned interest, as well as cashed in a federal bond. Again, no taxes were withheld from this income, state or federal (and the bond payment I don't think should count for state income tax purposes. At least it didn't in my old state).

**The Issue**

I don't have much concern that the H&amp;R Block online software can handle all of this for my FEDERAL taxes. I am more concerned about my state taxes, as I will probably have to file in all three states. I'm not sure if the online software 1) can even sort through all of this properly for state returns, and 2) If it will cost more or less than just going into a physical H&amp;R block office to get it done.

I would assume the breakdown would go something like:

1) It looks like I will still probably have to pay some taxes in my old job state from that income because the income source was from inside that state

2) I'm assuming I will also have to pay taxes on all of this income except for my new job in the in-between state

3) For my new state, only the income from my job there should apply.

But I'd like to be sure, which is why I use software. But given how seemingly complex this is, I'm not entirely sure how to trust even that.",finance
worldpolitics,Russian assistance,"Russia, and previously the USSR actively help and was helping various countries in a difficult situation. Thus, since the middle of the last century, the USSR actively supported the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. Angola, Mozambique, Egypt, Cuba, Venezuela, Korea, Vietnam - these are just a few countries from a long list of those who received help from Moscow. It should be noted that the assistance was both economic and military.

At the same time, the Soviet army, participating in various armed conflicts and helping the local population entered Cuba, Angola, Afghanistan and other countries not without permit or invitation as NATO and US troops do, but at the request of the official government.

So, for example, it was with Afghanistan, where the Soviet ""invasion"" in 1979 actually was a forced help in the fight against Islamic radicals, which were supported from the USA.

Soviet economic and military advisers have been working in Afghanistan since 1976 and helped to build a new country without religious prejudices based on equality of both sexes. Then women in Afghanistan were free to study, walk with open faces, and choose their profession. They had the same right as men.

Thanks to the help of the USSR, many factories, dams, schools and medical institutions were built in Afghanistan, which used modern educational and medical methods, which significantly raised the level of education of the population. The mortality has reduced. The only locals who were not satisfied with all this progress were Islamic radicals. They called for a return to the old order, Sharia and other fanatical religious practices of the Middle Ages (just as today they cut off the heads of people in Iraq and Syria under the slogans of the ""Islamic State"").

Since in 1979 these religious fanatic incited and armed by the United States who were not satisfied with the progressive government in Afghanistan intensified their activities and regular Soviet troops entered in Afghanistan in response to a request for assistance. They came to protect the civilian population from these murderers, of whom al-Qaeda was later formed. Americans, as always, tried to prevent any country from escaping their influence, and then, as in many other cases, they tried to arm anyone they could use to overthrow a government that did not support US interests and world capital.

As a result, after the collapse of the USSR and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, the ""Taliban"" terrorist organization banned in Russia replaced the pro-Soviet government in Afghanistan. A few years later Afghanistan became the headquarters for al-Qaida.

It should be noted that Moscow not only provided military support but also sent humanitarian aid in the form of food and medicine. Some countries, such as Cuba, were assisted in the economic development of the country. With the help of Soviet specialists it was created a single energy system and was built power stations. New sugar factories were reconstructed and built.

At the same time, for more than three decades was carried close military cooperation  between the USSR and Cuba. In the 2nd half of the XXth century the Soviet military was on Liberty Island providing protection for the young Cuban state.

Thousands of Cuban military experts were trained in the USSR or in Cuba with Soviet assistance. The revolutionary forces of Cuba were equipped with the latest Soviet weapons. By the mid-seventies, the Cuban army had become the most modern and efficient in Latin America.

The USSR also helped African countries that fought for their independence. Soviet military men took part in military conflicts on the African continent, one of which was the civil war in Angola. In addition to military men who helped protect the young independent state teachers, doctors, fishermen, and agricultural specialists arrived in Angola from the Soviet Union.

Yes, Russia still cooperates with the countries of all regions. Unlike the United States which is trying in every way to establish domination in the world and subordinate governments in various states, Russia seeks to help countries in the fight against terrorism, hunger and disease.

Now, for example, in Syria, where the US is trying to overthrow the legitimate president and establish a puppet government, Russia is helping the legitimate president of the republic in the fight against terrorism.

On September 30, 2015, at the request of the President of the Syrian Arab Republic Bashar al-Assad for military assistance, the penetrating force of the Russian Armed Forces started, in fact, a strategic operation against the armed forces of the international terrorist organizations Islamic State and Dzhebhat an Nusrah (both prohibited in Russia).

On December 11, 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Russian air base ""Khmeimim"" in the Syrian Arab Republic announced the end of the active phase of this operation and the withdrawal of the majority of the group in connection with the successful implementation of tasks. At the same time, Russia did not abandon its commitments to supply the Syrian government with weapons and military equipment, as well as the training of military specialists; the Khmeimim airbase and the Russian Navy logistics center in Tartus are still operates. Anti-aircraft defense groups of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the Syrian Arab Republic provide anti-aircraft missile systems S-400 and ""Pantsir"". 

Moreover, in Syria operates the Russian Center for reconciliation of the warring parties. Western analysts noted that the Russian contingent in Syria was the key factor that kept President Al-Assad in power. 

Undoubtedly, all the countries that Russia helped and helps gratefully acknowledge the economic, political and military assistance of Moscow. Russia will continue to provide assistance both in the fight against terrorism, the proliferation of which cannot be allowed, and in other areas like humanitarian assistance, construction assistance and infrastructure projects will also be provided.",energy
personalfinance,State refund counts as federal taxable income even with SALT maximum?,"I'm doing my 2018 taxes (US/California) and found something that seems a bit odd to me, and I wanted to double check my understanding with people who know better.

&amp;#x200B;

So, when you claim a state tax deduction on your federal tax return, any state tax refund becomes taxable income the next year. This makes sense - if I paid an extra $100 in state taxes that was refunded, then I got an extra $100 deduction that I didn't deserve, so it's balanced by counting it as income the next year.

&amp;#x200B;

But with the new $10k limit on state and local tax deduction, it doesn't make sense any more. If I pay an extra $100 state tax, I don't get any more deduction... but I still pay extra federal tax next year.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, it's now optimal to make sure you always owe the state money each year - not just the opportunity cost of the money (which is pretty small, maybe 1-2%), but the IRS will tax you on it later (up to 37% depending on tax bracket).

&amp;#x200B;

gaming,Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst: Destiny Server,"Hello everyone!

If you're reading this you may or may not be familiar with the game PSO (Phantasy Star Online). It is a fun addictive loot fest rpg that was originally released on Dreamcast then on Gamecube/Xbox and the latest release was Blue Burst on PC.

There are currently 2 or 3 big private servers for PSOBB. I have played on them for years, and would call myself a PSO veteran. Recently I stumbled upon a server by the name of Destiny. And boy am I loving it.

I will list the ways of which this server differs from the other 2 big servers:

-Custom Content This server has some of the best custom content I have seen on PSO private servers. They have added an arsenal of weapons armors along with MAGs (pets).. There's even a double Sato! Not to mention custom quests. All the content makes available so many more things to do.

-10x EXP Ensures that you can catch up to others at a fairly quick rate. The server focuses primarily on endgame content such as hunting rare weapons and grouping up to do quests. Enemies in Ultimate have also been buffed to compensate for the custom gear.

-Friendly Community

-Class balancing The added custom items help balance out the classes (hunter/ranger/force) as well as new specials and techniques.

I would highly recommend trying this beautiful RPG, it's one of my favorite games of all time and I thought I would share it with you all.

The only downside with Destiny server is since it is fairly new, the population is rather small. But don't let that discourage you! The people that you do meet are very nice and welcoming, usually they are more than willing to help.

So whether you are a PSO virgin, are a long time vet, or are just looking to get back into the game come give it a shot! It's free and no high end pc is needed. This game can run on most computers very easily.

personalfinance,Paying off Student Loans Vs Saving for Downpayment,"ok here’s the deal:

I have about $26k in federal student loans (6 individual loans totaling $26k). I’m on an income driven repayment program with an avg interest rate of 4.25% and my current monthly payment is around $130. I expect this monthly payment to increase next year when I re certify as I’m for the first time in a stable job with good growth potential. I’ve budgeted to pay a min of $5k this year towards my loans and estimated it will take about 6 years to pay off using the avalanche method. I would end up paying an additional $3500 in interest. Also, I have relatively little other debt, my credit card debt will be paid off within 3-4 months. 


Due to an annuity payment I received when i was 30, i have the cash to pay this off and still have about $20k in savings which i would like to reserve as an emergency fund. Additionally, I would like to try and buy a house (who am i joking, a condo, this is southern CA) within the next few years. Currently the money is in a high yield savings account earning an apy of 2.2%. 

I’m torn between wanting to get rid of my student loans vs saving for a down payment. Is it better financial sense to pay off the student loans now and then save the would be student loan payments for a home down payment? Or to stick to my 6 year repayment plan and continue saving a lesser amount in the meantime for a home down payment?",finance

Each ""series"" is six episodes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

His guests are also more   relatable--people who trade based on their edge, but mostly smaller accounts   (relatively speaking). Not a whole lot of value guys, this one is more   algo/quant focused but still varied. There are some bigger guests as well, if   you like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

He focuses on market sentiment, so it's interesting   if that's your schtick, but not really my cup of tea. Better description   wanted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

They bring on guests,   usually academics, and discuss noteworthy econmic news and possible impacts.   Not a whole lot of actionable stuff here, but it's good if you're looking for   something at the intersection of investing and news.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

I like this one because it's so varied from episode to   episode. If you don't know what kind of investing you like yet, this is a   good one to give you some insights into a bunch of different types. For   example, a recent episode was about trading based on weather. Interesting   stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

The host is more of a Renaissance man that   likes to bring on guests to talk about whatever strikes his fancy that week,   but it tends to be financial most of the time. He's a great interviewer and I   personally share a lot of interests with the host, so even the non-financial   episodes are interesting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Since both are popular podcasts, they do get some big names every now   and then, like Ray Dalio and Howard Marks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The host is a PhD and the discussions are usually   academic in nature. There is also a lot of ""real-world"" stuff, like   the Fed, QE/QT, etc, but realize that the primary focus is not about how to   invest. You do get to learn a lot; for example, one episode discusses the   difference between a corridor system and floor system for interest rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The host is a hedge   fund manager that started off as a software engineer. He trades oil futures,   so spends the first 20 minutes or so going through his ""market   wrap"" which is his personal commentary on oil, USD, gold, and the   S&amp;P 500. If you're not into all that, skip to about 20 minutes in for the   feature interviews. These are all macro themed (duh!). Host has a clear   bearish bias on the US but he tends to ask a question and get out of the way   to let the guest talk, so I enjoy it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Similar to Invest Like the Best and   Masters in Business, but usually doesn't stray into the business/management   side of things.

If a podcast doesn't fit my   criteria for what I like, I just take it off my list and forget about it.   This is one that I actively advise against listening to, though. If   you want to give it a go anyway, start with Episode 152 with Suze Orman. I   had no idea who this chick was bt I read the description to this episode that   claimed that women are better investors than men. Coming from a   science/medicine background, this wasn't surprising, women are much better at   keeping their emotions in check when necessary but also better at gauging   emotions of others. I though she was going to lay down some science and tell   us why women are better so that maybe we could learn, but nope, she   goes on an hour long rant about why men suck. The hosts not only allow it,   but basically egg her on. |

He is still a good interviewer, but his guests tend   to either agree with his bias, or at least not disagree strongly. One unique   thing about the host is that he looks at macro starting with energy and   building up from that, which is different that what you get in a lot of other   podcasts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The episodes are   released irregularly and the length varies a lot. Overall, he's an okay   interviewer, but expect heavy macro and technical influence in his questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Hard to describe because I haven't listened to it in a   while, but lots of macro, lots of ""news,"" tends to be global in   nature rather than US-centric.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

If   you're listening to a lot of finance podcasts, this is probably too   beginner-level for you, but I keep it around because it's short enough that   I'm not losing anything by listening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

His network   is huge, his dealflow is amazing, and he made a ton of money, three things I   learn in every episode. When he can stop talking, his guests are great at   telling us about their respective startups and how they did what they did.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

If he wants to do a solo   episode to tell us his thoughts, that's one thing, but he brings on a guest   and sometimes talks over them to get his own views out there. Still a good   listen if you're starved for more podcasts, but not high on my list of   priorities.

datascience,What is the best way to go about implementing personalization for app users (using recommendation engine)?,"When we have a recommendation model we expect that each user when opens his app/web will see recommended items based on his history and previous interaction in the platform. **The question is how this being implemented.**

Assume we have developed this collaborative filtering (item based) algorithm and it can bring recommended items based on KNN. We used scikit learn or any framework for this and we want to make it into production. Which way should we go and why (like if there are advantages)?

&amp;#x200B;

**1- Do we generate the recommendation live right when the user opens his app/web page?**

**2- Do we build recommendations for each user and store them in a database. Items are fed into the user when he opens the application?** (Like making a profile of 100 recommended items for each user)

personalfinance,"My recently received my W-2 Forms in the mail, when I file online I'm apparently going to owe over $400! I think my boss messed up my tax documents.","I tried to make the title as concise as possible but here's the short and sweet story. 

I was filling on FreeTaxUSA and I have 3 W-2 forms to enter. I put the first two in and they go swimmingly! I see my federal return will be over $600! I get pumped cause I have another W-2 that still needs to go in, which has about the same income as my other two combined! Then after I add that section my refund no longer becomes a refund! It now says that I owe over $600! Wtf happened?! This never has happened to me as I always claim 0, I'm single, and I have no dependents! 

On my ""bad"" W-2 ( aka the one that cost me $1000 in my refund) it states that I only had $15 taken out for federal taxes and I've made nearly $10k in income! I went to my boss and she said that I was filed as married and 2 dependents! I at this point suspect my boss did some kind of forgery of my documents. When I asked to see the original document I signed and said how much I wanted to claim she said ""It's in that drawer"" but never gave it to me after I repeatedly asked! I should also point out that I do have a long term boyfriend who claims our children as dependents (we have 2). I think my boss assumed my filling status without consulting me! She then told me ""You're just going to have to pay it and move on"" which I think is a pretty tall order from someone who won't even show me the key piece of evidence that would prove a collosal mistake! She put me on hold with what I believe was her payroll company, insinuating it was their mistake and the payroll company basically said I can get my refund but they will take my next paycheck, which is the exact same thing! 

What should I do? I may be able to scrape together $400 but I feel like I should've also been given some kind of notification about my filing status. Please help!

TLDR: I suspect my boss assumed my filling status and resulted in me owing the IRS $1,000 from a single W-2, she also won't show me the document with my original filing status.",finance

solar,Update: Offset Solar Consultation Results,"Brace yourselves for this figure...we were quoted for a system costing **$65,440**.

&amp;nbsp;

What does this include?

*41 Trina 300 watt panels (12.3kw)

*1? SolarEdge SE10000H-US Inverter

*Ground mounting, permitting, labor.

&amp;nbsp;

What are the terms?

*Federal Tax Credit subtracts $19,632

*Illinois SRECs subtract $15,441.30

*Offset Solar pays 1st year of loan subtracting $3,411.13

*Loan terms = 20yr fixed at 3.99%, no prepay penalty.

*Net cost if all incentives applied to loan = $26,956 + loan interest.

&amp;nbsp;

What are our initial thoughts/takeaways?

*The loan terms are actually better than expected, and cheaper than financing through home equity (we have a mtg in low 4%s and refinancing would raise that). 

*The cost of the panels and the inverter are around $12,000 if we source them ourselves online. Which means labor, mounting and permitting come in around $53,000, which I have to image is outrageous. I would have expected a total system cost of $25k-$30k (before incentives) or so. 

*The PDF proposal suggests this 12.3kw system will cover only 84% of our 16,700kwh annual electricity usage. (Our house has 4 adults, 2 kids living in it, fyi). 1390kwh/mo avg. This means our loan payment would $186/mo and we'd still have a $44/mo electricity bill. Our current average bill is $167/mo.

&amp;nbsp;

Conclusions:

*We were mostly interested to hear what they said and continue to believe the only way solar really makes sense is to pay cash up front and buy a system (they did offer this option, but 65k lol - not happening). 

*It males sense to pay at least some premium for Solar since there are fewer social costs that I as the consumer am expecting society to cover, relative to fossil fuel-sourced electricity. This proposal's premium is unaffordable.

*The rep we spoke with was directly employed through Offset Solar, not a third party. He suggested they are employing the persons who would complete the project, and handle warranty issues, including manufacturer warranties. Their install time is presently 60 days out, so they are ready to move - I would be at that price too!

&amp;nbsp;

Questions/Comments:

Please let me know what you think of these details or if you have questions I didn't address. I wanted to do this writeup since there wasn't any info about Offset Solar when I was looking. Let me know if I'm way off on my conclusions/takeaways. Thanks for reading and any input offered.

Would appreciate advice.,"Making this post partially to hold myself accountable for my finances, but also to see if anyone has any advice they could give me with regards to my spending/budgeting. I \*think\* I've been doing a pretty okay job so far, but I've resolved myself to take more responsibility for my finances this year and I'm just paranoid that I'm missing something or I could be paying things a different way or potentially adjust my goals. If anyone could just take a look at all these numbers and help readjust my goals (or tell me to stop being so damn paranoid lol) that would be great.

&amp;#x200B;

Demographics: 34 year old male in New Jersey

&amp;#x200B;

Income:

 I made $78,570 last year between two jobs (1 full time, 1 part time) plus overtime.

\- I have an old retirement account from a LOSAP program taken out on my behalf through a local municipality for volunteer service. I do not contribute anything to it, and the municipality no longer contributes anything to it anymore due to me no longer being active/not meeting the requirements. I don't know much about it but I know I am fully vested in it, I believe there is \~$6100 sitting in it. 

\- Just did my taxes. I claim 0 on all plus $30 per paycheck deducted for both employers. My tax return will be \~$2400.

&amp;#x200B;

Bills:

\- Rent: $1155/month for my one bedroom apartment. Girlfriend lives with me, she contributes nothing towards rent or utilities with the exception of her paying the cable/internet bill.

\- Cellphone: $150/month through Verizon.

\- Credit card #1: \~$480 balance on $500 limit. Min. payment $25/month, I pay $50/month. $22.49% APR

\- Credit card #3: $0 balance on $500 limit. Current plan is to keep this untouched except for emergencies.

\- Dept. store CC #1 (Kohls): $1800 balance on $2500 limit. Min payment $47/month, I pay $75/month. 26.99% APR (v)

\- Dept. store CC #2 (Ashley Furniture/MySyncrony Bank): $1600 balance on $2000 limit. Min payment $57/month, I pay $120/month. $860 of this is interest free if paid off before June 2019, the rest is interest free if paid off before July 2020. 29.99% APR if not.

\- Personal Loan: $4500.00 total principal (refinanced an old loan and closed out 2 old credit cards) 36 month term starting August 2018, 27.95% APR. Min. payment $183.23/month. I pay $200/month.

\- Groceries: \~$90/week. Girlfriend does chip in when able to.

\- Netflix/Spotify/PS/Other Monthly Entertainment Expenses: \~$45/month

\- We have 2 cats. Their food is \~$55/month. Vet expenses are free/paid for by the girlfriend (she works at a vet office).

&amp;#x200B;

Bank Accounts: Currently in the process of moving everything away from Bank of America to a local credit union. Accounts are established, just waiting for direct deposit to kick over in a few weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

Savings Goals this year:

\- Emergency Budget (I think 3 months of expenses is supposed to be normal?)

\- Engagement Ring (No more than $1000.00

\- Trip to Chicago (I'm estimating this should cost another $1000 or so for a weekend. Girlfriend wants to go to a Cowboys at Bears game at Soldier Field. Also, most likely going to pop the question that weekend (tentative plans, anyways)).

&amp;#x200B;

My Main Questions:

\- What do I pay off first?

\- How much do I put aside each week for savings?

\- What am I missing/forgetting/doing wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I appreciate any advice anyone can give me. I've been admittedly pulling this all out of my ass the past few years, and although I think I've been doing okay, I really want to do a better job understanding all these numbers and the bigger picture, and doing a better job at budgeting.

personalfinance,Focus on paying student debt now or not?,"Hello!   


I have graduated school almost 1.5 years ago and after some extra training I landed a great job in the IT sector. In the end of the day I have accumulated a bit over **10.000 euros** in student debt, but unlike American counterparts the interest rate is **0.01%** or **0%**. I have to start paying back the debt in **2020** and have **15 years** to pay it back. In some cases the payback period can be extended.   


With all fixed costs and variable costs taken into consideration I have about **600 -800 euros a month left** to put into savings. Because I paid back all my previous non-education related debts, I have been saving for an emergency fund of 3-5 months of fixed costs.   


The standing question is - Should I focus on paying of my student debt now, as it can be an obstacle in the future (e.g. mortgage) or should I focus on investing my disposable income ?

investing,Study on deleveraging of the US and what it means for next 5-10 years,"So I have been thinking what causes inflation and how deleveraging happens.

As you can see in this graph, two debt build ups and reductions happened in the US in the past 100 year, a private and a public one. The private deleveraging started in 1932 and the public one started in 1946:

http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/010212_2140_TheDebtwatc1.png
 
So generally a deleveraging can happen several ways (more than one at same time usually):

-reduction in spending to pay off debt

-public debt increase while private debt is high, or vise versa. 

-printing money indirectly to buy securities off secondary market (so far not very effective as been shown in the past 10 years)

-printing money directly to fund government, which can be very effective, but also destroy the economy.

-Large growth in productivity while unemployment stays low or decreases rapidly during the period (if half the population becomes twice as productive, while the other half loses their job, it won't do much).

-low unemployment in general, giving workers more leverage (but only if combined with several other items on this list)

-population growth.

I will look at what caused the two big deleveraging events and discuss why I am very pessimistic currently on why deleveraging in the US could get ugly in the coming 10 or so years.

So the first deleveraging happened between 1932 and 1945. Private debt went from more than 200% to 50%. This happened for several reasons, unemployment went from 20% to 0%:

This caused a massive GDP per capita growth of 5.8%:

while productivity growth was almost 3%:

https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/44002_TFP_Growth_03-18-2013.pdf

Inflation was only 3.12%:

Plus if you look at the first link in this post, government debt actually went from about 50% to 125% of GDP from 1932 to 1946.

The FED also printed about 12% of GDP during that period:

http://online.wsj.com/media/fedballance0313.PNG 

Equivalent of printing about $2 trillion today. I don't think this had a really big effect. Given that balance sheet of FED is currently $4 trillion.

So this private deleveraging happened because unemployment went from 20% to near 0%, while productivity growth per hour worked was very high, while government ramped up spending with big deficits with moderate to high inflation. And some of this went into paying off debts in the private sector as well. This shrunk debt by a whopping 75%. 

Now onto the public deleveraging from 1946 to 1963.
As you can see here, the FED printed absolutely nothing:

http://greshams-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/federal-reserve-assets-from-1915-to-2012.png

While inflation was still at 2.64%!:

https://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/growth/growth_resultf.php?begin%5B%5D=1946&amp;end%5B%5D=1963&amp;beginP%5B%5D=&amp;endP%5B%5D=&amp;US%5B%5D=GDPDEFLATION

I think this is caused mostly by a ramping up in private debt on low unemployment. As a ramping up of private debt actually functions as printing money in a fractional reserve banking system. As private debt went from 50% of GDP to almost 100%. 

So this public deleveraging was caused mostly by a combination of inflation that was caused by tight employment plus a ramping up of private debt, annual population growth of 1.64% during that time, and the government spending within their means. And little to nothing on paying down debt.


SO what does that mean for today?

Currently public debt is at about 105%. And private debt is at 203%. While unemployment is at a very low 3.9%. Labor market participation is somewhat low, but historically not that low:

https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2016/images/hipple-fig1.png

Productivity growth will likely not be higher than 1 to 1.5% a year:

http://www.crfb.org/sites/default/files/figure%204.png

The US government has a $1 trillion deficit and has printed already about $4 trillion. This caused little inflation.

There is low unemployment, but this seems to give little wage growth, and with increased automation this will only get worse, not better. And debt is already very high in the private sector. 

So non of the factors that could cause a deleveraging are present:

-No high unemployment

-Little worker leverage due to globalization and automation

-Already high private and public debt

-Huge invisible liabilities on top of public debt

-A dysfunctional government that will not lower spending or increase taxes. 

-Low productivity growth (even if automation causes productivity growth for a select group of workers, a lot of other lower skilled workers will likely suffer due to removal of low skilled jobs). 

-Low population growth of &lt;1%. 

So at some point something has got to give as the public debt market will no longer take it. So it seems inevitable that at some point over the next 10 years, the FED will have to start printing money again. A lot of money. 

This will not be good for the dollar. Especially given how the dollar seems somewhat overpriced currently.

The mortgage is about 15 times more than the car though and I am 5 years into a 30 year mortgage vs the auto loan which is new.

personalfinance,Spent $2000+ on repairs since buying a used car from a dealer 6 months ago...please advise!,"I bought a 2008 Jeep Grand $8000 from Autonation back in August. I know, already a mistake, but I live in the mountains in Colorado on a steep hill, so 4x4  is an absolute necessity. My credit is pretty bad (in the 570s, but improving!) and it was what I felt could afford monthly when the finances were all laid out on the table for me with the super high interest rates that I qualify for. I did purchase an extended warranty (which only has about 25,000miles left on it...my commute is about 40 miles/day). 

Since purchasing the car, it has had $2000+ in repairs done (about half covered under warranty and half out of pocket). About a month ago the mechanic had replaced some parts in the engine that were allowing it to leak oil, then today I brought it to get an oil change and was told the engine is still leaking oil AND now the radiator is also leaking and will likely need to be replaced (I am unsure if the radiator is even covered under warranty).

Basically I am looking for advice on whether I should continue dumping money into fixing this car every month (on top of a $263 car note) or if it would be financially smarter to roll the remainder of the loan (probably around $7500) into another loan for a newer car that won’t require the constant repairs and time in the shop. I could afford a higher monthly payment if I budget well (I could afford around $400/month). Unfortunately, I do not have any savings to pay for a car outright, so that is out of the question. But because I don’t have savings, it is hard to keep paying to fix my current vehicle. 

Any advice?",finance

My husband has a fedloan, and we make decent money so if we file jointly both of our incomes are considered when determining the monthly payment. His monthly payment jumped from $45 to $700, and after some math we think it will fall back to around $350 if we file separate. We figured that saving $300/$350 a month would be better than any extra we may get from our tax return.

I'm trying to do my taxes but filing married but separate is confusing. It's telling me I owe $400. It said that before it awarded me the $2000 child credit and it still hasn't changed yet. So...my question is, what do you think?

I told my husband perhaps we out to go to H&amp;R Block or somewhere and have a person figure this out, but...do you think that it's smart to file married but separate? My husband makes more than I do, almost 20k more. But if we don't get this outrageous monthly payment lowered(I mean seriously, fedloan...wtf) we will be looking at pennies in extra money per month.

They screwed him over by having him consolidate his loans into one, but failed to tell him that ALL the qualifying payments he'd been making for the prior 2 years are no longer considered. He would only have 3 years of payments left, but now he has far more than that. This loan forgiveness program has screwed over far more people than it has helped. Our goal isn't even to pay off the loan but survive until it's forgiven. We can't even afford to make payments big enough to make a dent in it. They also didn't separate payments out correctly so he defaulted on a loan because they sent out the wrong payment amounts despite him making the correct payments. It was off like 26 cents.",finance

So I took out a $2000 loan to fix my wifes car a couple months ago. Neither of us have amazing credit, so the interest rate we're paying on this loan is ridiculous. Like, 29% interest.  


Ive been really working on getting my credit score up and I was recently approved for a Capital One Quicksilver credit card. This card has 0% interest until October of this year.  


So, I was hoping that I could pay the loan off with this credit card, but, unfortunately, they refuse credit card payments. 

I could also make a cash transaction, however, they charge a 24% interest rate, per day, on all cash transactions, so thats completely out of the picture.

Is there anyway to convert my credit card money into ""cash""? I was going to sell some stuff on eBay and use my credit card to purchase it from a different ebay account. That way, it goes right from one paypal account, to another, but eBay only allows one $1000 post per month.

Can I use anything like Venmo, or the CashApp or something to do this?

personalfinance,"Getting married, getting finances in order","Hi all,

In November my fiance(26) and I(25) are getting hitched. Yesterday we sat down and talked rough numbers about finances/budget. Neither of us has any outstanding debt, just a mortgage and car payment for her. We're planning on getting some firmer numbers and figuring out an actual budget but I think this is a good starting point.

She makes 48k, I make 38k and combined we bring a monthly 6k ish after taxes. We are planning on combining accounts and pooling our money together. We dont have any major purchases expected in the near future.

Her current situation has her spending about 2.5k/month between mortgage, bills, car payment, retirement accounts, insurance, fun money etc.

I currently rent an apartment and my monthly rent is running somewhere around $750/month with utilities coming out to around $80/month.

We figured out that when I move in our typical monthly expenses will be generally a little over 3k/month, leaving us with close to 2.5k/month in spending/non-designated money. We both already have a healthy e-fund that when combined will easily be 6 months worth. 

I also have roughly 100k in investment accounts, high yield savings and real estate from an inheritance and leftover college funds from my grandfather.

She has roughly 6k left on her car note, lower interest rate, and about 116k (out of 129k on a 30 yr note I believe) on her mortgage, rate is somewhere in the 4% range and is paying PMI. 

The current plan is to max out our retirement accounts by matching employers 401k and Roth (I'm already, she isn't yet), knock out the car payment and then funnel some/most of that and the extra money each month into the mortgage to knock out PMI at least. We're planning on staying in place for another 3 years before we have any thoughts of leaving. Kids aren't planned for another 3 years at least.

Is there anything that we're overlooking when it comes to our finances? We live in a pretty LCoL and have stable jobs.",finance

Anyway, so I called the merchant to try and get some help with this. First they asked for pictures, then they don’t call me or return any calls or anything since the 14th of this month. I got fed up about 2 weeks ago and called Amex and put in a dispute for the full amount. The truth is after seeing the terrible quality we don’t want this, we just want our money back and will get another kitchen. 

TBH, if someone ordered 25k worth of stuff from me and they called me with an issue I would show up at their doorstep the same day if I could. So I’ve also come to find out they have shit customer service which I also want no part of.

Finally, only today (16 days later) do I get a call from someone in customer service there asking to schedule an on site visit to inspect the cabinets. My question is, do I let them come in and take a look around? I feel as though they will try and find ways to discredit my claim if I do. I’m sure they will also offer to repair whatever issues there are, which I’m not interested in at this point. Will this hurt me in my dispute or am I required to let them come in?

**EDIT: UPDATE: FYI, as per Amex, the correct answer is that once a dispute has been filed, the consumer should have no contact with the merchant. Anything that is wanted/needed will be mediated and coordinated through American Express. So eventually they may want to come inspect but that will need to be set up via Amex, not directly.**",finance

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated from college last year with a degree in graphic design, and I've been doing pretty well sense then. I managed to find work as a freelancer for a while, and now I've landed a full time job at a design agency here in town. I couldn't be happier being where I am, I love my job. The only problem is I'm approaching financial ruin as I try to stay on top of my student loan payments, and I am really scared I won't be able to support myself soon at all.

Now, just to get this out of the way -- I was a complete idiot when I took out my student loans. I was fresh out of high school and wasn't lucky enough to be born into a family that could give me financial help in any way. I was also pretty financially illiterate, and I made some stupid loan term decisions -- but I wanted to go to school. I wanted to do something I loved, and I thought if I found a job things would work out and I'd be able to pay my loans back. However because I was a young, financially illiterate moron I took out private student loans with outrageous terms that just kept piling up each semester until I finished. To make matters worse I procrastinated dealing with the loans after I graduated. (like I said, complete idiot)

&amp;#x200B;

Flash forward to now, I'm trying to figure out how to get myself out of this mess. I am almost 100,000 in debt at this point due to interest, and my monthly payments are now around $800 -- *and that's just my private loans.* On top of all of that, I of course have to pay rent, insurance, car payment, etc. I only make 32,000 a year, so once I make bills each month I really don't have anything left. I'd move back home to cut down on bills if that was an option, but I work in a different state. I was also late on payments a few times, simply because I don't make enough, and my credit has become miserable.

I tried to consolidate and refinance my loans with my mom as a co-signer, but we were denied a couple times (her credit is fine, but she is retired.) So now I'm late on other bills as I try to keep my student loan current, and my already financially screwed family is having to help me out. I'm trying to find a second job and rebuild my credit right now because I'm so far in the hole, even though I already work full time (more than full-time some weeks.)

&amp;#x200B;

I feel completely trapped right now, and I guess I'm looking to see if any folks on here found themselves in similar situations and how they eventually solved it. As it is - I feel like even with a second job I'm going to fall behind, and I really don't know what to do next. The only reason I'm not living on the run like a bad indie film is because my mom would be stuck with the debt as my cosigner.

Maybe there are some refinancing options I haven't thought about? Loan forgiveness? seppuku?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: More info as requested -- Most of my loans are private, but when I was in community college I was doing federal loans only. in total I'm looking at 32k for federal and 66k in private loans.

I owe $6,600 on my car at 2.29 percent, with a monthly payment of $240. On my CC, I owe $7k at 9% with a payment of $176 each month. I like the idea of paying off my car because it is the larger payment each month, which I can then, in turn, roll into paying down my CC. However, I understand that due to the higher interest rate it may make more sense to payoff the cc first.

personalfinance,Help With Credit Card Debt?,"I'm 30 years old and I have some credit card debt that I would like to pay off ASAP.  It's spread between two cards- 

Card 1- Visa- balance of 3,189.27 with 22.9% APR

Card 2- Amex - balance of 1,873.79 with 20.24% APR

I bring home about 2,600/month. 

My monthly living expenses are about $800/month, and I've been putting about $200 in savings/month, plus paying $100/month on each card.  

I don't use the cards at all anymore.  

I know that paying $100/month on each card isn't the most effective way to eliminate this debt.  

Is there a way I can consolidate these bills or something?  I'd like to make a plan to pay these off that won't hurt my credit score and will lower my interest rates.  Do I have any options that would do that, or should I make a plan to pay the cards off without consolidation?

personalfinance,Voluntarily give car back to bank but take on another car loan that I won't be upside down in?,"Through a series of bad choices, I traded in my truck on a honda civic, at the time seemed like a good idea as I was using $500 a month in fuel, what I didn't know was how far buried I would become in my honda civic, the dealer really took advantage of me being uneducated about these things, I owe over 45,000 on it, and according to any dealer, would never really be able to trade it in, and by the time the negative equity is low enough, it wont be worth anything.  
I have the option of  just voluntarily surrendering it to the bank, and getting a second car loan at a good interest rate on a newer jeep. The way this dealer explained it to me is that the second car loan would sort of carry my credit while I go through defaulting on another car loan.

I'm 24 and was injured on the job late last year. I work full time (40 hours) at 12.50 an hour, plus the occasional overtime which amounts to 5 hours extra per week.

I also left just before reviews and raises were given but I'm not sure if this affects the outcome of how much I would have made in 2018 if I wasnt out.

My W-2 states that I paid 1441.30 in federal, 1355.60 in social security, 317.03 in Medicare, and 151.42 to the Golden state.

I don’t want to do it wrong so I decided to pay the $39.99 fee for Deluxe so that I would file it correctly. But then I got to the end, and on top of owing money for state and federal now they’re charging me an extra $39.99 for my state return since I’m not using the free version anymore.

When seeing the different options,  married and joint gave us $60, married but separate on same return gave us $175 and then married but separate returns gave us $3200. Why is there such a difference in the last two? We are in Kentucky for reference. My husband also make roughly 3 times are much as me because I only work part time. Also, we tried to file our taxes with the married but separate returns, but tax act gave us a red flag, because it wasn't the same filing status as our federal.

\-Credit Card Debt

\-Money owed to a car manufactures - i surrendered my vehicle when i could not make payments or afford the insurance on the vehicle

\- I owe the IRS money  $6,000 not including the money I will owe them after I file for this season

a relative who is an accomplished accountant is going to look over my taxes to see what’s what and help me fix everything from my fuck ups, to filing this years taxes. I expect to owe the IRS at least 10K - another reason I’m leaning towards Bankrupcy.

Will call this Personal Loan Debt

I owe my ex girlfriend \~$3000

I owe my grandma $12,000  on a credit card with a 11% interest rate, so i need to pay that off quickly before i get over my head in interest payments -

I also owe my dad $4,000

Total Debt from family members; \~$20,000 -

Total Income

$1200 NET ( bi-weekly) I do receive a commission check, that’s variable. Let’s call that $1000 (net)

Total net income: $3400...

Total amount of money I would have to pay towards my debt should i choose to not file for bankruptcy: \~$700 -this is a dollar amount i calculated by deduction the total net income from the total monthly payment towards the personal loan debt I’ve agreed to make.

I’m leaning towards Bankruptcy because I am aware that I will still owe the IRS everything

personalfinance,So in over my head...,"I’m so embarrassed I’ve gotten to this point, I was debt free 27 months ago (aside from student loans). Here’s what happened, I’ll take any constructive criticism or advice that you have to offer. 

Oct 2016 - moved back to the states from the Middle East debt free. My son was attending an IB high school and wanted to continue that educational path but there are only a couple of IB public schools in the area. Despite the fact I didn’t want to live in them, we found a house. I cried at closing. 

We were given 30 days in a hotel with per firm which was extended to 60 days. I ended up paying for 10 more to get to closing at $160/day (reduced govt rate). 

There were some immediate repairs/renovations which had to be done. Fencing repairs ($1600) and wall repairs/paint ($1000). My dogs had to be boarded for a month because they were causing so much ruckus when confined to the hotel room so much ($1600). The government took four months to reimburse me for the hotel and to pay the per diem so I dipped into my 401k (withdrawal, not loan) for $33k for part of the 20% down payment. The extreme downside is that I wasn’t able to start contributing again for 12 months...I still haven’t started back because I can’t afford it. 

My daughter has always struggled with weird pains and heavy cycles and finally agreed to see doctors to figure out what’s going on. She suffers from bipolar type 1, borderline personality, severe anxiety, TMJ, migraines, PTSD, fibromyalgia, bulging discs, and no curvature in her cervical or lumbar spine. Basically, she’s in pain if she stands up, sits down, or lays down for too long. She’s medicated for the chemical imbalances now but they’re still working out the right dosages and she hasn’t seen the pain dr for the fibro yet. She’s just started to see a chiro so I don’t expect to see any improvement for a solid few months. 

I’ve paid around $18-20k out of pocket (after medical coverage) for doctors, tests, and prescriptions over the last two years because I want her to be healthy and have a chance to live a decent life. I’ve charged a lot of it to credit cards and that’s where the problems began. 

In early Mar 18 I bought a home warranty for $300, great right? My fridge went out before the 30 day waiting period was up. A new one was $1800. All three of our cars needed tires in March $1800, my car needed new piston rings and other things in April $1500, I was in a car accident in late April that insurance covered but it was stressful. In May the TV went out and I was able to get one of last years models for not a ton on an existing card. We had to make trips to Chicago in June (dr for daughter) and September (sons boot camp graduation) and to Florida in April and November (look at college for son and to drive sons car to his first duty station/military school). 

I make $85k/yr. I have separate accounts for my house and car payment with allotments going to them from my check and autopay. 

House payment $1450/mo ($186k bal)
Car payment $330/mo ($11k bal)
Insurance $205
Electric $100
Water $70
Internet $80
Gas $30
Fuel $200
Groceries $500

Credit cards:
Navy Federal $560/m $26k balance
USAA $300/m $12k balance 
Care Credit $275/m $8000
AMEX $75/m, $3000
ABC Warehouse (appliances) $3500
Amazon $6000
Citibank $6000
Chase $11000

Student Loans $160k not currently in repayment status. 

I started working with Americor Financial to consolidate my debt. They’re basically paying off the six bottom cards and closing them. My payment is set up for every two weeks for 38 months in the amount of $283.50. This includes all fees/interest. The security clearance guys at work seem to be okay with it. 

My house is worth about $230k with the renovations I’ve completed (bal owed $186k). I didn’t wrap the USAA or Navy Fed into the consolidation loan because they hold the loans for my house and car. 

Would it be better to refinance my house and use that to pay off Navy Fed/USAA or continue to make payments as I am? Right now I have about $140 every two weeks for groceries and fuel out of my regular paycheck. 

Last year I started working for SHIPT part time and made roughly $18k but it was 12 hour days all three days of my weekend. It’s a 1099 job which isn’t super great but it allows me to eat and occasionally see my son. The downside is that I work 7 days a week... if I work Fri/Sat/Sun for 6-8 hours each day I make roughly $400. I didn’t put any aside for taxes last year and want to this year.  

I’m trying to deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan again because there I’ll make around $225k for the year before taxes (they’ll take between 40-50k) and I’ll be able to pay things off. 

Did I miss anything? Did I leave anything out that’s glaringly obvious that you need to know?

\- I'm single, nearly 19, live with my mom (she is undocumented), and from what I know, the only person depending on me is myself. with that being said do I put dependent-1 or dependents-0?

\- This isn't a question but as of may of 2018 to September of 2018 I worked at this fishy 4 star sea food restaurant (no pun intended) where I was paid $12/hour. I didn't, at any moment at the job fill out a W-4 or anything of the sort. every time I got my paycheck there was nothing deducted, it was a full paycheck. keep in mind I was 18 at the time and that was my first job. I left because they started taking deductions of employees checks... but the thing is we never filled out any document for that to happen. I saw deductions for health insurance, state, and federal tax. Honestly all that money was going towards the owners pocket and not the government. I quit after 5 months.

personalfinance,Please help me advise some close friends,"Ok, I need some help from the community. I have a couple of friends who have worked themselves into a really bad situation over the last 10 years due to incredibly bad habits and poor decisions. I am committed to helping them figure their lives out, get everything in order, and start over if need be. They have some kids and they need help. Here are the details.

Net take home pay for the couple is 7k/month.

Their home is worth approximately 160k (BIG MAYBE), purchased 2005. They owe 145k on mortgage at 8.75%. Must have taken out a second mortgage back in the day and then refinanced at a higher rate. There is also a HELOC of 15k at 8.2% Their house is in pre-foreclosure, which is what I think started their panic and realization that they have made some big mistakes. (These interest rates are the jaw dropper for me) They owe $13k on the house IMMEDIATELY (past due and penalties) in order to get out of foreclosure.

There is an auto loan on a good but not gas efficient car that would theoretically last them a very long time after it is paid off, 25k @ 9%.

They have 6 credit cards in various states of delinquency, totally about 18k in debt.

They have less than $1,000 in checking. 

So here is my question for the extremely helpful people of this community that I have gleaned so much insight from over the years. I KNOW they need a budget. I KNOW they need to change their ways. They have been living a financial lie for nearly as long as I've known them. But before all of that is addressed, what is the best course of action for them to take with these debts? It seems to me they need to file for bankruptcy (13?) and get as fresh of a start as possible. Or do they just get on a tight budget and start paying everything back in a timely manner?

I am working on a budget for them and I think they net enough take home to make the minimum payments on all of this debt, but at these interest rates it just doesn't make sense to do that IMO. Their credit is already destroyed in case that wasn't clear either.

Anyways, please help me, help them = )


Ok updating with what information I have on payments and budget

Net take home $7,000
Mortgage        $1,550
HELOC            $175
Credit Cards    $500  (have to guess a little on this one, again about half have not been paid in months)
Car                 $650
Gas for cards   $400
Utilities           $750   (cell, cable, power, gas, water)
Daycare          $650
Food               $800
Insurance        $250 (home, auto, life)

Gives them an excess of 1275, but I haven't quite figured out where that is going just yet.",finance

investing,What's a minimal-risk fund that tracks the US Federal interest rate?,"Vanguard has a few of these, such as [VMFXX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VMFXX) and [VUSXX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VUSXX). Both, especially VUSXX, are minimal risk: you only stand to lose any principal if the US Federal government defaults. VMFXX is 52% T-Bills with the rest in U.S. Government Obligations and Repurchase Agreements; VUSXX is just 100% pure T-Bills.

These funds basically track the US Federal interest rate (aka federal funds rate) at minimal risk and expense ratios: 0.11% and 0.09% respectively. They're exactly what I'm looking for... but I can't purchase them at my new Merrill Edge account.

So I'm looking for equivalents that can be purchased on ME. Both mutual funds and ETFs choices will be fine; in fact I believe (incorrectly?) that an ETF would be more tax efficient.

I’ve got 2 credit cards Im working toward paying off, one has a higher balance than the other but they both have the same interest rate. Am I correct in assuming it doesn’t matter which I pay-off first? Because the interest rate is the same I can think of them as a single lump of debt and just allocate as much as I can afford to paying them off each month, split whatever way between the two? Or am I missing something?

If one is considering investing in LT Bonds (20-year treasury), is there any consideration other than yield to take into account? To illustrate the 20-year US-note yields higher than it's Canadian counterpart, would investing in the US be a no-brainer holding any taxation impact constant and controlling for interest rate risk?

personalfinance,How do credit transfers work on Credit cards,"It seems like you pay an up front %, then get 0% interest for 12-18 months, then you go to regular interest rate.  What i'm trying to figure out is, if you haven't paid off the principal over the time period, then do you have to pay full interest on any remaining balance at the end of the initial time period?  IE do they pro-rate it.  I know some like 0% financing on furniture work like that.  I'm trying to find the phrases or terms that would say that in the fine print.

This is what the bank of america terms say:

&gt;0% Introductory APR for the first 18 Statement Closing Dates following the opening of your account for transactions made within 60 days of opening your account. 
&gt;
&gt;After that, your APR will be 15.24% to 25.24%, based on your creditworthiness when you open your account. This APR will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate.

then fees

&gt; Balance Transfer
&gt;
&gt;Either $10 or 3% of the amount of each transaction, whichever is greater.

Then super fine print:

&gt;BALANCE TRANSFERS 
&gt;
&gt;If the total amount you request exceeds your Total Credit Line, we may send full or partial payment to your creditors in the order you provide them to us. Allow at least 2 weeks from account opening for processing. Continue paying each creditor until the transfer appears as a credit. Balance Transfers incur interest charges from the transaction date. If you revolve your balance to take advantage of a promotional or introductory offer, all transactions and balances, including purchases, will be charged interest. The Balance Transfer fee is 3% of the amount of the transaction (min. $10). If you have a dispute with a creditor and pay that balance by transferring it to your new account, you may lose certain dispute rights. Balance Transfers may not be used to pay off or pay down any account issued by Bank of America, N.A. or its affiliates.

personalfinance,"Filing form 1040-X to include foreign earned income exclusion, now AGI is negative? (USA)","Hello all,

I am a freelancer who has legally resided abroad since November 2015. Long story short, I was not aware that I was eligible for the Foreign Earned Income (FEI) exclusion for the tax years 2016 till present, and have been paying federal taxes at the full rate since then. I am now filing out forms 2555 and 1040-X to amend my returns from 2016 and 2017. 

I am marking up my 1040 and will carry over the information to the new 1040-X's. After filling out form 2555, you are instructed to write your FEI on line 21 of the 1040 in parenthesis. Then when I compute line 22, I get a total income of $1625 (total earnings - FEI). 

Now, when it comes to calculating the AGI, I have some business related expenses (line 27) and student loan interest (line 33), which would bring my AGI down to around -$5000. That, along with the standard deduction a few lines down brings my taxable income way in the negatives. 

So, obviously I am doing something wrong. Once my taxable income hits 0, do I just keep writing it as 0 and not claim the additional deductions? I know you can have a negative income if your business expenses exceed business income, but my income isn't negative, it's just exempt from federal tax, so am I allowed to have a negative AGI?

Also, yes I am aware that I have to pay self employment tax that is not exempt under the FEI

personalfinance,First time financing a car - Does this all check out?,"Try to keep this short and sweet without turning this into a novel - thank you for your advice.

* Buying a new cargo van to build into a camper. Never bought new before. Buying new for warranty and assurance of maintenance since a stable platform is a necessity for this project.
* Cast a wide net, searched dealers all over the East Coast, negotiated them against each other for best price.
* Settled on a price with out of state dealer. Savings offset travel costs by a long shot. Price is nearly 20% off MSRP. Got it all in writing with taxes and fees itemized. Got ""out the door"" price.
* Went to local credit union. Applied for financing. Pre-approved for 2.0% interest rate.
* Talked to dealer about financing options. Their rates were much higher on average. Told them I was going to use my own financing. No issues there, price remained the same, no funny business.

Here's where I get a little confused, so bear with me.

* Ask the credit union what next steps are. They require the Buyer's Order from the dealership which includes the VIN for the exact vehicle. Dealership sends it over.
* I go to the bank to talk it over and they essentially expect me to sign for the loan right there. I tell them I'm not going to get the vehicle for another 1.5 weeks and that I'd like to physically inspect it before signing for anything.
* They say that I can sign for the loan the day before I leave and if the vehicle ends up not being what I want, they can just void the loan since I never took delivery of the vehicle. Does that make sense? 
* I say okay, leave the bank without signing anything, and let the dealer know my plan, just so they are in the loop. The dealer requests a ""Letter of Intent"" from the bank. I'm not sure if this is something that is provided when I sign the loan, or something I need to provide ASAP.

**Correct Me If I'm Wrong:** My understanding of securing your own financing was that you'd go to a dealership with that pre-approval in your back pocket. You'd talk to them about their financing and decide what deal you prefer. If you elect to use your bank, you let them know as such and they work with your bank to file all the proper paperwork. My situation seems different because it's out of state and I already have a vehicle picked out. But what if I didn't? What if I wanted to shop around on the lot? 

The bank described essentially providing me with a check to pay the dealer. That obviously sounds extremely easy and convenient, but I'm confused why this seems a little different than every other description of using a local credit union. I realize you need to sign for the loan at some point, but I guess I figured it would occur after you picked the car out, not before. 

Again, maybe that's just because if you're shopping for a car locally it's much easier to go back and forth to a bank / dealership than it is when you're out of state.

personalfinance,Follow up question about repayment being taken from taxes,"I had posted about a month ago regarding advice for my tax situation this year. I have a repayment to unemployment that I was told *could* be taken from my tax returns. With the shutdown my plan was to save up the money to pay it off and then file in March.

I have not saved up the money yet and the shutdown is over so my question is regarding filing and how the money would be deducted.

The amount I owe is $1200 and my federal return is estimated $1500 with a $500 state refund estimated.

I have confirmed with the IRS that they have record of this repayment being owed.

My question is, will they simply deduct it from my federal refund and I will receive the rest? Will it be deducted from my state (making it zero) and the remainder from my federal?

I'm confused about what to do because it seems silly to save up the money, pay it and then get the refund when I can just use that refund money to cover it but I am not sure how it would work and don't want to lose anything in the process.

personalfinance,I owe $700 in federal taxes and $700 in state taxes - would it be wise (or possible) to contribute to an IRA to reduce my AGI?,"And would it even be possible?  I have only contributed to a 401k during the year and I do not currently have an IRA open.  I toyed around entering in hypothetical IRA contribution numbers in my tax return (using HR Block) but it said I cannot contribute more in Jan - April than I have in the previous calendar year (which was $0 for me).  So is it even possible for me to open an IRA and contribute in order to reduce my AGI?  Never done this before so I'm not sure if I'm understanding it properly.

Never owed taxes before so this is kind of new territory for me.

Side note:  Even though I'm not contributing to an IRA, my company actually contributes 15% of my income to a 401k and I contribute an additional 5%.  So I'm still saving quite a lot for retirement.  But I'm also trying to save cash for a down payment on a house, which is why I'm not maxing out IRA contributions.

Edit: /u/nothlit helped uncover the answer.

personalfinance,Sanity check - should we purchase and install a 7.12 kWh?,"Proposal:

Location - Upstate New York

Size - 7.12 kWh - Q.Cell 305-330w panels (23)

Includes - Roof installation on 7yr. old asphalt roof, grid-tied, 25 panel warranty, 10 yr inverter, 5 yr craftsmanship

Background - Our current usage is lower than array design at \~5.6 MWh/year (we use natural gas for other appliances: furnace, range, dryer), but we're expecting our first child and assume our electricity usage to increase. We might even consider swapping out gas dryer for electric if decide to go solar. Our utility net meters.

&amp;#x200B;

|Base Cost|$23,952|
|:-|:-|
|State Solar Incentive|\-2,496|
|Contract Price|21,456|
|Fed Credit (30%)|\-6,437|
|State Tax Credit (25 ~~20~~% up to 5k)|\-5,000|
|Cash discount (6%)|\-1,214|
|Coupon|\-250|
|Total after discounts/credits/incentives|**$8,555**|

&amp;#x200B;

We'd pay the total outright after a 12 mo, 0% interest loan comes due in 2020 Q2.

By my math, that's $1.10 watt installed, which seems really low.

I figure that if we invested that money somewhere else, we'd need a 5+% return over the same term to produce the same value/savings. Might not find that type of guarantee anywhere, and it's just a fraction of our investment portfolio.

A smaller design (5.6 kWh) comes in only about $1,000 less, minus 6 panels.

Am I crazy NOT to sign the contract?

&amp;#x200B;

**Our concerns:**

* Even at 64% off base cost, it'd still take 13+ years to pay off given our current usage. It's a long term pay-back period, what if technology improves?
* What if utility costs continue to drop (they've decreased from .13 kWh (2015), to .12 (2016), to .11 kWh (2017) in our area).
* There is a fear of, ""if we move, we may lose our investment and never recoup the cost"". Appraisals might not increase the value of our home, right?
* What if we actually don't increase our electricity usage that much to offset ?

tl;dr should we spend $8,5k cash for a system a bit bigger than our needs given that our pay back period is 13 years at current usage? Should I focus on actual usage/cost, rather than the 64% discount?; or just move forward with the good deal?",finance

I provide this information as I am of the understanding that perhaps we could get debt consolidation if I co-sign(and at a lower interest rate) (which I know everyone advises against, but in this situation I wouldn't even mind worst case scenario, I don't care too much about money and just want to pay this off with the least amount of interest).

My parents are about 22k in credit card debt (at 29% interest I believe), and have a mortgage which I will be getting the details to later tonight. My parents have been banking on paying off this debt with their inheritance once their grandparents pass. Both sides have wealthy grandparents, and they don't know that my parents have this debt. I figure it's better to just pay the debt off ASAP so that when inheritance rolls in, a larger portion isn't going to the interest of this debt.

My idea was, apply for debt consolidation at the lowest interest rate we can find, and then create a budget to make payments and reduce spending. Any advice with tackling this would be much appreciated.

My fiance and I are planning a wedding for next year and we currently have enough savings built up for a down payment on a home.

The reason we think this may be a better option is because locking in interest rates and lower housing prices now versus two years from now may save us more money in the long run than taking a medium-interest short-term loan against our potential home equity.

I'm a 26 y/o male, earn 91k a year. I went to an expensive private school and my parents agreed/wanted to pay off the majority of my student debt. I had one small loan taken out in my name that I paid off shortly after I graduated and got a real job. My parents pay the rest of it off. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, my dad (the primary breadwinner) just got laid off at age 60. As a result, I am insisting that I take over the payments on their ParentPlus loans since they have a lot of huge financial decisions to make about their future, and I am in a good enough spot with my income that I can take this debt over. I am aware that since these are ParentPlus loans, the loans are in their name and I am not legally obligated to pay for them, but I am doing this anyways because it was MY education and they were only paying it off because my dad made great money. In fact, they were actually paid well ahead on the loan and it is paid through September of 2020.

Here are some details on the debt:

I specifically have a couple questions:

1) I currently max out both my 401k and my Roth IRA every year. Since I now have this debt to pay off (and I want to get it paid off as soon as possible), does it make more sense for me to a) reduce 401k contribution to just company match, b) not contribute to Roth IRA until I pay off student debt,  c) combination of both (a) and (b), or d) keep retirement contributions the same, and just pay the minimum payment of 585.25 which would take much longer to pay off the loans, and accrue more interest over time.

2) I know nothing about student loans and refinancing. Is it possible for me to go to whoever financed these loans and see if I can get them refinanced/consolidated into a lower overall interest rate? I feel like these rates are high, but like I said I have no idea what the standard rates are. Obviously I would like to pay as little interest as possible.

personalfinance,Paying off credit card with vehicle equity,"I'm looking to buy a new vehicle. I was wondering if selling my current vehicle for cash and paying off my credit card with it would be a wise decision? Or would it be better to trade in the vehicle on a new one?

* I have a vehicle valued at 30k
* 13k left to pay on a 1.9% loan $386/mo payment
* 15K credit card debt at 14% $330/mo minimum
* Looking to purchase a 52k vehicle with the same 1.9% loan $664/mo
* New vehicle gets 10mpg better fuel economy
* tax savings on trade would be about $950

I have no problem making current payments which total about $720/mo. It seems rolling both debts into one auto loan would save $50/mo and transfer my credit card debt in to a loan with a 12% lower interest rate. Am I missing something here or is this to good to be true?",finance
personalfinance,Having issues getting consolidation loan to pay off debts because of my debts. Any advice?,"A couple years and a couple moves and job changes left me with a little less than $18,000 of credit card debt. I got a budget that I'm sticking to and I'm working on paying it down, but I'm just barely making the payments on it. I'm trying to get a debt consolidation loan to reduce my interest rate (avg 19%), which would reduce my monthly payments by \~$150/mo, which then become savings/additional payments. I am fortunate enough to have my parents cosign the loan, and they have excellent credit. 

The problem is, my credit union won't lend to me as the primary borrower, and asked that my parents open an account and have me be the co-signer, but they weren't comfortable opening a bank account with a credit union halfway across the country. They recommended we get the loan through their bank, but their bank would require me (even if I were the co-signer) to have an account for three to six months. But their bank rejected me for both a checking and a savings account. I assume because of my credit report, but I have to wait for the official letter to come in the mail.

The debt is spread across seven accounts and my credit utilization is pretty bad because of it (49% total, 45% average in credit cards; plus 17k in student loans at 15k on a car--a Honda Fit bought new, which I realize wasn't a smart choice, but I spend about 10 hours a week commuting and was frustrated with my beater dying on me). Other than that, my credit report has two missed payments, one in 2013 on a Bank of America credit card (my first one) which I have since closed, the other was in 2017 on a new card with BoA. I realize I am at fault for not monitoring it more closely, but in my defense, both were because on the website I added my bank account for auto-pay but didn't click the checkbox that turns on auto pay for that account, and BoA didn't get in touch with me until I was already 30 days delinquent. My FICO score is 693 which FICO says is good. 

Basically, is there any way I can improve my credit score to help me get this debt consolidated? I guess I'm frustrated because things were looking up and then everything stopped, and that I had no idea how bad my credit was until I started looking for this loan, which is humbling.",finance

personalfinance,Debt settlement on my own or with a company?,"I would really appreciate your advice on whether I should settle debt myself or use a company.

I have just over $31,000 in unsecured debt. I've spoken with DMB Financial, a debt settlement company. They've offered me a monthly payment of $585 and a plan to have everything paid in 42 months. Based on my initial conversation with them this means putting the $585 in some kind of escrow account or something while they (DMB) work with my creditors. I guess I'm also supposed to stop paying my creditors, which sounds bad.

I've read some posts on websites and here on Reddit that say I can do this myself.

Here are my details, all amounts rounded to the nearest dollar. Please give me advice on how to knock this out. If I can do this without going through a debt settlement company that would be great. I figure I could just park the money that they would otherwise be taking in a high interest savings account until I'm ready to settle. Some debts I could keep current, but some maybe I float them and if asked I promise to pay...not real sure how this part would work.

I understand that I'll take a credit score hit, and I'm ok with that. My only issue is that I'm in a car lease, which I'll never, ever, ever, do again, and I want to buy the car at the end of the lease term.

* Net pay is $3,950
* Mortgage payment is $1,175 on a 30 year note at 4.5%.
* Lease is $370 and matures in October.
* I have a federal student loan for $11,800 and my monthly payment is $258. The interest rate is 6.625% and currently all of this payment goes toward interest (not sure why other than forbearance just ended).

Here are the unsecured debts.

1. Retail Card 1, $140, pmt is $27 at 26.99%
2. Retail card 2, $443, pmt is $35 at 27.99%

4. Retail Card 4, $635, pmt $76 at 25.26%
5. Retail Card 5, $933, pmt 147 at 24.96%
6. Credit Card 1, $3,932, PMT $59 at 0% (intro rate until May 2020
7. Credit Card 2, $1,715, PMT $59 at 25.15%

I want to keep just one of the credit cards as I have recently had a problem with someone using my debit card and getting the funds restored has been a pain in the ass. Again, DMB makes it sound simple, but if they're going to do what I can do then I should just do it myself, right?",finance

**Questions:**

* It sounds like the cutoff for immediately paying off debt is 5% interest. Does it make sense to pay off the car loan immediately? We already going to pay it off 3 and 3 months early. I know paying it immediately will save interest but only about $1600. I'm on the fence here.
* The next step is it worth refinancing our mortgage? While I would love to not be paying the PMI the fed has raised interest rates a few times since we locked in our rate. I plan on mortgage shopping but I am not convinced that the savings will be worth it. A local realtor says that we could probably get a new appraisal that will get us closer to 80% LTV. If we do refi I plan to continue to make the same monthly payment and use the difference as an overpayment to shorten the life of the loan.
* Given my 401k being 100% VFIAX which funds do you all recommend for the remainder of this windfall. Also what do you guys recommend for bond exposure?

personalfinance,Question re: refund adjustment bills last year,"On my 2017 income tax filing last year, I didn't receive a 1099 for a debt forgiveness and neglected to report it. Several months later I received adjustment notices from Federal and State and paid both bills. 

I zipped through TurboTax experimentally just now for 2018, and their records still show I received a state refund of $245 last year that I need to add to my Federal income this year, but in reality, I ended up paying it back. 

Should I ignore this and let the amount go to my income, or zero it out since I ended up paying it back with interest? I did not amend my returns since both notices detailed the amounts they were changing in all the fields to reflect extra income from debt settlement. Did I goof by not manually amending my 2017 returns, or is this just TurboTax records out of date from how I saved them last year not reflecting the changes that were made?

I haven't found out yet if I'm going to get another adjustment that was settled in 2018. I've been on top of the company that handled this for me since they didn't forward me the form in 2018. Do I need to wait and see if it gets reported, or should I just enter a 1099 manually if I can get the dollar amount that I need to enter on it?

personalfinance,Student Loan Rehabilitation Federal Loan - any advice appreciated!,"Hi /pf, 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in a bit of a situation and was wondering if anyone had any experience negotiating loan rehabilitation for a defaulted federal student loan? I've definitely be bad with finances and am trying to rectify my negative marks as I start to earn a little more money.  We've got a baby due in 6 months and trying to get our finances in order here... 

&amp;#x200B;

**Called CA today to discuss:**

&amp;#x200B;

I called the credit agency, National Credit Services, and told them I was in default and wanted to discuss loan rehab. They went through a bunch of options and finally started to get into monthly payments. The agent said I was scheduled for wage garnishment on February 23rd. 

Their first offer without any income requirements was too high, about $200 per month too high. So, we went through a song and dance about how many independents I had, if I filed separately from my wife (I did), our monthly income, etc. 

I definitely fudged the numbers fairly significantly, not wanting to share my real info and they spit out a monthly payment of about $100-$150 less than I was planning to pay. However, I do make significantly more money than I told them when they went about trying to find me an income based repayment plan. 

They of course want verification of this info and are now asking for 2 pay-stubs from my employer and 2 paystubs from my wife from the last 90 days. My wife isn't in any way associated with my account and I don't want to expose her to any direct liability regarding this debt. So, basically we dropped it and they said they would need those documents to proceed. 

I asked if there was another option to pay a little more per month and forgo any income verification. They said no. 

They then made a push to have me pay via Credit Card, debit card or routing number and make a payment today. I explained I needed to talk to my wife and ended the call. They gave me a scare speech about how I needed to fix this today and that was that... 

&amp;#x200B;

**My question...** 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not asking for a silver-bullet. I got myself into this mess and it's my job to get myself out. 

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, has anyone had any luck negotiating with these CAs? They are a direct contractor for the US DoEd and this is a Federal Direct Loan, so these may be the only two options I have available...but, wanted to see if anyone else had found any wiggle room?

I have no interest in sharing my or my wife's personal account information or paystubs with a CA for obvious reasons.

Thank you!

personalfinance,Best Next Step....?,"Hello all you fantastic people that help everyone out. It’s much appreciated by me and many others. I’ve been on and off here for a few years and have had some ups and down and all arounds. But thanks to great people I’ve held steady. 

Due to and unfortunate split last year, moving to a new city with a new job, I’ve acquired some debt. So, the last 6 months of last year crap was flying all over the place with some of it beyond my control. Now that the dust has pretty much settled and I have stabilized everything, I’d like some advice on my next steps please. 

I have a variable monthly income that fluctuates between $3,200-$9,000 per month depending on season and other things. Average right now over the past 8 months is roughly $4,045/pm. Although in Dec. I made $9,000 and this Jan. I’ve made $4,700. I expect my income to grow slowly every month to about an average of $5,000/pm over the next 6 months and level out there from there. 

I’ve kept meticulous records of every income and purchase category for the past 8 months as well. I have specific categories for everything so I understand we’re all money is going and coming. I can now know exactly how much money is going to be spent every month to make a tight budget. 

When everything happened last year my entire savings was wiped out and massive debt was added to my credit cards that were all basically at zero. This all happened without warning and extremely quick. I hade no time to really react due to the situation. When I was able to move I basically started with absolutely no savings and living a week or two behind every paycheck. This is started about 8 months ago and then I took back control and started my path to debt freedom. Sorry, just wanted people to have an understanding so I may get better advice. 

I now has a savings of around $6,000 cash on hand and I’ve paid the credit cards down, that were pretty much maxed at about $22,000, down to around $15,500. So I’ve paid off around $6,500 in that short time while getting about 1 months savings worth for a e-fund. 

I’d like to lower my interest rates on these last few cards. My plan, if advisable, is to use the max available on my Navy Federal CLOC ($400) to my Navy Federal Credit Card. That would create about $1,300 of available credit on the NFCC. With the current promotion, for me, of a BT for 1.99% and no transfer fee, I want to move the Capital One debt over to the NFCC. That would massively reduce my interest rate for that one card. If I’m able, I want to try and get a CLI on the NFCC just before all this and move as much as I can from Discover to NFCC as well. Is this a good plan?

I always pay way more than the minimum balance on all cards combined. I then want to knock out the Discover with all available income possible, while paying the minimum on the remaining cards and do the avalanche method until all debt including the car is payed off. By my calculations, I should be able to have it all payed off by Dec. 2023. 4 years. All the while continuing to create more savings. It really scares me not having a savings. 

Any thoughts on improvements or other ideas I don’t know of would be extremely helpful. Thanks for your time and I sincerely appreciate it. I promise to put all good advice into practice and know it’ll help someone.

worldpolitics,Kuril Islands sovereign territory of Russia,"More than 70 years have passed since the end of the Second World War, however, Russia and Japan have still not decided to put an end to the peace treaty. The “stumbling block” was the Kuril Islands, which after the end of the war and the crushing defeat of Japan were ceded to the USSR, however, Japan still does not lose hope to return them and repeatedly makes territorial claims to Kuril Islands.

In recent years, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meet regularly to discuss the development of Russian-Japanese relations, including in the economic sphere. The head of Russia notes the important role of joint plans for cooperation in the digital economy and in increasing productivity, increasing trade between the two countries, developing interaction in the construction, housing, utilities and urban environments.

However, the main problem of Russian-Japanese relations is Japan’s desire to return the four southern islands of the Kuril Ridge (Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan and Habomai). Russia has never questioned their sovereignty, which was reinforced by an international legal act. Nevertheless, the very fact of the discussion on this topic is very encouraging to the Japanese, and these hopes of the Japanese prime minister for the return of the southern islands are placed on the Russian president, whom the leader of Japan considers the only politician who can solve this problem. Therefore, Abe is moving closer to Putin despite the sanctions and ostracism.

The claims of the Japanese government on the Russian islands are groundless from a legal point of view, and Russia's firm position on the issue of the Kuriles has proven this for many years.

At the end of January 2019, the meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ended in Moscow. The leaders of the countries confirmed the readiness for further work on the conclusion of an agreement. However, the question of how they intend to decide the fate of the Kuriles remained unresolved. The leaders of the two countries agreed on the opinion that their task is to ensure the long-term and comprehensive development of Russian-Japanese relations at a qualitative level. But there were no specific theses regarding the main issue - the ownership of the Kuril Islands. This territorial issue is painful for both parties, and negotiations are only in the initial stage. It is obvious that in a question that cannot be resolved for such a long time, it will not be able to do without substantial disagreements.

The South Kuril Islands are part of the border of the Russian Federation and became part of the Soviet Union following the Second World War.

Japan likes to refer to the Shimoda Treaty of 1855 on the delimitation of the Russian-Japanese border between the islands of Urup and Iturup, but the Russian-Japanese war of 1905 disavowed any past agreements, and the results of World War II formed a new configuration of the world order. From here references to the contract 1855 are naive.

One of the central conditions for the participation of the USSR in the war against Japan was an agreement between the United States and Great Britain on the unconditional assignment of the Kuril Islands to the jurisdiction of the USSR, subject to complete and unconditional surrender. In accordance with the decisions of the Yalta Conference of February 1945 and the Potsdam Agreement of August 1945. The final defeat of Japan in September 1945 initiated Directive No. 677 of January 29, 1946, which was formalized and signed by the United States in San Francisco. In other words, the essence of the directive was reduced to the withdrawal from the Japanese jurisdiction of all the Kuril Islands and the exclusion of any claims to South Sakhalin. Also, the document noted that “Japan waives all rights and claims to the Kuril Islands and part of Sakhalin Island, which Japan acquired sovereignty under the Portsmouth Treaty of September 5, 1905.’’

Claims of the USSR and Russia, as the successor of the USSR to the Kuril Islands, are formed in international acts as part of the post-war repartition of spheres of influence.

personalfinance,Currently living paycheck to paycheck with a mountain of debt. Looking for advice on how to make this more manageable?,"Hi,

Posting this kind of thing is very out of the ordinary for me. I've recently realized just how much of a financial hell-hole I'm in (or at least, that's what it feels like).

First - some basic information about me. I'm 25 years old. I don't have a college degree. I dropped out of college after about 2.5 years of studying, so I still have student loans to pay off (*side note - paying off student loans without having a degree feels like the biggest kick in the nads ever). I got married 3 months ago - she is also 25 years old. We like to eat/drink with friends, but don't spend money on much anything else other than bills. I make $45,000/year as an insurance adjuster. My wife makes about $32,000/year working for a non-profit.

Ok, now my financial info:

I have about $8k left on my student loans. My wife has about $35k in loans from a private Christian university, where she got her Bachelor's in Psychology.

Together, we have almost $15,000 in credit card debt. This is mostly from our wedding, which we had to pay for mostly by ourselves. We are not actively using any credit cards.

I have around $12k left on my car loan. She does not have a car loan.

Monthly costs are as follows: ~$1350/month for rent and utilities (rent, electric, water, cable, sewer), $259.51/month for federal student loans, $297.15/month in private student loans (Sallie Mae), $511.81/month in minimum payments on our credit cards (we have 9 different accounts we're paying off), and $500/month in car payment and car insurance costs. We also spend $80/month to sponsor two children's education-related expenses in Jamaica (this is kind of a non-negotiable expense for my wife, which I agree with).

So, total we have about $3000 locked up per month on the above costs. We make about $4400 after tax/benefits per month, so that leaves $1400/month for food, gas, daily parking for work, etc.

This obviously doesn't leave much room for saving much money after taking unexpected expenses into account. Our long term goals include having children and buying a home, but with our current financial structure it doesn't seem likely that either of those are practical anytime soon (God forbid our birth control fails). We've considered debt consolidation and personal loans... But don't know enough about finances to know what the right course of action is.

​

We're overwhelmed and we don't know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated more than you could imagine. Let me know if there's any important details about our financial situation that I've left out. Thank you for reading!",finance
personalfinance,Refund of credit card annual fee...when cancelling the account?,"After spending the last 10 years repairing my credit after some questionable mistakes on my part, I finally called to close my First Savings Credit Card today.  It was one of the first cards I was able to get when my credit was not so great a long time ago.  It had a very high interest rate, and carried a $75 annual fee (not to mention my lowest credit limit by far), and had no rewards program at all.

I called the customer service line, spoke to a very nice representative.  Of course she tried to give me the song and dance of retention (we'll waive that fee one-time as a courtesy!), but honestly I don't use the card and don't want to continue to have an annual fee (or have to remember to call and get it waived).  The closed account is not going to ding my credit too much according to several simulators online, and I have other cards with far better terms.  The representative was apologetic, and confirmed all my info.  Then she informed me that they would be ***refunding the annual fee I paid in February 2018 since it hasn't been a full year since it was charged*** (five days shy of the anniversary)!

So here's my question: are credit card companies required to refund annual fees if the entire year hasn't passed?  I didn't request a refund from them at all (and honestly I'm not holding my breath on the check coming in the mail); in fact, I never brought up the fact that I had paid it last year or complained about it or anything at all.  This has to be the biggest surprise I've ever heard from a credit card company!

EDIT: Just to add, I literally do not use this card at all, there was no use in trying to get them to switch me to a no annual fee product or anything like that (and with First Savings being a subprime lender \[I think\], I'm really not their target customer anymore).",finance

personalfinance,"Paid $15,000 extra on my monthly student loan. How is it suppose to be applied?","I have Great Lakes. I have a monthly payment of $700 (interest on all my 7 loans). This month I made a payment of $15,700.00. This is my savings I have saved up to be applied to my student loan principal balance. A huge sacrifice but worth it knowing my principal balance is increasing by 6% each year.

I made the payment online. I specifically chose ""excess payment"" to Loan #4 since that is my highest interest loan.

This is how I expected the $15,700.00 to be applied. I expected the $700 to go towards my monthly amount due, the monthly interest. Then, the $15,000 to go to the principal of Loan #4.

Great Lakes applied it like this: $700.00 towards my monthly amount due. $2,000 towards the unpaid interest for #Loan 4. Then the remaining $13,000 went towards the principal for Loan #4.

Is it suppose to be applied like this? Because this is a monthly payment.  Additionally, their online says, ""We automatically apply excess to: \[1\] Accrued interest *since your last payment*. \[2\] Principal of the loan with the highest interest rate.

How is it suppose to be applied? I need to be sure because I've heard sketchy things about student loan servicers.

My taxes are usually pretty straightforward and simple to complete. I have quite a few student loans, so I gathered my 1098-E's and my W2 and efiled with HR Block. A few days later, I got three 1098-Es I was not expecting. Then I remembered I switched my federal student loans over to a new lender last February to claim PSLF, so the 1098s I got were from my previous lender. 

I also took a college class last semester and did not realize I would get a 1098-T for the $120 I paid in tuition. (Thought you had to be a full-time, matriculated student (I wasn't) to claim anything).

Combined, all of my 1098-E's equal more than the $2,500 cap, so I think I'm okay not claiming the three I missed. (They list $55.49 in interest paid all together, if that matters). 

My main question is: will amending my return to include the $120 tuition payment increase my refund enough to make it worth the headache of filling out the 1040-X?

personalfinance,Capital allocation vs. cash flow,"My SO and I find ourselves thinking from two *conflicting* perspectives when making/planning financial decisions. I'd like to learn from others' thoughts, experience, perspective on this.

---

## Perspective 1: optimizing capital allocation

- Optimizing for long-term purchase power.
- Take on debt as long as (1) you service that payments, (2) obtain an interest rate that is lower than your expected return on your capital elsewhere, (3) is a small portion of your net worth.

**Example:** 

We put no money down on a family car, and take a 5 year agreement with high monthly payments, because the interest rate (0.9%) is significantly lower than we expect to make by investing elsewhere (hell it's likely less than inflation).

**Pros:**

- This seems to optimize for *""time in the market, not timing the market""* mentality, since our capital remains deployed, that deployed capital doesn't incur transactions costs from moving in and out of assets, and we come out head due to the favorable differential interest rate.
- Automated payments mean little-to-no administrative overhead. The money comes in and out each month with no effort or significant risk.

**Cons:**

- Gives up optionality, your cash flow is well allocated to month to month (I sometimes view this as a good thing. Since it's that much less cash coming into our checking account that may tempt us to use as ""disposable income"" were it not already allocated).

---

## Perspective 2: optimizing cash flow

- Optimize for optionality, cash on hand
- Pay off all debt

**Example:** 

Save up for family car and pay cash for it.

**Pros:**

- Very simple: you've got what you've got.
- You don't owe anybody.

**Cons:**

- Losing ""time in market"" because you've liquidated assets to pay off debt, and now need time to save and purchase new assets

---

## Future outlook: 

- Asset prices seem generally high. We are in the longest bull-market in US history after all. There's been so much stimulus. Move into cash on the way up, pay off debt (increase cash-flow)
- I'm anticipating inflation, which I view as incentivizing taking on debt (capital allocation perspective).
- On the other hand, I'm also anticipating a recession sooner-than-later, and would love more cash available to purchase assets if/when it happens (cash-flow perspective).

Basically I know enough to confuse myself... How do you think about these things?",finance
personalfinance,I'm probably going to need to get a second job which will prevent me from doing any extracurriculars.,"Title pretty much says it all.

personalfinance,What is the best course of action for me?,"Hi! Please forgive me because I don't think this is the right sub to post my question in, but I cannot find another suitable sub, so I'm hoping to take any advice that I can get. I am also not financially savvy so when it comes to financial calculations and whatnot, I just get really confused.

Back in November 2016 when I was 22, I bought a savings insurance policy. I chose the 25-year paying term, and I'm putting aside $250/month (so 3k/year). This policy comes with the flexibility to withdraw 60% of my yearly saving amount as a form of cashback, so generally it has a 'lower' interest rate compared to locked-in saving policies where you cannot withdraw. IIRC, the projected non-guaranteed compounded interest rate is about 2.5-3% per annum. I am allowed the withdrawal option only from the 25th month onwards, so starting from this year, I am actually free to withdraw 1.8k every year for spending, OR I can just leave it in the policy to accumulate interest.

Looking at the benefit illustration of the policy, 3k/year for 25 years would payout a projected amount of 100-110k when the policy matures, assuming no withdrawals were done.

Question: Is it wise to actually withdraw the money every year for spending or to leave it in the policy? Reason I am asking is because the inflation rate of my country is about 2.8-3%, which is already on par or higher than the projected interest rate. Based on the logic of the time value of money, money that I have now is worth more than that identical amount in the future. What is the wise decision?",finance
personalfinance,Why have my W2 wages increased so dramatically when my salary is the same?,"Despite no real changes in my salary or withholdings, this year my tax bill was thousands of dollars higher than it was last year. It didn’t make a ton of sense because my deductions are only going down by about $1000. I’m going to consult an accountant, but in the meantime started to do some digging on my own. I compared my W2s from the past two years and think I know why my tax bill changed so much. All three of my “wages” boxes are WAY higher this year. Last year box 1 was $117K, this year its $138K. Box 3 was $127K, this year it’s $128K. And Box 5 was $128K, this year it’s $149K. 

My benefits and salary haven’t changed, except my bonus was about $1000 higher this year. I also haven’t changed my elections (401K, etc.) or withholding (withheld about $1000 more this year than last year for federal) and the amounts listed in Box 12 are within a $100 total of being the same. 

Any clue why this might have changed so dramatically? Could it have something to do with the new tax plan? Or did my employer possibly screw something up? I’ve racked my brain (and google) and just can’t figure out what changed when my base salary is identical.",finance
personalfinance,"(AU) 21 y.o. medical student aspiring to make into 6 figures, how should I secure my finances early for a comfortable life and not fuck it all up?","A bit of background first for this very hypothetical future. I’m currently 21 years old in my 3rd year of medical school in South Australia (so my dollar amounts are in AUD not USD). I have two part-time jobs paying in total about $1,000 a month, nothing terribly special, but I still live at home with great family support so it’s just some side money. My family is happy for me to live with them/under their financing until I have finished medical school. As of yesterday, I opened an account with a bank offering the best savings interest rate (bonus interest account, min $200/month required) of 2.87% here in Australia. I’ve initially saved ~$3,000 there at the time of posting, and at current I am aiming to deposit at least $500 per month. I pay for my phone bill and other entertainment stuff (about $100 a month) and car costs (about $1.5-2k a year). No board/rent or costs of living. I think it wouldn’t be far from true to say I have had and continue to have a very good shot in life. I do not want to let it go to waste. I like to think my story is fresh, early, and promising enough that it can still be easily moulded into anything, and might be a bit of fun for you guys to play with. So now to my future aspirations.

I won’t lie, I’m at least somewhat materialistic. I’m not a big spender, but I want to live very comfortably with at least a few luxuries before I am middle aged or ideally by the time I start a family (which is a while off yet, as is all of this). My dream end-goal for a while has been to be financially comfortable with a main home near a city hospital (I am not after any multi-million dollar house, just a nice small home) and a small waterfront home (perhaps on a lake or river rurally, nothing near a city) where I have a boat for holidays away. The main underpinning goal is to be able to achieve this and then by the time I retire, have a substantial net worth which would set up my potential children for some time, or at least to begin their adult lives strong.

I went into the medical field because I have wanted to ever since I was a small child. Never really aspired for anything else and have since had experience in the medical field which I have enjoyed. I am only now really realising how much money I could be making, and it’s a little daunting (also exciting now that it could be possible for my dreams to be reality). Medical school in Australia has 2 years of pre-clinical stuff and then in the 3rd year and beyond, you enter real hospitals to learn. My grades in medical school for the first 2 years have been fairly good, but I got really slack at the end of last year (burnout, continually adjusting to university etc). This upcoming 3rd year will be a real test, and I am aware of the competition for surgical training, but I am determined and fiercely competitive. My field of interest is primarily cardiology and at the time of posting, my career goal is to become a cardiothoracic surgeon. To my understanding, cardiothoracic surgeons these days are becoming less and less referred as cardiologists begin to expand their training, so I will keep that in mind. As it stands in any case, I have spoken to a surgeon I am close with as well others and have consulted the internet and it seems the average income for an experienced cardiothoracic surgeon is $200k and above, and the surgeons I have spoken with say there is often significant room for negotiation, depending on private vs public and whereabouts you are etc. 

I will be 25 when I begin working as an intern and 26 when I am a fully accredited junior doctor. I am still fuzzy on the details, but I can’t just immediately begin training as a surgeon until I have worked for some time. Optimistically assuming I start speciality training at 30, at the very best I will be 36 when I am an accredited cardiothoracic surgeon making very likely much under the $200k I stated earlier.

My question therefore is to you guys, is this a realistic and achievable financial goal (assuming I can achieve these career goals)? If so, what should be some ballpark milestones I need to reach (ie at 25, 30, 35, 40 etc)? Certain amounts/percentages of money stashed/invested in certain places etc. I will finish medical school with $60-80k interest-free in debt, then costs of speciality training which I am not entirely sure the cost of. I know there are a lot of variables yet to be discovered (like housing prices, living costs, etc), but I really am just looking for guesstimates at this stage (am I just woefully dreaming etc). One thing that my education has really let me down on is finance, so this is a very new field to me. Mathematics is a breeze, but the actual nitty gritty of finance I have no fucking clue about as it was never taught in school and the research I have done so far has just been a headache of trying to know where to start. Are there any sources/books/articles people would recommend for an absolute novice?

Some additional info that may help. I am mildly risk averse and have dabbled in the stock market with very small amounts just to get a feel (fairly unsuccessful so far, but the education is valuable). If I make the 6 figure values I wrote about above, I will be in the highest tax bracket of 45% here in Australia (oof).",finance

I double checked all of the values that I input into the tax program for accuracy, so I'm not sure what went wrong. I also have a Form 5498 which, to my knowledge, proves that it was a direct rollover, and should cancel out the 1099-R.

personalfinance,Need advice for going on a paid “strike“ for better pay within a corporate job.,"### The Background

Right out of college I got hired by (what I thought) was a great company for me to pursue my field of Graphic and User Interface Design. I’ve now been with this company for 5 years, I’ve worked with major companies like Rite Aid, Athene, UPS, Sempra, UTC and so many more. I’ve created numerous interfaces and prototypes for a lot of different business and my company has given me 1 raise the entire time I’ve been with them. 

This is a very large corporate company that works largely in IT Services. I know very large companies that often time use global employees have more difficult time in justifying raises, however this is getting a little out of hand for me. Currently I make $22,56 / hour as a user interface designer in California. I’ve become somewhat complacent within the job, as I do have the availability to work from my home on a very regular basis, and the company offers pretty great healthcare for a very very reasonable price. Those are the benefits. 

### The Problem 

The obvious problem is I really need my pay to go up, and I’ve been bugging my boss, his boss, and whoever I can for a raise for over a year. Every time I feel like they are getting close, or telling me they are working on it, the request is tabled for another time. Now I’m basically fed up with waiting and would like some advice. 

Here’s where I’m in a potentially good position, but I need some help on what to do. 

I’m working on a project right now where I am absolutely crucial. We’re currently redesigning a very large talent/job search company’s web interface. There is literally no one else that can do this project (as we have a very small team - only 3 of us, even though the company itself is humongous). 

I also have 4 weeks of saved vacation. 

I’m curious if I can basically just say “I’m taking a vacation, get back to me when I get a raise”. 

I need help communicating my “strike” and am also curious if I can take my paid vacation and if it’s legal for them to fire me over taking vacation hours that I have accumulated. 

My second option is just to take the paid vacation (under the assumption that I will be fired after 4 weeks) and work on my portfolio for a job hunt. 

**Really need some helpful opinions.** 


### Tl;dr:

&gt;[MORPHEUS.NETWORK](https://MORPHEUS.NETWORK) WAS DESIGNED IN CONSULTATION WITH SOME OF THE WORLD’S LARGEST SHIPPING, CUSTOMS &amp; BANKING FIRMS TO CREATE A FULL-SERVICE, GLOBAL, AUTOMATED, SUPPLY CHAIN PLATFORM WITH AN INTEGRATED CRYPTOCURRENCY PAYMENT SYSTEM UTILIZING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY.

&amp;#x200B;

**Let’s dive in deeper than the typical buzz-words you’d expect to see on a project’s website.**

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, this middleware approach to blockchain + global trade is simple, intuitive and brilliant. Rather than focusing on developing a new technology altogether -- [Morpheus.Network](https://Morpheus.Network) is able to leverage all the best blockchain protocols **(Ethereum, Holochain, Chainlink, Stellar, IPFS document storage, Storj, Siacoin, BTC, Ripple**, the list is literally never ending...), all of the best logistics API's **(FedEx, UPS, Microsoft Azure, DHL, SAP, IBM, Oracle**, etc.), IoT triggers **(QR, RFID, GPS Location, temperature sensors**, etc.), and anything else that might be useful in global trade.

That essentially makes the platform future proof. New technologies and innovations just enhance the ecosystem even more, because they can simply be integrated. It also has no competitors. There isn't a single crypto project that is doing this -- providing a blockchain powered network as a middleware to link all the best supply chain technologies together. I've searched, believe me. The concept is so intuitive, and yet nobody else has been able to pull it all together, that tells me this is special.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, what’s special about this Platform are the partnerships and integrations with top tier **payment platforms**. That's essentially what brings the entire supply-chain process together, and it's something that really gives the product an edge. With the strength of the world's largest international payment platform -- **SWIFT** \-- coupled with a groundbreaking cash management platform -- **AccessPay** – [Morpheus.Network](https://Morpheus.Network) not only brings the payment side of the process into play, it does so in an innovative and superior way than most existing centralized solutions.

&amp;#x200B;

The flexibility, scalability and ease of use cannot be understated -- especially as Dan (CEO) and Karl (Global Head of Business) are out selling the platform to CEOs. Top executives don't care **how it works**, it just needs to work – and then they’ll let their imaginations run wild with how much money it can save them by automating **everything**. Everyone knows how to drag and drop -- and this kind of plug and play blockchain automation is what this industry currently lacks.

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of “how it works,” this is where you’re probably asking yourself, okay they have an incredible product - why does it need a token, and how will the token be used? What is going to make this MRPH token have value beyond speculation? Here is the current token utility as we know it. Keep in mind, the full tokenomics are currently being developed and approved by the legal team. They will be published before the platform launch (by the end of Q1 2019):

&amp;#x200B;

* The platform charges a flat **1%** transaction fee. This 1% fee **must be paid in MRPH.**
* The MRPH token is specifically designed to map out the details of any smart contract executed within the platform. To put it simply – MRPH **must be transacted** on the blockchain to record the history of every single supply chain event (each payment, QR/RFID scan, shipment, delivery, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

Clearly, the MRPH token has intrinsic utility within the network. There isn’t a single event on the Platform that doesn’t cost MRPH. The next question is – how does [Morpheus.Network](https://Morpheus.Network) expect users to buy these tokens, store them safely, and do so without dealing with the current crypto regulatory nightmare? To put it simply – **they don’t**:

&amp;#x200B;

* Users of the platform **do not need to hold MRPH or purchase them off an exchange**. All fiat to MRPH conversions, and MRPH transactions, happen autonomously on the backend. So if a company does not want to be paid in crypto, **they can choose to be paid in any fiat currency they want**. The platform will automatically convert 1% of the fiat currency to MRPH the backend.
* All payment amounts are pegged to the EURO, so that while a payment is in escrow (waiting for goods to be delivered), the volatility of MRPH does not affect the customer whatsoever. Let’s say between ordering the goods and receiving them, MRPH increases 10% -- the cost for the seller **is not affected**. It simply means less MRPH will need to be bought on the backend.

&amp;#x200B;

The MRPH token has undeniable intrinsic demand within the platform, customers don’t even need to think about MRPH because it’s used 100% on the backend of the platform, and the price volatility of MRPH is a non-factor. What’s the catch you ask? We still don’t know:

&amp;#x200B;

* Where the tokens bought on the backend will come from. Speculation from me: it would make sense for them to be purchased from a decentralized exchange. In fact, they have a liquidity exchange within their website: [exchange.morpheus.network](https://exchange.morpheus.network)
* What happens to the MRPH tokens **after** they are bought and transacted for the 1% fee and to map out the supply chain. Speculation from me: Dan has teased some “token holding incentives” when asked about masternodes in one of the AMA’s. I believe there will be masternodes announced, and they will be entitled to a % of the transaction fee. Also, they could implement a token locking mechanism that will reduce circulating supply over time.

&amp;#x200B;

To sum this post up – there isn't a single supply chain scenario this platform can't handle, in theory. Obviously, things need to be developed for each use case – but the potential number of integrations is nearly unlimited. The native token MRPH is the backbone of the network and is going to be transacted in every single event that happens on the platform, sometimes, in more ways than one. Upcoming tokenomics and token holding incentives – including masternodes (potentially).

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I’ve left out that I want to touch on – the team is truly high caliber. Former CEO of DHL, Roger Crook, is Team Lead for Global Logistics; inventor of privacy Bulletproofs – Jonathan Bootle – is an advisor, and R3 Blockchain Solutions Architect, Daniel Eidan, oversees Software Solutions (Note the recent collaboration between SWIFT and R3). Check out [https://morpheus.network/team/](https://morpheus.network/team/) to see the full power squad.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, I truly think that as people fully understand the platform, it’s accomplishments and the limitless potential – they will see that [Morpheus.Network](https://Morpheus.Network) is the future of global trade.

personalfinance,"UK citizen, based in Madagascar, working as an independent contractor for a US (NY) 501(c)(3) - help needed!","Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

As the title states, I am looking for some advice on my situation, which is a little complicated. I am very new to this, and not familiar with the US system, so any advice would be greatly appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

I live in Madagascar, thought I don't have residency - I will have a courtesy visa once I start work. I am a UK citizen. I will shortly be starting work for a US (New York)-based 501(c)(3), as an independent contractor.

&amp;#x200B;

First and foremost, I would like some advice on what forms I need to fill out to get registered with the IRS etc. in the USA. I want to make the process and quick and smooth as possible, so I can receive money ASAP. What steps should I take?

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, what taxes should I expect to pay, given my location and citizenship? My fee for the year's contract is $65k. How will the taxes be paid, and how often?

&amp;#x200B;

Thirdly, and connected with point 2, how can I minimize my taxes? Are there any taxes (federal, state, and local income taxes, plus self-employment tax) that would not apply give where I live? Should I sent up a company to receive my fees?

&amp;#x200B;

As you can tell, I am pretty lost, so any guidance people could give would be amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!",finance

personalfinance,Questions on How to Buy a Car Guide from Wiki,"Hello everybody. I’m looking to buy a new car soon and have a few questions on the [Step by Step Guide on How to Buy a Car](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3898f1/step_by_step_guide_on_how_to_buy_a_car_my_friend/) guide from the wiki. I already know what car I want and am looking to iron out some details before I’m looking to buy in the next few weeks/months.

My preliminary research on interest rates is a bit troubling to me. The rates I’ve seen are between 3.5-5%, which seems high. Is this what I should be prepared for? Should I be looking in specific place for lower rates?

For step 6, how far in advance should I be applying for car loans from banks? Is this something I should weeks in advance, or will a few days be enough time?

When I reach out to dealerships in step 8, should I include the price I want to buy the car for, or let them give me an offer first? Should this price also include sales tax, or will that be added later? I have a firm upper limit for the model I’m considering, so I’m leaning toward opening with “this is how much I’m willing to pay for the car, and that’s it.” If this is a bad idea though, please tell me. Will that approach work better if I try at work out the price at a dealership? 

Step 11 confuses me the most. Assuming I go with outside financing, how exactly do I get the money to the dealership to make the purchase? Will the bank send the money, or do I need to go pick up a check? Should I walk in there with the money, or should I wait to make sure they honor our deal first? If I have to walk away or the dealership is able to beat the bank, I don’t want to have already taken out the loan. What if I go with a bank that doesn’t have a branch in the area?

Again, assuming I go with outside financing, how does the down payment factor into that? Do I work that out with the bank, or do I give that money to the dealership at the time of purchase?

This is all completely new to me. I’ve never had to take a loan that wasn’t a student loan, and I want to know what to expect and how to navigate through the process. I don't want the banks/dealership to try and take advantage of me once they realize I have no idea how the process works. Thanks for all your answers in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Have yet to receive my W-2 statement from employer. What can I do?,"I work for a small company who uses an independent contractor who does our payroll, taxes, and benefits. He has a history of missing pay periods.. forgetting to enroll employees in health care benefits etc.

personalfinance,Refinancing Student Loans - Looking for Advice,"Hello! I am in the process of refinancing student loans valued at about $42,000 with average interest rates of 7%. Household income is about $95,000 and expected to increase to about $105,000 over the next 3 years. Emergency fund of 3 months expenses and about $2,000 per month to allocate among different financial goals. Currently have $500 budgeted towards paying student loans (not included in the $2,000 previously mentioned).

I have been approved for refinancing with the following loan terms:

Shortest: 5 years, 5%, $790 per month

Longest: 20 years, 5.7%,$300 per month

Mid-point: 12 years, 5.3%, $490 per month

One of my goals within the next 2 to 3 years is to save for a downpayment and purchase a home. I am having difficulty figuring out which loan term will be most beneficial in terms of helping me to purchase/afford a home. As much as I would love to take the 5-year student loan term, I think this could negatively impact my home-ownership goal. This is my first time going through this process so I don't have the perspective that some of you might have. Thanks!

Edit: Looking at house values in the range of $300k to $360k. No other debt besides student loans.",finance

personalfinance,Looking to Refinance a high interest car loan,"I am looking to refinance a car loan with fairly high interest, my current car loan has 60 months left on it, and the interest rate is over 11 percent.  The loan is with Carmax Auto Finance. Over the past year, I have been able to increase my credit score by almost 75 points, making refinancing to a  much lower interest rate quite a bit easier (even if it only knocks 30 to 40 dollars off the monthly payment.)  However the one thing I have really come to like about Carmax, is that they have a very lenient grace period (10 days) before they apply a late fee on the loan, and unfortunately, I live paycheck to paycheck, and have to make the payment a day or two after the due date, depending on how pay periods line up. I am working towards building a savings, and getting away from living paycheck to paycheck, I am not looking for a lecture on my finances, I know buying a newer car with an 11 percent interest rate was not the best decision, I am simply looking to see if this kind of grace period is available with a company that could potentially give me a better interest rate and lower my payment, so I can put the excess I am currently paying towards the loan or into savings.",finance

My credit card is near its limit (I was planning to pay it off 2-3 months from now) and while I have a parent that earns a lot so I don't qualify for need-based aid (he doesn't really provide for me outside of a place to live).

Is there a place where I can receive a loan really quick? I don't really care about the interest rate (but I do care if it has early payment fees). I will use parts of the loan and pay it off as fast as I can when I start getting my paycheck.

personalfinance,Tell me why this isn't a loophole (US federal taxes),"Edit: kudos to u/cubbiesnextyr for finding the answer.

I feel like I’ve found a loophole in the new tax code, but frankly, I’m not that smart. So I just need someone to point out where I’m wrong.

This supposed loophole centers on the new $10k limit on SALT deductions. First I’m going to walk through the reason this loophole didn’t exist prior to the $10k cap. To best illustrate this point, I’m going to keep things simple by assuming that each year is the same as the previous year in terms of income, withholding, tax rate, etc. I’m also using 2018 tax brackets for all examples, again, just to keep things simple so it’s easier to see my point.

With no $10k cap:

150000 – wages

2300 – previous year state refund

20000 – federal withheld

9000 – state withheld

3900 – real estate tax

19000 – other deductions

-

152300 – income (150000 + 2300)

31900 – deductions (9000 + 3900 + 19000)

18367 – tax owed (based on 152300 - 31900 = 120400)

1633 – refund (20000 - 18367)

-

Now in an alternative universe where I withhold $1000 less in state taxes, it all comes out in the wash (i.e. no loophole):

150000 – wages

1300 – previous year state refund (1000 less because I withhold 1000 less)

20000 – federal withheld

8000 – state withheld (1000 less)

3900 – real estate tax

19000 – other deductions

-

151300 – income (150000 + 1300)

30900 – deductions (8000 + 3900 + 19000)

18367 – tax owed (based on 151300 - 30900 = 120400)

1633 – refund (20000 - 18367)

-

Now I’ll do the same thing with the SALT limit in place:

150000 – wages

2300 – previous year state refund

20000 – federal withheld

9000 – state withheld

3900 – real estate tax

19000 – other deductions

-

152300 – income (150000 + 2300)

29000 – deductions (10000 + 19000)

19005 – tax owed (based on 152300 - 29000 = 123300)

995 – refund (20000 - 19005)

-

But if I lower my state withholdings by $1000, it no longer comes out in the wash:

150000 – wages

1300 – previous year state refund (1000 less because I withhold 1000 less)

20000 – federal withheld

8000 – state withheld (1000 less)

3900 – real estate tax

19000 – other deductions

-

151300 – income (150000 + 1300)

29000 – deductions (10000 + 19000)

18785 – tax owed (based on 151300 - 29000 = 122300)

1215 – refund (20000 - 18785)

-

TL;DR: if the SALT limit affects you, then you should lower your state withholdings. It will result in you owing less in federal taxes. Please correct me if I’m wrong!",finance

I'm 24 years old professional working in NYC making around 60K. I've never known how to shop for savings accounts.

Forex,Here is what an EA looks like for those who are wondering,"For those of you wondering what an EA (forex automatic trading program) looks like and how it works, here is an example of one I've been working on today:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/6egnrh5y5td21.png

What this particular EA does is tries to identify trends using a few indicators on two timeframes.  It then outputs what it thinks of the market in the little panel you see on the top-right corner.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now it's saying USDCAD has a weak bearish trend, which makes sense as you can see on the left side of the chart there was a gradual decline yesterday which ended abruptly with the massive dump (that's the Powell interest rate announcement yesterday btw).

&amp;#x200B;

If this bot had been live trading, it would have jumped on the downward trend (first candle shown on the chart, roughly 1.32650) and rode it down until the trend turned around 1.31350 before bailing out with 130 pips profit.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then the pair has been floundering a bunch as the market hasn't figured out where it's going now.   However it looks like it might start turning around and head up - that's what MACD is starting to suggest, the upward momentum is surpassing the downward momentum.  So we're likely going to see a rally heading into next week.  Because of this uncertainty, the bot would have stopped until it can clearly see a strong trend going.

&amp;#x200B;

EA's are very useful because:

1. They will very quickly show you how good your strategy actually is.  You set the rules and they go to work.  If your strategy is shit and you've just been getting luck, you'll find out very quickly.  If your strategy is good then the bot will make it better as it will be more precise in entering and exiting trades than you can.
2. They run automatically.   The EA will work in your sleep or while you are working or whatever.   If your strategy is solid (see above point) then the EA will work 24/5 for you.   You won't miss opportunities like you will manually trading.

On this flip side, EA's can be risky because:

1. If your strategy is bad, the EA will be bad.  It likely wreck your trading account if you don't code it properly.
2. If the coding is bad, you are beyond fucked.   Even if the strategy is sound, if it wasn't coded properly or you didn't account for certain edge cases, consider your trading account a write off.
3. If the computer powering the EA loses power/internet connectivity/whatever, then it won't be running.  That can result in lost opportunities but it's not the end of the world.
4. Because EA's generally rely solely on technical analysis, they are always lagging behind.  They will be a little late to jump on the trend wagon, and they will be a little late to jump off it.   So while in the above example the bot would likely have made 130 pips, a human who was using a similar strategy would likely have jumped on earlier and gotten out earlier and probably hit around 150-160 pips profit.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, this is what an EA looks like.  Happy thursday :)

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

&amp;#x200B;

Update as of Friday morning.  After doing some more work on it after I posted this yesterday I set the bot live.   It identified the entry conditions on GBPCAD and placed a sell order (see the yellow box around the green candle in the screenshot below).  At first the market started swinging upwards, but the overall daily trend was down so the bot held it's ground.  This morning it's at 80 pips profit and still going strong:

personalfinance,How to resolve my car issue?,"I currently drive a leased vehicle with 1.5 years left. I want to get out of having car payments as soon as possible, but I don’t know how to do that.

My parents currently pay the lease but we have an agreement that I would start making payments on it when I found a job and started working. Since I just graduated college and found a job (I start Feb. 11th) I will soon be the one making payments. The lease is $295/mo. 

I want to no longer have car payments for the foreseeable future, at least until I pay off my student loans ($16,375). If I only make the minimum payments on my loans ($168/mo.), I will only have $176/mo. left to save for a used car. Fortunately I have a grace period before I have to start making payments of 6 months, so until June. There’s also the issue of the mileage of the lease. I’m allowed 12,000 miles/yr. but have already reached 26,800 miles with the 1.5 years remaining so I’d have to save up to pay the mile overage fee (I think it’s $0.15/mile over).

The job pays $13.49/hr. so about $22,000 after taxes (I live in Tennessee so no ~~federal~~ state tax, yay) and before monthly+quarterly bonuses and over-time.

I’m just feeling overwhelmed with the lease and not sure what to do. Any advice would be appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,What do I do with my current home? How do I buy another home before selling/moving out of this one?,"I bought in 2015 and I'm at the 4 year mark of my mortgage. Bought it at 800k with 20% down at a rate of around 4.2%. I may need to move out this year thanks to a growing family and shifting job. I'm trying to figure out what's next. I have two probably dumb questions.

1. I was thinking of refinancing with a lower interest rate ARM loan renting my place out for 5 years before selling Is this a dumb idea? I played with some numbers and it seems like I'd come out on top even if I had to hold my house for a little longer with a somewhat higher interest rate.
2. I'm looking at buying another house without selling this one before I move out. In order to qualify for an appropriately sized loan, the mortgage guy I spoke to said I needed to show a lease of someone willing to pay me a certain rent. He suggested I just have a friend or family member sign something saying they would. This strikes me as extremely shady, and I don't feel comfortable doing that. Am I over-reacting? Is there any other way to qualify for a loan and line something up before I need to move?

Even if I do need to sell, I'm not likely to be able to sell it quickly enough before moving and I'm trying to minimize life disruption for the kids and pets doing a lot of moves.",finance

How is this possible?

1. I did not receive any benefits or health insurance at my prior job. I do receive benefits at my current job. However, I wasn't enrolled until 2 months in, so the first two paychecks didn't deduct anything for my benefits. When I don't include healthcare, etc., my calculations are the same.

2. Same withholding for both jobs. My taxes are simple. I'm single, no kids, one salary, standard deductions, ""2"" for federal withholding and same for state. Everything has been the same.

3. I now work for the federal government. However, I'm not talking about my backpay or anything. Im taking about my normal paychecks that I received before the shutdown.

Essentially I'm two years in to a bachelors, debt free (Community college + grants + working)  My goal is to transfer back to a 4 year school come the summer time but with that comes a decision:

Important to note, I am ineligible for any federal loans, and I have only one bank that loans to students in my situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I live on campus I will pay around $20,646 a year, $40,542.00 total for my last 2 years.  The loan is for 10 years, fixed rate 13.99% (awful but I have no other choices) I did some numbers and this would result in a monthly payment of $629, for a total of $75,508 after 10 years.

&amp;#x200B;

My other option would be to commute (1 hour each way) which would effectively half my amount after 10 years to $4,053.00 ($342 monthly)

Current Situation: 
I am currently in the processes of selling my home and looking to purchase a new home. The owing of $7k would be a huge hit to the down payment to my home.  Almost all my funds aside from savings for the home are tied to long-term investments like 401ks, Stocks, Bonds, and Roth IRA.

personalfinance,Defect in TurboTax software: Screwed out of $80,"I tested several online tax filing programs (turbotax, hrblock, taxslayer, freetaxusa) as I do most years, because one tends to come out to more for whatever reason.  This year, all 4 gave me the same result for Fed, but different numbers for State, with TurboTax being the highest refund by over $400.  My SO's showed a similar difference despite having very different deductions, etc from me. So we both pushed through to E-file with TurboTax.  

Mine was free but because she had an HSA, TurboTax said it would require $39.99 EACH for both federal and state.  Normally I would scoff at this but since it appeared that TurboTax found something the others didn't, it would more than pay for itself.  

Today we both received messages that our state returns were rejected due to an error in TurboTax which has since been patched, and we must re-file.  Now when logging in we see that our state refunds are actually LOWER than the other three were, albeit not by a significant amount.  The ONLY reason we sprung for the obnoxious $80 charge for TT fed+state deluxe was because it seemed like it must have done the best job finding our deductions/credits/whatever, through our comparison process.  I even ran through TT twice to be certain that I had entered all my forms and numbers correctly.  

I checked on their refund policy and:
