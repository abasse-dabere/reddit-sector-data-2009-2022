personalfinance,Is it a good idea to refinance the house mortgage from 30y to 15y if I’m planing to pay it off in next 5-7 years anyways?,"My husband (30y) and I (28y) bought a house in Sep 2018. Our current loan balance is $275k (30y fixed 4.75 APR). 

Recently I have been watching Dave Ramsey show and get influenced by the idea that it is good to pay off house loan ASAP when you have extra money after retirement savings and emergency funds. We usually have $4k savings per month that we add to our savings account. Now we are thinking of making more aggressive payments against principal per month. But we were also considering refinancing our loan and try getting a lower interest rate with 15y fixed terms. 

With our current financial situations, we should be able to pay off the loan in 5-7 years if we dump most of our monthly savings to mortgage. My question is: would refinancing and 15y term help save us a significant amount of interest if we plan to pay it off in next 5-7 years?",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage shopping,I'm looking to buy my first home and got pre-qualified for a mortgage back in April 2018. At the time I foolishly didn't shop around for rates. I still haven't found anything I want to buy and am wondering if applying again for pre-qualification/pre-approval with different banks is a good idea just to make sure I'm getting the best interest rate. Since it's been so long it'll count as a new inquiry and potentially lower my credit score but I'm thinking if might be worth it? My current lender quoted me at 4.3% over the summer. This is for 100% financing and no PMI. And the other lenders I would be looking at would be for the same type of mortgage. My score has already taken a hit because 2 months ago I had to get a car loan when my 02 Nissan finally died. My FICO scores are TU 781 EX 741 EQ 741.,finance

personalfinance,CareCredit for cosmetic surgery? new to credit cards and credit-building in general,"I am considering using CareCredit for a secondary rhinoplasty and some lip fillers. I'm 21 and I've never had a credit card before, although I am listed as an authorized user on one of my mom's cards. The cost will be 3,400 (discounted since I am going back to the same surgeon.) I know very little about credit. I live at home, free rent, free groceries, and I go to college for free through Walmart. So barely any expenses. 

Does anyone with experience using Care Credit see anything potentially financially disastrous in this plan, assuming I pay before the promotional period ends? Will using the card hurt my credit considering I don't have any other cards? Would it possibly build my credit? FYI, the credit limit is 25,000 on Care Credit cards.

EDIT: I guess i didn't consider using a card with a 0% interest rate for the first year/something similar? Would that be a better option? Would it have same effect on credit/better/worse?

EDIT: Thanks everyone for giving me your personal judgment on plastic surgery and very-little-to-no actual advice. Very helpful. I've decided I'm not getting any procedures anymore, because of your sage opinions of disapproval that were unrelated to the actual topic I sought help with. Happy New Year.",finance
personalfinance,Shoukd I pay off the house morgage asap?,"Hi folks first post here, would really appreciate your input.

My wife and I live in a condo that is worth 700k and we have a 4% 30 year loan on it. We make about 2.5k morgage payment, 800 property tax and 500 hoa a month. 

We together make about 400k pre tax a year, after maxing out 401k we put our money in wealthfront and fundrise as well as a small portion in the stock market. I was listening to a podcast called Dave Ramsay. He was saying that people should pay off their house morgage asap. I dont quite understand this. Since the morgage interest rate is 4% but the managed fund can do 7% or higher return on avg. Why would it be a good idea to dump all the money in primary residence? 

Also, if you guys have any good ideas on how to invest besides the three ways I mentioned above, i would be super interested to know. Thanks in advance.",finance
financialindependence,Four Years of Needlessly Detailed Record Keeping on Path to FI,"Edit: Here is a [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RgIiJ557mg5R-bHl85nXAkVFm7hSt98NK4oYLxbgWJw/copy) to a google sheet version of the FIRE Projection Chart I made.

**Background**

My wife (30) and I (33) have been married for a little over four years now. I am an active duty member of the military and my wife works for a non-profit organization. I was a saver prior to getting married but didn’t fully internalize the idea of Financial Independence until after we got married. My wife is responsible with money but was not a huge saver when we met. When we got married, she had no debt and some money in a 401k (better than probably 95% of her peers) but was not purposefully planning for retirement or anything. I have been tracking our expenses, income, and net worth fairly meticulously over the last four years and thought I’d share what that looks like.

**FIRE Snapshot**

[FIRE Projection Chart](https://imgur.com/ARoJEFs)

The above chart is our one-stop snapshot of our progress to FI. Here is an explanation of the different lines on the chart:

Total Assets: Self-explanatory (however it excludes 529 account)

Projection: This is our projected Net Worth with our planned monthly $4500 contributions and nominal 9% return.

$2,000: This is a projection of our NW with a pessimistic savings rate.

$6,000: This is a projection of our NW with an optimistic savings rate.

Goal: This line is our FI number. It is adjusted for inflation over time (2.5%).

Path: This curve represents the minimum asset growth rate to reach our FI number from our starting NW by our planned retirement date. As long as our actual NW remains above this curve, we will be FI by our planned date.

Coast TGT: This curve represents the NW required to meet our FI number by our planned retirement date with market returns only. If our NW crosses this curve, in theory we should not have to contribute any more money to savings and still hit our FI number by our RE date.

All-in-all, this chart gives us a quick overview of our plan to achieve FIRE.

**Income and Expenses**

Our expenses have gone down over the last four years. This is mainly due to us travelling less beginning in 2018 and continuing into 2019. I was very busy with work in 2018 and we had our first child in December of that year which really slowed down travelling. Additionally, we have managed to keep our other expenses relatively constant over the same time period. Below is our gross income and take-home savings rate for each of the last four years. Our savings rate in 2017 was roughly the same as 2016 but we did buy a new car essentially with cash that year as you can see in the expense charts.

2016: $129,900 / 28.7%

2017: $137,000 / 29.0%

2018: $146,600 / 52.9%

2019: $160,750 / 58.8%

Our income is a little non-traditional in that a significant amount of it over the past four years has not been subject to federal income tax. Because I’m in the military, a portion of my pay associated with locality is not taxable. Additionally, in 2015, 2016 and 2019 I spent a significant amount of the year in a combat zone which excludes my income from federal taxes.

[Annual Income Chart](https://imgur.com/YJgGW72)

I keep a monthly graph that shows our expenses and savings in both absolute and proportional measures.

[Absolute Monthly Expenses](https://imgur.com/ZVirzPr)

[Proportional Monthly Expenses](https://imgur.com/2nHKVUs)

Our net worth has increased much faster than I expected as we have been able to save more money over the past two years than I really anticipated. Below is an area chart of our net worth since I began tracking in 2011.

[Area Net Worth Chart](https://imgur.com/1Ju8JG5)

We are currently 48.5% of the way to our FI number. We plan on retiring when I hit 20 years of service in the military which will occur in about nine and a half years.

**Things we have done well:**

We have done a good job of keeping our living expenses the same or lower while increasing our income fairly significantly. This is how our savings rate has been able to increase so dramatically over the last 4 years. Our savings for 2019 alone exceeded our savings for 2016 and 2017 combined. We’ve also been disciplined with our investment accounts and continued to chug along through a few market corrections.

**Things we have not done well:**

I didn’t realize how much our income had been increasing, so in 2017 and 2018, we actually ended up with a decent amount of income in the 22% tax bracket but we weren’t taking advantage of all of our tax-deferred retirement planning options. So, we missed out on some tax deferred growth for sure. It’s even worse when you consider that we have had dividends paying out in our brokerage account which could have potentially been tax exempt if we had maxed out my TSP. In 2019 we maxed out my wife’s Simple IRA which should keep us right about the 12% tax bracket.

**Moving forward:**

In 2020, much of my income will again be tax exempt based on time in combat zone. However, we will increase our tax-deferred contributions using my TSP. This will give us an opportunity for some tax gain harvesting before our taxable income makes this impossible again. It’s likely that my wife will stop working, at least for a few years, when we have our next child. That is one of the reasons that we are trying to be aggressive now, so we can reduce our required savings in the future to still meet our FIRE goal.",finance

personalfinance,Social Security Offset Account?,"A coworker just explained to me that she linked to a federal government account on her online banking. This account had her social security number attached to it. She said that she paid off a credit card balance of about $1100 with this somewhat nebulous account.

She did not have to speak with anyone on the phone and linked to account online thru her banking app. She googled 'social security offset account number' and was given a routing number and account number. The account from which the balance was paid on her online banking read 'U.S. Treasury (Stored Value CA Last 4 of her social)'.

I'm just curious if anyone has any experience with a similar account? Will this be taken out of her income tax return? She says that the payment has been processed and her credit card balance reads 0.

solar,Will the tax credit be extended?,"Hello everyone, first post on r/solar.  I work in solar sales for residential homes and a bit concerned about the tax credit being phased out.  The 30% credit went a long way to making the cost of solar work for people.  What do we know about a possible extension?

I can see by 2022 with the planned phasing-out of the federal incentive the sheer cost of having a solar system installed on your home is going to be very prohibitive unless the cost of panels goes down dramatically

Edit: From what I can see that ITC extension wasn’t approved in the latest government spending bill.  Pretty disappointing.  At only 2.5% of energy production in the US I wonder how solar survives without drastically reducing the cost of panels",energy
personalfinance,Depression + DIY home model = disaster,"I am attempting to recover from a disastrous few years wherein I grappled with severe depression.

Bare with me cause there are a lot of details.

firstly, I am a software dev, making 110k a year in portland, or. I have a partner who brings in much less, but whom should be making approx half my salary in a few months when they graduate. I have

* 16k cash,
* 7k savings
* 5k investments,
* 20k 401k,
* no car.
* But most importantly, a house which I bought for 420k, which I pay 2.5k per month, 500 of which is PMI. We have roommates upstairs who pay 1.5k per month, to me, as rent. I owe 380k on the house.

I am currently accruing about 1.25k per month but this should be more like 4k when partner graduates.

Ideally, I would have refinanced the house earlier this year, at a lower interest rate and without PMI, which \_would\_ have lowered my mortgage by around half.

However, the past few years I have been very erratic and depressed.

personalfinance,Is my plan on how to pay off all my credit card debt a terrible idea?,"Hello everyone!


I (26F) need some advice as to whether this idea is terrible or not. I have found myself in some credit card debt. I owe $7,500 on credit card A and $4,500 on credit card B. I’ve been paying on them for some time. I have not added any transaction on credit card B for two years, and will occasionally put something on credit card A and try to pay that off ASAP. However I’ve been struggling to pay credit card A off for a while. I try and pay $500 to credit card A a month, but I feel like it only decreases by $50 a month. Credit card B used to have $9,000 on it two years ago, so I think I’ve done pretty well with that one. I’ve been paying around $200-300 a month on that one. 


Additionally, I have student loans (both federal and private) and typically pay about $700 a month on those. 


Anyway, I am back in grad school (online) so my student loan payments have stopped. I am lucky because my work pays all of my tuition, so I’m theory I’m not paying anything out of pocket. However, my work will only reimburse me for tuition costs after I have completed the courses for the semester and submitted my grades. This means I have to pay out of pocket first and wait a few months to get reimbursed. Because of this, I will have to take out additional student loans. 


Here is my idea: I take out a private student loan for $3,500 a semester (a total of 3 semesters). When my work reimburses me, I use that money to pay off my credit card debt. Then the private student loans get added to the loans I already have taken out. I will start paying on those after I complete my program.  


In my current financial situation, I can’t afford to pay $700 a month in student loans and $700 a month in credit card debt along with my other living expenses. I figured almost completely clearing out my credit card debt will free up a lot of money to throw at my student loan debt later. 


Thanks!

Edit for more info: Credit Card A has an interest rate of 16.65% (variable) and I have been paying about $105 in interest a month. Credit Card B has an interest rate of 17.4% (variable) and I have been paying about $65 in interest a month. My student loans have about a 7-9% interest rate.",finance

personalfinance,Home refinance question.,"I've been contemplating doing a refi on the home I currently have a mortgage on since interest rates are so low. We currently have around 85% LTV (the home has appreciated since we moved in 4.5 years ago). The loan term is 30 years. I do not pay PMI on the home, Navy Federal CU services the loan and does not charge PMI.

Right now our interest rate is 5.75%. It looks like with the current state of my credit, I can get that down to about 4.25ish depending on the lender. With about 7 to 8k in closing costs. This would lower my payments on the mortgage by about 150 dollars a month. My principal balance is down by about the same amount the closing costs would be. If I stay with NFCU I will avoid paying PMI still.

It's not our forever home, I don't plan on staying in the home past maybe 5 years from now. 

It would take about 4 years to recoup the costs of a refinance, but I would still have around 18k in equity in the home after the refi.

My main goal is to lower our payments. I'm not taking a cash out refi at all. It seems like I'm trading equity for a slightly lower payment, and that I may just be better off keeping things as they are and having more equity in the home when I sell, instead of having slightly more cash in my pocket each month. 

Am I on the right track with my assessment on this? Am I crazy for not taking advantage of lower interest rates right now?",finance
personalfinance,1st reddit post: Need Advice - Newly graduating physician…but with a big curve ball impacting finances and life plans.,"I wanted to start off by saying thank you so much to all who contribute to reddit as I have learned so much from the kindness of strangers on this website (long time lurker). My parents did not graduate high school and they did not have the privilege to pursue a graduate education as I have. In addition to training  to be a good doctor, I continue to try to learn more about how to be financially independent/at least make responsible financial decisions. 

**Background:** 

Soon to be 33-year-old physician, graduating end of June 2020. Not married/no kids, dating. 

Signed contract for base salary of $200k per year plus bonuses start in August 2020 in low cost of living area. 

Debts: Only Medical school federal student loans to the amount of $260k at avg 5.9% currently on PAYE plan. 

Savings: $8k emergency fund in online savings account with 1.6% interest. 

Retirement savings: $12K Roth IRA (index funds/bonds).

**Curve ball:** Parents went through devastating  times over the past 15 yrs+ (for brevity sake will keep it at that) and will need to sell their home as their current living situation is not sustainable. They lost nearly their entire retirement and emergency savings. Only “income” is from SS which is $1300 total per month. I have been contributing whatever I can as a resident but it is not much to sustain them. They project to sell their house with about $50K left over after paying all their major debts (2nd mortgage/CC debt/personal loans). Their remaining personal debt after is an auto loan for a total of $17850. This amounts to $335 per month for 54 months (includes interest of 5%). 

**Assessment/plan:** I need to take care of my parents as they will be dependent on me as their only child. They are mortified about this prospect as they have never had to be dependent on anybody and their pride is hurt. They sacrificed so much bringing me up and this is the least that I can do. They will have to live with me the first year at least to reduce expense and adjust moving to a new state. I do not plan to buy a home my first 2 years until I am certain this is a good long term private practice for me (ie partnership). A goal is to have my medical school debts paid off by 10 yrs. May or may not refinance privately depending on interest rate options when I graduate. I plan to build an emergency fund for projected 4 months expense total of $35K (25K on top of what I may have after moving expenses for my parents). Contribute what’s left after, and fully contributing after first year practice to retirement fund. 

I hope that I have not been to myopic in my plan and would like to know if this plan sounds financially sound/what I should adjust or have not accounted for?

*If interested- my projected Monthly budget plan for August 2020-2021 determined after taking out federal taxes (no state income tax): Fixed:* R*ent $1700, Utilities $300, Car+apartment rent insurance $250, Phone bill $110, OWN occupation Disability+term life insurance $350, Student Loans $3000 = Total fixed: $5710. Flexible: max $3000 (vacation included). Saving: as above $2K emergency fund then retirement plan.*  

***TL;DR: Parents lost home/retirement funds and will be financially dependent on me as a new physician graduate with $260k in student loans- need advice for sound financial plan for this year.***

I'm currently living with my parents (started 4 months ago) so I'm saving my money. I have about 5k saved up so far. I am putting 3% into my retirement currently. 


If you are still here after my terrible formatting, thanks! 

I would like to purchase a cheaper house around 125-150k within the next 2-3 years. Should I continue saving my money for said house or should I try to pay off my student debt? I believe last I looked I'm occurring around 7$ a day in interest for my private loans which is insane.

I guess my problem is I feel like paying off my student loans is throwing my money away. It may be bad to say but I like seeing my savings grow. I set up an acorn account so hopefully that works out well too.",finance

Bitcoin,"I was reading Saifedean's book and saw ""Mircea Popescu"" mentioned.. any info on this person?","I've read Saifedean's book and researched a bit who were the people thanked. I haven't found much on this person, other than some links of how he promotes rape and sent death treats to Andreas A and Pieter Wuille, which doesn't sound too good for starters. I did also read he runs some sort of exchange and had problems with the SEC but basically told them to leave and got away with it. Was also related to some betting websites, and he and other people run a Bitcoin client which they call the ""reference implementation"" and basically try to keep it as basic as possible, which seems like a good idea that someone is doing this (for instance the ""inflation bug"" on Core that the BCash developer found, I think didn't affect their client). Im not sure if their software has suffered from other problems, then again, barely no one uses it, so it's not as exposed as Core, but nonetheless, that someone keeps a really basic version is a good idea.

Other interesting things I've found is how Luke and Gavin asked him and their group if they were ok with their fork proposal, so he must have a lot of BTC if they did bother asking him to get on board with a potential fork back then. Looks like he has a blog and I've been reading. It's a bit of a word salad headache, but if I got it right, he has mass enslavement-genocidal plans, and setting up a feudal system on BTC in which people that don't meet a certain level of IQ are sold, raped, killed.... basically, not considered human if they don't pass some sort of test. He would be the ""king of Bitcoin"" as he controls 51%+ of the BTC supply, thus he is the one ""pulling the strings"". Unless he's a troll and likes to play this villain persona, from what I've read he's defending rape, sending death treats over not agreeing with something, mass genocidal plans unless you can pass a fucking test... this guy must be fun at parties.

I mean, I can see how Saifedean learned some things from this guy. It's clear he is definitely knowledgeable on Bitcoin, made some good predictions and is most likely loaded so has a lot of skin in the game, but im just wondering, is this guy a great guy in person and he is just having a laugh at us with this thus why Saifedean decided to publicly thank him, or he's really fucked up in the head and seriously wants to enslave the entire fucking species because he didn't get enough hugs as a kid or something?

I may go back to school for a masters in the next few years (I have a bachelors), but haven't decided yet. I want kids and a family, but don't know exactly when this will happen (at least not for 5 years). I want to be able to pay for my kids college as much as possible.

I talked to a financial advisor, who recommended that I either save for a downpayment on a house, or open a 529 account to save for either my masters, or my future kids' college. Or maybe both. She said that if I do a 529 account, she reccomends utah's plan: [my529.org](https://my529.org) If I save for a downpayment, she recommended that I invest the money conservatively, but only if I plan to buy in 10 years or more. If less than 10 years, she recommended that I put it in a CD or high yield savings account.

Finally, I talked to my parents, who said they will probably give me \~200k for a house downpayment, as an early distribution from their estate.

I'm not sure which of these to prioritize--house savings, 529 savings, or both. What do you guys think?",finance

personalfinance,Amend federal return for years under payment agreement,"My wife and I made some big mistakes with her taxes and my immigration process several years ago. To make a long story short, she entered into an payment agreement with the IRS regarding owed taxes for the 2013 to 2016 years. She has been making those payments without fail and she has paid off all of 2016 and is now paying towards the owed taxes of 2015. The prior years are still owed.  I got an immigration attorney who advised me to apply for my ITIN and amend our tax return to correct our filing status for 2018 for immigration application purposes. The IRS accepted the amended return and applied the overpaid amount to my wife's 2015 owed taxes. We soon realized that we've been filing our taxes incorrectly all along and have been overpaying. We filed a 1040X for 2016 &amp; 2017 a month ago and the IRS has made adjustments to those years but we are still waiting for the letters regarding the outcome.

Amended returns on state taxes for 2016 to 2018 where accepted and resulted in over payment refunds for all 3 years.

Where I could use some help is whether we should/can file amended returns for the years of 2013 to 2015. The 1040X instructions says:

&gt;File Form 1040X only after you have filed your original return. Generally, for a credit or refund, you must file Form 1040X within 3 years (including extensions) after the date you filed your original return or within 2 years after the date you paid the tax, whichever is later. 

Since my wife is still paying off the taxes for those years, does that mean we can still file the 1040X? We are not hoping for any kind of refund but maybe we could have the total owed reduced to the correct amount by correcting our filing status for those years.",finance

DR's advice tells me to use $3k of my emergency fund to put towards my car loan, and then try to throw every penny into that loan until it's gone. After my loan is cleared, THEN I should build my emergency fund to 3-6 months of expenses.

Realistically, I could pay my car loan off in two years by paying $800\~ per month, which is doable for me.

investing,Goldman Sachs: Learning From A Century of US Recessions,"CNBC had some really sensationalized reporting around this that was removed but the paper itself is quite a good read.  Here's the highlights:

&gt; —During the “Great Moderation” period before 2007, many economists were
hopeful that various structural and policy changes had made the economy
fundamentally less recession-prone. While this view took a serious hit in the
crisis and the subsequent deep recession, we think many aspects of the Great
Moderation are still intact, and some have even strengthened.

 &gt; —A review of the last century of US recessions highlights five major causes:
industrial shocks and inventory imbalances; oil shocks; inflationary overheating
that leads to aggressive rate hikes; financial imbalances and asset price crashes;
and fiscal tightening.
n 

&gt; —The first three causes of recession have become structurally less threatening, in
our view. Better inventory management and the shrinking output share of the
most cyclical sectors have reduced the impact of industrial fluctuations. The
decline in the economy’s energy intensity and the rise of shale have reduced the
impact of oil price shocks. And better monetary policy has led to a flatter and
more anchored Phillips curve, reducing the risk of inflationary overheating.
n 

&gt; —The fourth cause, financial risk, has been the main source of recent recessions.
Old risks could reemerge, and the growing financialization of the economy or
shocks from abroad could create new risks. But for now, regulation and private
sector restraint in the post-crisis environment have kept financial risk subdued.
n 

&gt; —The fifth cause, fiscal policy, has historically meant major postwar
demobilizations on a scale not seen since the Korean War. But here too, new
risks could emerge in an era of political polarization, uncertainty, and dysfunction.
n 

&gt; —Overall, the changes underlying the Great Moderation appear intact, and we see
the economy as structurally less recession-prone today. While new risks could
emerge, none of the main sources of recent recessions—oil shocks, inflationary
overheating, and financial imbalances—seem too concerning for now. As a
result, the prospects for a soft landing look better than widely thought.

https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/learning-from-a-century-us-recessions/report.pdf

In summary Goldman is saying that structural changes to the economy as well as relatively tighter fiscal and regulatory controls have lessened the risks of a hard crash.  The idea of a soft landing economic event could be quite likely - think 2000-2002 but without the multiple compression in equity markets.",finance

My current interest is in some new builds in the area that have a 1300 sqft 3/2 starting at $236,000.00. Nerd Wallet  estimates my mortgage to be $1,723.00/month for a 30 year at an interest rate of 4.25% with my current DP of $25,000.00.

In my mind this seems reasonable as this will leave me with \~$700.00 remaining per month after taking into account increases in utilities, however I am sure there are items I am missing. Am I reaching to far? Do I reasonably make enough to afford this kind of home? Are there monthly expenses I am not thinking about or taking into account when deciding what I can afford? What can I do now to better prepare myself? Any help would be greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Help me to understand the best vehicle decision.,"# Situation:

We had our first child (2 months old now) and we have realized that my wife's car is a bit small. With the car seat, it requires the passenger seat to be pushed almost all the way up. Meaning no one can sit in it and also no room for baby 2 when the time comes.

We currently owe $11,390 on this car and it's worth about 6k-9k on a trade-in, so we'd have to roll the money into the new financing.

She wants to look at getting a new crossover type car used for $13-$16k. Plus tax, tag, and title I assume we'd be walking away with 14.5k - 17.5k in financing at a higher interest rate than we pay right now. Payments would probably be identical.

We have plans to pay off the old car by Sept this year as part of our debt reduction strategy. This obviously would elongate that plan by 5-9k of more debt to pay down.

Purchasing this car to me seems like a bad decision, to her it seems worth it. We would have to purchase a new car no matter what when child #2 enters this world (9m - 1y9m away).

&amp;#x200B;

**My question is, what option appears to make the most sense?**

1. Continue to pay off the car early, reducing the trade-in value with time, then purchase a new/used car on payments when kid #2 is coming.
2. Purchase the new car now and just prolong the overall debt paydown strategy by 2-4 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Update:

We came to a compromise to clean out my car more and use that and see what options exist for smaller car seats. The benefit of a new to us car now does not outweigh the cons of adding more debt.",finance
personalfinance,Solar panel credit - Should I use it to pay the no interest portion of loan or use it to pay off higher interest debt?,"Hi All,

New here and looking for financial advice from people who are more literate than I am at finances. My apologies if this is a simple scenario, and thank you in advance.

I recently purchased solar panels at a financed loan of about $55,000 (lots of panels) in 2019. The federal tax credit is about $17,000. The loan is a 10-year at 4.99% interest. 

Currently, that $17,000 is 0% interest until June 2020. This is because they give you the option of paying it lump sum once you get it back from your federal taxes. It technically doesn't have to be paid back. If I decided not to pay the amount returned in taxes, the value of the loan returns to $55K and I pay interest on that amount at 4.99%.

Here is my main question. Long story short, I had to move across the country in a quick hurry at the start of 2019. Doing this caused several major financial set backs, which isn't worth getting into, that lead to the usage of some high interest credit cards (20-25%). Roughly $20-22K on interest rolling cards. They're literally crushing me.

Is it better to use that money to pay off most of the existing debt that I feel crippled by and eat the 55K loan at the lower interest rate?

Or:

Do I use it to pay down the original loan as intended to around 38K at 4.99% and try the old fashioned way of paying credit cards of that amount?

Side note, transfers to 0% or low interest credit cards isn't really an option at this point.

I guess I'm trying to ensure I captured the pros and cons of each scenario.",finance
personalfinance,Debt Consolidation Through 401k Loan then Personal Loan,"Hi all!

I want to revamp my financial situation in a pretty big way in 2020, mainly because my wife and I are expecting our second child. Credit card debt is my primary financial burden right now, but my wife and I have a combined income of roughly $150k in a reasonably low cost of living area. Basically, we can still pay all our bills, put some money away, and live comfortably without doing anything different. Realistically, I'm not in a bad situation, especially given some of the scenarios I see on this sub. However, given the high interest rates of credit cards, it would be advantageous to consolidate because I'm wasting pretty serious money in interest.

I had an idea that I feel like I'm missing something because it seems too easy. I want to improve my credit (currently around 675-700 based on the free credit reports from my various credit cards) which is good, but not good enough to get the really great rates on the personal loan sites (payoff, bestegg, etc.). Here is my idea - take out a 401k loan to pay down/off the credit card debt, wait for all of that information to get processed by the credit monitoring agencies which should increase my score, go back to the personal loan sites, and take out a personal loan to pay off the 401k loan. I don't think I'm missing anything on this, but figured I would check.

Currently, I am getting rates between 9 - 11% on BestEgg, which is lower than my CCs, and I'm not sure if I would be getting a significantly better rate with the method above.

Any advice is appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,529 plan for student loan payments,"Hi looking for some advice on this one.

I saw a separate post about paying student loans with a 529 plan and can't find it now.  After some reading it appears that you can now use funds from a 529 plan to pay towards student loans.  My question is that if you don't have one already set up with funds, would you be able to open a 529 add funds and start paying back the student loans from that account? I no longer qualify for the tax deduction due to income.  I would rather lower my overall tax rate and use the funds from the 529 if possible.

3 different student loans at around 10k each with interest rates from 3.5 to 7 percent.  I currently make extra payments on the higher interest rate loans to pay them down more quickly.

personalfinance,"23 yo. Living at home with parents making ~$2500 a month while I have $20,000 in student loan debt and $8,000 in series EE bonds. Asking for advice on how to proceed forward with both student loans and bonds.","Hello all,

I posted in here a couple months ago asking for similar advice, however I now have a better understanding of my finances now that I have started my job since my last post.

I currently am living at home making $2500 a month in which I can apply $1250 of that every month to my student loans. As for specifics, I currently have $16,500 in subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loan debt. And another $4,000 in Federal Perkins loans that I will begin payments on in March of this year.

My current approach is that I am paying the minimum on all of my Stafford loans, and then applying the remaining amount to whatever Stafford loan has the highest interest rate (5%). As for the Federal Perkins Loans I have not started paying anything on these yet, and their interest rates are similar to that of my Stafford loans. My first question is should I be trying to eliminate these Perkins loans entirely or should I continue on my approach?

Secondly, I have found out I have about $8,000 in series EE Bonds from my grandparents/parents over the course of growing up. My parents advise me to sit on these bonds for as long as possible. I was wondering if this is the best advice based off the fact my loans are accruing interest, and I’m not well informed on bonds. Should I be looking to use these bonds to repay my student loan debt that I am currently in, or sit on them until I look to buy a house? As for the bonds themselves, how do I know which ones have matured or still are, and which ones I should use before others? I read online that applying bonds to Stafford and Perkins loans that they won’t be taxed, does this change how I should be looking to use these bonds as well?

personalfinance,How should I split my retirement savings between traditional and Roth accounts?,"Hi all,

I'm planning on maxing out my 401k and IRA contributions in 2020. I know there isn't necessarily a correct answer, but I'd like your thoughts on the best way to distribute my contributions between traditional and Roth accounts.

I'm a 23 year old male and I plan on retiring in my 50s. I live in a part of the US with a very high cost of living and I am renting a room from a friend of mine. I have no debt, no kids, and I am not married. I live in a state with no income tax.

Annual income: $105k (~80k after taxes)

Monthly expenses:

Rent: $1100 (includes utilities and internet)
Phone: $45
Car insurance: $100
Gasoline: $80
Food: $800
Misc/Fun: $500

Total monthly expenses: $2625
Net monthly savings after expenses: $3975

I currently have about $14k in savings and $40k in various retirement and brokerage accounts. 

My plan is to put $6000 into my Roth IRA this year and put $19,500 into my 401k split somewhat evenly between traditional and Roth accounts. My company matches my contributions dollar for dollar up to 4% of my salary. 

I'm currently favoring my Roth contributions because federal income taxes are historically low and I don't pay any state income tax for now. However, by contributing somewhat significantly to my traditional 401k I will lower my tax burden and pretty much keep myself out of the 24% tax bracket. 

Is this a good way to split it up or should I go ahead and put everything into Roth accounts? Also, since I plan on retiring before I'm 59 1/2, should some of my savings be going into a normal brokerage account as well?

Any advice is appreciated.

personalfinance,Parents living WAY above their means and in credit card debt. My grandmother passed away and her benefits were contributing to the household. Looking for advice before they drown in debt.,"My parents have NO idea how to manage money. They have spent way too much money all their lives, and now it's coming back to haunt them. They were taking care of my senile grandmother for 12 years and her social security / veterans benefits (from my deceased grandfather) were adding $2,700/mo to the household. She passed away a few weeks ago, and now my parents are scrambling to keep up with that $2,700 hole in the monthly income.

**I don't want to get TOO into the specifics of food and phone plans and all that stuff. The details are all very important, but right now I just need help with the big picture, long-term costs.** I know how to scrimp and save on daily spending, I just don't understand mortgages and the big deal stuff.

-

---

-

**THE UGLY BASICS** 

* Mortgage has $509,000 left on it because they had gotten a HELOC at some point to help with debt relief.

* Credit card debt of $74,000. APR ranges from 13%-28%, and calculates out to an equivalent 17.5%.

* Mortgage is $2,600 per month. Credit card **minimums** sum up to $2,300 per month. Obviously paying more than the minimums is important (especially on the higher APR cards) but for now we might have to stick to the minimums for a couple months as they prepare to move. 

* That means the mortgage and credit card minimums are approximately $4,900/mo. Add another thousand+ for electricity, phones, water, food, etc. and call it an even **$6,000/mo. in costs.** And this is ignoring the expenses of some minor house repairs which add up.

* Average income for the two of them combined is approximately **$6,600/mo** take-home after taxes. I am moving in with them for a little while to help the transition and I will pay them $1,200/mo as rent (which is around what I'd pay in this area so not a big deal for me).

* Credit scores for them both are around 600-650. Not good.

* Savings: I don't know about retirement but in terms of actual emergency funds there is nothing. There is never more than like $3,000 in the bank account at a time.

* Both own their cars, fully paid off with &lt;75k miles, so that's one thing to not worry about for now. Selling one of their cars would not really be viable at this time.

-

---

-

**THE GENERAL PLAN**

* They will have to move/downsize in a major way. We are fixing up odds and ends in the house in order to prepare it to sell. I think the house is worth around $650k but my father thinks it is closer to $750k. I'm very skeptical of that number so I'm not relying on it.

* Say the house sells for $675,000. $509,000 of it will settle the remainder of the mortgage. $75,000 of it will relieve ALL credit card debt. Realtor costs I'm seeing are ~6% of the sale of the house, which is another $40,500 (I had no idea it was so high). Then closing costs I'm seeing are 5% of the sale price of the house for another $34,000. **That only leaves $16,750 for all moving expenses and the down payment on the new house.** This is not enough, so we REALLY are hoping the house is more in that $700k range.

* We don't even know if they will qualify for a mortgage. If we can scrap together $20,000 and use that as a down payment, then we would need PMI which isn't great but it is what it is. We would be looking for houses in the $325-375k range in this area. Every area within a 45 minute drive of work for them is not going any lower than that.

-

---

-

**QUESTIONS/COMMENTS**

* Am I oversimplifying things in my general plan above? Looking at it like a very basic math equation: *(House sale) – (remainder of mortgage) – (credit cards) – (closing costs, realtor fees, moving expenses) = Remainder left over as down payment on a new mortgage.*

* With credit scores of 600-650 and not a ton of money down, are they even going to be able to get a mortgage?

* Worst-case scenario, if they REALLY can't get enough for a down payment on a new mortgage, then maybe we could knock out the highest interest rate credit cards only (say $40k) and then keep the ""lower"" interest rate credit cards to pay off aggressively after moving.

* Should I be looking into any other debt relief for them? Credit card consolidations or anything? I don't know the options here.

* One other note is that living in a small apartment is not really an option for them. They have 4 dogs and will require a backyard. I know my parents would rather live on the street than give up their dogs.

I think if we can just get them downsized and eliminate the credit card debt then they will find stability. With a $350,000 mortgage and $20,000 down, that could be around $2,300/mo according to [Nerd Wallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/mortgages/mortgage-calculator/calculate-mortgage-payment). That compared to their $6,600 income should hopefully get them back on their feet. Am I naive? And yes, I will cut up all their credit cards after this is done, that's for sure.",finance

I am working part-time currently, and haven't heard much from companies related to my degree. I am applying all over the country, so if a job hires me across the country I'd be willing to relocate, not sure if I would need a car if that happens but that's all just a dream for now.

I am planning on getting another job/ part-time job in the meantime, working as many hours as I can. Problem with that is I just don't have reliable transportation whatsoever, and am house hopping (sometimes I am stuck at a house and can't walk anywhere), and borrowing cars where my situation requires me to sacrifices hours at my current job because I don't have a ways to get there.

I don't have much savings, as I had to pay off whatever I owed my school to graduate. Over college I had saved up and purchased two cars from around $4000-$5000, and both were lemons that broke down pretty quickly and costs way too much for me to repair unfortunately. I do have good credit (a little above 700), and a credit card with a year and a half remaining of 0% APR, and no debt outside of federal student loans. I do not want to buy another risky cheap car as I have been burned twice before(once private, once a dealer), and without savings I fear I would be stuck with paying it off if I were to get a loan for it. (The last two I paid cash for.)

I am considering looking for a more reliable used car from a dealer, or perhaps even a short-term lease. I plan to just work as much as I possibly can while applying to jobs for my major. Because I have very little saved up I am considering throwing a down-payment on the 0% APR credit card, and aiming for around $200/month payments, then just spend the next year paying both off while looking for higher paying jobs in my field. I am used to living off very little.

I’m currently 21 years old and I graduated college with my bachelors degree in the spring of 2018.

Then, I got a raise and my salary increased to $52,000, and now my current salary is $56,000. My take-home pay every month is currently about $3,300. I believe I get a raise every year, so next year I might be making a bit more. 


I graduated with about $20,000 in student loans, but thanks to the fact that my parents are letting me live rent-free and save up my money, I paid them all off in a couple months. So, since then, I've been pretty much just saving my money (besides paying for necessities like gas, groceries, vet bills, etc.) 


I currently have $23,000 in my savings account (with an interest rate of 0.2%), and about another $2,000 between my two checking accounts (my debit card and then one I use as a 2nd ""savings"").


I have two credit cards that I've had for a couple years that I pay off every month, and my credit score is currently 750 (it used to stay in the 780-790s, and then it dropped when I paid off my student loans, I don't know why... still working on raising it again). 


My goal is to start house hunting in early 2021. Worst case scenario, if I save only $2,500 of the $3,300 I make every month, then by January 2021, I will have about $53,000 saved up. I typically don't spend $800 each month so $53,000 is probably the absolute minimum I'll have by then. Ideally I would like to keep $10k of that for emergency savings. 


I live in Washington state, and it's not the cheapest area to live. Houses here cost an average of $250,000-350,000. The lower end are houses that I will probably need to fix up a bit, while the higher end are newer houses or to-be-built plans. So, either way I'll be spending a good chunk of money.

Got about 240K in the bank. 

Part of me wants to pay off the mortgage fast because I hate the idea of paying $825K in total (2293\*360). At the same time, I don't know if it's a smart thing to do. 

What would you do?",finance
personalfinance,"Hi. I have a low credit score &lt;600. I wanna build it back up, so I had some follow up questions! Ty!","Hi. So one the reasons my score was low was because my credit card was maxed out and now I've paid off almost half of it.  
Next, since I just started a job I'm planning on getting a used car worth around 10k. Now I need some advice regarding this! I'm planning on getting an auto loan. I know the interest rate would be high but it's gonna help my credit score improve coz i'm going to make on time payments. If for a loan period of 36 months, if I pay it off after one year is that advisable for me? I'm planning on getting a new car after a year and getting that financed after paying of this 10k. I have no idea when it comes to all this so any advice would be greatly appreciated!  
Also, right now I've 2 credit cards. I heard getting a discover card and using that regularly with the other 2 would also help build my score. Should I do that? If yes, is discover fine or would you suggest something else?  
Would really appreciate any advice. Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Fidelity Fund Choice Question,"1. I have an Roth IRA at fidelity currently sitting with FFNOX. Would you recommend switching it the fidelity equivalent (FSKAX I believe) of the Vanguard fund VTSAX? or better yet, move the entire IRA to vanguard.

2. TLDR: Number of 403b funds got nerfed and it sucks but out of these which would be ideal for my situation? After the change, i'm not even sure which one or few to go with. Age: 36
VANG INST TR 2050 (VTRLX) is what I have currently that was switched from FFNOX.

personalfinance,How much should a 23 year old contribute to a 401k?,"Starting a new job on the 6th and I can start to contribute to my 401k 3 months after employment. I don’t know how much I should be contributing right now. The job is 60k a year. I will have $3240 deducted for commuting credits so my taxable is $56,760. Using a tax calculator which takes into consideration Medicare and social security, I would be paid biweekly $1,664 every 2 weeks so $3,328 a month. 

I will be living at home so, as of right now, I won’t have any rent to pay. However, the job is almost a 2 hour commute there and back so I might try to get An apartment closer to where I will be working. I live in a very high cost of living city and rent for a studio can be $1,600. 

While at home, I want to pay as much as I can toward my loan while still being able to save up some money. While at home, I want to put $1,300 a month or so, maybe more, toward my 20k federal loans. Hoping I can knock a ton of money off my loans while I’m at home because I won’t be able to pay nearly as much if I get an apartment. 

I’ll be staying on my parents health insurance till I’m 26 so I won’t have to pay for that. 

With these factors in mind, how much should I be paying towards 401k? I know they say 10% but I feel like that’ll be too much between rent (potentially), loans, and high cost of living.",finance
personalfinance,Should I sell my stocks to put towards loan?,"I’m a 21 year old finance and economics major with 2 semesters left. I work a great paying year round internship and have been there since March 2019 and have saved up quite a bit of money. I do have about $10,000 in student loans and as graduation nears (December 2020) I’m thinking about going ahead and working on those vs putting my money away in investments. Right now I’ve got:

High yield savings account: ~$1,000
Roth IRA: ~$3,100
Individual stocks: ~$3,000

I’m considering selling my stocks to put towards my student loan which has an interest rate of 5.45% but I wanted some other people’s opinion. I know most people will say “would you borrow money to invest in the stock market?” but  this past year I had a return of just over 13% and while 2020 is surrounded by uncertainty, I’m confident in the choices I’ve made and think I can certainly beat a 5.45% return. If you were in my position what would you do and why? Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,2 years behind on taxes,"I’m not sure If I’m in the right place. I’m looking for some guidance. I began working at a small family owned and operated bakery in 2017 when I was 17. I’m paid as a 1099 self employed contractor, the owner did it that way to make things easier on herself since I’m the only employee. I was 17 at the time and didn’t understand what it meant. The first year I made like $500 so I didn’t think I needed to file. The next I made $13,000 and this past year I made $18,000.  I haven’t paid taxes for either year, it’s so daunting that I just try not to think about it. I can’t afford to have someone file them for me and I’m so lost.  When I did the math I’m looking at around $5,500 owed for both years combined. I’m planning on going through turbo tax to file when I have the money but I’m hoping I’m very wrong and it’s less. I live in Texas so it’s just federal tax. Will I get penalized for paying late, and is there a possibility I will get anything back?",finance
personalfinance,401k employer match,"I started a new job this fall and my employer does not start matching my 401k contribution until 6 months in. (Standard) As of April 2020 my employer will begin matching. My company’s match is 25% of my contribution (amazing), I am currently contributing 18%. I am trying to decide if it would be worth it to stop contributing until April when my company will match me and then contribute at that time what I would have contributed January-March. I would save the amount that I would normally be contributing and then allocate it to my expenses in April-June while I am contributing more and taking less pay home. Is this worth it? My money would grow more in the 401k rather than my online savings account that has an interest rate of 1.9%. Is this a fair trade off? Ive lived a mindset of waiting to invest is losing out on money, but in this case it may be worth it? Thoughts? Stop contributing 18% over next 6 paychecks (3 months) and start contributing 36% for 6 paychecks beginning in April? Appreciate the feedback!",finance

investing,The actual return of an EE treasury bond.,"**United States investing**

An EE treasury bond doubles on the maturity date, but accrues interest on the initial investment simultaneously. 

f(r,t) = ((1+r)^t + 1)^{\frac{1}{t}} - 1

This is the equation to find the “actual” annualized return given the interest rate on the bond, r, and the number of years until it reaches maturity, t.

Here, we can see that given a 30 year maturity, a bond with at least 1.2% interest rate will outpace the average rate of inflation in the U.S. (3%). Any interest rate less than this will lose purchasing power over the long run.",finance
personalfinance,Cash Out Refi Primary Home to Pay off Rental Property?,"My husband and I are exploring refinance options for both our primary and rental property.  Our primary home is on a 30 year fixed (only about 1.5 years into paying it) with 4.0% rate and a current balance of $350K (market/appraised value around $550K).  Our rental property is also on a 30 year fixed with 4.5% rate (6 years into paying it), current balance of $110K, and market/appraised value of $215K.  Not sure if it's worth noting, but our current cash flow on the rental property is only about $200/month.

Any refinance option for the rental property (even a 15 year) has a higher interest rate than our current 4.5%.  However, we could refinance our primary residence to 3.5%.  Would it be wise to refinance our current home with a cash out of $90K to pay off our rental property (and we'd pull $20K out of HYSA).  We would still have plenty of liquid savings available if we used $20K to pay off the rental.

Our primary mortgage payment would go up $238/month, and we'd cash flow $650 more on our rental property (the cost of the monthly PI pmt) if the mortgage was paid off.  We would be net ahead of our current payments between both properties by $412/month.  Are we evaluating this correctly?  Presumably, we would have to pay income tax on the $650 cash flow, but even with a conservative 28% tax bracket, the net result is +$230/month.  We would still be able to deduct the mortgage interest on our taxes through our primary residence, but I'm not entirely sure what tax implications there may be related to our rental property.

Another question: would this be considered a cash out or no cash out refi given we are using the $90K to pay down another mortgage?  We are uncertain if a cash out during a refi requires you to pay income tax on the cash out portion, and if it does, are there any exceptions for how you use the funds?

Any and all advice appreciated.  Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,"“No cost” refinance? Advice needed, please!","I’m a first time homeowner.

I received an email from the mortgage broker that handled the purchase of my home six months ago offering a “no cost” refinance opportunity to reduce my interest rate from 4.125% to 3.75%. Currently I have about a $451,500 balance. The new loan would be $453,000. They claim my monthly payment would be reduced by about $115 a month. They say they will cover the closing costs and fees ($3,750 including the required appraisal) and that I would only be liable for $690 to cover 15 days worth of interest if I “do not establish an impound account.”

I currently DO have an impound account and love it. If I read between the lines, it seems that if I want to continue having one, it will cost me even more in upfront costs to refinance. Is that true?

I'm aware that TurboTax can handle this, but each State return is something along the lines of $40 each additional. This will still probably cost less than seeking a CPA to do, so TurboTax may still be my best bet. Or another tax software company... Any advice/suggestions would be appreciated! 


I'm not familiar with this either since I've always only had one state and one federal, but would I be able to just complete the different state returns within TurboTax and then print it out (and not pay the $40 each additional state) and mail it/do it manually on each state site?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,Credit score above 800 and mortgage interest at 4.125%,"My husband and I are buying our first home in one of the most expensive markets in the U.S. So the sticker price is already pretty high and we aren't as rich as most residents in this city. Luckily though, we got a good deal on this property and currently the process is half way in. (inspection and appraisal done)

All of a sudden, today we were told that our lender(one of the big US banks) has an issue with our loan(complicated situation but today I learned that these big banks have stricter restrictions which applied to our case). Luckily we had run 2 pre-approvals so we contacted the 2nd lender today asking about the loan. He said that he can do it and even close in 2 weeks to meet our deadline. 

The problem is that he knows we are desperate. So he quoted us 4.125% for 30yr fixed. Our current lender gave us 3.5-3.875%. Even if it's 3.875, that's 0.25% difference which seems negligible. When I punched in each interest rate on the Nerdwallet mortgage calculator, the monthly payment difference was $70/month.  
Since this is our first home I'm not sure if $70/month is a huge difference. It seems and it seems not. I feel like all the expenses of owning a property will add up to make $70 look like $7,000.

  
Both our credit score is above 800 and we don't have any other debts besides this one tricky situation that our current lender requires several documents we just can't get until late January-early February - well passed the closing date. 

We are thinking about paying penalty  to our seller, which will be about $3,000, to extend the closing date but not sure if it's worth it. What if we get the docs in Feb and for whatever reason, the loan still doesn't go through although we were told that once we have those docs, everything will be solid and good to go.   


Should we just proceed with the 2nd lender and go with 4.125%? With the low interest rate I'm seeing around, over 4% rate gives me a feeling of being robbed.",finance

What is going to be better to pay off? I want to pay off my CC because it is credit I will be able to use again in an emergency (also its killing my credit score). It is only that high of a balance because I needed dental work done. I want to pay off my car loan because I've been paying 300 a month for like 3 years now and its a 9 year old car. I can confidently say I'm going to probably pay twice maybe even 3 times its value but I had no choice at the time.

So, which do you think I should pay off and why?

stocks,What do Schumpeter and Kondratieff tells us of the current economy?,"I believe most users here are self taught and their knowledge comes mainly from news sources and forums (like here). Those who received a classical education in the domain might know about the works of Schumpeter and Kondratieff whose described economic cycles in works that have made history in economic science.

Everyday that goes by the description of those cycles match a little bit more our current economy. We are currently (or just where) in a prosperity period where innovation drive competitivity and investment, the economic activities reach their maximum heights and the idle or unemployed resources are minimised. As we can see our markets reached historical heights that some starts to call ""pre-crisis"" levels and unemployment follow suit.

Innovation products displace the old ones and thus decrease their demand in the market. Consequently, the prices of old products fall. With a view to liquidating their stocks, the old firms start selling their goods at a low price and hence most of the firms incur losses and some firms are even forced to run into loss. Schumpeter describes the industry as being the source and first warning indicator of a crisis, this description can be seen today in current PMI index.

The events that follows are Investment declines and unemployment rise, leading to a fall in the aggregate demand. As the entrepreneurs start repaying bank loans, the quantity of money in circulation is reduced and prices start falling. Profits too decline and come to zero point. Uncertainty and risk increase. A wave of pessimism sweeps the entire economy and the boom period ends with the appearance of the phase of depression.

This phase appears to be the next step for us,  this would mean the current market trend is only induced by FOMO and confidence boosted by the fed rates.

OR. Everyone keeps telling me to refinance my loans. Which; in theory sounds great. Consolidate my loans and have a single interest percentage. However, I'm very skeptical of refinancing. No one in the world wants to do you a favor without have an ulterior motive. Theirs would be that they buy my loans and then rake in the interest rates; and literally for nothing.

I want to try and get out from under it so I can find a new job.","This past year had some financial burdens, that we probably mismanaged and now hoping to get under control.  Had baby, that cost a decent chunk of money, had vet bills that also cost just as much as the baby did, and an expensive dental emergency. (Do not let your mouth get an infection.)  Which end up with us having $9800 in credit card debt.

Before anyone asks the dental place wouldn't work with us on a payment plan, and according to my wife, the hospital would not either.

I have a job that has me on the road about 90% of the time, make decent money doing it, probably can make more for the amount of travel I put in somewhere else, but as you can probably imagine new baby I wouldn't mind the idea of being home more often, but the pay cut we would not be able to stay above water with school loans and everything else.  We have already started cutting cost where we don't need.  We barely eat out anymore since the baby. We cut cable out and just have the internet.  We do have a couple of subscription services like Netflix.  The big killer is the $700 a month daycare.  

The rub is if I want a job at home it looks and feels like I am going to have to take a big pay cut because I am going have to switch fields it seems and start over.  I work in hazardous gas detection now.  Not a real big job market with that experience. 

I have enough in my 401K to pay off the credit card debt, but everywhere seems to think that's a bad idea.  I am 29 so I feel like I would have enough time to catch back up.  I looked for $9,800 it would cost me about $11,985.77 for federal and state taxes for doing such.  Not counting the lost money over the next 36 years. 

I am currently looking for a part-time job on the weekends to see if I could use that to pay off the debt but it seems to be hard since I can't work for those places during the week.

personalfinance,[US] Starting a Savings Account - No Idea What I'm Doing,"Hey, everyone.  My wife and I are finally in a position to open a savings account and my ignorance combined with all of the information out there is overwhelming.  I have looked over a lot of the information here and it seems like this is the best course of action, but wanted some advice.

For some backstory; my wife and I have both been broke the majority of our lives.  We have both been homeless before.  I'm currently going back to school because my previous profession doesn't pay for shit and her teacher's pay is not great.  We have no credit cards, no car payment, no health insurance, currently rent and she has 50k in student debt.  I will likely be incurring my own student debt before long.

I handle our budget and have meticulously documented everything for the past 2 years that we have lived together.  We typically close out the year with surplus and have held the joint account at 4-5.5k for that time period.  She came into the relationship with 3k.

I am going into a healthcare field and after tons of debate and study, we have determined that health insurance is an absolute waste of money for us.  The premium we could afford has a deductible so high that we would *never* pay it off.  Our state does not offer Medicaid/care gap coverage.  So we decided that saving for health emergencies, a replacement car or a house down payment is the most responsible thing to do.

We would be starting by putting aside about 1.5k and are hoping to put ~100 into it every month.  My wife has a Capital One savings account at 1.7%.  She has kept it open for years with a few hundred in it.  But we don't have a Capital One branch here and they don't have the best reputation.

Our current bank offers abysmal interest rates, so I've been looking around online and found [Bank5 Connect](https://www.bank5connect.com), [Vio](https://www.viobank.com/online-savings-account), and [HSBC](https://www.hsbcdirect.com/savings/).

Are these good options?  Are there better recommendations?  Is there anything I should look out for or consider?

personalfinance,I received a call out of the blue from my current mortgage company to refinance (see details),"I received a call from my current mortgage company with an offer to save some money.   I wasn't busy at the time so I listened to the offer and had them look at what they could do. I currently have 26 years on my mortgage.  They can lower my term to 20 years and only raise my payment by about $170.  Over the 20 years, this will save me a little over $50,000 in interest.

This sounds good, so I told him that I wanted some time to think it over.  It then, at that point, made me feel a little rushed.  ""We only have this special rate for X amount of days, etc""  Almost Timeshare salesy in that if I didn't act today the offer would be off the table.  I'm not worried about this being a scam (identify theft, etc) as we were walking through things on their company website and it was clear that he was in their system.  It just seemed like sketchy business practice.  I ended up convincing him that I didn't typically make big decisions without being able to think about it overnight.  He gave me over the weekend to think about it.  I don't want to identify the name of the company, but they wanted me to act *Quick*ly as if I were on a *Rocket.*  Should I be concerned about the rush placed on this offer?  Is it just a salepitch?

I am still interested in saving this money.  Another thought did pop into my head, though.  Would I be better off just putting $170  extra (ore more?) towards the principal (there is no prepayment penalty) each month with my current loan?  To be clear, my wife and I have no desire to stay in this same house for 20 more years.  Maybe 5.  So it's unlikely that this mortgage will be fully paid off ever.

**Some background**

I'm a permanent resident (status) in US, applying for citizenship in a month (process takes up to 6 months). Currently in VA. Bachelor's in CS (overseas, EU), working as a software developer.  


**Income**

* Salary: 82,000/year
* Take home: 4,600 - after all taxes (federal and state, social), health insurance and 401k match (4%).

**Expenses (monthly)**

* Total: 2000
   * 1,200 rent
   * 350 food
   * 450 bills (phone, internet, gas, water, electricity, garbage)

Those have been consistent for past 4 years.

**Savings**

* Monthly: 2,000 - this is for the past 12 months, I think average for past 3 years is 1,200. Starting salary was 55,000.
* Savings account (currently) - 22,000
* Roth IRA - 5,500
* 401k - 10,000
* Credit score - 775, not sure how to increase and if it matters much, accounts need to mature is my  guess

**Debt**

Car is paid (current value is 13,500, initial was 16,500). Two credit cards, I pay them off every month. No loans.

TLDR: no debt currently

**House**

I think my range is 300,000 to 350,000. So payments would vary like this:

* Monthly:   1,804 - 2,066
* Down payment: 30,000 - 35,000

I estimated with APR of 3.8%, 30 years.

\---

My target is around September this year, at that point I'd be at 43,500 (38,000 + 5,500, will withdraw from roth IRA). Backup would be between 8,500 and 13,500 (based on 300,000 vs 350,000 house) and about 15,000 in 401k. Will be paying PMI for the first 2 years, with intentions to bring it to 20% equity and stop paying. Only looking at new houses (in regards to maintenance).

personalfinance,Debt consolidation for ~15k in CC debt across 5 cards?,"My wife and I have a little less than 15k in CC debt spread across 5 cards, all with 20-30% APR. We also have a baby on the way, and I'm looking for ways to make our finances more manageable before that happens. One of the things I've been pondering is consolidating our credit card debt into one payment, and get these cards with long-time outstanding balances paid off finally. If I put what I'm paying towards all these cards towards a single 15k loan, I'm looking at 36 months of payments, trying to account for interest.

Are there hidden catches I'm not considering, or other things I should consider or prioritize?

personalfinance,Student loans. Took a huge paycut to stay in a community I love; hate decreased capital to put towards loans/retirement,"35k/year is how much I gave up to stay.

I'm still new to my career at 26. Left grad school 3 years ago with a doctorate of physical therapy and 200k in student loans and interest.

I was working a travel job (travel pays exceptionally well) for 105k a year and making good progress towards aggressively paying my loans off, like I planned when I was in school.

I have no family or old friends here, but I met my girlfriend and a wonderful community when I moved here a year ago. In lieu of picking up and moving to the next contract site, I took a job locally in town. I signed on for 70k hourly for 40 hrs, but within 2 weeks they reduced my hours to around 20. This went on for 3 months and significantly stressed me/my wallet.

I put in my resignation, and they offered me to stay as the rehab director and be salaried. I stayed, I don't really trust the company, but it's a small town so job opportunities are slim to none. I figured the resume experience would be worth it. 

I've been managing a small department for 2 months now. It's a fine job. Easy and low demands. But I can't escape this nagging feeling like I'm missing out on 35k + interest that would all be invested or put towards student debt.

 Am I crazy? I work a very comfortable job for just slightly less than market value. I am the first of my peers and classmates to land a director position. I am surrounded by the most wonderful people I have met in my life.  

I have the life I want when my loans are paid off. If I could stop worrying about the student loans (which are under a federal repayment plan) I'd probably be really happy.

That said, at this point, I now have no real timeframe for paying off my student loans like I did when I was traveling due to the fact that I can't even keep up with the interest at this point. It's been reduced to, well, I hope I have enough saved for the massive tax bomb that will hit me in 20 years when they're forgiven. And that stresses me out, a lot.

personalfinance,Student loan debt- need serious advice.,"I just graduated from a 4 year university in August and have accumulated 32k in federal student loans and 67k in parent plus loans. I graduated with a bachelors of science degree in nutrition and have just found a full time job in the clinical research field. This job is a entry level position and I will be making 16$/hr with full benefits. However, after 2-3+ years of experience in this field, I can most likely secure a more rewarding position that has an average salary of 70k per year and it’s not unusual for this position to earn upwards of 90k a year (lookup CRA salary’s). 

Being realistic, I can’t count on that everything will work out and I will land a CRA position after 2 years, but my end goal is to be in this position. So currently, my loan payments will start in March and I am working on finding a refinancing company to consolidate my loans. I figured that whichever company offers me the lowest interest rate after they have been consolidated is who I should go with. The job that I have now is not in my hometown so living with parents is not an option (I tried finding a position in my hometown but there aren’t any clinical research opportunities there). I know some of you may say that it was my parents choice to get a parent plus loan and that they should deal with it. However, I will not put that burden on my parents no matter what because It’s my responsibility and I am not a shitty human.

**Building a Balanced Portfolio**

**Stock vs Bonds**

**Bonds:** Fixed interest rate, plus repayment of initial investment after a fixed period.

**Stocks:** Partial ownership of a company.

Bonds are issued by both companies and governments. When you hear the government is $23 trillion in debt, it means it issued $23 trillion in bonds it has to pay back.

**Advantages of bonds:**

\-Safety. Fixed rate of return. Treasury bonds have historically averaged 5-6% return, although today's treasury bonds yield 2-3%.-Advantage in bankruptcy. When a company goes bankrupt bondholders have priority over stockholders. Typically in bankruptcy a new company gets created, where existing stockholders are wiped out and bondholders are issued shares in the new company.-Perform well during recessions. Treasury bonds gained 20% during the 2008 crash: [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/\~adamodar/New\_Home\_Page/datafile/histretSP.html](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html)

[https://imgur.com/JBQjgIu](https://imgur.com/JBQjgIu)

**Advantages of stocks:**

\-Voting rights. Stockholders get to vote on board of directors.

\-Ownership of all profits after bondholders are paid. Profits are returned through dividends. Sometimes for tax reasons companies also return money by buying back stock, which raises the stock price.

\-Historically have a higher rate of return (average of 9% annually since 1980). Future yields are expected by many people to be lower.

[https://imgur.com/aFkI4FE](https://imgur.com/aFkI4FE)

**It's safest to own both stocks and bonds!**

Suppose you were of retirement age in 2007 with $2 million in savings. When the market dropped &gt; 50% (Dow went from about 14,400 to 6,700) you would be very tempted to sell at the bottom. If instead you owned half bonds and half stocks, your bonds would have gained in value by 20%, which means your overall portfolio would only have dropped by 15%. More importantly, you would be able to sell your bonds and buy stocks when the market was at its lowest. A good rule of thumb is to always own half stocks and half bonds, and to rebalance your portfolio back to 50/50 at a specific date each year. This will force you to sell stocks when they are high and buy them when they're low. If you're younger you may prefer a slightly riskier portfolio with more stocks and less bonds, and older people closer to retirement are often advised to hold a higher proportion of bonds.

**Diversification:** Not putting all your eggs in one basket. Takes the stress out of investing, which means you make better decisions.

**Mutual Funds vs ETFs**

**Mutual Fund:** Professional money managers that invest for you, usually for a 2% annual fee. Never invest in a mutual fund if you can help it! That 2% fee will compound to 50% over a 20 year period. Mutual funds have been shown to consistently underperform the market.

**ETF: Exchange traded fund.** A basket of stocks or bonds. ETFs charge much lower fees than mutual funds. 

Example etfs:

SPY: An ETF that mirrors the average performance or the top 500 traded US stocks. Expense ratio is 0.1% annually.

GOVT: Tracks US government bonds, with an expense ratio of 0.15% annually. 

**Simple Investment plan**

If you want a stress-free investment plan that tracks the overall market, open up an account somewhere (I use Fidelity) and put half your money in SPY and half of it in GOVT. Be sure to set up a calendar event each year to remind yourself to rebalance between these two. 

**Valuing Stocks**

For most people, trying to pick winning stocks is a poor use of time versus buying an ETF. Most stocks have been closely scrutinized by an army of professional stock analysts who usually have done more research than we are willing to do. On the other hand, picking stocks can be a lot of fun! 

Take Ford as an example. I crossed out the chart and the stock price because I think it's more important to look at a company's financials. A company can still be relatively cheap even after it has gone up significantly, or expensive even though it has dropped.

[https://imgur.com/8e2zrB6](https://imgur.com/8e2zrB6)

**Stock Price**: Cost per share. Means absolutely nothing, since the number of shares issued is arbitrary.

**Market Cap:** The cost of buying all the shares in the company. 

**Dividend Yield:** Annual return on investment from dividend payments.

**P/E Ratio:** Price to Earnings ratio. Specifically, it is market cap divided by last year's net income (i.e. profit). Intuitively, if you bought the whole company, it is the number of years of profit you would need to receive until your investment paid for itself. 

P/E ratio is the most important metric to consider. Historically 15 was an average P/E ratio for a company, although today 20 is average. See [https://www.macrotrends.net/2577/sp-500-pe-ratio-price-to-earnings-chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/2577/sp-500-pe-ratio-price-to-earnings-chart)

**Growth Companies**

A company is considered a ""growth company"" if it has a history of growing rapidly (say &gt; 20% a year). Investors are willing to pay more for growth companies because they expect income to continue growing. Typically, investors may be willing to buy a company at a P/E ratio of 30-40 if it has a solid prospects of future growth. 

For an example of a growth company, check out Twilio's financials on Yahoo finance:

[https://imgur.com/QeFPFyd](https://imgur.com/QeFPFyd)

Twilio is a giant money pit: It lost $263 million in the last 12 months! However, it's revenues have increased by 50% every year, so investors are willing to pay a fortune for it:

[https://imgur.com/SloY6PI](https://imgur.com/SloY6PI)

(Note there is no P/E ratio, since earnings are negative). The takeaway is that investors are willing to pay $14 billion for a company that loses $263 million a year on $1 billion in revenue. This is only because their revenue has increased 50% for the past several years (and Twilio is a tech stock, which tend to be overpriced). When evaluating a stock like this, consider what the company would have to do in the next five years to justify this valuation. For Twilio to have a P/E ratio of 30 (which would be normal for a tech stock), it will need to make $500 million a year within five years. Furthermore, if you buy a stock like this you don't expect it to simply justify its valuation but to double in value, which means investors are expecting it to make $1 billion a year in profits within the next five years. This would require Twilio to both turn its profit margin from -25% to something healthy like 20%, and then to increase its sales from $1 billion to $5 billion. High priced-in expectations like this make growth companies like Twilio very risky. Personally, I avoid growth companies.

**Value Companies**

Companies that are selling at a discount, usually because they aren't growing rapidly. Although the business may be in trouble, the stock is being sold cheap enough that it may be safer to purchase than a growth company. Take a look at the department store Macy's, which has scared investors off since retail is in decline:

[https://imgur.com/K8iRBAS](https://imgur.com/K8iRBAS)

Notice that revenue has declined about 6% over the past 4 years, and net income has held steady. Also notice that profit margin is only about 4%, which means it would only take a small drop in fortune for net income to become negative. Were that to happen, would this company pose a bankruptcy risk? Let's check out the balance sheet: 

[https://imgur.com/ezMrjQB](https://imgur.com/ezMrjQB)

Macy's only has $4.6 Billion in debt, which isn't too high compared to $26 Billion in sales and $1 Billion annual profit. 

In summary, Macy's is facing slightly declining sales but has consistent profit, and has low debt. There appears to be little bankruptcy risk over the next several years, even though revenue is declining. 

[https://imgur.com/qCR75lL](https://imgur.com/qCR75lL)

The company is selling at a P/E ratio of 5, compared to the market average of 20! This means if you bought the company at its current price (5.1 Billion) you would make back your investment in 5 years. The company is also paying out a 9% dividend. Even if you expect Macy's to continue to decline in revenue, you can make a strong case that this is a good investment based on the low P/E ratio. Even if retail continues to decline, Macy's should, (to some extent) be able to keep a positive profit margin by closing down unprofitable stores and leaving the profitable ones open.

Key Takeaways:

\-Picking your own stocks is riskier, more time-consuming and stressful than buying a basket of stocks (an ETF). I only do it because I enjoy it.

\-Keep an even balance between stocks and bonds.

\-Prefer ETFs to mutual funds.

\-Stock price is an arbitrary number, since companies have different numbers of shares outstanding. A stock priced at $10 could have a higher market cap than another stock priced at $100.

\-When valuing a company, P/E ratio is a critical number. Growth companies demand P/E ratios, value companies have lower ratios. Currently the average P/E ratio for a stock is 20.

\-Ignore stock market news. These days the stock market goes up and down because of algorithmic trading, not because of the reasons financial reporters talk about.",finance

personalfinance,5%/10% disability retirement deduction for 25%/50% survivors pension plus survivors insurance (also have Tricare/VA)?,"So I'm applying for disability retirement from a federal job and my wife and I are having trouble with this decision. It's a good problem, the benefits are amazing, but there are a lot of variables. The federal retirement includes post-death insurance benefits for the family BUT I'm also a disabled veteran with VA healthcare (myself, family below certain income) and Tricare (whole family after death). 

As a rough estimate, the cost/benefit for the 10% deduction/50% survivors pension option would be about $300 a month for about $1800 a month in survivor benefits. Also, if we ever had trouble with Tricare getting the healthcare we want need, we could re-enroll in Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) and only pay the co-insurance as though I was still working as a federal employee. IF we did this, and I died, my wife could continue the FEHB *only* if we have a survivors benefit. So no survivor benefit, no FEHB but retain access to Tricare and possibly VA. 

The 10%/50% option seems expensive but I think that part of it is the continuation of FEHB benefits. If the ""backup"" health insurance options are something we should factor, the 5%/25% (about $150/$900) option might make more sense for the pension AND to keep our toe in the door on another health insurance option for my wife if I passed away. 

Another big factor, I'm pretty young (almost 35) and I have a multitude of health issues but nothing life threatening (fibromyalgia, inflammatory arthritis, anxiety, sleep apnea, and a bunch of other little things). So we could potentially be paying these premiums for a very long time. 

My wife is sort of leaning on me for the research so I would appreciate any feedback and advice. Right now, I think I'm leaning toward the 5%/25% option because Tricare is an amazing benefit but I have heard some horror stories in the past with getting some specialty care when you are older. It's not an easy equation in my opinion but this sort of hedges our bets. 

Also, the election of survivor benefits for Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS) is permanent as far as I know.",finance

I’m admittedly asking about something only a small segment cares about - what happens to a city like Memphis, whose economy is based very much on Fedex if Fedex is purchased? There are obviously examples like Detroit where the auto industry went under. Pittsburgh with steel. 

I think there are also multiple options. A company line Walmart could purchase and the company would remain more-or-less intact. Or an investor could purchase and sell off parts of the company, which would be worse for the city’s economy.

personalfinance,Should I repair my car or buy a new one?,"Ok, so I have run some numbers and am trying to determine if I should repair my 2018 4runner or buy a new one with better financing. I realize that there is the typical don’t buy a new car, don’t finance, etc etc. But off-roading and camping are some of my biggest hobbies and l love 4runners so it’s definitely a guilty pleasure that I am ok paying a premium for. With that, I’m just trying to determine if the net total cost would make it worthwhile to just buy new with lower interest and trade in my old 4runner (understanding that it has depreciated too and I am out for a good chunk of the money I put down on it and have already paid). Here are the stats on each vehicle:

2018 4Runner (current):

- 18000 miles
- cost 39,000 new and I paid 5000 and traded in previous vehicle for 9000
- live in Texas where it’s 6.25% tax on new vehicle 
- foolishly paid for extended warranty at 2850 which I’m getting refunded 
- currently has 3000 worth of body damage from a single vehicle collision (off road) which I am considering getting repaired 
- loan total is 29000 at 3.79% of which I’ve paid 4400 in principal and  1000 in interest and it’s a 72 month loan

2020 4runner:
- 15 miles 
- sales price of $40,040 with added value items such as custom wheels and Apple car play which the current car does not have, and was thinking about getting the wheels added anyway on my current vehicle which would cost ~$2000 so this is a “savings” in that sense were I to do it
- approved for $30000 60 month loan at 2.85% 
- the dealership would credit 3000 towards the new vehicle in exchange for me canceling the extended warranty on my old one
- I would trade in the old one which is worth 26000 (with the damage) and receive 5000 towards the new vehicle after they pay off the rest of the loan (per the dealer) 
- I would also put in ~ $2000 cash to get down to the 30000 owed on the loan

I’m trying to make sure I’m not missing anything because it seems like with the lower interest rate and shorter term and getting rid of the extended warranty it might actually be cheaper overall at this point to buy the new one rather than repairing the old one for $3000 now. The already sunk costs are 5000 down payment, depreciation, and the damage. Then I would take a depreciation hit again in the new one. So the depreciation on the new one would immediately cancel out any benefits when I drive it off the lot. Is that it? I’m just thinking as I write and hoping to make sure I’m making the best decision.",finance
stocks,Some interesting news in the stock market this week,"While there was little news from large cap names this week, President Trump managed to keep things interesting with his New Years eve tweet that he expected to sign a Phase 1 trade agreement with China in the next couple of weeks. That sent Chinese stocks, along with US companies that import and use Chinese products, higher on Thursday. Then on Friday, oil and defense stocks, along with gold, received a boost (for the want of a better word) from the US airstrike that killed Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani. Airline stocks fell as oil reached a seven month high.

In Japan, Carlos Ghosn, the 5 foot 6 inch ex CEO of Renault and Nissan who was facing charges of financial misconduct charges, provided a great story that seems more appropriate for Hollywood than Wall Street. Despite being held under strict bail conditions including constant surveillance, Mr Ghosn apparently climbed into a case for musical instruments on Sunday evening before being whisked off to a local Japanese airport and flown to Turkey and then on to the Lebanon.

Back home, Barron’s ran a worrying story about **Canada Goose’s** ($GOOS) $1,000 signature parkas and how they are stuffed with goose down and trimmed with coyote fur. That’s a dangerous product to be associated with in the age of the anti-fur movement and social media. The Daily Beast has already run a story claiming that owning a Canada Goose parka may even put off potential dating partners. Canada Goose’s stock price has fallen 50% from 2018 highs and its valuation at 35x earnings would normally be reasonable for a company growing at around 30% p.a. However the risk of being outed for the use of fur in the fickle fashion industry means I would avoid.

**Cassave Science Inc’s** ($SAVA) stock price almost doubled after CEO Remi Barbier bought 100,000 of stock on New Years eve. The purchase follows positive data from a mid stage trial for one of its experimental Alzheimer’s disease drugs. There is still a way to go before approval, meaning the stock may yet have to give up all the recent gains (and more), but with a market cap of just $166 million the potential upside from an approved Alzheimer’s drug would be huge. The purchase by the CEO is a big vote of confidence from those in the know and sends out a strong signal to the market.

On Monday, **Sol-Gel** ($SLGL) jumped 90% after reporting positive phase 3 trial results for its acne treatment drug Twyneo. Sol-Gel now plans to file a new drug application (NDA) in the second half of 2020. It is more good news for the company which was already planning to file an NDA for its rosacea drug Epsolay and potentially going from zero to two commercial stage drugs in one year. The company’s valuation has jumped to $320 million, but that looks reasonable given its two drugs that are close to approval with a combined total addressable market of $10 billion.

Otherwise the news was largely confined to analyst upgrades and downgrades. A couple that caught my eye were Goodyear Tire and Axsome Therapeutics.

**Goodyear Tire** ($GT) is a cyclical stock that will never trade at a premium but with the stock down 55% over the past two years and trading on 7x 2020 consensus earnings its valuation is looking cheap. Nomura Instinet analyst Anindya Das agrees with a target price 33% above Fridays close. Das says GT has a strong earnings outlook having largely completed its restructuring. I would agree, auto sales have slumped since 2015 but, with the average auto age at an all time high of 12 years (and in the absence of a recession), it’s likely that the renewal cycle will begin in the near term. GT’s forward PE looks cheap compared to peers such as Cooper Tires (10x 2020 earnings). The 4.2% dividend also looks attractive.

**Axsome's** ($AXSM) was up on Monday after reporting positive results from a late-stage study to evaluate, AXS-07, its drug for the acute treatment of migraine. Good news for Axsome and 37 million Americans suffer from migraine. Axsome said it plans to file an NDA in the second half of 2020.

It follows news earlier in December regarding Axsome’s new clinical drug the blockbuster, AXS-05, which reported significant improvements in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). 47% of patients with MDD achieve complete remission, as opposed to the 16% of patients taking the placebo. Depression treatments are one of the largest healthcare markets in the U.S., with around 7.1% of adults -- or 17.3 million -- Americans affected each year. Estimated at USD 15.60 Billion in 2018. And there's not a lot of competition.

Axsome's stock has surged by almost 4,000% since the beginning of 2019, pushing the stock from a $93 million market cap into the $3.5 billion range. But it could have further upside potential due to AXS-05 and AXS-05 and the large addressable market. Priced at $95.20 at Fridays close Cantor Fitzgerald raised their price target to $125 and HC Wainwright increased theirs from $170 to $200.

investing,Help Understanding Arbitrage Concept and Theoretical Scenario,"I figured some of the bond traders on here might be able to gauge my rationale behind these assumptions.

Many cities across the United States are issuing Pension Obligation Bonds (""POB's"") to pay down pension debt.  In most cases, cities are members of a State-administered investment pool.  Cities are required to pay into the investment pool based on a formula that is multiplied by the quantity of employees that they have in the system.  The pension recipients have promised benefit amounts (defined benefit).  If the State-administered fund fails to make a return that is high enough to cover the increasing costs of benefits, the State basically charges cities to make up the delta.  This is becoming increasingly common.  Usually, cities do not have the money up front to pay this delta, so it sits on their books as an Unfunded Accrued Liability or ""UAL."" 

In California, the State-administered pension system charges municipalities that have a UAL *interest* on the UAL principal based on the State-administered pensions system's estimated investment return.  If the State thinks they can make a 7% market return, they charge municipalities a 7% interest penalty on their UAL principal.  The State does this because if the municipality had actually paid the UAL up front, the State would have taken that UAL principal and made an additional 7% on it.

In response, cities in California have been issuing POB's that have a fixed interest rate of 3-4%.  They pay the UAL principal down, avoid having a 7% interest rate (in place of the lower 3-4% interest rate), and save money in the long run.  

1. Is this what *arbitrage* is?  Taking out a loan for 3%, thus *""*making"" 4%?  

2. The 7% charge from the State pension system in California fluctuates.  There's talk of the State lowering that return projection, which could mitigate the savings made by cities that issue POB's at 3-4% interest.  As such, opponents of this strategy have attacked the rationale behind POB's.  In theory, the State pension system could make a negative return.  When that happens, cities get charged to make up the difference between the assets of the funds and the liability of payments owed to pensioners.  In theory, a city could take out a 3% POB, pay their UAL, and receive a negative return on a huge principal in the short run if the market crashes.    My response to this has been that since we have to pay the UAL anyways, it makes no difference if we pay it now or later.  No one can time the market (certainly, municipalities can't), so it makes do difference if we pay the UAL when the market is growing or contracting.  Thoughts on this?",finance

personalfinance,How to best use funds post real estate closing?,"Hi there - I have come to reddit a lot for views on financial matters and I finally am looking for advice on a recent situation I find myself in. 

I am in the process of relocating from Atlanta to Austin and I just sold my home in Atlanta. I was able to net $138K from the sale (mainly because the neighborhood gentrified). I am currently building a home in Austin and I am now able to put down 20% on the property ($56.2K) due to the sale of my house. I have a car loan on a 2018 Tacoma ($15.8K left on the balance - trade in value is about $24K). I also have another home in Atlanta that I rent out, the balance is $98K and it is cash positive with tenants locked in until November. My current cash reserves are about $50K, personal brokerage $32K, and my 401K is at $120K (I have contributed since 21 and have been maxing out for the past 4 years). I have mentally become more risk adverse as I have become older (currently 28). I do eventually want to purchase an investment property in the Austin area. I plan on unloading the other Atlanta house if the tenants do not renew or if I get tired dealing with it. 

Should I pay off the truck's loan?  The interest rate is 2.63% but I know its a DEPRECIATING asset (granted the truck does hold its values somewhat - it was originally purchased for $26K) and that keeps me from wanting to do it. Also, is putting 20% too much on the new house? I rather have a lower note and not pay PMI but I just like having reserves in place for emergency. Initially I was looking at 10% down since it was looking I was going to rent my previous residence. I also do not carry balances on any credit cards so the only recurring debts I will have are: primary home in Austin, rental property in Atlanta and the 2018 Tacoma. 

At the end of the day, I want to make things easier for me and continue to build assets and financial security. I used to invest a lot more in the stock market but the way things have been - I am quite nervous on jumping right now. I still plan on maxing my 401K and savings at least $1K monthly in post tax income into my personal accounts.

personalfinance,"Haven't had a raise in 13 months, not sure what to do (rocky history)","For context, I work as an internal software engineer at a smallish tech firm in Ontario(Canada). I like my job quite a lot, however I'm looking for a raise, and am a bit worried about how this might go down due to the below.

The company itself has struggled a bit recently. After being touted as a major up-and-coming company in 2017, in 2018 and 2019 they struggled to expand almost at all. This came to a head this year, when we had a day of major layoffs, letting 20 of our roughly 110 staff go. On top of that, since those layoffs, about 30 people have quit, and many other before that, meaning that in 9 months we went from about 110 people to 67 people. Since then, however, sales numbers have been solid, and we have raised our base costs significantly,  meaning our expected recurring revenue is up big time(for those wondering how I know this, the company is very open about everything, as well as the fact that I created our accounting database).

I started off in tech support(50k-&gt;60k salary in 2 years), then got promoted to my current position, starting at 72k. However, this transition was actually quite a story, as originally my new department was super short-staffed, and I was working there on a part-time basis(50/50 split between the two teams), mostly to see if I could handle this new job(I had much less experience than the ideal candidate would have had, other than some web design contracting).  Without going too much into the details, I was initially denied a raise for the job(and the job itself), then got it after someone else quit.

I was told on the spot there would be no raise that year for me, since I was just moving into the job, which I understood. However, that was the last time my salary increased(October 2018).

Since then, I've settled quite well into the new role, getting a new boss who I really get along with, and making really big(in my opinion) systemic changes to the companies internal software systems. I like my job and boss, however I haven't actually ever had a performance evaluation, and the new year went by without any mention of raises or bonuses. Part of my confusion is that I'm not actually sure if this is normal, or maybe it just comes at the end of January, vs before the new year.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Update: Thanks for the advice guys! I went ahead and talked to my boss, who indicated the company was not giving out raises except for promotions that had happened a few months ago. He also advised there was no point in asking for anything(my plan was to ask for extra vacation in lieu of pay raise). 

Since it doesn't seem like there are great growth prospects, and I'm not super stoked with the fact no one actually told employees there would be no yearly raise(many people still thought they were just late, and coming end of January), I've decided to look for another place to work.",finance

investing,"About the ""not-QE"" thing","I just want to bounce this off the reddit community. So the Fed reserve has been pumping $60 billion a month into the economy in the form of treasury bill buybacks since October. They call this different than the bond buybacks they started in 2007 but the result is similar right. With current interest rates around 2% there's little room to move when we do have a recession (from 2007-9 they cut 5%). The S&amp;P 500 is at all time highs (strongly correlated with the ""its not QE QE"") and the Fed is spending 60 billion a month causing further rampant inflation of securities. Now they release statements hinting that they're gonna restart actual QE. Mexico is closely linked to us and they're in recession. There are recent signs our own economy is slowing. We are in a bubble caused by extremely over leveraged hedge funds and banks, and the ways we used to fix the aftermath of the 2007 crash are not there. The Fed budget can only go so high.

personalfinance,Clueless about Savings/Debt Consolidation/etc help appreciated.,"Hi, I am new to this subreddit and looking for advice around saving. I come from a pretty destitute family and thus never really learned a whole lot about the proper way to manage my finances. This is probably going to sound like a lot of rambling because I really am clueless around this stuff.

I live in New York and I make $95,000/yr. I am currently not contributing to a 401k. My employer does not match my contributions. I save about $2000 per month. I recently reached a milestone of saving $11,000 however I used a large portion of this to pay off $4,000 in medical debt.

I recently started working on my credit as I am trying to save for a house (currently pay about 1500+ a month total for rent+utilities+parking). My score is 598 (I know it's terrible). I was approved for a credit card with a $300 limit which I plan on using to help with this.

I also have a car loan with $8,000 left on it and student debt roughly around $100,000

I want to be saving money the right way. Currently, I just take a portion of my income and move it into my savings account at my credit union. I feel like this might be a simplistic view of savings. What is the best way for me to be growing my savings?

Also on the subject of student debt. I checked credit Karma and noticed that I have 13 accounts open for federal loans and 1 account open for Sallie Mae. I don’t know anything about consolidating loans but this sounds like what I should be doing?

personalfinance,Should I pay off my loan or keep the money in my emergency fund?,"Fairly simple scenario here. Just trying to figure out if I'm being irrational or not. 

I have a balance of $2400 on a personal loan with a 13.5% interest rate. My account says last year I paid $490 in interest. 

I also have an emergency fund with 2 months expenses currently saved up.

I would really love to pay off my loan as the monthly payments are getting old. To do this, I would only have 1 month expenses left in my emergency fund. It makes me nervous to drain it that low as I've worked really hard to save up to this point. If I worked really hard though on spending less and being more frugal I could probably build it back up to this point again in 3 months without this extra payment.  

I don't have anything in my foreseeable future that could be changing which would make me need to use it. But obviously anything can happen and I'm glad I'm finally prepared for it.

Would it be more responsible of me to pay off the loan or to have a larger amount in my emergency fund?

personalfinance,I don't know how to handle my mom's debts,"A little bit of backstory: Came back home from school for break and long story short, I received the cold hard truth about my mom's financial situation. She's behind on basic bills, is trying to sell a house, and has debt. I've already started helping her pay off the bills she was behind on, but I just found out about the amount of debt she had and really don't know how to approach this situation.

Basically, my mom has a HELOC w/ 50k pulled out and I think 4% interest on it (but I think half of it is at a promo rate of 3.24% but I haven't had a chance to look into it, or how that actually works) and a car loan with approximately 13k left on it. My mom technically has the cash to pay off the entirety of the HELOC or the car loan, but not both or we'd be extremely strapped for cash. However, my mom's plan was to just used the proceeds from selling our house to pay off the HELOC.

My main question is: Does it make sense to pay off the car loan first since 1) we have the cash for it 2) it has a higher interest rate than the HELOC (I'm actually not 100% sure about this since I know very little about how loans actually work, but I'm assuming a car loan would have a higher interest rate than 5%?)

I guess I'm concerned because I just don't know how to help her pay off these debts (and neither does she) since a lot of it is dependent on her selling our house. Any advice is much appreciated. thanks

retirement,Retirement and primary home,"I'm approaching 54 and find myself thinking about retirement a lot recently. My youngest child is leaving for college this year so we're free to move to a different location (as opposed to having to be near the high school).  I'm not satisfied with our current primary residence (e.g., not enough closet space in the Master bedroom suite.) so I want to move anyways even if we stay in the same area. I regret not having moved to a bigger house years ago in the same area due to indecision and fearing of the stress of selling a house and buying another one at the same time, but that's for another post in another sub.

So now we're actively thinking about selling our house and buying another one. The question is where and what kind of house. Whatever we buy will probably be our retirement home.

I've always heard that people downsize their primary residence when they retire. I found myself wanting to upgrade to a bigger home since I always wanted to live in a bigger home than my current one. Our current home is all paid off.  A home I want to live in will mean a mortgage of $300K that we'll probably have to pay for the rest of our lives, which amounts to $1450 a month at 4% interest rate, plus about $200 more per month in taxes and insurance than our current home.

I figure in retirement, I'll be spending most of my time at home, so a home that I enjoy living in will be a major ingredient of my retirement happiness. Financially, it means we'll need an additional $500K in our retirement funds to cover the mortgage and the extra taxes and insurance.

Financially, we can make it work. But having to devote $500K of the nest egg to cover additional housing costs, though viable, seems financially imprudent.

I'd like to add that I've always been very frugal when it comes to my own needs for material goods. Other than spending too much on our two children's college education, I've been financially prudent too.

It's a tug-of-war now for me: a nicer home that will contribute a great deal to my retirement happiness or financial prudence?

financialindependence,"Side incomes from Blogging for FIRE, my 2019 revenue report","So I've been in this sub for quite some time and like many people, were first drawn to the premise of FIRE from a blogger. I think everyone on this sub gunning for FIRE are smarter than average and realize that these bloggers have supplemented their incomes with blogging. How much is the question? I've also seen many people that were genuinely curious at the detailed breakdown of blogging. Whether this is because it's been your childhood dream to blog about something you're passionate about, or you think it is your way to salvation to your FIRE dreams (it's probably not), i think there are many people that want to know how much bloggers make and hopefully this post helps.

Most of these bloggers hit their FI numbers long before they really started making money from their blogs but nonetheless, they are earning passive incomes from writing online. How much this amount is rarely shared and i think people speculate wildly and of course some bloggers are much more successful than others. I've also seen many people on this sub keen on how people started up blogs and how they've managed to monetize their blogs. As someone that is almost FIREd, here is a rundown on my website and how much I made in 2019. This post will be a summary but if you want the detailed breakdown with charts and stuff, you can visit my page (link at bottom of post)

It's not easy to make money from blogging so please don't think because I created something that generates money, it is an easy move for you. I wanted to shed some light on the subject and I know plenty of people here are keen to create a blog of some sort before or after FIRE so hopefully this will help or inspire!

&amp;#x200B;

**Blogging is not factored into my FIRE #**

Full disclosure, I am almost at FIRE (probably in the next year or two) but it is completely separate from my blogging activities. I work a full time job (Earning 200k+) and the blog was merely a hobby started many years ago and only recently started to generate noticeable amounts of money. I don't count the blogging income into my SWR as it is still a relatively new profession and past success does not guarantee future returns. When I FIRE, my SWR will be purely from my investments.

Nevertheless, it is something i truly enjoy doing and whether I FIRE with $1m, or $10m, I would continue to blog regardless. The extra cash is just a nice perk on the side. I'll use the extra cash for fun spending money, reinvesting in the markets or taking punts on single name stocks. Who knows?

&amp;#x200B;

**What is my blog about?**

My blog is not really related to the topic of FIRE but rather a travel blog. I guess these things kind of go hand in hand like Gocurrycracker. I started it when i was living abroad many years ago to document my experiences and just kept writing stuff over the years about places I've traveled to. I've also written a bunch of posts about how I take advantage of US credit cards and fully engage in hustling the crap out of them for travel benefits. I've not written much in the sense of FIRE besides making a spreadsheet tracking Net Worth (which you can find if you google ""Net Worth Spreadsheet"", it should be one of the top 5 results).

So in summary, it is a blog about 5 years old that is about travel. Blogging takes a lot of work if you actually want to monetize it. I feel lilke people here think ""oh they're a blogger so they must make lots of money"". It couldn't be further from the truth. Sure there are plenty of bloggers that do make money but the vast majority never do. It takes a long time to write quality content, consistently while at the same time optimizing your SEO. Nowadays, it's very easy to make a blog look nice because of all the premium themes out there but it can't make up for quality content which takes a long time to write. I've written about 250 posts and each post is somewhere between 2000-3000 words. This means I've written almost a million words and who knows how many pictures.

I never had the intention of making money in the beginning because I enver thought it would become anything. However, the money generated is just a nice affirmation that you have created a product on all your own that is ""worth"" something. It's a nice feeling to get compensated for something you enjoy.

&amp;#x200B;

**How much traffic do i get?**

Traffic is of course wildly important for generating income on a blog. It's pretty linearly correlated; the more traffic you get, the more money you can earn. In 2019, my traffic increased significantly as the year went on so saying what the average over the year is not so accurate. So i'll use the last quarter's traffic as this is a better indicator for future traffic. This is not to say my traffic won't decrease because of certain factors, but it would also increase too.

For q4 of 2019, I had roughly **1,500** unique visitors a day and roughly **2,200 page views** per day. This translates to 50,000 unique visitors a month and 70,000 pageviews a month. With this amount of traffic, you can start earning some cash. As of the beginning of 2020, I have been getting almost 2000 unique views so hopefully it keeps growing.

**How do I earn money from blogging?**

Before I write a single word, let's preface it by saying EVERYONE has different ways of making money. How I mak emoney is not how another blogger would. There are probably much better ways to monetize that I've not been exposed to but this is merely how I made the amount of money i did for 2019.

* **Advertisements: S**elf explanatory. Running ads through Google Adsense and Ezoic, which is an ad optimization service that has really beefed up my ad revenue. This is probably the easiest way to make money if you have enough traffic because you just set it and forget it. Of course, running too many ads (which I probably do) reduces the readership experience and likely to increase your bounce rate (percentage of people that leave your website reading only one page). Nevertheless, I'm still relatively new at this so will adjust this accordingly.
* **Sponsorships:** This is probably how the big bloggers make most of their money. They don't need to run ads anymore because they have such a big following that big companies will pay said blogger to advertise a specific product. I get some of these from small travel agents. I also post sponsored post which is a post I may write about a specific travel topic and I'm linking it to another company that then pays me for said post.
* **Affiliate Programs:** I use booking.com as my affiliate program. When someone clicks a link that I have on my blog with my affiliate ID, makes a booking, I get a percentage of that booking. Other people use Amazon affiliates where they can link to a product on Amazon and if they reader buys it, they get a percentage commission. These are great for people running fashion blogs, tech reviews, etc. but I just never really got into this.
* **Social Media:** Everyone probably knows about those people making crazy money on Instagram these days. That is not me. I enjoy social media but could never be bothered to really build it up. I make no money from Social Media but i know many travel bloggers that make a killing. Youtube is also another huge revenue generator for some people but just never something I've invested enough time into.
* **Bespoke products:** This is just certain services and products you offer your readers. This can be things like selling e-book, photography services, social media management, e-courses etc. For me, this is travel planning. i've planned out numerous honeymoons to Africa in the past year. I've not charged anything for it but just asked the couples to book their accommodations using booking.com which then i generate commission (see bullet above). I plan to start charging a nominal fee for this in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

**How much did I earn in 2019?**

So now that you know how I made money on blogging, this is how much I made:

Advertisements: **$5,500**

Sponsorships: **$3,500**

Affiliate Programs: **$3,000**

Expenses: **($100)** \- This is primarily costs from hosting and a few premium Wordpress plugins.

Total 2019 Profit: **$12,000**

If you want a detailed breakdown of that number with charts,you'll have to go to my blog. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Projections for 2020**

2020 is looking good. Ever since I moved to Europe for work, there's been lots to write about and i've seen a pretty solid growth of traffic in 2019 that was probably more SEO related than content, but nonetheless I hope that trend carries forward into 2020. If i extrapolate my q4 2019 to 2020, I should hopefully make around $16,000-$18,000 or more in 2020. Let's see what time brings!

&amp;#x200B;

**How much do the big guys make?**

So there you have it. How much I made in 2019 from a blog that you'll never have read before. So someone writing about financial products like FIRE bloggers with the type of traffic that gets sent their way by the press, reddit etc, it is easy to estimate they could make well into the 6 figures for blogging. Of course, not everyone is MMM. He was first to market and really capitalized well on the movement in the beginning. He is an outlier along with many of the other FIRE bloggers. While I will never make 6 figures blogging, I am totally content with growing my little mini presence online and making a few bucks doing it.",finance
personalfinance,Applying for a mortgage - lender says my score is much lower than I thought,"Background: I've had credit cards for a few years and have only missed one payment in all that time. I applied earlier in 2019 for two new credit cards. I never have a balance on my card that I don't pay off immediately when the statement comes out. I have no car loan, student loan debt, or any other debt. My credit card apps let me check my credit score and they're all reporting the score in the mid-700s.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I are applying for a mortgage for a home. She already owns a home and has a mortgage on it, but we'll be selling that property in order to buy a new house together. The loan agent we're working with just came back and said my credit score is in the mid 600s which is going to jack up our interest rate.

Is there something else that I'm missing that a loan agent can see that I can't that would make my score a whole 100 points lower than I see it? I just went and pulled my TransUnion credit report and it's clear other than the one missed payment on my card last year (which I paid off the next month as soon as I realized I'd forgotten to pay it).

Is this because I applied for new credit cards in 2019? I can't imagine it would've dropped my score that much.

Am I allowed to see the credit report that the lender ran on me? I'm almost skeptical of what she's saying because it doesn't add up and I want to see why my score is as low as it is.",finance
personalfinance,Tax help for this year (2020),"I am active duty military. My wife works full time.

For last year I did not have Federal taxes withheld, as she did not either.

I will pay taxes for last year, 2019 by April of this year.

To begin this year right, I wanted some help. I can easily do the W4 calc and start paying taxes like everyone else but in lieu of this I was thinking of pushing that money in the deferred taxable Traditional TSP, which will lower my taxable income.

Options

1. Should I invest money into my TSP/Traditional to lower my taxable income?
   1. I have two kids so I wasn't sure if we lowered it enough, that we would be eligible for EIC or child tax credit?

2. If not maybe we should invest into TSP/Roth and just pay taxes?

Either way I am trying to right the ship but also maximize our tax return.

Does it make more sense to pay off my first-year loans and take out $20k for next year, OR keep the $10k and only take out  $10k for next year? They’re federal direct unsubsidized loans, so interest is a factor, and so is the fee associated with taking out the loan up-front (about 1%).

personalfinance,I don't understand federal income tax withholdings.,"I told my previous job to send me my w-2 form from 2018 because I lost it and didn't file taxes that year. They sent me it and my wages, tips, and other compensation from that year equalled to $2,787. My federal income tax withheld equalled to $69. That makes no sense to me at all. I downloaded a paycheck calculator and entered an estimate of how much I was making since the day I started working at my previous job to the end of the year. I was paid weekly and estimated my checks to be around $170. The app told me with a $170 check, the federal income tax withholdings from each paycheck would be about $15. I started that job in September of 2018. From September to December, if $15 was taken federally out of each paycheck, I should of had about $180 withheld. So I don't understand why it's $69. Can someone please elaborate.",finance
personalfinance,Which Student Loan Repayment Plan?,"Apologies beforehand if this has been asked before. I looked but did not see it. I went back to graduate school later in life (I’m 33 now). My major was not finance, so this is something I’d like someone else to help answer. I just finished and obviously need to start making payments soon (technically in May, but I want to start now). I took some gambles and have higher than average debt (about $94k, all federal, including accumulated interest), but the job I’ve started pays enough that I’ll be able to pay about $3k every month. I plan on using the avalanche method to target specific loans with the overpayment, and a calculator shows that with the standard ten year repayment plan I’ll be free and clear in less than four years. 

Due to my income, I do not qualify for any income-based repayment plans. However, I noticed a graduated payment plan when I was going over my loan accounts for preparation last night. In this plan, payments start small(ish) and increase every two years. For the first two years, payments are about 60% of the regular plan, and for the last two they’re about 160% of the regular payment. It has the same ten year period as the standard repayment plan. 

Intuitively, it seems like this would be a good option for someone making big overpayments, since it gives me more money (about $400 a month more for the first two years) to send to specific loan accounts, and it’ll be paid off so early I’ll hopefully never see the painfully high payments. However, I’m having a hard time proving it. IS this actually the best way to go about things, or should I stick with the standard repayment plan?

Additional info: I’m contributing to my employer’s 401(k) match and am making max contributions to an IRA. I’m putting a comfortable amount into savings and paying all my other bills. The $3000 payment is doable, but it would require neglecting things I don’t want to neglect to go any higher than that, so I’m going to leave it there for the time being. I also get an annual bonus (the actual amount varies, but historically it’s been 6-10% of salary), of which 50% will go towards the student loans.",finance

personalfinance,Is it always advantageous to pay off a car loan early?,"I purchased a used vehicle two months ago. I have a 6.4% interest rate on my car loan. My common sense + my parents advice says that I should be making extra payments on the principal when I can so that it will be paid off early. When I got down to thinking about it though, I came up with this question. Would it be better for me to make the minimum payment each month and instead of putting in extra money towards the principal, I invest that money for the long terms gains? Basically I’m trying to measure the opportunity cost of paying off the car early vs. investing more money. From everything I’ve read, I can expect an average of 6.6%-7% gains annually (assuming there isn’t a recession, but I’m not here to time the market), as long as my gains outweigh the interest, shouldn’t I be investing my money? Especially considering that I’ve had 16% returns for the last year, which, if I can continue getting returns at anywhere near that pace, would give me a much larger margin between gains and money lost due to interest. Any thoughts or experiences would help, thanks.

EDIT: got some really good advice so I’m hopping off this thread now and will check again later. Thanks again you to those who chimed in",finance

personalfinance,Student Loans - best way to take advantage of repaye?,"Does anyone know if the following is allowed by fedloan?

I have \~180k in student loans, I am in REPAYE, and my minimum payment is approx $280/month (withdrawn automatically). My loans generate about $800 in interest per month, so after my $280 payment, there is $520 left generated per month, and with REPAYE the government forgives roughly half of this, so I get $260 forgiveness, and $260 for my final interest generated per month.

I noticed on the fedloan website that I can suspend my automatic payments and instead choose to pay it every month on the website, and when you do that you can specify how much money goes toward each loan. One of my loans is \~40k and has the highest interest rate out of all my loans, 6.5%. My question is, can I just take my $280/month minimum payment and put all of it toward this loan with the highest interest rate and still get the government forgiveness of half my remaining interest generated on loans for that month? So I would pay $280 to the high interest 40k loan (which creates $216/month interest), and then the remaining $64 would go towards paying down the principal on that loan. Then there would be $584 left in interest generated per month from other loans, and REPAYE would forgive half of this and result in $292 forgiveness, and $292 for my final interest generated per month. This way would end up netting me better bang for my buck in my $280 payment because my $64 toward principal would make up for the extra $32 in final interest generated per month from the other loans, netting me essentially a free $32 monthly principal payment on my highest interest loan compared with my current payment structure in the first paragraph.

My concern is that this may not be allowable, or because no payment was made to the interest on the other loans, that REPAYE might not forgive half the interest generated that month on those loans, which would put me in a worse situation because then I wouldn't be receiving any forgiveness of my interest generated. My income will be going up significantly in approximately 2 years, at which point I won't be eligible for any interest forgiveness through REPAYE, so my main goal is to get as much interest forgiveness as I can, while I can.

I currently live in an apartment with a roommate and pay about $950 a month. My mother cannot afford the payments, so it would fall on me.

personalfinance,"Interesting ""student"" loan situation. how to set myself up for the future","Hello all,

Background:

\- 22 years old  
\- Salary: 60K (possible 70K with overtime)  
\- no degree  
\- 5K in savings  
\- Only debt is student loans  
\- take home: ($3800) monthly expenses: ($2500)

I have two student loans. One is through FAFSA and the other is directly through the college i went to (only finished 3 years). The one directly through the college has no interest rate but we were able to make an agreement in which I pay $100 every month until the balance hits zero. The other one is a standard student loan with a $95 minimum per month detailed below

\- Direct Subsidized Stafford **$2,974.55 @ 4.410%**   
\- Fixed Direct Subsidized Stafford **$3,006.68 @ 4.040%**   
\- Fixed Direct Unsubsidized Stafford **$1,864.47 @ 4.040%**

\- Balance of payment directly to college: $6300 (No interest) 

Now I understand the no brainer situation here is to pay off the FAFSA loans since they have interest. HOWEVER. I plan on going back to school (this time paid by my employer) however I'm unable to obtain my current transcript on the 3 years completed unless the $6300 is paid in full. Does it still make sense to pay off the non-interest loan in this situation or still go for the one with interest. If I don't I most likely will have to wait an additional 2 years likely once I pay off the $7800. I would like to at least get started on my degree in order to not only have more job security but open up more doors (as a bachelors is almost a baseline requirement these days). My other major concern is having only 5K in savings. Although my job is pretty secure but anything can happen. Knowing I only have 2 months worth of saving makes me sweat a little.

His view is that what has driven valuations up in equity markets are low interest rates. This makes sense because low interest rates make equities relatively more attractive v. debt and means you're willing to settle for a lower free cash flow yield - i.e. higher valuation. If interest rates go up, equity markets should get crushed. What would make interest rates go up? Inflation. What would cause inflation? Wage growth resulting from the extremely tight labor market in the US.

&gt;No catch.  We will pay all the costs, except escrows.  VA allows this process and it lowers your interest thus your payment. There is no appraisal or paystub.  We do pull credit but that is to show no mortgage lates in the file.  It’s the right thing to do!   
&gt;  
&gt;The timing of the next payment always works out that you skip a payment, but the very next month is the new payment.

I was wondering why S&amp;P 500 P/E ratio has been so high for so many years ?

[https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio)

Is it because of the Fed's QE since 2008 ? Other reasons ?

personalfinance,IRA Contribution Timing with Resect to Paychecks,"I understand that IRA contributions must be from earned income, but does the timing of when that income is earned matter, or does the IRS only care that that one's IRA contributions are less than one's income at the end of the year? Concretely, I have not yet earned any income for 2020, but I have some extra money sitting around that I would like to invest. Can I put this money in an IRA before I get my first paycheck from work (I'm a W2 employee)? Also, when tallying up earned income for the purposes of IRA contributions, is it gross income that matters, or just the net that lands in my bank account? I have social security and federal and state withheld from each paycheck, so the net is a bit less than what I gross. I don't think the few months between when I would invest will make much of a difference in my long term investing timeline, but I was mostly just curious about the details. Where do you all read up on the odd details of these tax issues?

personalfinance,"New baby, moving, family glitch","My partner and I have been planning to move to Durham, NC this summer. By the time we move, we'll have saved about $35-40k. We are looking to buy a house for between $200-225k. I expect to continue working the same job remotely after the move and she is a teacher, so it shouldn't be hard for her to find work. Also, we plan to get married in June, right after we move. All of this seems doable and even though June will be a hectic month, it all feels pretty manageable. 

Then, just a few days ago, we found out that she's pregnant. We had been trying for the last few months and were feeling ready, but when she didn't get pregnant immediately, it seemed like it may be somewhat of a blessing, allowing us time to get established in Durham before having a baby. She really wants to take a year off teaching during the child's first year and I want to help with that. She plans to work part-time to add some supplemental income. We spaced out her paychecks from this year so that she has pay for the summer. Everything seems like it could work...

...except for the family glitch (IRS ruling on the ACA that causes lots of trouble for certain households). My employer offers a health care plan that is reasonably priced for me and also offers plans that will cover a spouse, a child, or the whole family. However, to cover us both, along with a child, the cost shoots from \~$225/month to \~$1300/month. I make just a bit too much (about $45k) to qualify for Medicare or CHIP. At this point, I'm looking at an extra $12k to cover insurance for the year after the child's birth.

Information I'm looking for:

\- Similar experiences in which you've figured out how to navigate through the family glitch

\- Experience working in Durham Public Schools during/around the time of pregnancy and the possibility of getting insured even though she won't be able to teach full-time during the first school year we're there (she can sub or work part-time).

\- Knowledge of any programs offered in Durham/NC/federal that would be helpful

personalfinance,Personalized tips on buying a house?,"Long story short, wife and I are in the middle/late beginning of buying a house. Lease is up June 1st, so I figured now would be the time to go house shopping. Here's where I'm currently at:

\-I have read just enough information on buying houses, mortgages, etc. to have a cursory knowledge, but now would like some advanced help

\-Wife and I have enough in savings to cover 3-3.5% down payment on a house, but would need the seller to cover closing costs

\-I have been offered several mortgage options and am unsure which is the best option. So far, it's been a downpayment assistance program with an interest rate of 4.75%, where I would still end up covering about 1% of the overall house, an FHA loan with a 3.9% interest rate, or a conventional 97 with a 3.9% interest rate.  


Also, I make good money salary wise, so we're covered, but the one thing I haven't figured out how it will affect me is I technically have a company car. It's a salary increase, but it is not part of my monthly pay. I'm waiting to see my 2019 W2 to see how/if they break out the car from my traditional salary.

My main questions are: what's the best loan typically? Since the downpayment will wipe out most of my savings, would it make more sense to take the higher interest rate loan with the lower up front cost? How common is it for sellers to cover closing costs? Based on my timeline, am I okay looking to purchase and move in to a house by May?",finance

Recently I took a new job which increased my salary by almost double (83%) which was in a city around an hour and a half away, and as things lined up I decided now was a great time to move in with my SO. 

So my house is currently sitting empty, costing me money every month which I don’t think is a great idea to keep anymore.

I’ve considered renting the house out, however with the tax rate being 40% for any income over £50k here it seems like anyway I slice it I’ll be losing money each month.

My repayments are currently £487 p/m.
And I can expect roughly a £700 p/m rental income.

With tax and agent fees I calculate that I can expect to take home roughly £380 of that £700 which results in a net loss of -£107 p/m or about £1,300 p/year.

Am I right in thinking I should just cut my losses, sell the house likely losing around £5k in the process to fees i.e. early mortgage exit, lawyers, estate agents etc over prolonging this taking a potential loss each month at best case in hopes of selling at a profit in a few years?

investing,S&amp;P overvalued? Not so fast... A quick look at long term trend,"I saw this analysis mentioned in today's Bloomberg email. I thought it was interesting enough to share here.

Summary: 

&gt; In my view, the behavior of equities this year is not an unexplainable deviation from fundamentals but an expected recovery from excessive pessimism. Is there excessive optimism now? Nothing dramatic relative to my expectations given the ongoing expansion.  That doesn’t rule out a correction, but absent a recession I would tend to view it only as noise around the trend.

&gt; Bottom Line: I don’t think you need to fall back on “it’s all QE” to explain the behavior of equities this past year or this cycle. It appears to me that the general path of equities is what should have been anticipated given continued expansion. To the extent the Fed is involved, it is because policy moves have sustained the economic expansion. 

It seems pretty simple... look at the S&amp;P 500 on a log scale over many decades and everything that has happened the last several years is mostly just a continuation of the norm.",finance

Wow. This thread is my internal thought process written down. Thank you. I'll do my best to update if it keeps flowing.

Things I've learned: 
3% interest is cheap money. I never thought of it functionally with inflation and current savings interest rate.
Sofi has refinance rates down to 3.75%. That would be ideal. I'd feel comfortable paying together and not dipping into savings, if that is legit. She said she tried to refinance with no success. We shall try again.
Absolutely never spend your emergency fund. Unless it's actually an emergency. Thankfully I've never had anything that truly qualifies. Hopefully I never will.

I've done my best to answer unique questions case by case, but the general answers are:
Yes, she is my wife and I am a guy. I tried to keep it gender neutral. Sounds like I slipped up or my mansplaining rang through or Reddit is sexist. I give up. It's hard being gender neutral. We are all zed now.
Zed's debt is not what I would call irresponsible debt. Zed has a masters degree in forensic paleontology. Zed had to buy a new vehicle as zed's was totaled in a not at fault accident. We got an solid deal on a reasonable vehicle. We both agree that expensive cars are not worth it.
Future debt concern is unwarranted. I advised zed was far better with money than I am. If my math is correct, zed is using 30% of her income after taxes to pay down current debt. Also, zed does contribute 10% in her 401k. I totally spaced on that. The only reason I am ahead is due to an 8 year advantage. I was not much better at 27. 
I should have added zed is intelligent and just as frugal as I am.
Concern of 'together forever' is fair. I get it. My sister and father echo your wisdom.
Together, we have discussed zed's debt at length. Zed is of the opinion this is zed's responsibility. I saw what some would consider a smart opportunity to help our future. This is an exercise to explore what I may not have considered. I believe it was a success.
Thank you again.

*Bonus Bonus Question*
I also have an HSA for medical emergencies (Zed will have one on the next enrollment). Do people include this balance in their emergency fund? I consider it money that I've already spent on medical bills. Interest rates are appalling and I can't spend it anywhere else. Why even think about it?

Student Loan 1- 
$37,118.88
7.210% Interest
$390 payment per month

Student Loan 2-
$7,156.85
3.862% Interest
$50 payment per month

Student Loan 3-
$19,994.25
6.210% Interest
$160 payment per month

Car Loan-
$12,689.67
3.09% Interest
$400 a month payments

Current pay plan only includes spouses income. Our combined income is about $100k after taxes. 

I have $60k in savings working towards buying a house. $10k emergency fund. I max out my Roth IRA and contribute 10%(3% match) into my 401k. I am debt free with a newish vehicle. Spouse has not started down the retirement path. We currently live rent free (long story) and probably will for a few more years. Especially if I dump my savings. Other expenses are budgeted and I believe negligible for this exercise. 

Unbury.me is a fabulous tool that shows the straight dollars of spouse's current pay plan. Numbers indicate it would be paid off by 2028, but with over $20k in interest paid. The balance exceeds my funds, but we can scratch off the two higher interest student loans. Increasing our pay plan to $1500 a month, we would be debt free in a year with only $390 interest paid.

I feel like I have given this plenty of thought, but I am looking for outside insight that I may have not considered.

*Bonus Question* - Our living situation is rather unique, but can change at any time. It has not changed in 5 years and we do not expect it to, but it surely could. I was told with home loan interest rates being what they are; it is better to borrow than to put down a large down payment. I'd always have the $10k emergency fund for a down payment. Opinions? 

Lastly, let's pretend trust isn't an issue. This isn't relationship advise. In my heart of hearts I can't imagine spouse saying ""kthanksbye"". This is not their idea. Spouse doesn't even know I am contemplating this. Spouse budgets, is paying debt aggressively and is far more responsible with money than I am.",finance
personalfinance,Would it make sense to pay off my car loan of $15k?,"Throw away due to financial discussion.

Bought a car in July 2018 for ~$50k. I paid just over $20k down and financed the balance of about $29k over 36 months at 2.9% APR.

I have just under $16k left to pay off over the next 1.5 years or so (about $800 per month).

I really don't like having debt, and can pay it off now but understand I have a relatively low interest rate.

**Would it be stupid to pay the balance down early?** 

- I'm in my mid 30s
- Earn $100k / year
- Max out 401k with about $100k balance
- Cash in savings or stock about $100k (the $16k would obviously come from here)
- Only other debt is mortgage that's shared with my wife",finance
personalfinance,Navy Federal is offering a Special 37-Month IRA/ESA Certificate. Is this worth it?,"I have a good portion of money that I want to plant and let grow over time. I have been looking into ETFs and index funds. However, I feel that the market is unstable at this time and would rather go for a Bond or CD. 

I am banking with Navy Federal Credit Union, and they are currently offering a Special 37-Month IRA/ESA Certificate, min deposit 50 dollars, term 37 months, dividend rate 2.96%, APY 3.0. For me, this looks like a good balance, as I don't want a super high return and am not willing to take risks at this time. 

My questions, 1) What is the difference between dividend rate and APY? 2) How is this account any different from a normal CD? 3) Is this worth it?

I live at home, so my monthly expenses do not exceed $1,000 (excluding my student loans).

My student loans are about $1200 a month. Yes you read that right. Average weighted interest rate is about 6.8%, but I’m trying to refinance to a rate lower than 5% at the moment.

My company does not match my 401(k), but contributes only 3% no matter how much I put in.

They also have a Roth 401k, but the pre-tax should always be maxed out before hand, theoretically, correct?

personalfinance,"Don't BANK WITH USAA, Fraud on my checking account from another State","USAA is a joke, last year someone was trying to steal 4k out of my bank and USAA let them take 1k from my bank account. No solution was ever met and I was blamed for the fraud. DONT TRUST USAA! If you guys have time read my story. I spent numerous hours trying to get this resolved and I gave up because USAA has terrible service. Heres my story. I put down on their community page that never got addressed. Here it is... ""USAA has been one of my favorite banks since I have enlisted and transition out of the military. Customer service is usually spot on but as of today 04/13/2018 reaching out to multiple department of USAA for my fraud situation. As a veteran, I now live in California. On March 21st 2018 someone open up a checking account in Ohio by depositing $25. I did not notice it until April 9th. The address was even open in Ohio and during my talk to one of the USAA representative asked me how come I didn't change my address for the checking account? BECAUSE I NEVER LIVED THERE! and why I was not notified that a bank account was open in OHIO while i reside in CALIFORNIA. During this gap the person in Ohio withdrew from my other bank account withdrawing $1000 and attempting to withdraw $4000. I notice this large transaction on April 09 and called USAA. I was advised by one of the representatives to let the transaction go through and just transfer it back. The funds of $1000 was transfer into the ""FRAUD USAA CHECKING ACCOUNT"" it was immediately spent. The transaction were made on April 6 at a Wal-mart in Ohio. ""WM SUPERC Wal-Mart Sup CANTON OH."" 

The transaction of $26.50, $50, $400, $507.99, and $25 = $1,009.49 I was told that I was scammed and someone obtained my information, I do not recall any suspicious purchase during that time. I spoke to multiple represented from USAA and was told to hold until my other bank account ""Navy Federal"" replies for the amount of money that was transferred. The transferred was made from my USAA account by the fraud user. I did not authorize any of these transactions and did not provide any with my information. I was told that users are liable for handling their information. This is obviously Identity Theft. Luckily I didn't get my $4000 dollar stolen from me because I removed my money from the transferring account into another one. Since USAA COULDN'T NOT PREVENT IT.  If I did not do that I would have been left with $0. As of now my USAA is account is unavailable to touch all my funds and have to wait. The fraud department has been little to no use, they say that an analyst will contact me in 1-3 business day. I was also told that my $1000 could take 30 days to get back too but there is no guarantee I will even see that money. I feel helpless in this situation and USAA has been little to no comfort about my situation at all. I've been reading about fraud claim in USAA and it seems like its been a common misfortune dealing with the fraud department. I do try to see USAA as a great company but as of now I feel as USAA do not care for their customers anymore. 

UPDATE 2 weeeks later: USAA stands with their decision on denying my claim without any evidence. I have also went on un-linking my Navy Federal account to my USAA account because I feel my money is not safe anymore with USAA. No one is pursuing to investigate and I am more frustrated with USAA's customer service. USAA also failed to provide me with any evidence, any of the notes that were made on my investigation and will not provide me with the previous address that was open on the fraud checking account."" 

Update Monday, January 6 2020 @ 1030, I received a call from an agent regarding a reopen investigation on my case. Apparently whoever had my information in Ohio was logged in at the same time I was in California. Because we were logged in at the same time I was liable.... whoever the hacker was. The person who hacked my account had all my information and security questions and no errors. I'm an officially a thousand dollars poorer because of USAA thanks for keeping my money safe.

personalfinance,Net pay result discrepancy on paycheckcity using the new 2020 w4,"Has anyone tried using paycheckcity with the 2020 w4 box checked? Why is it that when I checkmark ""Two Jobs"" after clicking Married, the net pay significantly decreases? It seems like paycheckcity (and other online calculators) all do this. 

For example, when I input a theoretical $100,000 as annual income paid out monthly with no deductions and Married without checking ""Two Jobs"" it spits out $6976.75, but merely checking this box lowers that to $6437.21 (higher federal withholding). 

I've been trying to match the numbers to the new 2020 IRS w4 calculator and figure out the additional withholding needed by the higher income earner in a dual income household, but I don't understand where this discrepancy comes from if the paycheckcity calculator doesn't know what the other spouse's income is in the first place..",finance
personalfinance,27yo single adult seeking financial advices,"Hi I need to apologize for my english first as it's my second language, please bear with the mistakes that I make in this post.

A bit about myself: 27yo single male, graduating from master's soon in 2020 with an engineering degree. Doing a full time job making about 90k and currently work half time (so making half of it) with the same company.

One of my goals this year is to review my finance situation and make smarter decisions. I have been browsing posts on this subreddit for couple months and this is my first post. I primarily want to seek advices on structuring my savings better. Here is my current structure:

assets:

* checking account for cash flow buffer: 3k
* high yield saving account for e-fund: 3k with 200/mo deposit
* stock market: 6k with 200/mo deposit, holding primarily in major tech companies, defense ETFs, and cryptocurrencies for draw of luck.
* EE &amp; I bonds: 2.5k with 200/mo deposit, intended for future kid's college fund, if it doesn't happen, it's my e-fund.
* 401k with company matching: currently contributing 10% of my pay with company 6% matching, 44k in account and growing
* HSA: 5k atm, maxed out for 2019 and will max out for all future years
* Roth IRA:  just started last year, 600 in account, only contributing 50/mo

loans:

* car loan: 5k at 2.99%
* fed's student loan: 14k at 6%
* no cc balance

(EDIT: added expenses)

monthly expenses:

I have a budget plan based on my income / savings

* gas: 100
* rent: 0 as I live with parents when in graduate school
* food: 300
* miscellaneous: 350
* gift for parents: 300
* car loan payment: 800 (wanted to pay off the 5-yr loan in 3 yrs, will be 0 after this month as I pay it off completely)
* phone bill: 42
* auto insurance: 170 (full coverage in SoCal on a rather sporty car)
* no internet or utility bills as they are paid by my parents

projected budget after I move out later this year:

* rent: 900 or below
* utility: 50
* internet: 50
* phone bill: 42
* food: 400
* gas: 200
* gift for parents: 300
* auto insurance: 170
* student loan payment: 500 (exact amount unknown but I will try paying it off asap)
* miscellaneous: 350
* the leftover of my paycheck goes to savings and investment, should be able to increase on some of the items listed under assets section

other info:

My tolerance of risk is rather high as I don't have a lot of money in stock market anyways and I'm young. I will get a huge bonus this month and I plan to pay off car loan and half of the student loan with it. My long term goal is to max out 401k, Roth IRA, and EE bond but I feel that I don't make enough to do it comfortably at the moment. After I graduate I expect to return to full time status making about 90k (possibly with a small raise as well)

&amp;#x200B;

The issue with my current asset structure is that: I want to have fund for future car / vacation / house purchase. Currently they are all part of the e-fund saving account and I don't like it. But I don't know if opening additional 1 or 2 saving accounts are necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys suggest? How do I handle the savings for different purpose? What can I do to optimize my current investment and assets?

personalfinance,How can I help my wife pay off her debt on credit cards with very high interest?,"I want to help my wife pay start to aggressively pay off her credit card debt, and would really appreciate some guidance. I  just created an account on [undebt.it](https://undebt.it) to help with this, but as we were going through her statements I noticed two of her cards have absurdly high interest rates. Here is the breakdown of her debt: 

&amp;#x200B;

|Card|Balance|Interest Rate |
|:-|:-|:-|
|Barclays Credit (Apple)|$4,500.00|28.49%|
|Amazon Credit|$880.00|27.49%|
|Discover Credit|$1,450.00|16.49%|
||Total = $6,830||

She will be able to pay a minimum of $500 a month towards her debt, and using the avalanche method we could have it paid off by May of 2021. My main question is regarding the credit cards themselves; what can we do to mitigate the high interest rates? Should we sign up for a balance transfer card? Should we ask nicely for promotional 0% interest? Does the fact that I have a very strong credit history and a high credit score (780+) help in any way since we recently got married? 

If it helps, her credit score per Credit Karma is 679 (Transunion) and 680 (Equifax). She has missed 1 payment in her lifetime in August of 2018 but no derogatory marks.

Went to the bank next to my apartment because it's convenient and I'm going to start having to give them a shit ton of cash just so I could use a f****** secured card.

I'm doing all this because I'm looking at getting a house and might as well get a truck while I'm at it. 

I got the money for down payments on both. And only reason I'm getting a loan on the truck so I could help build credit for the house.

I'm probably going to get a truck at the end of the month regardless not giving a s*** about what kind of shity interest rate I'm getting. Because I'll make more with a truck due to my side Hussle. 

But with the house, I would have to at least wait till spring. And although I don't really give a s*** about the interest rate on that either because it can be ridiculous and still be cheaper than paying rent. Obviously for both cases I would like to get those rates as low as possible.

Main question right now is how long will it take to build a decent credit?

personalfinance,"Budgeting: how to eat when on a trip, traveling, working on the road, at events, etc.","Note: this was also posted on r/eatcheapandhealthy. I originally cross-posted it earlier but decided to delete and repost with the full text.

I see a ton of posts here and on Reddit in general about how to eat healthily and inexpensively while traveling, at events, working long hours, etc. You can insert any number of situations here but the repeating idea is that people end up eating out constantly and want to know how to change that. I was just in a discussion where someone said $1500 in a month is totally reasonable to feed one person in these situations. I heavily disagree and I have some straight up facts to show you.

I just attended a multi-day convention that also involved 7 hours in the car during normal eating times. I attended this convention for **25 hours** plus travel time back and forth from my hotel. I was feeding **2 people total**. I live on the East Coast in a mid COLA. I bought all food from Kroger, and could have done it cheaper if I had done it through Lidl or Aldi.

**What we spent on food for the trip**: $69.70

**What we bought:** 

* 2 Arnold's multi-grain bread loaves
* 1 8 count package La Banderita carb counter tortillas
* 2 9 oz packages turkey pastrami
* 1 12 oz package mixed greens 
* 2 8 oz packages pre-sliced cheese
* 4 pouches of tuna
* 2 pouches of salmon
* 16 pack individual mandarin orange cups, non-sweetened
* 24 count string cheese
* Large bag Old Trapper jerky (we could have skipped this and saved a ton of money)
* 6 THINK Protein Bars
* Grape tomatoes
* Reduced sodium olives, small container

**What we already had at home:** 

* Peanut butter
* Small amount of trail mix
* Dijon mustard
* Plastic fork and knife

My first tip is that if your hotel/accommodation has a free breakfast, *eat it*. It's free; you've really already paid for it in the cost of your accommodations. Some people snub their nose at hotel breakfasts, but you can find some great options if you look. Eat as much as you can, focusing on protein (eggs and meat y'all) to keep you full for a while. If you eat a good breakfast at 9am, you should be able to hold off until 1pm for lunch, and some people can even just snack and skip lunch if they're not used to eating breakfast. We ate at the hotel breakfast both mornings we stayed.

If you have to do breakfast as well, here are some inexpensive options for you:

* Unsweetened full fat Greek yogurt with fresh fruit or honey
* Plain oatmeal (try for multigrain or blends) with fresh fruit or a little brown sugar/maple syrup. *The convention may even have hot water for you to use!*
* English muffin or bagel with cheese and deli meat of choice

Any of these should cost around $5 for 4-5 breakfasts.

The only ""prepared food"" we had for the convention was the wraps we did: turkey, mustard, cheese and greens on the low carb wraps. My husband had 3 1/2 of them throughout the con, and I had 2 1/2. I also had 2 slices of bread with peanut butter spread on. Everything else was as listed in what we bought. 

Now, here is the kicker. **We still have food leftover.** This wasn't just food for the convention, we ended up bringing some home! Here's what we still have left:

* 10 mandarin orange cups
* 1 entire loaf of bread and most of the 2nd
* Most of the pack of turkey pastrami
* 1/3 of each pack of cheese
* 10-12 grape tomatoes 
* Salad leaves
* Olives (we forgot them in our room)
* 3 protein bars
* 1 tortilla wrap
* 3 pouches of tuna
* 1 pouch of salmon
* 11 string cheese
* 1/3 bag of jerky

These leftovers fed us for lunch today and I could stretch them for dinner as well, but I actually feel like cooking today after eating like that all weekend. 

Take from this post what you will, but the entire point is to show how far $70 can go over multiple days for two people. If we had eaten out each day, we would have spent close to that in one day. If we had shopped elsewhere (Kroger was solely for convenience) and dropped the jerky for something else, it would have easily been $50 spent.",finance
personalfinance,My dad needs $6000 for dental surgery,"My dads teeth are rotting out. He has like 15 teeth left and they are all very bad. He needs them all removed. He’s seen two dentists and both recommended having an oral surgeon remove them all at once under anesthesia. This will cost $6000.    
   
My dad is a struggling business owner of a failing storefront. He literally lives on a blow up mattress in the storage room and showers with some outdoor camping shower behind the building. The business makes just enough to pay rent and utilities.   
   
Obviously, he doesn’t have health insurance or any probable income. I’m sure you can guess his credit is bad because of a foreclosure when his mom passed away and he didn’t have to keep paying her mortgage (she was sick for a long time).  
   
Anyways. I’m an RN and i know the risks of untreated dental infection. The longer he waits, not only does he suffer in pain, he loses nutrition from what he can’t eat and he risks infection which can lead to pericarditis and other serious medical emergencies.   
   
I make around $60k a year with overtime. I have some empty credit cards but they are all ridiculous interest rates so if I put 6k on them he would be paying interest forever. I have a 750+ credit score. My life expenses are already pushing me over the edge financially with a wife and two babies.   
   
I can’t just sit and watch my dad suffer and possibly die from this but I’m also in such a tough spot financially as it is.  
   
I also don’t have much faith in his ability to pay me back either. He says he can but what is the next 4 years going to look like for him? I have no idea.   
    
I’m trying to buy a house in the next year because my family is very quickly outgrowing the one we rent and I don’t want to take any new lines of credit unless I have to.   
    
One idea I have is to add him as an authorized user on all of my credit cards to give his score an artificial boost. Maybe if I do this with like 4 of my long standing cards he will have enough of a boost to qualify for some sort of care credit or loan or something. He still doesn’t have any provable income so I’m not sure how far he would get.

personalfinance,debt consolidation + personal/medical loan advice?,"hello y'all! i'm looking for some advice as to how to deal with a two part financial problem:

1. i'm in a significant amount of credit card debt that i would like to consolidate to (hopefully) get a better interest rate and just have 1 payment against this each month instead of having to keep track of my multiple credit card bills. my goal is to be debt free in the next 5 years!
2. unfortunately  i am also in need of some very expensive dental work that my insurance will not cover, so i'm going to have to figure out the financing for that. this is not something i can put off much longer and it will need to happen in the next couple of months.

&amp;#x200B;

initially, my hope was to obtain a personal loan with which i could both consolidate my debt AND pay for this dental work, but having never looked into a personal loan before, i'm finding out that most financial institutions don't offer one in an amount large enough to cover both of the above needs. never having needed such a large sum of money since applying for college financial aid (and i was lucky in that my parents helped me with those applications at the time), i just don't quite know how things work in this arena and don't have anyone in my life i can go to for advice or help, so i thought i'd throw a couple a couple questions here to see if any savvy folks out there might be able to provide some insight!

would it be unwise of me/unheard of to apply for two loans (personal and medical) at the same juncture?

is there some other type of loan other than personal that i should be looking into that could cover both?

open to any other suggestions as to how to get the ball rolling on these! i've spoken with a nonprofit debt management service who was able to assess the situation with my credit cards and lay out a payment plan for me that would expedite paying off those balances, but i don't think i'd be able to afford both their plan and the payments of an additional loan for my teeth. hell, i mean, i don't even know if i could get approved for the loan with the credit card debt. i'm so lost and confused! i feel like there are so many financial advice services offered to people who have loads of money, and seemingly not so many for those of us just barely getting by.

my life situation: live with a domestic partner, no children (and there won't be), i rent, i work 40-70 hours a week at one full time job where i've been slowly working my way up for almost 6 years. unfortunately i don't own any significant assets except my car.

personalfinance,"Mortgage preapproval, how much does it matter?","How strict does the mortgage preapproval application have to be? 

My realtor wants me to get preapproved as soon as possible to get the ball rolling. However I wanted to wait a little bit and tour places in the meantime because I have some credit card debt that will be paid off within my next 2 paychecks so that will affect my debt to income ratio and my credit score (due to utilization) quite a bit

Should I go ahead and get preapproved now and then the lender will drop my interest rate accordingly during final approvals or should I just wait a few weeks and then get preapproved? In other words, does the preapproval more or less lock in my rate?

personalfinance,"FedLoan added 3 Stafford Loans to my account- all were in collections since 2012, all apparently in my name.","I'm going through their fraud reporting now, but they say the process may take up to a year. Part of my extreme concern is that I didn't notice the loan until September, and didn't dispute it until October, when the loans were transferred and I made payments March-Sept., luckily it was at the minimum, about $428 total.

The first time I called in Oct., I was told it would be easily resolved, wait two weeks to watch it drop off. Next I called in early November, I was told I needed to submit a resolution packet, detailing the fraud. They would have to mail it, not way to expedite, just have to wait. Ok. Waited until November 21st, no packet, called in, now told I needed to file something online. Thought I did. Think I'm losing it. Call today and they tell me no I didn't submit, no files in my account history, I also need to file a police report with it, or they can do nothing. Oh and they sent me the promissory note for the loans as I requested...you didn't receive it? Oh no worries, we can email, will only take 7-10 business days...

There's over $8000 total on the fraudulent loans, and apparently they've already gone through a federal repayment program. I have no record of contact with them since they were taken out in 2008. In 2008, I was in school, but have other private loans from that period, not associated with my fedloan account.

I've realized the Fedloan process might be worthless, but my questions are: 
- Can I go to my bank and credit karma to report it without screwing up or delaying the process? 
- will the fraud process clear up everything related to the loans, or am I going to be seeing other repercussions from this? 
- I am 99.999% sure I am not tied to these loans in any legal way. Starting to get scared of that .001%. Anything I can do to resolve quickly cleanly? 
- Other documentation I should bother with collecting pre-emptively? The loans were taken out for a tech school about an hour away from me- I've tried calling in to their loan office, no luck with a call back. Any point in going down there/following up? 
 - I'm going to start repaying on the loans I know are legally mine (they were all placed in admin leave when I first called, which I think just turns out to be deferment?), but is there any point to pay off the interest on the fraud loan? Nerve racking to see it accrue interest against my account.

Bitcoin,Stratum protocol - problem with implementation in python,"Hello everyone :)

For a couple of days I'm trying to write simple script in python to communicate with stratum pool server. I'm using simplified code of NightMiner ([https://github.com/ricmoo/nightminer/](https://github.com/ricmoo/nightminer/)) and some testnet I've foud ( stratum+tcp://pool.bitcoincloud.net:4008), but I can't get the proper result. Maybe someone more experienced could help me. Below I show each step of my script (step, no python source code).

**1. connect to the server, authorize, get the job data**

After connecting to the server I send this requests:

    b'{""id"": 1, ""method"": ""mining.subscribe"", ""params"": []}\n'
    b'{""params"": [""testuser"", ""anything""], ""id"": 2, ""method"": ""mining.authorize""}\n'

and get the following response:

    {""id"":1,""result"":[[[""mining.set_difficulty"",""deadbeefcafebabea200000000000000""],[""mining.notify"",""deadbeefcafebabea200000000000000""]],""40000004"",4],""error"":null}
    {""id"":null,""method"":""mining.set_difficulty"",""params"":[0.01]}
    {""id"":null,""method"":""mining.notify"",""params"":[""4ca"",""4128bf630f57387b00e25b419d1bb77e667e4036a7d8fee80000015600000000"",""01000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff2503a77614048c8a145e08"",""122f626974636f696e636c6f75642e6e65742f0000000002062c9c04000000001976a91423e020eacd64acfe093150331d44fdbcc0c7ce0688acc2eb0b00000000001976a91400bf6d61c2a34df5a9ea338fcad188c31bb4a52388ac00000000"",[],""20000000"",""1a02b098"",""5e148a8c"",true]}

**2. get the coinbase and merkle root**

With this data and extranounce='00000000' I can build the coinbase (in byte form, but I will show as hex in this example):

    coinbase=coinb1+extranounce1+extranounce2+coinb2
    coinbase=b'01000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff2503a77614048c8a145e084000000400000000122f626974636f696e636c6f75642e6e65742f0000000002062c9c04000000001976a91423e020eacd64acfe093150331d44fdbcc0c7ce0688acc2eb0b00000000001976a91400bf6d61c2a34df5a9ea338fcad188c31bb4a52388ac00000000'

Next thing to do is double hash the coinbase with SHA256 algo, which gives as the following bytes:

    b'9b9c9ab0b1c92844e4fed3f895f9443fefcda5ae02cc5a8ad4444f9303081a23'

There is no merkle branches (merkle branches list is empty), so hash above is our merkle root.

**3. building the header**

With merkle root and data received in step 1, I can start building a header:

    header= version + prevhash + merkle root + ntime + nbits + nonce

I use the values as follows:

    version - received '20000000', after little-endian conversion it is '0000002'
    prevhash - received '4128bf630f57387b00e25b419d1bb77e667e4036a7d8fee80000015600000000', after conversion it is '63bf28417b38570f415be2007eb71b9d36407e66e8fed8a75601000000000000' (reverse bytes order every 4 bytes)
    merkle root - get '9b9c9ab0b1c92844e4fed3f895f9443fefcda5ae02cc5a8ad4444f9303081a23' in step 2, stays that way
    ntime - received '5e148a8c', after conversion it is '8c8a145e'
    nbits - received '1a02b098', after conversion it is '98b0021a'

So the header is

    b'0000002063bf28417b38570f415be2007eb71b9d36407e66e8fed8a756010000000000009b9c9ab0b1c92844e4fed3f895f9443fefcda5ae02cc5a8ad4444f9303081a238c8a145e98b0021a' + nonce

**4. search nonce**

the difficulty is 0.01, so my target is

    00000063ff9c0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

after some calculations, I find this 4 bytes to use it as a nonce:

    b'd0cf1040'

so my complete header is now

    b'0000002063bf28417b38570f415be2007eb71b9d36407e66e8fed8a756010000000000009b9c9ab0b1c92844e4fed3f895f9443fefcda5ae02cc5a8ad4444f9303081a238c8a145e98b0021ad0cf1040'

after double-hashing it with SHA256 algo and reverse bytes order I get this hash:

    000000032f201567fc4d02fa468bf2dc6a5c21ae70098c124e99ee7d2520ca26

which is below my target, so 'd0cf1040' should be the correct nonce.

**5. submit nonce**

last thing to do is submitting the results, so I send this request to the server:

    b'{""id"":2, ""method"":""mining.submit"",""params"":[""testuser"",""4ca"",""00000000"",""5e148a8c"",""4010cfd0""]}\n'

and this is response I get:

    {""id"":2,""result"":false,""error"":null}

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea why I get result=false. I can only suppose there is a mistake in step 3 (building header) and this mistake is related to byte-order of some values, but I can't find this mistake (I have tried many variants of byte-order, but never get the response result=true).

I will be  much obliged if anyone can check this calculations and give me some tips.",cryptocurrency

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

economy,Central Bank Digital Currency,"Christine Lagarde recently announced ECB (European Central Bank) Policy Makers are discussing plans to create their own Central Bank Digital Currency.

She gave this speech in November 2018.

For that paper she referenced, named [Casting Light on Central Bank Digital Currencies](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Staff-Discussion-Notes/Issues/2018/11/13/Casting-Light-on-Central-Bank-Digital-Currencies-46233) \- a particular section is very interesting indeed...

""This note contributes to a growing body of literature on CBDC. Others have already explored this topic, including international organisations such as the Bank for International Settlements and several central banks (Bank of Canada, People's Bank of China, Bank of England.......""

Remember, this report is from November 2018 - so Central Banks and powerful entities such as the BIS, Bank of China and Bank of England have explored this topic in detail for longer than one initially assumes.

There are important points to discuss, as it could have huge implications for society in general:

1. The first is the trend towards a cashless society. The infrastructure required for using cash costs countries a fair amount every year. Also, younger consumers prefer the convenience of mobile payments.
2. What does this mean for privacy (particularly financial privacy)?
3. What does this mean for the most vulnerable in society who are heavily reliant on cash, such as the homeless?
4. As well as this, any trusted third party is a security hole - thus these centralised institutions are [honeypots for skilled hackers](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/capital-one-hacked-over-100-million-customers-affected/)
5. There is of course Facebook's Libra and the recent news of [China's plan to introduce the Digital Yuan](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/12/china-central-bank-close-to-releasing-digital-currency-pboc-official.html)

Outgoing Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has stated that [digital currencies can be used to reduce the reliance on the US Dollar](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/23/mark-carney-dollar-dominant-replaced-digital-currency)

So...

Demand is there, and Pandora's Box is now opened

IT SEEMS INEVITABLE THAT THIS IS THE DIRECTION IN WHICH WE ARE HEADING.

Here is my current take on the situation.

**\[DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE\]**

Things can change and you should conduct your own due diligence.

I think Central Bank Digital Currencies *will* happen and start the trend towards a cashless society.

This will also make it easier to collect taxes for Governments.

Unfortunately, I believe this probably will be a centralised network.

This means that funds can be frozen (which is bad for certain privacy conscious consumers), although it will mean that transactions will have reduced fees and that the 'middleman' aspect of the financial services industry will be hit (which is good for all consumers).

Therefore, Bitcoin will be (and already is my opinion) the decentralised hedge against bad monetary policy and centralised power structures.

Allowing for peer to peer transactions in a decentralised manner.

In terms of long term investment, I think that Bitcoin will hit $100K within 2-3 years, and $1MM within the next 15 years.

This will be a critical issue over the next decade that could have some very serious consequences for those who are not prepared for this transition.

As an investor, it is important to understand where the long term trend is heading.

Generally, this revolves around technological innovation that makes our lives more convenient and makes it more efficient to transfer value and thus drive progress and prosperity.

These developments are an indicator of that, but it is important to remember that those in positions of power and that control the flow of money are ruthless in their pursuit to maintain that power and maybe, just maybe, the guys at the NSA created a decentralised hedge against their incompetence...

* W2 income of 70K
* 1099 income of 110K

I've been curious about  how to handle deductions on this because it looks like I can take the  standard deduction, but can I also take the 20% sole proprietor  deduction? I'm single. Other factors:

* 8K in office expenses and rent (solo office, no living situation).
* I've got some travel expenses but not sure if those are applicable anymore.
* 19K in qualified medical expenses that year.
* 2K in charity.
* 0 in IRA contributions (no 401K)

personalfinance,Pay off student loans or continue to pursue PSLF?,"Hi,

I’m trying to figure out if I should just aggressively pay off my student loans or if I should continue making minimum payments and have the rest forgiven through PSLF. 

My background is that I’m a federal employee with 5 years of service so far. I earn $120k. I do not plan to leave my job. I’ve made consecutive, on time payments but 3 years of the 5 in service I was in the wrong kind of income based plan so those payments did not qualify. So I have 24 months of qualifying payments. My expected eligibility date for PSLF is November 2027. My loan payoff date is October 2030. 

My loans are $55,000. I make $600 a month payments. I’ve barely seen a dent in reducing my principle in the last 5 years. My average interest is 5.71%. 

I know they extended an act to help people like me get forgiveness when they were in the incorrect income based repayment plan but I know those funds are limited, too. 

Should I pay the minimum for another 5 years and hope I qualify for the program for those who were in the wrong plan? If that’s not possible, should I continue on PSLF until 2027 to save on 3 years of payments?

I started a new job mid December, (so far so good) there was one thing I am trying to make sure to fix though.

So my first 3 paychecks (paid weekly) by our companies mistake or my own, I was listed as tax exempt. So my first 3 pay days I was not giving anything to federal taxes. I caught it this past weekend because I kept telling myself I was taking home way more than I should be. I’m just glad to have found it early on. We have Paycom and I adjusted accordingly so that this coming week I am all back on track. I also withheld x amount to cover what would have been last weeks federal taxes. So for 2020 I should be all set. 

My bigger question being, those two checks from 2019, what can/should I do about making up for those two missed federal withdrawals. It is not a huge amount of money and I would happily give it back. As many of us, I rely heavily on my tax return every year for a multitude of things. The biggest thing I want to avoid is being penalized in any way. I am looking for advice on how to go about handling the situation.

personalfinance,retirement account vs paying off mortgage,"Hi guys,

Apologies if this is a common question.  New here, just trying to decide what's optimal.  I looked at the flow-chart in the wiki and it suggests to pay off moderate interest debts--excluding mortgages--before putting 15%+ into retirement accounts.

Well, according to my math, I'd save a lot more money by paying extra on my house.  My interest payments are higher than my principal, and if I get the loan amount down to 80% of the house's value I can drop the PMI payment which is about the same as my principal, maybe a little less at this point.  That means for every extra principal payment I'm saving just as much as I'm putting in, maybe even twice as much.  Isn't that something like 200% return vs the \[very nice\] 17% I got last year on my 401k?  I suppose I'm saving some on taxes but it can't be enough to offset this, right?

I want to make sure I'm not missing anything.  This is my first foray into getting my finances on track.  I need to look at the actual numbers so I can try to quantify this for real.

personalfinance,Medical Debt Repayment - Do’s and Don’t’s?,"Hey there! I live in MN, USA. 

I have a $1050 hospital bill from the birth of my second child. I’ve paid all other associated costs already except this one. My daughter was early and had a NICU stay. The $1050 is me only and all that’s left of her birth debt wise from either of us. 

The hospital is telling me that I can make two payments of half now and half next month, or I can finance the balance through a third party they work with for lower payments. I’m really not interested in financing but I can’t afford two large lump sums. 

I guess my question is, can they refuse if I make smaller payments to them? And if they refuse my payments, do I have any recourse if sent to collections? I understand bills are due at the time of services rendered and they most likely can do what they want if I don’t pay to their terms. I’ve heard a lot of conflicting information surrounding medical debt and hospital bills, so I want to make sure I have no other options before financing the debt, and know if that’s even a good option. I’m currently awaiting an information packet from this company so I don’t have more information for you guys about interest rates or terms. 

This has no bearing on the situation, but I’m so frustrated being backed into a corner over $1050 when my insurance has already paid them $59k for me alone, not even including what they were paid from myself and my insurance company for my baby. You can’t work with me over $1k?!",finance

From my current understanding, I can only contribute up to my W2 income into my Roth IRA since it is less than the federal limit. What if I contributed more? What happens?

personalfinance,"Sold house, advice on next move","Me and my wife recently sold our home and are living with the in laws. They are cool with it and its not so bad. We netted 45,000 after everything was said and done. I'm looking for advice on the next move.

Currently my wife has 26k in federal student debt, with a balance of 10k on her vehicle. No loans and a small credit card balance of maybe 50 bucks.

I owe 31k on my vehicle and have no credit cards or loans.

We both together make over 100k. But we also need to be saving for a downpayment on a house. 

My question is should I pay the student debt off first? Or maybe pay off both vehicles and tackle student debt that way? What would be the best option in terms of the future? I absolutely love my car and plan on keeping it for awhile. She'll need a new car within the year. We are currently saving around 700 a week give or take.

personalfinance,Credit Card Balance transfer 19.99% - 8.99%,"Hello

I am 29 years old and I've discovered last year that I had screwed up my credit and financial future immensely. I didn't pay my student loans, I maxed out 2 credit cards at 1900 and 2500 and let those and a $900 hydro bill go to collections.


I started off September 2017 with nothing in my bank account because student loans took my rent and bill money directly out of my bank account on the 1st of the month. 
I was in a hole and it was all of my own making.
Student loans $28,000
MC 2500
Visa 2300
Hydro 987

I was lucky enough to settle the MC, the Visa, and the hydro bill for $3400 total. And I paid that off with a loan from my grandmother (thank goodness for that woman. I love and respect her and have paid her back)
I started a new job 10 days later
 In the last 24 months I have brought down my student loan to 18,500. I pay 400 on it every month.

About a year or so ago I applied for capital one MASTERCARD to help rebuild my credit. I got it, a limit of 300, and it was easy. I then stupidly increased it to 2300 and have gone to hell with it. I pay 450 on it but I still use it so my balance just constantly stays the same. I have managed to throw an additional 500 on it so it's down to 1700 now but now I'm looking into credit card with a lower interest rate as the 19.99% interest is murder. 
I am looking into a MC that has 8.99% and 90 day 0 interest balance transfer. And after that 8.99% interest on the transfer itself. Is this a good route to go? Balance transfer to the higher card and try and continue to pay the 450/month on the lower interest card... I know this seems like an inane question but I'm trying not to screw this up.

Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated.

investing,A question regarding either paying debt or investing,"I've got a question that's been bugging me. It's in relation to deciding if it's better to use a lump sum of money to either pay down a debt or to invest. 

Ok, so say I've got $50,000 and I want to buy a $50,000 car. I could just pay all that money upfront and own the car 100% and have no debt....but the savvy financial advise I see everywhere says *""No no, if you can get a loan for at a low interest rate, you're better off investing that $50,000, and pay the loan off over several years. After the loan is payed, the returns on your $50,000 investment is likely to be higher than the interest paid on the loan, and so you end up ahead!""*

This makes sense to me except for one thing: **Where is the money to pay back the loan assumed to be coming from**? 

Is the idea you're taking your monthly loan payments out of the $50,000 investment? Like you're selling off some stocks every month to make the minimum payments? That would seem pretty inefficient, since you'll be losing some money on transaction fees/commissions each time you make a trade. Plus that also means you're not investing $50,000 for the life of the loan, you're just whittling it down each month, eventually to zero, which I have to think really dampens whatever returns you can expect. 

The only other option I see is that you've got enough additional income to pay off the loan without touching the $50,000 investment...but that would seem to be moving the goal posts on the original scenario. It's, ""I've got $50,000 to use to buy a car"" not ""I've got $50,000 plus a comparable monthly income to buy a car""

So help me out, because I feel like I'm missing something obvious here. I've seen this advice pretty frequently, but they never go into the mechanics of what's expected to happen.",finance

Card 1: 2k @ 12% - monthly minimum $50

Card 3: 1k @ 7.6% - monthly minimum $50

Besides the monthly minimum we've an extra $300 to put towards this debt. 

Would the best option be to quickly pay off Card 3 then contribute the extra $50 per month towards paying off Card 1? Or go in order of interest rate paying Card 1 first ? Or does it make most financial sense to pay Card 2 first since it has the highest monthly payment?

Death benefit of policy: $494,300;

Net death benefit (after paying loan): $422,790;
Current cash value: $129,633;
Annual premium payment (paid twice a year by four beneficiaries): $9,028

We assume it’s best to keep it open, because we don’t expect Parent2 to live more than 10-15 more years tops.

personalfinance,Buying a home. Large down payment vs. small down payment in this Economy,"What’s up guys. I think I know the traditional answer to this question but was hoping to get different views other than banks and mortgage brokers. 
—-
The below is what I was told and not 100% sure if all the stats are accurate. 
—-
To make the math somewhat more simple let’s say the home I am looking to buy is 1,000,000. 
Most people would advise putting less down. Let’s say 20%(200,000) and taking the remaining money and putting it in the market or an index fund. 
Mortgage rates are around 3.7% which lenders will call “free money” and the average return of the market is 9% to 10%. 
So over the 30 year mortgage 
My interest on an 800,000 loan would be roughly (a)550k. And if I took that 800k and put it in the market I’d make (b)( I tried some interest rate calculators but don’t know if it’s accurate) 
So it would be a-b= c  if it put 200k down. 

Vs. a non traditional way of putting down 800k and putting 200k in the market 
The interest on a 200k montage over 30 years is roughly (a)160k. And then that 200k in the market would grow to (b)(I tried some interest rate calculators but don’t know if it’s accurate)
Then a-b=d if I put down 800k

Then c vs d

This seems obvious that C( putting down 200k)is the correct choice. But with the market at an all time high, volatility in the works and other factors that I’m hoping some of you could uncover... I’m having 2nd thoughts. 

As you can see from the above, finance and grammar are not my strong suits. 
I’m lucky I found a job that really neither are needed and do do well for myself.

As of right now, we still owe ~$540,000 on our mortgage. We have no intentions of moving and this is intended to be our forever home. We both have excellent credit, no foreclosures, and no debt (besides the mortgage).

Seeing the 17 years left made me think if we should refinance to a 15 year fixed rate mortgage. I have no idea where to start or if I am misunderstanding how refinancing works, but I starting googling refinance options and came upon nerdwallet, which recommended www.better.com. According to this website, we can get a 15 year fixed rate mortgage with an interest rate of 3.0% (3.025% APR). $2,000 in lender fees, $1,047 lender credit, and additional 3rd party fees (closing costs?) which I'm assuming will be a fair amount.

According to their calculator, our mortgage payment if we refinance will only be $100 more than our current mortgage payment. This is something we can afford, and it seems to make sense to refinance to lower our interest rate. 

Knowing this information, does it make sense to refinance? I feel like I'm missing something or I'm completely misunderstanding how a refinance works. Even if closing costs are $10,000, the money saved on interest should easily make up for that right?",finance

Over time they will shed, and try to keep processing minimal for best results. My final total ended up being $631.00
So fast forward to July 1st I received the hair. The first problem I had was the hair she sent me was 4 inches shorter than what I paid for on one and 2 inches shorter on the other. After a month of going back and forth with her via text message she finally issued me a $50 credit.
 A few days after receiving my credit I messaged her again asking her if maybe I got a bad batch because the hair was behaving nothing like what she talked about on her Instagram, and on her youtube. She did nothing but blame me and accuse me of doing all this stuff to it when all I do is wash it with all the products she recommended. I told her that the hair she sent me is not good hair and after this she started ignoring me. I decided to take the L and just try to make the hair work but the quality just continued to decrease. 
I was so fed up finally in September I called PayPal seeing if there was anything they could do. I ended up filing a dispute with PayPal and it was denied because her description of the hair matched with what she sent me “close enough.” So in October I filed a dispute with my bank I provided pictures of the hair,And messaged the seller asking for a refund in exchange for her wigs.

He said I had earned it. Anyway, at the beginning of this year, all of the other salaried employees and I were pulled in to HR to be told we are being converted to a hourly wage. They said it was a new federal law that was passed stating any employees that do not work in a office environment must be on the clock. I work in a warehouse as a materials handler.

personalfinance,Help with Federal Tax W-4,"Hey everyone,

First time posting here and I had a quick question regarding updating my Federal Elections/Withholding for this year. My company uses Workday as the web portal system to update Withholdings and I am currently seeing something similar to the following for questions to fill out:

&amp;#x200B;

 **Number of Qualifying Children Under Age 17** 

 **Number of Dependents** 

The confusion here is two fold...

1. If I am filing married jointly and my wife does not work and we have two children, am I simply put 2 for the first option and 2 for the second? Or is dependents different than children under 17?
2. When I fill this out with a 2 in the first and a 2 in the second option, I see that it says I am withholding $5,000...

I guess I'm not sure how this equates to the typical W-4 with options A-H. On that one, I would currently have 11 as the total of all lines:

1 for myself

1 for married filing jointly

1 for married filing jointly, have only one job, and spouse doesnt work

8 for having two children, filing jointly, and have an income of a little less then $103,000

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, I usually just file what would be considered Married 0, but I would like to start getting the maximum I can in my paychecks and less back at tax time. Thanks!!!",finance

business,"Fundraising is just like dating. Halo effect goes a long way with a date, how are you guys building a halo around yourself to get a foot in the door and impress investors?","Okay, so there I said it, when speaking of dating a rockstar is always going to be more successful than a regular Joe, even if the rockstar is a terrible person who cares little to nothing about their many partners and the average Joe is a sweetheart who'd put their (sole, unique) partner on a pedestal.

Sociologists refer to this phenomenon as the ""Halo effect"", each and every human is subject to it and those who are affected the least better not discount the halo effect while building their model as it's real and can really hurt you (ask those who shorted Tesla discounting the halo effect around Musk).

Speaking of Tesla, many things can be said, but both sides really do agree on something. The capability of Musk to generate halo around himself which exceeds the actual capabilities or qualities of the man and the company. Shorts will tell you that's disonesty and being promotional, Longs will tell you that's black belt salesmanship and they'd get to what they promise eventually 

In any event the halo effect is something which is there and cannot be ignored, and it's working wonders for the company in terms of fundraising (making it easier to essentially print money by issuing stock or by lowering interest rates in the bond market)

I want to end this with a question:

personalfinance,How to balance tuition/rent/savings,"Hello!

As a bit of background, I'm currently 21 years old and entering my 3rd year of a Bachelors degree in CS (transferring from a community college with an Associates.) Up to now I've been able to pay tuition and stuff without debt for several reasons:

* I worked and saved pretty much all my earnings from 17 on. Nothing fancy, just food service and a summer camp.
* I've lived either with my parents or on site at said summer camp as I did maintenance and stuff.
* I've done my best to do college as cheaply as possible. Community college online for two years, transferring to another state school to finish my degree online.

My dilemma now is that I'm almost out of savings, and this new school, while still cheap in comparison to many schools I looked at, is more expensive than the one I have been at. Also, I no longer have the option of living rent-free (until mid-May, when summer camp starts again). I've found some super nice people that are willing to rent me a space for $300/mo for a few months, and I plan to move forward with that.

As a breakdown, my current income is usually around $800/mo. (Working part time for my camp). My current savings is $4.4k. Tuition is $4.1k (will be slightly less in future semesters). Rent is $300/mo. I don't have an emergency fund beyond those savings, so I've always tried to not touch them as much as possible.

So, I've got a few options. My college has a payment plan that splits the amount into thirds for a $25 fee. The only Federal aid I qualify for (my parents are successful enough that I don't qualify for much, but I don't receive aid from them) is a $2,750 Direct Unsubsidised Loan. I have applied to several scholarships (need to do more) but have not received any. 

I've got the savings right now to pay for this month, but going forward I'll need to potentially take a semester off of school in order to build up savings. I'd love to do college without loans at all, but I'm not sure how feasible that is right now. I'm registered for the Spring semester, and tuition is due very soon so I need to stop hemming and hawing and make a decision.

Thanks for your time and (hopefully) advice. :)

personalfinance,"Investing a personal loan in the stock market long term, is there a downside?","Hey guys!

*please if you're gonna comment, read the details, this isn't just r/wsb type of taking a loan you can't afford to lose and putting it all on options*

So I just met up with a friend who works at a bank and he told me just did this:

He took out a personal 5 year loan of 60k at a fixed 2.5% interest rate, and he's putting it all on indices like the S&amp;P 500.

He reckons, if the stock market goes the way it's been going in previous years, he's going to rake in the free cash doing basically nothing. And if the market crashes, he pays off the loan and just keeps money riding the market long term (even 20 years) and just let that money make itself back.

This sounds almost too perfect of a plan to me, where's the risk?

Edit: 

Because people asked i'll answer here, he lives at home and plans to stay there for a few years, We're not from America so a crash probs won't effect our jobs, and he has more than the sum borrowed in cash if push comes to shove, but he's saving up for real estate AND if he can do it with leverage instead he thinks why not",finance

The value of my house has risen to around $495K based off houses being sold in my area (very good area right now) and my focus has been to get the loan down below the 80% LTV so I can get rid of the PMI.  If I do this refi my loan amount will reset back to $430K.  

Initially I told them no but once I worked out the math a bit, taking this offer hurts me in the short term but does save me over $50K in interest over the long haul of the loan.  So should I jump and take the refi or hold pat to my current loan?  We are planning on staying in the house for at least 10 years from now.

Any and all advice would be welcome.  Thanks",finance

My employer offers both a 401k and 401k ROTH (neither with a match) as well as a pension plan that is completely funded by them. I currently max out a ROTH IRA held with Vanguard as well as contribute to the 401k ROTH for a combined total of 20% of my net income. I also max out an HSA.

That got me thinking... I believe my current setup is correct based on historically (or at least in my lifetime) low taxes and lower liability in retirement, but I believe that after the ""Trump"" tax policy expires I should split contributions between the 401k and 401k ROTH while keeping all else the same. I'd like to know if my current setup is maximizing my success for retirement, if my thinking about splitting is correct, and if so is there a good site/math formula to help me in splitting?

I am 31, US citizen, and make about 200k/year working for a large tech company. I have 500k in stock (\~250k of which is vested and available to sell now) and a 20k emergency fund in a savings account. I’ve maxed out my 401k/pension and have a few other long term investments.

I know we need to start paying down the student loan debt ASAP, but my question is how aggressively makes sense?

We are planning on starting a family and are interested in buying a house in the next 5 years.

So far these are the  options I’ve been able to come up with:

Super aggressive: Flush my stocks and pay the whole loan amount today. This is obviously the “cheapest”, but significantly impacts our near term goals. Probably pushes back by 3-4 years.

Middle ground: Get on the standard repayment plan (min \~1400/month) and throw X$ on top of that to pay less interest. Maybe pay everything off in 10 years? Ideas on what X$ should be 10k at a time? This gives us some more freedom to invest and doesn't put off our family plans significantly.

Super conservative: Just pay the standard repayment plan - same \~1400/month for 360 months which ends up being 485k. This leaves us with the most investable cash...maybe ends up making us more in the long run?

Super crazy: My wife gets on an income based repayment plan, we file taxes separately, pay 0$ a month, forgive the loan in 30 years and get hit with the interest then (probably about 200k). We might be crazy rich or renounce our American citizenship…so maybe worth the gamble?

Alright so my first job layed off 90% of the company about halfway through the year, I was eligible and applied for UI while I did my jobsearch. I ended up picking up a contracting gig with HIGHLY variable hours so the UI continued on weeks where I had not enough work. I eventually landed a job that i wanted just into the 4th Quarter. My 3rd Quarter's estimated tax payment was easy, I owed federal taxes on the UI and that's it. Figuring out this past quarter's estimated taxes has me very confused. I've tried following along with the IRS worksheets but my numbers keep coming up... odd. It doesn't help (to me) that the sheets often don't tell you WHY you are doing something.

So I know I have Self Employment taxes in addition to Federal estimated taxes, is there a good tool/flowchart to follow to do all this in the right order that actually calls out what the steps are doing. I feel like I'm doing something wrong like adding the social security tax to the federal tax and calculating that as my over/under pay. Do I send 2 payments in, or is it all together? Most of the ""this is how you do self employment returns for idiots"" guides don't figure on you working a regular job in another part of the year ( I ended up having a negative estimated tax payment following one, and I know thats wrong heh)

Sorry if this is actually covered somewhere, I'm just in a bit of a panic realizing I need to get this done NOW (deadline for estimated payments is the 15th)",finance
personalfinance,"Credit card used fraudulently, reported it immediately, card company says charge is valid. What are my options?","A couple of months ago, I received an email alert that my card was used in an online transaction. It looked like two charges on eBay via PayPal. I use neither eBay nor PayPal and I reported the charges immediately as fraud. (Saw the email about an hour after it was sent and called it at that point so minimal time had passed) I had recently done a balance transfer to that card using a 0% promotion and I had not used the card at all for purchases for a couple of months so I wouldn't mess up the interest rate. **Also relevant, at the time the charges were made, I was at the veterinarian all afternoon putting my beloved dog to sleep and can supply a time/date stamped invoice.** I was most definitely not doing any online shopping. The physical card was at home and no one had access to it.

After a review, the card company deemed one charge valid because ""I had received benefit from it"" and the other one fraud. They were made at the exact same time so how can one be fraud but not the other?? Now, a random package I did not order did show up about a week after I reported the fraud. There was no invoice, transaction, or seller contact information in the package so I had no idea where it was from or how to return it.

Apparently, this item is what was purchased on eBay and since it went to my home address, they determined it was valid. (I never ship anything to my home address -- always to my office so things won't be left unattended on the porch)

When I disputed the finding, I asked if they had the seller's information. They gave me an email address. I wrote to the person and explained that I had not ordered anything and asked if we could resolve this. The person won't reply to me.

Am I truly stuck paying for something I did not order and cannot use?  I would happily return it to the sender for a refund but I can't get them to answer me. The credit card company says their finding is final and the balance will be posted to my account. It's under $100 so do I just have to suck it up and pay for it or are there any other options? Thanks in advance!",finance
investing,Asset allocation and duration,"I've read several posts with questions about how to invest for shorter time horizons than retirement, such as saving for a down payment, kids education, etc. So i wanted to share [this link](https://www.betterment.com/resources/stock-allocation-advice/) to what I've seen as the most robust quantitative analysis for risk adjusted returns.

***Disclosure***\*: The analysis is prepared by Betterment. I am not affiliated with Betterment, I am not a licensed financial professional, and I am not providing investment advice. Invest at your own risk.\*

**Procedures**:  
\- Back-tested historical returns of stock and bonds based on portfolio mix and duration  
\- Analyzed the returns by percentile to obtain risk / reward payoff  
\- Used the above data to come up with base portfolios for each duration of investment  
\- Considered qualitative factors (risk appetite) and how one may want to tweak the base allocation

**Limitations**:  
\- Does not consider taxes in projections, all are made pre-tax  
\- Does not describe full detail of what is included in equities and bonds (S&amp;P 500, international, etc.)  
\- Does not consider dollar cost averaging and impact to results  
\- Does not consider how valuation of market (CAPE ratios, PE, etc.) &amp; interest rates impact results  
\- Is by nature a back-test and future performance may vary

**Results**:  
\- To no surprise, the longer the time horizon, the more probable it would be that equities over-performed cash and bonds, and the return / risk profile improved. An investor should expect to earn more in equities after a 10 to 15 year duration.  
\- In a 10-year period, a mix of 70% stocks was expected to generate a positive return approximately 94% of the time. In a 3-year-period, about 80% of the time. However, the shorter duration, the more likely a loss may be material  
\- As the mix of stocks increased past 80-90%, the marginal benefit of holding additional stocks decreased compared to the risk decreased logarithmically

**Conclusion**:  
The 'base' portfolios were as follows:  
\- Short term: 10% stocks  
\- Medium term (5 - 10 years): 60% - 80% stocks (increases with *duration*, **not** risk tolerance)  
\- Long term (20+ years): 90% stocks / 10% bonds  
Depending on risk tolerance, Betterment advises to adding or subtract a 7% weighting of stocks to the portfolio. I would expect risk tolerance to consider age, risk-appetite, safety of your profession to recession, size of emergency savings, debt, income / savings ratio, and whether you are dollar cost averaging in or dumping money all at once.

**Practical implications**:  
After reading this, it suggests that for saving for a kids education, you may want to invest a significant portion of funds into equities if they are 10+ years out, and draw down as the kids becomes older. In 10 years, there was a 94% probability of a 70% equities portfolio having a neutral or higher return of capital employed. 

For house down-payment savings, this allocation may greatly vary depending on your time horizon and risk appetite, as well as the actual cost of a down-payment. If the down-payment is less than 3 years away, the risk / reward profile for equities are fairly marginal, however from 3-5 years it dramatically increases. If an investor didn't have a set date to purchase a house and required at least 3-5 years to save for the principal, a prudent equity weighting may be sensible. Particularly if you are not investing in one lump sum and are dollar-cost-averaging in. 

What are your thoughts about the post? Any other limitations I missed? Do you agree / disagree with the study or my interpretation and why? Feedback greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.",finance
personalfinance,"First year student, preparing for tax question!","Hey, all.

So I'm going through TurboTax, as I typically do my taxes. They're pretty straight forward. Kind of goes like;

\-Yes, I made money.

\-No, I'm definitely not married.

\-Yes, my heart is still beating. 

But I'm preparing for this year using their TaxCaster tax-estimator and there was a question that said ""Enter the total amount of tuition and fees you pay for the year."". This has me a bit stumped. So the last two semesters I've taken $7,500 in gov't loans (unsubsidized and subsidized) and haven't paid anything on them yet (eek, still enrolled). The next question it asks me is ""Have you paid any interest"" nope. 

But its the first question that has me stuck. So I've technically paid for the tuition and fees for my schooling, however... I really haven't, considering its on loans. Would I mark this box upon the actual tax form as $0, or $7,500? Because it changes my estimation from \~$500 to \~$3,000 and that makes me think that I should be putting in $0. However, I've never received a federal refund less than $1,600 so I'm a bit puzzled (yet fully aware this is a calculator and not accurate in ANY regards). Just trying to prepare myself for the big 2020!

personalfinance,Need to rebuild emergency fund quickly,"Hi! I've recently incurred some high expenses leaving my once-comfortably-building savings a few scattered coins in the piggy bank. I'm not fully broke, but waaaaay outside my comfort in terms of savings (there's $2000 left). 

So I've budgeted out my retirement savings for the year, and after maxing out my 401k (no match *cry*) and Roth IRA, and accounting for the need for food and shelter and other recurring expenses, I have around $200 - $300 to put away each month. 

Where can I put this money to grow it best? My savings are currently in an account earning 1.7% APY -- I don't know what's going on in the big picture re: these interest rate things, but this has fallen from 2.1% or something last year, and I don't trust it to not fall again. Can I increase that somehow (while still keeping some portion liquid), and add my modest $200 monthly? High, fast returns would be preferable (of course), as I have some 0%-interest debts I also have to pay off (to very understanding parents, who will wait even years to get paid back). I haven't factored these into the equation because I know they are flexible, but I do need to grow this $2000 into something resembling ""emergency fund"" quickly. I see that a few places have 2.00% APY CDs, but I don't want to lock it up just yet. 

Obviously (and this will probably happen), I can **not** max out my 401k and Roth IRA (that's $25000 right there) -- is there a benefit to maxing one out over the other, or should I just halfsies (or more) each of them? 

Thank you for any tips!",finance

personalfinance,Advice Needed: Student Loans while in Military,"So I’ve made the decision to enlist in the military to get my finances in order and develop my career (if all goes right). I have \~30k (Consolidated with Fedloan Servicing at an interest rate of 6 percent) in loans right now from an undergraduate degree.

I’m planning on getting an online masters while in the military. I’m on the fence about which masters to get. I’ve considered an online MPA at USC for 50 k (IF I can get in) or an MS in Global Technology and Development from ASU that costs just 13k. I also have a 5k scholarship I’m waiting to apply to grad school or loans from Americorps.

What is the best move here? Accept the GI Bill and go with a higher quality and more respected masters (or save it for my future kid or possibly something else if I decide to pass on this expensive masters) OR take the budget masters at ASU and wipe out student loans instantly. Or should I save my GI Bill for grad school and get on PSLF and an income based repayment plan? I have like 6 qualifying payments for PSLF so far.

Thanks in advance for feedback!",finance
personalfinance,I can put 25% down on a house. Should I?,"My partner and I plan to purchase a house soon for 800k. We're in a position to put up to 25% down on the house. The house we're planning to purchase is in great shape and fairly updated, but the master bathroom is outdated (carpets! why!)

We're debating the merits of putting down 25% vs 20%, holding back some cash to immediately remodel the bathroom.

To get some things out of the way:


* We have 50k in savings earmarked for emergencies and committed in no way to the house purchase or renovation 

* We max IRAs and 401k matches (saving 15%+ of income for retirement) 

* We have no debt (cars are paid off, no student debt, no credit card debt)

* We have 25k liquid to cover closing costs, moving, furnishing, etc. Essentially this is to buffer additional costs when taking ownership of the house

* Where we live geographically and the quality of home we want dictates a house roughly in this price range. We both work remotely and value a home we feel happy spending *a lot* of time in

* The mortgage payment is &lt;25% of our income 

Back to the original question - one side of the discussion is to put 25% down to lower our monthly payments as much as reasonable by securing a lower interest rate (3.75%) and lower loan amount overall. The other side is to expose less of the money to the real estate market and have 40k cash extra to immediately remodel the bathroom, furnish the house further, and likely dump the rest into the market. This comes at the expense of a higher interest rate (3.875%), about $150 more in mortgage payments a month, and more loan overall.

I'm personally leaning toward 20% down. The remodel seems like a great investment both in our happiness and value of the home, and the costs seem very reasonable to make that happen. I've been persuaded by investing advice recommending exposing less absolute dollars to the real estate market (that is, at a low interest rate, cash is better served doing work elsewhere). I had a hard time finding a discussion about this topic, and I wanted a second opinion, so I thought I'd open the discussion up to r/personalfinance

personalfinance,Should I max out Roth IRA if employer already offers SEP IRA?,"Hello fellow Reddit, hope to get some advice here.

I’m trying to figure out what should I do in the following situation. I get SEP IRA from my work along with the profit shares. A portion of our profit shares we get as SEP IRA. 

I get on average about $30k of SEP IRA/year. Currently, I have close to $71k in my SEP IRA.

I’m planning to purchase a house within the next 3-4 years, I’m trying to decide between maximizing ROTH IRA for 2019/2020 (for both me and my wife) vs investing some of the money into high-yield savaging last account (or a federal market) and mutual funds in a brokerage account.

I can later withdraw up to $20k from my IRA accounts without paying a penalty as a first-time home buyer (for me and my wife), thus I can use contribution as a $20k savings for a home purchase with the growth being reinvested for retirement. 

In my current situation, my wife is still in school and has about 2 years to go. With our future combined income, I can expect that we would no longer be qualified to contribute to IRAs unless I go with something like a backdoor Roth 401k. 

Would it make sense contributing and maximizing into IRA or should I instead focus on brokerage growth investment and savings?

Additionally, would I benefit in any way within tax code to contributing into Traditional IRA rather than ROTH IRA and then take advantage of $20k withdrawal for a home purchase? Which of course would still be a subject to tax.

personalfinance,Refinance for better rate or keep current for longer credit age.,"Hello, This question may sound stupid to some, but I thought this would be the best place to ask.

I’ve been prequalified to refinance my student loan, decreasing my interest rate from 6.49% to 4.5% on ~$19,000. The minimum payment is $300/month, but would increase to $360. My husband and I have already been aggressively avalanching our student loans and should have this particular loan paid off by 2023 (believe it or not this is not our highest interest rate loan). Our budget can tolerate this increase without impacting pay off date. 

My predicament is my credit age is only 3years old. I am unfamiliar with how much it truly impacts overall credit score, so I’m asking for your input: Do I refinance for a lower rate to save on interest paid or do I continue with my current rate to keep my credit age higher?",finance

investing,"CFO Signals survey: Q4 2019 (97% of CFOs say a downturn has already begun or will next year, expected to be mild)","The survey: [ CFO Signals™: Q4 2019
Downturn concerns dampen 2020 revenue, earnings, investment, and hiring expectations
](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/finance/articles/downturn-concerns-dampen-2020-revenue-earnings-investment-and-hiring-expectations.html)

4Q19 Highlights: Downturn concerns dampen 2020 revenue, earnings, investment and hiring expectations.

* CFOs’ views on the trajectory of the North American economy improved somewhat; views on Europe and China remain poor.
* Ninety-seven percent of CFOs say a downturn has either already begun or will next year; about 80% cite taking defensive steps.
* Trade wars and uncertainty remain CFOs’ top external worries.
* Expectations for consumer and business spending have declined since last year.
* CFOs are less likely than last year to expect higher industry revenue and prices.
* Own-company optimism rebounded, but remains relatively low.
* Revenue and capex expectations sit near three-year lows; hiring and earnings are among their nine-year lows.
* CFOs cite moving operations out of North America, and expansion rather than contraction in Europe, China, and “other Asia.”
* Contrary to a year ago, CFOs expect very low interest rates and 10-year bond yields; they again expect a strong US dollar.
* CFOs cite high pressure to act on climate change—mostly from their employees, customers, and boards; common actions
include increasing their efficiency of energy use, and including management of climate risk in governance processes.

---

*How do you regard the status of the North American, European, and Chinese economies?* Perceptions of North
America leveled off, with 69% of CFOs rating current conditions as good (68% last quarter), and 23% expecting better
conditions in a year (up from 15%). Perceptions of Europe rose, but only to 7% and 6%; China fell to 18% and 11%.

*What is your perception of the capital markets?*
Eighty-six percent of CFOs say debt financing is attractive. Equity
financing is considered attractive by 43% of public company CFOs and 26% of private company CFOs. Seventy-seven
percent say US equity markets are overvalued, up from 63%.

*Overall, what risks worry you the most?*
 CFOs express ongoing trade policy worries, with growing concern about political
turmoil, competition, consumer demand, and upcoming US elections. Internally, talent concerns continued, while concerns
around change, costs, and growth rose.

*Compared to three months ago, how do you feel about the financial prospects for your company?* The net
optimism index rose from last quarter’s -5 to +11 this quarter, but remains among the lowest levels in three years. Thirty
percent of CFOs express rising optimism (26% last quarter), and 19% express declining optimism (31% last quarter).

*What is your company’s business focus for the next year?* Although companies continue to focus mostly on growth and
investment, their growing focus on cost reduction and returning cash (multi-year highs) may suggest growing defensiveness
in anticipation of a downturn.

*How do you expect your key operating metrics to change over the next 12 months?* YOY revenue growth
expectations slid from 4.3% to 3.7% (three-year low). Earnings rose from 5.6% to 6.0% (but still second-lowest in nine
years); capital spending edged up from 3.6% to 3.7% (still near its three-year low). Hiring fell from 1.6% to 1.1% (second-
lowest in six years). Dividend growth rose from 3.9% to 4.3%.

*What are your economic expectations for 2020?* A minority of CFOs expect improvement in the US, Canadian, and
Mexican economies; expectations for consumer and business spending declined sharply, and those for labor costs rose.

*What are the prospects for a US downturn and has your company taken defensive action?* Ninety-seven percent of CFOs say a downturn has already begun or will next year; compared to 1Q19, companies appear to be taking more defensive action—especially around spending and headcount.

*What are your expectations for the capital markets in 2020?*  
Contrary to this time last year, CFOs expect very low interest rates and 10-year bond yields for the next calendar year; they again expect a strong US dollar.

*What are your expectations for your company in 2020?*  
Compared to last year, CFOs are less likely to expect industry
revenue and prices to rise; they are mostly unlikely to make major changes to their strategy due to downturn expectations
or upcoming US elections.

*Compared to three years ago, how has your company adjusted its geographic focus?*  
CFOs cite a higher focus on US, European, Chinese, and other Asian markets, and expansion of capacity/operations in the latter three regions.

*Are you getting pressure from stakeholders to act on climate change?* More than 70% of CFOs say their company is
under at least moderate pressure to act on climate change from at least one stakeholder group; the average is 2.5 groups.
Is your company taking action in response to climate change? More than 90% of CFOs say their company has taken
at least one action in response to climate change, with the average CFO reporting nearly four.

*Does your company have greenhouse gas reduction targets?* Overall, 44% of all responding CFOs (52% of those who
know their status) say their company already has or is working on greenhouse gas reduction targets.",finance

personalfinance,Should I Refinance Student Loans?,"I currently have about $40k in Federal student loans. My current monthly payment to pay it off in 5 years is $755/month. It's split up between nine loans having an average interest rate of 5.83%. Over the next 5 years, I will effectively pay $6100.38 worth of interest.

I looked into refinancing for kicks, and I can get a new loan for the full amount at 4.15% for seven years. The minimum monthly payment would drop to $554.28, and I would pay $6119.46 in interest. If I added extra payments to total the current $755/month I am paying on the federal loans, I could pay it off in 5 years and save around $1970 over the life of the loan.

It's very tempting for me to refinance to the lower monthly payment and take the extra 2 years of reduced payments for the same effective cost. I know it's not what would get me out of debt the fastest, but it would take a little bit of stress off of me having such a high monthly payment. I currently pay more on the student loan in months that I can afford to, but I mostly pay the minimum. The only federal loan perk that I would really miss would be hardship deferral, but I have a good job in a good industry, so I'm not too worried about losing my job at the moment.

I'm not entirely sure how much it would impact my credit. I know the hard pull would be negligible, but my age of accounts would go from 5 years, 10 months down to just over 2 years.

ethereum,Organizational authorization forms - can ETH/private ETH fork improve accountability for internal business processes?,"Say a form requires 6 signatures in order to complete the process. Let’s say the process, when complete, on-boards an employee into the organization’s system as an employee.

At the bottom of the form, it states that it requires 6 signatures to “*complete the transaction*.” Transaction? Hm. This got me thinking about the lack of accountability in how documents are processed in this org. **It’s all paper-based.** 6 signatures. See where something can go wrong somewhere in there? It goes to multiple different departments before those 6 sigs are on it.

Something I’ve already considered bringing up to management/directors is the idea of tying employee ID’s to (most likely) a private blockchain with public keys mapped to employee ID’s. There are other, more open plays that can be done with a blockchain-based ID system in this org too, but I’m currently most interested in utilizing this tech to improve accountability within the org I operate in. 

My org claims moving to a digital document management system to manage authorization forms is too expensive...we interact with tax payer money - state and federal. I want more transparency if my signature is on those authorization forms. Weak, highly exploitable system IMO.

I know DocuSign has an ETH integration, but my org claims DocuSign is too expensive of a solution. I’m also unsure how the Ethereum integration plays into their document signing product. Either way, it’s not an option right now.

Is blockchain a logical solution for document signing/processing in an org like this? Are there any operational products like this yet?  Are there any projects in the works? Is Consensys potentially incubating an enterprise tool like this? Devs - can you imagine how a system like this might be designed?

Form info:
- Employee profile info
- Employment classification info 
- Position info (pay/title/etc)
- Department/Manager
- Signatures (6, including employee) authorizing all of this info is correct

I understand this would likely have various components and is sort of a crapshoot, but the Ethereum community has always been insightful/helpful and would love to hear your thoughts about this post.

Edit: this org is on quite a few acres with many departments/divisions. **Is it possible to create a system that requires consensus in a way that makes the network Administrator powerless?** Would be interesting if there was a sort of blockchain/private IPFS system where the documents would reside and only certain employees have access. If a doc changes, it’s uploaded to IPFS and the process starts over - signers would be required to re-sign the new form.

Is something like this destined to fail? Does the network admin always end up being the last point of failure within administrative systems like this?

Since taxpayer funds are involved, I’m looking at this from the system exploit angle. Who says a Network Administrator can’t be paid off? You know? I want to do my part to tighten up accountability around how citizen funds are deployed. Seeing a lot of waste and it makes me sick.",cryptocurrency

technology,I'm going to be a trucker and the discussion around automation is frustrating.,"Airline pilots have autopilot and auto land.
Cashiers work side by side with auto check out. Soon enough even complex jobs such as accounting and law will be on the chopping block. It's no longer a question of which industry can't be automated, but which will have more years unchanged by automation.

I'd argue that self driving cars and the automation tech involved is ringing in everyones years because people can relate to transportation much more than a job in air travel, retail, law, and finance. Perhaps a lot of you work or have worked in retail and do hear about more automation coming to grocery stores etc like how Amazon is doing it with their relatively unstaffed stores concept. But I'd argue that the volume of self driving news does not equate to a higher chance of impending automation even within the next decade. I've done a fair amount of googling and conversing and what truck driving may become is a semi autonomous system that still includes a driver as to limit liability at the source, otherwise, why aren't we flying planes and driving trains without their pilots and conductors yet? 

Furthermore, trucking and logistics LEVEL 5 (full self driving- no human intervention) automation is possible don't get me wrong but if it were to be implemented these driving systems would most likely be working in conjunction with non self driving cars where as planes would be able to sore through mostly empty space without their own pilots- but would you step on board that plane? And would you drive on the roads knowing there isn't so much as a human inside a vehcile?!

personalfinance,"Just took a new job with a salary that is $5000 higher, but my first check seems to be taxed disproportionately higher compared to my previous job (MIC).","I just took a new job, and I went from making $60,000 annually to $65,000.  Both jobs pay quarterly commissions, and each pay bi-weekly, however I started my new job on 12/23/19, and I haven't received a commission check yet.  

I just received my pay stub for my first paycheck that is coming tomorrow, and I am getting paid for my first 3 weeks of work.  The amount of federal taxes that are being taken out for 3 weeks of work are more than double what were normally taken out at my last job for 2 weeks of work.  Surely making only $192 more every pay period wouldn't cause my federal taxes to go up that much, right? Am I being taxed disproportionately because I have 120 hours on one paycheck?",finance

investing,How good/bad of an idea is using margin in this way?,"Making up some semi-random numbers here to illustrate my idea:

Let’s say you already have a reasonably sized emergency fund in cash set aside and are relatively young (in your 20s) so you have a long time horizon. Every paycheck (2 weeks) you can afford to set aside $700 just for long-term investing (~$18,000/year). Because of these circumstances you decide you want to take on a little extra risk

Because you know time in the market beats pretty much any other strategy and since you know you’ll be saving $18,000/year, you decide to take out a margin loan at 5% interest for that amount on Jan 1st. That entire $18,000 will then be invested, all at once on Jan 1st, in a good index fund or ETF (such as the S&amp;P 500) regardless of if the market is high or low at that time.

Every paycheck you get every 2 weeks you then deposit your $700 into your account and instead of “investing” it, it instead gets used to “pay off” the margin loan. Since you’re paying off the loan incrementally throughout the year in equal amounts you’re effective interest rate at the end of the year on the full $18,000 turns out to be just 2.5%

If you do this year in and year out, the market is expected to provide a return of 7% average after inflation. Normally you won’t see the full 7% return on the money invested that year since your contributions will be spread out throughout the year, but with this method you do get the full 7% minus 2.5% interest for a net 5% gain

Yes, there is an element of risk to it (margin calls, losing your job, etc) but likewise the ROI is higher. There are also ways to mitigate risk too (not using the full margin amount available, being conservative in the amount you can expect to invest per year, etc). 

My line of thinking is that if using leverage in real estate investing (via a mortgage) is accepted, commonly used, and considered a great way to build wealth, why not do the same with stocks?

personalfinance,"Refinanced mortgage at the same lender, the escrow is now gone.","Hello, 

Thank you in advance for your help. My partner and I recently refinanced our mortgage. We went through the same lender and me being naive I thought the existing escrow account would simply transfer over to our new mortgage. At closing we inquired about the escrow and the title company said ask your lender, so the later that day we sent an email to the loan specialist at the bank. She said that we must have missed the checkbox on setting up an escrow account with the new mortgage and if we want to set up one contact the a different department at the bank.  Okay, no problem. We contact them, and tell them we want to set it up, they respond with okay no problem we will send the documents for that (by mail) as soon as the loan is processed in their system, will take a week or so. 

So about a week later my partner inquires with the escrow department and discovers that the money that accumulated in our previous account was applied to the principle of the loan and we would have to pay this years taxes ($6,200) out of pocket.  I have gone through our closing documents and have not found anywhere where it says the escrow account will be applied to the principle.

We asked them what our options are, in hopes of them fixing this and refunding the escrow account. Their response was we could either take out a Personal Loan minimum interest rate was 5.9%, or take out a home equity line of credit.

This bothered me. 

Final piece of the puzzle, in order to set up a ""New"" escrow account they want us to put down a deposit of $2400 and it must be received before 2/1, in order to to ""avoid overdrawing out account"".

TLDR: Refinanced, bank applied escrow balance to the principle, told us we have to pay our taxes out of pocket, and in order to set up a new escrow account, we need to make a large deposit.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Advice on how to financially finish my degree,"Hi Reddit I’m in a tough spot right now. I am 60 credits into a degree after starting at community college and have finished all of my general education requirements to start classes for my degree. I initially paid for these semester by taking out small loans through FASFA, a small amount of aid based off my mothers income, and by working full time. I then moved to another city to finish school last semester. 
Upon moving my mother agreed to take out a loan to pay for part of this year because I could not get any loans that would fully cover my tuition on my own through the federal government and couldn’t qualify credit wise for private loans. 
Mid semester my mother decided she didn’t want to take the loan out for me anymore, (that I would be paying back myself) and cancelled it without telling anyone. I was just this week informed by my school and have a hold on my account and cannot change my class schedule. I have two classes I need to drop and two I need to pick up and am unable to so because my student accounts frozen now that I owe last falls tuition.
I am now unsure what to do because school starts this month and I can’t qualify for any private loans. Even if I would find one of the few companies I haven’t yet tried, I’m afraid I wouldn’t get the money fast enough to enroll this semester. I have exhausted university scholarships options and I can’t pay 13,000 through working alone. Are there any other options so I can stay in school and finish my degree? Or should I just leave my degree behind unenroll and work to pay off the 10,000 or less I have currently already taken out?",finance

I'm in school! I enrolled in my local community college, and the only advice I really have for others in the same boat is persistence. I started in April by filling out my FAFSA; from there the only thing I did was check in with the school every other week (at minimum) to ask them what they need from me, fill out papers, provide documents, pay miscellaneous fees, etc. I'm getting some federal financial aid and a small, federally-subsidized loan to help with tuition, but I'm also working full-time (not at Walmart - yay!).

Winter Quarter has just started; I performed well in the fall and I'm optimistic about this quarter as well. The plan is to obtain a degree in business, and use that along with my past experience in retail to leverage a loan so I can open up a convenience store. When that day comes, I'm sure I'll be back here asking you all for advice. If the store pays off, I'm also interested in entrepreneurial ventures in other industries besides retail. And from there, who knows?

investing,2020 Psychedelic Industry Insights Report,"By: Nikita Alexandrov BChem, MBA - CTO, [ThinkMyco](http://www.thinkmyco.com)

Jan 8th, 2020

**2019** was a pivotal year in the  psychedelic industry with US decriminalization actions, two companies  receiving FDA breakthrough status for psilocybin, funding of the **$16M** Johns Hopkins Psychedelic Research Center, The US Defence Department starting their rumored **$20M+**  Focused Pharma psychedelic science program and the movement of top  universities into research and clinical trials. With the explosion of  the more than **$100M** dollars worth of investable psychedelic opportunities in **Q3 2019**, the collapse of high quality cannabis investments, one of the best Decembers on record and a potential **$1B** scale psychedelic IPO - **2020** will be the year of psychedelic investment.

The movement in the field recently is just a blip compared to what  is to come, this industry has been brewing for the last few decades. Big  Pharma has failed when it comes to new approaches to brain and central  nervous system treatment. Due to poor understanding of mechanisms,  complex clinical trials and systematic side effects, Neuro drugs have  half the success rate of all Pharma projects, which caused most of the  big players to reduce or cut their Neuro programs in the last decades.  Recently, engagement is exploding with new clinical legislature  supporting Neuro and the recent approval of 3 potentially blockbuster  Neuro drugs in the last 2 years,

**Q2 2019** saw a record of over **$320M**  in investment into Neuro drug development. Interestingly enough an  influential group of ultra-high net worth individuals including PayPal founder Peter Thiel funded the psychedelic holding company Atai Lifesciences which went on to fund Compass Pathways and continues to fund commercial efforts in this field. Atai Lifesciences  recent movements are a familiar story of acquisition and consolidation  in an emerging market which will be a common theme in the future of the  psychedelic industry. In **2019** Atai Lifesciences acquired Perception Neuroscience and GABA Therapeutics for their next generation tranquillisers. Last week, Atai also acquired NeuroNasal, a non-psychedelic company creating a concussion nasal spray. In partnership with pharma, Atai's recent launch of EntheogeniX,  an AI based psychedelic drug discovery platform, shows that Atai is  serious about making investments into the fundamental research required  to continue being an industry leader in the long-term. It is rumoured  that Atai has made a number of cash investments recently, so new  partnerships and acquisitions should be expected in the next months.

The collapse of investable cannabis opportunities are driving  investors comfortable in stigmatised industries and binary risk to the  table with big pharma, cutting edge science and huge unmet market needs  to create a perfect storm of opportunity.

**How big is the Psychedelics Industry?**

Historically, the psychedelics industry has been fragmented with around **$60M** worth of companies in the last 20 years, many of which were not sustainable. The current industry is around **$220M+** worth of investments, dominated by the Peter Thiel backed Atia Lifesciences at **$100M+** and Compass Pathways at **$50M+**, followed by Mind Medicine at **$10M+**, Fieldtrip Ventures at **$10M+** and then a 10-25 early companies in the range of **$2.5-10M** each. The **$220M+ worth of investable deals** have only existed since the public formation of Compass Pathways in **2016**, with the majority leaving stealth mode in **2019**.

**How big is the Psychedelics Market?**

The psychedelics market is emerging while highly coupled to  clinical/regulatory events and is split between recreational and medical  psychedelic markets:

**Recreational: $8-19.2B**

Calculated from cannabis market and comparable usage prevalence as well as demand size economics.

**Medical: $373B+**

Calculated from the main markets addressable by psychedelic  therapeutics (neurogenics market): mental health drugs, therapy  spending, neurodegeneration drugs and cognitive enhancement.

Emerging Players - There are a number of emerging players, around **$35M+** in emerging deals in **Q3 2019** which have not passed due diligence.

**Clinical:**

Recent data is showing psychedelics can be real mega blockbuster Neuro drugs. Johns Hopkins recent trial on Psilocybin for smoking cessation showed an **80%**  success rate in terminating nicotine addiction, more than double any  known therapeutic approach, including nicotine replacement therapy. This  is showing addiction can be treated with new mechanisms that are much  more low level than replacing the drug in the receptor. Academic data  unequivocally shows that Ibogaine is **95%**  successful in terminating acute opioid withdrawal symptoms permanently  from a single dosage. Limited data from long-term Ibogaine for opioid  addiction trials show **50%** success rates in terminating addiction in the 6 month period with a single dosage, more than **10X** higher than the generous **5%**  success rate of other approaches in the 6 month period. Data from  leading Ibogaine providers like Universal Ibogaine show that this **50%** figure can be pushed closer to **75%** with proper protocols and aftercare. Clinical trials on Psilocybin for cocaine/crack addiction are ongoing at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, a top 20 medical research university. 10 patients were un-blinded for bioethics review and the unpublished data shows that **30%** never touched crack again while the other **70%** had a relapse or two and turned their lives around, showing a **100%**  success rate in changing lives with minimal cost. When this data is  available publicly in the next years, tidal waves of interest will move  into the field.

**Projections:**

As a recreational market, **0.1%** of the population was surveyed as using psychedelics in the last month, placing the current black market at **$19.1B** while as a comparable percentage of the legal cannabis market adjusted for prevalence would place it at **$8B**.

As a medical market, the **$373B**  neurogenics market seems to be the addressable market. Penetration into  any indication in the neurogenics market would reap vast rewards.  Psilocybin is on track to compete in the depression market with two FDA  breakthrough designations, a **2%** penetration into the depression market would being **$1.4B+** in value yearly. Ibogaine's very reasonable projected **5%** penetration into the opioid dependence market in the next 10 years will bring **$9.6B+**  in value yearly to groups like Universal Ibogaine which are deploying  clinical infrastructure, supporting clinical trials and controlling the  Ibogaine supply chain. Of all of the indications in current psychedelic  clinical trials, not considering crossover, they address a **$400B+** market, with projected penetrations across each indication and adjustments for market factors, it is projected **$16B+** of value yearly will be created from commercialisation of the current late stage clinical trials which are in progress.

**Challenges:**

**Regulatory Challenges:**

While nearly 100 cities are creating legislation to decriminalize  psychedelics and multiple US jurisdictions have passed  decriminalization, federal changes will be required to open legal  markets to the full potential. While investing in the binary risk of  regulatory changes is standard in the junior markets, current regulatory  controls are preventing early revenues. Many Canadian companies  building production and distribution infrastructure offshore in  jurisdictions such as Jamaica are operating in a legal grey area. While  it is legal in Jamaica, any benefit or advantage given to a Canadian  company could be considered a proceed of crime including IP development,  capital repatriation and validation of technology offshore. Section 56  exemptions from Health Canada are required for Canadian companies  working with psychedelics offshore and companies which are raising  investment dollars without a secured Section 56 exemption may be  incurring legal risk.

**Cardiac Liability:**

The unspoken elephant in the room of psychedelic derived  pharmaceutical acceptance is not regulation, for example Ketamine is a  scheduled drug which was recently approved for the general market. The  problem is actually the liability of bringing a seratonergic based drug  to the market like Psilocybin, DMT and LSD. The crippling withdrawal of  blockbuster drug Fen-Phen and issues with other drugs like Imitrex due  to seratonin agonist effects on the heart have scared the FDA into a  position that any seratonergic drug will require extreme cooperation and  diligence and will absolutely incur additional clinical and monitoring  costs over other drugs. Psilocybin while technically hitting the 5ht2b  receptor which causes cardiac side effects, does not have a high enough  affinity to be a deal-breaker, meanwhile LSD having a very high affinity  will cause large barriers for groups attempting to bring microdosed LSD  to the market. Ibogaine suffers from cardiac liability due to an  entirely different mechanism and unlike Psilocybin or LSD, adverse  events have been reported. While Methadone and other standards of care  also have the same long-QT cardiac liability at much higher rates and  significantly higher mortality rates , Ibogaine clinical models must  pre-screen patients for existing heart defects before procedures to  guarantee no adverse side effects.

**Banking/Insurance/Exchange Issues:**

Legitimate psychedelic derived drug development companies have  already had bank accounts halted at multiple banks for involvement in  this industry and moving forward similar challenges faced by the  cannabis industry should be expected. Exchanges and public offerings  will have logistic challenges with this industry and minor friction has  already been seen in the listing process. DNO insurance and other  underwriting will be required to list in large markets and to date no  psychedelic company has been underwritten, although underwriters and  leading insurance brokers are actively exploring his industry.

**Reimbursement:**

The real whale will be insurance and single payer reimbursement of  psychedelic derived pharmaceuticals on the market, allowing for global  market uptake. Health systems have traditionally been decades behind the  state of the art as seen in the point of care and home diagnostic  device market, a market which could keep people healthy at minimal cost  but has been crippled by lack of reimbursement.

**Supply Chain Commoditization:**

The production and control of psychedelic supply chains which is  the familiar play of the cannabis industry will be a race to the bottom  with magic mushrooms and other psychedelics. Production models are  competing with a much more fluid black market and are being cannibalized  by low cost home production and wildcrafting of psilocybin mushrooms.  The LSD or ergoloid supply chain is highly monopolized, with the  majority of the worlds ergoloids being produced in a single location.  Companies competing in the production and supply chain space will face  heavy price pressure and a highly coupled global regulatory system. The  single outlier is Ibogaine, with a current global use estimated around **90kg**, expected to reach **280kg**  in the next few years, this is a commodity whose price will drive  through the roof. Large ibogaine producers have stopped production and  natural sources are not commercially viable, with an Iboga plant  producing maybe a single dose on the 10 year period, the move of  Ibogaine to endangered status in **2019**  and no synthetic GMP producers - the Ibogaine market is legal in the  majority of the world and exploding while highly underserved and  fragmented.

**Delivery System Challenges:**

A number of recent psychedelic deals are built around new drug  delivery systems for psychedelics entering the recreational market to  build expertise and infrastructure ready to move into the pharmaceutical  market. Many of these technological approaches will not translate from  the recreational market to the pharmaceutical market such as  CBD/psychedelic compositions, natural product compositions as well as  vaporizer and inhaler based delivery systems. While **20%+**  of all new FDA drug entities are derived from natural products, natural  product mixtures containing many products and a controlled substance  have never and will never be FDA approved due to the regulatory system.  Companies developing Psilocybin/CBD combinations and related  therapeutics for the recreational market should understand that unlike  the cannabis market, recreational approaches will not translate directly  to medical approaches.

**Opportunities:**

**Syndicated Investments:**

One of the largest opportunities in any emerging market is syndicated investment, a **2002**  analysis of 584 venture backed exits showed that syndicated investments  produced double the rate of return of non-syndicated investments.  Psychedelic research and development companies require standardized  infrastructure that can be leveraged across a number of players. The big  players entering the industry are more interested in empire building,  requiring massive consolidations of commercial efforts which can be  facilitated by syndicated investment groups. Companies like ThinkMyco, Entheogen Biosciences and Cybin Corporation  which focus on technology development, IP Portfolios and early stage  drug discovery will benefit the most from syndicated investment and  collaboration. A Harvard Business School  review of Pharma discovery programs statistically compared drug  discovery programs to weapons research programs and found in these high  reward/low incremental cost programs the optimal path is to run parallel  programs, with an average Pharma drug discovery program having 16  parallel programs, 10 core and 6 low budget/high risk. At the current  moment, around 5-10 psychedelic investment funds are forming in the  range of **$10-50M** each, including the Cannacord Genuity backed Entheos and the **$20M** psychedelic quant fund Tabula Rasa Ventures.

**IP Portfolio Development:**

IP development is the highest value for dollar on the investment  value chain and the psychedelic industry will be a totally IP driven  industry. The most valuable patent portfolios will include new  psychedelic compositions and therapeutic mechanisms, which require  significant investments into fundamental R+D, while less competitive  portfolios will include delivery system/psychedelic combinations.A  recent review of patents related to psychedelics shows many hundreds of  patents for psychedelic derived therapeutics with only a small  cross-section being commercially competitive. DemeRX, the **$40M+** Ibogaine research company holds 65+ patents in the ibogaine therapeutic area. While DemeRX  filed for bankruptcy and their research and development assets were  liquidated, it is rumored they have been injected with enough capital to  come back to the party - this is a dark horse to keep an eye out for.

**Mushroom/Protein Connection:**

The real opportunity in magic mushroom production models is flying  under the radar: protein production. Mushrooms are one of the highest  quality sources of nutrition and protein, if you took a vitamin C  supplement you can live exclusively off mushrooms. Dried mushrooms have  basically the same protein percentage as beef and in terms of grams of  protein per acre per year are **100**  fold higher producers and much more sustainable than traditional  agricultural practices. Companies in this space which invest into real  R+D for lower cost mushroom production will get a lift from the **$1.8+** trillion dollar protein market. A recent review of mid-sized mushroom farms shows that **50%+**  of the cost of mushroom production is due to labor and technical  inefficiencies. If energy, labor and materials cost drivers can be  reduced, and the cost of growing a pound of mushrooms can drop from  around **$2** to around **$0.75**  through automation, mushroom protein becomes significantly more  commercially competitive than many of the industry leaders in plant  based protein like pea protein. If energy cost reductions can drop the  cost even further, mushrooms will become a disruptive food source.  Psychedelic companies building mushroom production infrastructure will  be well served to remember that by investing in automation, new  technology and new growing systems the price of mushroom based protein  production can make it more competitive than any other food source. The  largest food security report in history was released **Q2 2019** and showed that without subsidies a hamburger would cost more than **30$** and the meat industry will economically collapse by **2040**, the protein game is looking more and more attractive as a hedge against the regulatory risk of magic mushroom production.

**China:**

China is one of the most advanced markets in terms of size and  pharma spending, as well as venture investment. Traditionally the Asian  cultures had no interest in marginalized and politically tense areas  such as drug medicalization but the movement into CBD and China's rabid  interest in plant medicines may create a large influx of Asian capital  moving into psychedelics. This industry shifting action will be  leveraged by education and the court of public opinion. A dialog must be  created showing psilocybin as a plant medicine and not a drug of abuse.  Interestingly enough, Chinese firms have very recently started  producing magic mushrooms industrially and importing them into the  Canadian market where they are sold into the black market  over-the-counter in some Canadian herbalist stores.

**Ibogaine:**

Ibogaine is the only psychedelic model which will not be very  quickly commoditized. Ibogaine as a solution to the opioid problem is a  disruptive technology, with the rise of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs  like carfentanil dominating global supply chains, Buprenorphine, the  preferred standard of care is no longer effective and produces a life  threatening condition called Precipitated Withdrawal. This is due to the  aggressive affinity of fentanyl to receptors, the lack of tolerance  ceiling and the little understood metabolism of next-generation fentanyl  analogues, dramatically compounding a problem already at pandemic  levels. Ibogaine supply chains have collapsed at the same time that  demand is growing exponentially, the firm which dominates the current  global ibogaine supply chain will reap around **$1.4M/mo** profit serving the current global demand. One of the largest African Ibogaine brokers has seen a **30x** increase in sales from **2017** to **2019**.  With Universal Ibogaine taking Ibogaine through the Canadian clinical  process and the grassroots support from Health Canada, Ibogaine will be  the first psychedelic approach available to consumers. While Ibogaine is  a scheduled drug in the US and some European jurisdictions, it is not  scheduled in Canada and the majority of the global market. Multiple  Ibogaine documentaries are in filming, including actors such as Johnny Depp, as this is an education driven industry, we should expect exponential growth to accelerate in **2020**.

**Support Industries:**

Industries supporting the growth of psychedelics will be a large  part of the future landscape as was seen in the cannabis sector. A  psychedelic business support network including education, conferences,  business analysis and financing have already cropped up commercially. In  **Q3 2019** the renowned Cambridge House International Extraordinary Future  conference created a panel for psychedelic opportunities. Two weeks  before the conference there was a frantic rush and the majority of  relevant psychedelic players were represented last minute in the panel  discussion including: Compass Pathways, FieldTrip Ventures, Mind Medicine, Johns Hopkins, Dennis McKenna and ThinkMyco.  Multiple psychedelic investment funds are forming alongside of industry  press, consulting groups and other support interests. In **Q3 2019**, Dr. Matthew Thompson of Johns Hopkins and Dr. Charles Nichols of LSU/Eleusis Benefit Corporation helped organize the inaugural conference for the new journal called International Society for Research on Psychedelics  in its home of New Orleans. Over 100 international scientists from top  universities were represented, with the conference having to turn down  many late registrations. Dr. Rolland Griffiths, head of the Johns Hopkins Psychedelic Research Center said ""This was the best scientific conference I have been to in my entire career."".

**Sub-perceptual dosing:**

Microdosing was popularized by Silicon Valley, catalyzing the  resurgence of the psychedelic industry but microdosing is a protocol  built on unsound fundamentals. Research shows that the therapeutic  effects of psychedelics are highly dose dependant, higher doses lead to  better therapeutic effects. The microdosing supply chain model has  excellent returns, with a pound of mushrooms costing less than **5$/lb** to produce which provides around **1200X**  microdoses. When dosages increase past the perceptual threshold, the  potential for adverse events such as bad trips exponentially increases.  The ideal dosage seems to be just under perceptual threshold where you  can still go about your day, but much higher than a microdose. This is  industry standard with seratonergic pharmaceuticals, an example being  the diet drug Belvique, which is closely related to psilocybin, dosed at  the perceptual threshold for maximum effectiveness. Belvique can cause  psilocybin like hallucinations if 4 tablets are taken as it is a  seratonergic drug. High doses of psilocybin require a clinical  infrastructure and in-patient experience, dramatically increasing costs  and logistics overheads. Sub-perceptual dosed pharmaceuticals will be  available for out-patient and take home treatment and in many cases may  be as effective as full blown psychedelic experiences. Mind Medicine, ThinkMyco and Eleusis Benefit Corporation are leading the charge in sub-perceptual therapeutics.

**Next Generation Drug Development:**

Mind Medicine is taking  the approach of engineering the hallucinations out of the therapeutic  experience by removing parts of the molecule and are moving their drug,  18-MC through the clinical process. This is the ultimate high risk/high  reward play in the psychedelic industry. 18-MC is modified which also  changes a variety of important receptor binding effects. The modified  receptors include the receptors responsible for neural growth factor  release, cognitive effects, cardiac effects and the opioid system  coupled NMDA receptor system. Since there is no data on the human use of  18-MC in opioid addicts, significant capital must be deployed before it  is even known if 18-MC is as efficient as the parent molecule Ibogaine  for treating opioid addiction, the ability to treat addiction in an  out-patient setting with no cardiac toxicity - 18-MC will be the  megablockbuster all investors in the neurogenic space are waiting for. ThinkMyco, Gilgamesh Pharmaceuticals, Mind Medicine and Eleusis Benefit Corporation are leading the field in next generation drug development.

**Lateral Drug Development:**

While psychedelics address a $373B neurogenics market, companies such as Eleusis Benefit Corporation  are showing they can address other unmet clinical needs such as chronic  inflammatory disease. Eleusis is developing new psychedelic compounds  for the treatment of inflammation, specifically within ophthalmology,  and has recently published Phase I trial results revealing the safety  and tolerability of low dose LSD in healthy older adults, with the  intention of evaluating low dose LSD as a disease modifying therapy in  Alzheimer's disease. Eleusis Benefit Corporation looks poised to cannibalize the **$3B**  steroid therapeutic market. Not yet published research is showing  Ibogaines potential as a therapeutic to treat sleep disorders. Johns Hopkins is currently reviewing the application of psychedelics in pulling patients from comas and vegetative states. The original pre-Mind Medicine  clinical trials on the Ibogaine derivative 18-MC showed promise in  treating Leishmania infection. BOL148, an inactive form of LSD,  originally the placebo in human clinical LSD research, was found to in  some cases to permanently terminate cluster headaches after a few doses  and is being publicly demanded from the cluster headache community.  These are the earliest days of understanding the application of  psychedelic derived chemistry as new therapeutic approaches.

**Public Health Engagement:**

Looking at recently released data representing North American,  working class adults, methamphetamine and fentanyl use is growing  enormously and consistently. Linear regression of growth rates over the  last 5 years projects a **380%+** increase in Fentanyl usage the next 15 years, with Methamphetamine projected at a **475%+** increase. This is concerning as there are more than a million high quality data points over 5 years and an R2 value of **90%+**  which paints of picture of statistical certainty. This shows that the  opioid crisis has moved from a lift caused by supply side drivers to an  organically growing demand side driven pandemic, fueled secondarily by  histories cheapest and most available synthetic drugs. With Johnson and Johnson settling with two counties in Ohio, projections have placed the total at **$100B+**  in fines for the opioid crisis in the next few years. State  jurisdictions will shortly receive an enormous amount of cash that will  be legally obligated to flow into anti-addiction spending. Due to poor  outcomes and non-scalable approaches around advanced public health  programs, there will be a flurry of legislature to address how to spend  the **$100B+** anti-addiction warchest. Players like Universal Ibogaine  who have proven clinical models, can deploy infrastructure and  guarantee statistically better outcomes will receive unprecedented  amounts of non-dilutive government funding and will be the first to  benefit from Decriminalization/Medicalization in the North American  market. Players that can come to the table now at the state level and  propose medicalization legislature as well as profitable clinical  infrastructure with proven outcomes, could monopolize the entire US  market. FieldTrip Ventures is developing Psilocybin clinical infrastructure while Universal Ibogaine is deploying proven clinical infrastructure already developed and proven by Clear Sky Recovery, the leading Ibogaine clinical experts with thousands of successful detox procedures and no critical adverse events.

**Closing:**

Like any emerging industry, there are challenges and growing pains  but the blue-sky upside is unparalleled. ""Black swan events are  characterised by their extreme rarity, their severe impact, and the  practice of explaining widespread failure to predict them as simple  folly in hindsight."" Due to changes in public opinion, a mental health  and addiction pandemic as well as enormous movements of liquid cash,  this sector is poised to explode in **2020**.",finance
personalfinance,How to do HELOC Payments on 3-way Ownership,"Hello finance gurus!

Would like to unlock the value of the overvalued sitting pile of cash that is our condo in Toronto. One problem: 3 way ownership which means we are all going on title for a HELOC. For simplicity of this post we will call the 3 owners Suzy, Paul, and Ahmed - interest rate is 5%, HELOC size is 500k.

Suzy owns 70% of the property

Paul owns 25% of the property

Ahmed owns 5% of the property

&amp;#x200B;

We are in agreement to each only be able to use a congruent amount of the HELOC on the property based on our % ownerships - to which we set a contract within ourselves. How do we set payments to be done automatically depending on each users' use of their share, which varies to their discretion? AKA Suzy borrows 100k, Paul 10k, and Ahmed 0: over a year Suzy owes 5k interest, Paul $500 interest, and Ahmed $0 interest.

Most important criteria to our group: waste the least time possible doing manually entries.

Second most important criteria to our group: limit number of manual entries and calculations to remove risk of human error.

personalfinance,Is having a co-signer with a good credit history and significant net worth going to guarantee me a mortgage as a single?,"Ok so I'm looking to buy my first place soon. I have 80K saved in the bank, I'm looking to put about 30% down on a house around 250K, or about 40% for something like a nicer townhouse/condo.

The thing is, while I have a ton of money to put up front compared to most people buying their first home, I sadly don't have the best credit history. It's all due to silly little mistakes I make like forgetting I used my credit card for a $20 dollar online purchase a couple months ago, but I've never been in a situation where I'm truly in debt, I've always had more than enough money to pay my bills. I have most things set up to just be automatic so I don't keep doing this to myself, my credit is healing but the damage is done.

Another thing is the fact that I'm doing this solo, I don't have a spouse or girlfriend or anything, it's all me. Which honestly in the eyes of the lender makes me a bit more risky since I have nobody to fall back on if the bills become too tight. One reason why I kind of like the idea of a condo since the bank will have nearly half the property's value in security right off the bat, and strata fees add an element of security since they cover any essential repairs that could put me behind like roofing or needing a new furnace or something.

My parents told me that they will just co-sign on the mortgage if I have any trouble.  They have a very good credit history, they outright own their house which is worth 350K and have something like 100K in various savings/investments. My Mom wants to help put down on the place as well though we've not talked any real numbers, and I don't feel entirely comfortable allowing them to give me money when they've done a lot already.

Another thing I'm wondering, wouldn't it be a bad idea to try and get approval first without a co-signer? If I got one by myself I assume I wouldn't be getting the best interest rate than if I were piggybacking on their credit.

EDIT: As for income, I have a pretty good paying job working for the Government of Canada, been there about a year, my take home pay is about $2800 a month, the mortgage or mortgage+Strata will be about $1000-$1100",finance
personalfinance,Backdoor Roth at Vanguard - Issue with Distributions,"In 2019 and 2020, I've done a backdoor Roth conversion. First, created a Traditional Roth at Vanguard and deposited $6k into the account's Federal Money Market. Once it cleared, about 24-48 hours later, I would click ""convert to Roth"" and everything was seamless.

The issue I'm facing is that in both years, there's a small distribution (&lt;$1) that gets added to the Traditional IRA account because of the short period of time in the FMM account. This isn't a big deal to pay taxes on obviously, but it makes the form 8606 a little less straightforward to fill out.

personalfinance,How does income tax work when you're withdrawing from an IRA once you're retired?,"So I understand that the traditional IRA gets deferred on taxes until you're ready to withdraw after age 59.5 however I am confused about how you figure out the tax bracket.

Let's say you are retired and except for social security benefits and your IRA you have no other source of income, what tax bracket are you in? Is it based on how much you withdraw from the IRA? Let's say you only withdraw 12k so you're getting taxed 15% federally or is it calculated based on something else?
Also what if you also have money in an index fund and are withdrawing every year after 59.5 and does this income get added to your IRA withdrawal to make a total taxable income? Or only the index fund money is getting taxed?
I've been trying to look everywhere but it does not say how it actually all adds up in the end when you're ready to take money out, only that it will depend on your bracket, but what creates the bracket?
Thank you.",finance

gaming,Remakes are getting out of hand,"OK here's my real rant on remakes, the last post made was mean to be satirical tbh:  


As much as I am a fan of Pokemon, Doom, Yugioh, Batman and more, a remake of a game should not be in the works. I respect Mystery Dungeon, I respect Red Version. I never played MD cause I wasn't a fan of the idea. However, we need to address the issue with Pokemon Red version. I get it, it's the first MAJOR Pokemon game made. That's awesome! But at the same time, how many times can you replay the game? How many times can you go to Lavender town and watch Cubone's mom get taken away? How many times can you catch a Snorlax blocking Rock Tunnel? How many times do you need to catch Mewtwo before it gets old?   


I'm not saying the game is bad, I'm saying that remaking the same game so many times gets old. Red version, Fire Red, Red version with an update on the 3DS to add in the ""link Cable"" feature and then 3D Red Version called ""Let's Go!"" which was not bad but lacked a lot of basic shit like actual battles. The game was crappy.   


Are they catering to children or to millennial nostalgia? People here say it's for the kids. They say, ""Nintendo wants the kids to experience what we did as children."" \[and\] I respect that. I would love for a 10-year-old today to have the same joy I did when I was playing Red version but they don't need to play the same game. Continue the storyline.   


Prime example I can use -   
Yugioh has been out almost as long as Pokemon. Yet, instead of using the same main character over and over and making him start from scratch, they say, ""Hey, let's make a kid go to school."" ""Let's have them ride autopilot bikes in a circle,"" ""Let's have them be a circus act,"" It goes on from there, I don't remember after zexal, was it vrain? IDR. I was watching Vrains and got bored. But at least they continued the idea without using the same person over and over and made him hit the hard restart. Hell, even Ash's Pikachu gets nerfed every region. If he just kept his Pikachu as strong as he was the last region, there's no way he'd lose a battle at that point. 

&amp;#x200B;

Skyrim is just as bad and so is Batman Arkham, has Asylum had this treatment the most? At least when the did ToeJam and Earl they just continued the story right? I think? Remakes aren't all bad, don't get me wrong. I'm saying when a game is remade to death. If a game hasn't been out in almost 20 years, sure go for it! 007 GoldenEye doesn't have a remake I think, if so correct me.   


My point is that I don't care about remakes, I care about the amount of remakes it makes.",technology

personalfinance,Helping a friend out that got into a nasty auto loan - any options?,"One of my good friends recently had some auto issues, and decided it was time to find a newer car.  He had some negative equity ($2100) that he rolled into the lightly used 2017 Nissan Versa, which he purchased at about $12,000, for a total loan of $14,000. We got around to talking cars recently and I asked how much he pays per month for a used Versa, since he seemed to imply it was ""crazy for a Versa"".  He pays $339 a month.  Of course, I respond ""well at least you'll have it paid off in 4 years"".

Nope.  It's a 72 month loan at $339/month for a used Versa.  17.9% APR.   Of course, I'm blown away by the interest rate and why he would ever agree to anything that outrageous.  Turns out, hes atrocious with finances, and just assumes that's what a regular rate is on an auto loan.

His credit score was equally atrocious when he bought the car, turns out.  540.  Sure, it isn't in the 300s, but it's still solidly subprime.  He's been better with finances over the past year or so, and has managed to increase his credit score to about 650.  Of course, he's completely underwater in the loan - his car is only worth about $6k, and he's only paid off about $1500 off the principle in about $3500 of payments, and still owes about $13k.

I've told him to apply for refinancing at his bank, but of course I'm skeptical anyone will refinance the loan when he owes double what the car is worth.  I've also warned him that it's possible that the only way he gets out of this is by attacking his loan with every single penny he can find under his couch cushions and hope to get out from under the loan over the course of a year or so.

Does he have a hope or prayer of refinancing? His credit score is, while not spectacular, markedly better than it was when he took on the crippling interest rate. Or is this just a $10,000 lesson to not use online car shopping companies?",finance

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-the-formula-for-paying-no-federal-income-taxes-on-100000-a-year-2019-11-22

Let's say a married couple has $1.3 million or more in stocks, earning at least 8% annually. Or for the sake of discussion let's say they have enough invested capital to earn a steady $104,000 or more every year from long term capital gains and qualified dividends.

If they have no other income, the article seems to say they can pull out up to $103,150 in long term realized gains and qualified dividends each year to live on, and pay NO federal income taxes (and no income taxes at all if in a state with no state income tax.)

Is this true?  It feels too good to be true.  If it is true, it seems like a really amazing financial goal to aim for.

It would seem the vast majority of people who saved for retirement wouldn't have to pay any taxes in their retirement years due to this (I imagine most retired couples live off less than $100k after tax income per year).

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,Debt Collectors - How Far Can They Go - Loved Ones,"Two years ago my father decided to become a franchisee of a small chain restaurant here in Washington D.C. The restaurant did not go as well as he had hoped and had to take out a Small Business Loan. The Small Business Loan I believe had an absurd Interest Rate (maybe 36% if I recall). My family had to sell their house in order to pay off some bills but the total number of loans paid down is unknown to me.

Here's the part of this story where I come in. I had to pay the restaurant's rent for one month a few years ago as my father was obviously in a tough spot. I gave him a $12,000 check for the rent and asked that he pay me back when he could. Following the sale of the house my father paid me back $9,000 of the rent via check noting the rest would come. The other day my brother, who also helped out with bill payment, noticed $5,000 taken out of his account by the Bank and it seems that the Business Loan provider (who was NOT the Bank) seemed to collect it from accounts tied to my Father.

How far can lenders go to take money that I guess is owed to them from loved ones? Would my personal bank account (not at all linked with my Father) be subject to a similar withdrawal that my younger brother saw? How far can they go?

personalfinance,Sell the house or rent it?,"Hi all, I’ll make this quick. The wife and I have a house where our mortgage is $2k per month, have only been paying on our mortgage for 14 months. There is a good possibility I will get another job and have to relocate this summer. So here’s the question, do we keep the house and rent it out or do we sell it? We know we can rent our house for $2k per month, and potentially up to $2400. If we do rent our house out, should we look into refinancing right now? We can get our payment down to $1600 with a lower interest rate being offered so we would be making a bit of money by renting it, but also have never done that and seems risky. Would appreciate any insight and can also provide more info if needed. Thanks!",finance

Contributing 5% to company 401k, discretionary match but YOY they have matched 15% of funds up to 5% (first year with this company). Loan balance at $57k. Leftover income is around $1600/monthly.

&amp;#x200B;

Current Cash

$1k+$2.8k in checking (buffer + this months income so far, i pay bills on the 1st of every month and bring down my balance to 1k by transferring leftovert to savings accs)

Route A - Payoff 5.05% loan and have $500 leftover in other savings, contribute $500/month to IRA, go 50/50 savings/loans with the rest of monthly leftover income (\~$1100)

&amp;#x200B;

Route B - Take savings and split 50/50 to savings/loans starting with highest interest

&amp;#x200B;

Route C - Go 100% on loans

&amp;#x200B;

Route D - ????

personalfinance,Relevant factors for determining if a 529 plan should be used to pay off student loan debt,"What information do I need to know to determine if the new changes from the SECURE act make a 529 more advantageous than just paying off my student loan through my bank account. I'm assuming I need to know:

-My federal marginal income tax rate for the interest I would pay off if I pay normally

-Whether my state conforms to the federal student loan interest subtraction from income

-My marginal state income tax rate

-The amount of interest I would pay back over the year in total

-My state income tax benefits for 529 contributions

I live in Oregon, where we recently instituted a tax credit for only $150 for contribution to a state 529, and would require me to contribute $600 to receive it I believe. This credit would be better than the interest deduction for a payment of those $600 (would include about $70 in interest), so my thought is that I should contribute this $600 to a 529 and spend it on the loans, and then pay the loans off like normal for the rest of the year. 

This means that I can wait until the legislative session is over and I can be near certain that Oregon is going to allow this before I have to commit. Does anyone have any additional information that I need to consider? Is this logic sound?",finance

My private loan has a variable interest rate, which is one of the reasons I am curious to find out about this. I am 24 years old, I am not sure if my credit is great or not so I wanted to know if releasing the co-signer (who has great credit) would be detrimental to me?

I make around 1,200 a month, sometimes more sometimes less, car payment is $300 even. I opted for GAP insurance.

Insurance is a whopping $470/month, which i didn’t originally even think of when budgeting for a new car. I expected something in the ballpark of ~$300. Anyways, live and learn, I can afford it. Altogether the car payment is $770/month.

personalfinance,Unique Situation,"I have a bit of a unique situation (I think, maybe it's more common than I know). 

A while ago I purchased a used vehicle. I financed about 50% of the purchase and wrote a check for the other 50%. Just to use round numbers, let's say I wrote a check for $10,000. 

When the dealer deposited the check that I wrote, the bank only hit my account for $100. Apparently, they took the last two 0's of $10,000 to mean $100.00.

When I first saw this, I thought ""Ok, when the dealer does their month-end close they will catch the mistake and eventually get in touch with me about the balance."" But it's been a while now and I haven't heard anything. 

A couple of thoughts I've had:

1. It's possible that the amount of money just isn't that much to the dealer and maybe they didn't notice a $10k variance? That seems implausible though. The month end close process should certainly catch it.
2. Even though it's been about 5 weeks, the dealer may still be doing their month end/year end closing so it may take them some time to catch it.
3. I got really lucky and maybe that's the end of the story.

Anyway - any thoughts out there? Appreciate any input, opinions, etc. I haven't been in this situation before and am wondering if anyone else has seen this type of thing and what they did about it.

As an aside, I have the cash to cover the balance if the dealer does come asking about it. But I'll keep earning a little interest on that cash as long as I can. And for any PF sticklers out there, I also have the cash to pay off the loan and buy the car outright, but I felt like maintaining a little more liquidity and maybe using some of that cash to earn more than the interest rate, which is super low.",finance

personalfinance,Refinance credit cards now or wait until score rises?,"About a year ago my wife and I began to tackle about 120k in unsecured debt, including credit cards, school loans, loans we took for a now-failed business, etc. We've already paid down about $26k in debt, but we still have $37k in credit card debt that we haven't touched. This includes two cards that are currently at 97% &amp; 94% utilization. The cards currently average a 27% APR.  Due to the high utilization and the number of accounts we have open, my credit score is only 628.  I have NO late accounts, no defaults and not a single late payment showing anywhere on my credit reports. I don't have a problem making payments on the debt...I just have a lot of it to pay. In fact, I just completely paid off two loans and finished paying off one credit card last week.

To improve my credit score and to lower my interest rates, I'd like to consolidate the credit cards using a debt consolidation loan. Problem is, with a 628 score, most lenders aren't interested. Most lenders simply noped out when I did a rate check and prequal for the loan. LendingClub made a terrible offer, but Upstart surprisingly made an offer at 18% APR (I didn't expect anything from them, since their published FICO minimum is 640). 18% is still not awesome, but better than the 27% we're paying right now. We'd take a hit on our FICO for opening a new loan, but that should be more than balanced by the five other accounts that would go to zero utilization (the cards have been shredded and we're on an envelope system budget, so no worries about running them up again).  I'd also have a lower minimum monthly, which would allow me to apply more money toward the principal paydown every month.

This brings me to my question. I have a 628 credit score and just finished paying off two unsecured personal loans and a credit card that previously had low utilization but a $2900 balance. These changes probably won't be reflected in my credit score for another month or two. Does paying off the loans have that much of an impact on my score? I'm reading conflicting opinions online about how much impact loans have vs. credit cards.

personalfinance,(US-TX) 1 year old - Trying to determine best way to save for college,"My wife and I are trying to determine the best method for saving for our 1 year old's college.

We live in DFW with 160k income between the two of us.  Mortgage payment of 2200 and one car payment of 400.  Outside of that, neither of us have any debt.

When I asked my close friends about how they are planning saving for their kid's college, I get a wide variety of responses.  Some say 529's aren't as effective as other crafty options.  I honestly don't know enough about them which brought me here.

I started a savings account when he was born, and have been moving about 125 bucks a month over to that, but interest rates in savings accounts are literally nothing.

Any advice?  Thanks much!",finance
personalfinance,Looking to buy a House in a Year or Two. Asking for suggestions on budget and to improve credit.,"My Wife and I are personally looking at buying a house in 1-2 years, and start a family and have kids. Our Yearly Income right now is about 70,000$, with 3-7% Raises each year. I personally am doing a 5% Match through my job for my 401k, also putting 40$ per payecheck into HSA to save on Birth Control Cost and Dental. 

We Looking at a budget of about 220-280K$ and do not want a Mortgage no more then 1800$. Ideally 1250-1500$. Both of our Credit Scores sit at about 740 currently. Both of our cars are payed off/gifted. She only has 2500$ left on her student loan and has been paying about 300-400$ each month towards that. Once it gets to 1000$, she will do a loan close out payment. 

We both pay off our credit cards each month. She currently only has a Amazon Prime Card with a 2000$ Limit.  I personally have a 500$ Limit Secure Card. Started Building my credit only 2 years ago, and defaulted on a student loan payment a couple of years ago, but is payed off. I also have a 2000$ Limit Best buy Visa Card, I opened to get some electronics here and there on interest free payments, but that is currently payed off. 

I am wondering if I should open up another card to improve my credit with a larger limit to use on all spending and pay off monthly, that has better rewards? Also should she open up another card as well?

We Currently have about 4000$ saved and are looking into opening up a High Interest Savings Account like Wealthfront (2.51%) soon to put our savings in. 

**List of our Current Monthly Budget:**

Net Income Per Month after Taxes: 3,800$-4,200$ (So will say 4000$ to keep it simple) 

Rent: 500$ (Currently renting From Her Step Dad, but a very small house at 750sqft for two people and a possible child down the road after a new house.)

Electric: 150$

Water: 75$

Internet: 70$

2 Phones: 125$

Car Insurance: 80$

Her Student Loan Payment: 350$ (Should be Finished in 4-6 Months) 

Groceries: 400-500$ (Sometimes we host game nights at our house, so those months are a little more)

Subscriptions Total: 70-85$ (40$ of This is Regal Unlimited, We like to go to a lot of movies, and the flex is sometimes HBO Now) 

Eatting out at Work: 150-250$ (We both have really been cutting back on this, making our lunches most of the time and she will be cutting buying coffee once I get her a Expresso Machine for her Birthday at the end of the month which should cut this another 80-100$. 

Dates: 140-180$ (We usually go out every two weeks and the dates average about 80$ after drinks and food) But we are looking at cutting down on the drink cost to save money and consume less calories.) 

Misc: 150-250$ (Vet Bills, Car Maintenance, Hair, Dentist etc...)

Personal Money: 100-150$ (Usally spent on buying a game now and then or for her makeup etc...)

 Savings: 1000-1200$ (Once Her Student Loan is done, we plan on upping this by 350$ to 1350$ Plus)

We usally put Overtime Money or Bonuses Towards a small 500-1000$ Vacation each Year.

**Total:** 3800-4000$

I know personally we can cut down on spending money on eatting out, but living in a city were the food and beer is so good is really hard to be honest, and we both really enjoy the food here. We have cut back significantly over the past couple of months, by about 400-600$ a month to save for the house. 

Ideally we want to save up 15,000-25,000$ before looking to have some left in our account for Emergency Fund, and have a Solid 15,000$ Plus for down payment.

personalfinance,I gave too low of a salary requirement and now I have an offer. Too late to ask for more?,"Like the title says, I gave too low of a figure for my salary requirement, which they have already accepted and included in an offer letter. After doing some research into the typical salary range of the position, the cost of living in LA, and the cost to relocate from Cleveland (should have done this before giving my salary requirement), I realize that I should have asked for much more. 

The position is a with a federal contractor and the job is reviewing and responding to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for a government agency. There is a HUGE backlog of FOIA requests, at this government office and government offices nationwide. Additionally, my name is on the proposal that the contractor submitted to the government, so it would be a pain to move on to a different candidate and amend or re-submit the proposal.  There is little to no day-to-day support from the company, which has 0 other employees in CA, so this presents a tremendous personal and professional risk to move to LA for a position that seems to have been hastily put together to quickly score this federal contract.  I feel that all of these factors give me bargaining power. 

To put numbers to it, national average for this kind of role is in the 60-65k range. LA is far more expensive than the national average, so the salary should be towards the higher end of the range. Unfortunately I responded before adequately researching this, and I asked for only 52k :(

The truth is, now that I know more about LA and the cost of moving there, I don't want to accept this offer at the current salary. It might look bad to come back with yet ANOTHER salary requirement figure, but that could still be better for all parties than if I declined the offer and they have to start the search from scratch.

Is it too late to ask for 58-60k? I deeply appreciate any and all insight.",finance
personalfinance,Rate my 401k fund selection,"Yes, I know, it's yet another 401k post among the dozens on this subreddit... however, it's still nice to get some acknowledgement that I'm at least struggling towards the right direction.

My employer recently changed our portfolio selection in early January 2020. Previously used a lazy ""Aggressive"" portfolio set by the system, and once our 401k funds changed in 2020, our investments were automatically re-allocated into the new funds available. With this opportunity, I'm looking to optimize my fees and funds now that I have more choices that I didn't have before such as Vanguard and Fidelity funds.

# Stats

* 25 years old, paid bi-weekly.
* Income is \~$48,000 without overtime and yearly bonus. Including those, income goes up to about \~$52,000?
* Roth 401k in ADP system, employer matches 5% of my gross income, which is exactly what I'm putting in every paycheck. Might switch to contributing to a traditional 401k instead if my income ever goes high enough.
* Fully funding a Roth IRA at Vanguard, all of it is dumped into Vanguard's Target Retirement 2060 fund.
* HSA with HealthEquity, which has a $2k minimum to invest, i.e. I can only invest the portion of my balance above 2k. I haven't hit it yet, but plan to soon as I will be maxing out my HSA this year via pre-tax paycheck deductions. Tentative future portfolio is 50% VIIIX, 25% VTPSX, 15% VEMPX, 10% VBMPX. Might actually make a future post on this once I actually can start investing my funds.
* As you can tell from my IRA and HSA portfolio, at the moment I'm targeting a 90% stock-10% bond allocation for my 401k portfolio.

personalfinance,"[Advice requested] Where to put money next? Max after-tax 401(k), separate Vanguard Acct., or pay off mortgage?","Throwaway because of personal information.

I've been working at a FAANG company in NYC for over 3 years now. Prior to me landing this job, my husband and I lived paycheck to paycheck and we are not quite sure where to go next with what we have and would love some help - we end up with a substantial amount of money left over each month after various insurance contributions, 401(k) contributions, transfers to savings, small charity contributions, and all of our expenses. 

**Background:** All income and expenses are for myself (33), my husband (34), and 3 pets.  We have no children and have no plans to have any. My husband is self employed and works from home part-time, but does not bring in substantial additional income.  I cover all expenses (except for my husband's student loan) for the household and what he makes is his to spend as he sees fit after he covers his operating expenses/quarterly taxes and makes his payment on his loan.  He tends to just use it for Christmas/Birthday gifts throughout the year and save the rest.

A few notes:

* We have a substantial emergency fund ($45,000, which would cover about 9 months of expenses)
* I front load my 401(k) for the match ($19,500) before tax with my annual bonus in January and continue to contribute 4% after tax for the rest of the year.  I currently have $105,000 in my retirement account and am 33 years old.  I definitely feel like I'm playing catch-up, as this is a result of what I've been able to afford to contribute since I started working at 22. My husband does not have anything set aside except for $35,000 in savings, not tied to our emergency fund.
* We own a condo in Florida.  The property is valued at $110,000 and we owe $87,500 on a $98,500 mortgage with a 5.000% interest rate (30 year, fixed).  It is rented out through a property manager and has not been empty for more than 2 months over 3 years.  Any profit made from it after the mortgage, HOA, and management fees (profit is about $200/mo) goes into a separate account for maintenance and repairs.  Our income below does not include any income or expenses related to the condo as it has been, so far, it's own self-supporting entity.
* Aside from the mortgage and my husband's almost paid off student loans ($5,000 @ 7%) we do not have any debt.
* If it matters, about 1/3 of my yearly compensation is in RSUs.  I am enrolled in the autosale program and treat these sales as regular income (included in the total and averaged out)

Some of the total remaining goes to random fun things we want (tech, experiences, games, books), clothes, travel, etc. but even with those expenses, there is still at least $2,000/month, in general, up for grabs and right now is just accumulating in a savings account and I know it should and could be doing more.

I see three options:

1. Open an after-tax Vanguard account and start dumping money there to continue to save for retirement.  Possibly tighten our budget up and consider shooting for semi-early retirement (50?)
2. Up my regular 401(k) after tax contributions to try and hit the $57,000 max, or at least come close.
3. Pay off my husband's loans for him and then throw this money at the mortgage in Florida, since it's sitting at a higher interest rate.
4. Something else we haven't considered?

personalfinance,Does it make sense for me to buy this home?,"TL;DR: I am a 26 year old single father with Custody of my child.  Make pretty decent money, but owe $43k in low-medium interest loans. Due to my custody arrangement I will need to work / live in this area for at least 2-5 years if not longer.  I have a potentially favorable opportunity to buy a home from my current landlord. Do I have a plausible plan? Does this make financial sense for my situation?

**Background Info:**  

I graduated with an Engineering degree in May 2018.  After graduating, I won primary custody my daughter who is now 5 years old, and I moved back to my hometown (where baby mamma, her immediate family, and my immediate family live).  
 
**Income:**  

I grossed over $75k last year including OT, Bonus, and premium pay for working a rotating shift. I intend to move to a new role in the company toward the end of this year. It will provide me a more stable work schedule which is great since I am a single parent. However, I will lose almost all my OT and premium pay. I would expect this to be someone offset by a 3%-4% increase in my base pay, but I will definitely earn less after the move.

**Debt:**  

* Student Loans - ~$36k (all interest rates under 4.5%)  
* Car - ~$7k (2.9%/ 1 year into 3 year loan)  

**Retirement:**  

* I am taking full advantage of my employers 401k match (6%)  
* I am maxing my Roth IRA every year.  

**The situation:**  

Currently, I am renting a home from a lady I went to church with and have known well for 10+ years. She has informed me that she intends to try to sell the house (my lease ends in June). She is nearing retirement age and is building a new home that will be somewhat closer to her daughter. She has asked if I would be interested in it. I told her that I would be if the numbers worked out correctly. Last week she told me that her tax assessment put the house at $41k and asked if I would buy it for that.  We would finance everything through her, and she would not require a down payment.  

**House info:**  

* Built in 1961  
* 3 br / 1 bath  
* ~1000 sq ft  
* I currently pay $500 / month (I believe this is a somewhat discounted rent price for knowing me)  

If I move out and rent another comparable home, my rent will almost certainly raise to something like $600-$800 / month. Since I have custody of my daughter, legally it would be difficult to move farther than 45 miles away from baby mamma anytime soon.  My goal would be to get the house (and all associated monthly bills, including saving for repairs / upkeep) to be less than what I currently pay for rent. I believe I will need to get the home for $31k - $35k and pay 20% down to make this happen on a 10-year loan. My rough plan would be to live there for 3-4 years, and complete reasonably priced upgrades and any essential, expensive upkeep projects during that time. Then, if the need to move presents itself, I would like to be able to rent the place out and at least break even if not eventually make income.  

This was the first home my landlord and her husband bought and lived in after they were married. So they have owned it for about 30 years.  I have been living here for 6+ months. The home appears to be in decent shape, but does need some TL&amp;C. We discussed financing the home through my landlord, so we would avoid the bank.  She would not require a down payment, I would be paying interest on the loan to her.  If I buy the home, she is avoiding all the costs involved in putting the home on the market.  Probably avoiding needing to make some repairs / remodels to help the home sell. And she will not have to wait for the home to sell. I intend to have a home inspection and have my own lawyer read over the contract.  

I realize that buying / renting homes has a ton of variables, but does this seem like a reasonable plan? Does asking $31k (3/4 of the tax assessment) seem reasonable when she would be avoiding so many other costs / headaches? Or is that way too low? Any other advice or thoughts I should be considering?  

With such an old home, it seems I could only hope to break even on costs until I pay the mortgage off.  But if I am able to do that while keeping the house in decent shape, there would be the potential to create a new revenue stream after the mortgage is paid.",finance
personalfinance,Question about Rate of Return on Paying off home early. Am I missing something?,"I'm going to apologize upfront, I've never posted before so sorry if this formatting is hard to read or I left out some important information. I am trying to figure out where my dollar can be most effective. I currently have 3 homes that I rent out . I have my emergency fund already in place of 50k. I am maxing my contributions to ROTH for 19.5k for federal employees and my wife is maxing hers at 6k.

So I don't want to put my extra money in the bank at 1.7%, so my options I was thinking were stocks or paying off my mortgages early. I started doing some math on paying the mortgage off early and I would like to know if there is something I am completely missing because my rate of return seems astronomically high and I think I may be doing something wrong.

Home A

$110,000 27yr remaining loan at 4%. monthly payment is $555

My calculation was if I make an additional payment every month of $1475 I would have my home paid off in 5 years. I will have contributed an additional $88,500 to my loan and saved $58,538 in 5 years. I played around with different amounts to try to find the effective rate of return by solving for it using a given Final Value. My thought process was to compare this to a mutual fund.

If I contributed $1475/m or 17,700/a for 5 years and it grew to the Final Value of 147k (the effective value of the amount I have contributed and the amount I saved in interest ie, ""earned"" 88.5+58.5). If that was a mutual fund my effective rate of return would be 19%?

* 5 year growth (compounded monthly)
* 19% = 148.2k

I  cant buy any more homes because I would not get approved because neither my wife nor I would have enough verifiable income when the time came (I'm about to leave my job in a year to go to school) and I don't think I would want to. I'm attempting to leanfire and 3 doors is enough to sustain the lifestyle I want anyway.

Is there something I am missing here? Why would I put my money in stocks when I can get a guaranteed return of 19% for 5 years and then just contribute to stocks after with more because of no mortgage.

Thank you for making it this far and I appreciate and information given.

He earns about $30-$35k annually (before taxes) but his rent and other bills are next to nothing. As far as his credit report goes - he doesn’t have history other than 5-6 months of a secured credit card and a (voluntary) repo from 3.5-4 years ago bc he was incredibly upside down in the loan. 

He has saved about $3,000 cash for a down payment and needs to get a $3-5k loan for a vehicle. He doesn’t want to spend any more than $7-8k on a car. He has applied at his bank, his credit union and some online lender and been denied by all 3 and we know it’s bc of the repo. But he needs to get a car loan and make timely payments in order to build and improve his credit score and he needs to do it ASAP. 

Please don’t tell me that he should just buy a car for cash with the $3k. He did that 2 years ago and it’s been nothing but a money pit and it’s a HONDA CIVIC!

Bitcoin,Central Bank Digital Currency,"Christine Lagarde recently announced ECB (European Central Bank) Policy Makers are discussing plans to create their own Central Bank Digital Currency.

In her previous role at the IMF, Lagarde gave a speech - [Winds of Change: The Case for New Digital Currency](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2018/11/13/sp111418-winds-of-change-the-case-for-new-digital-currency).

She gave this speech in November 2018.

For that paper she referenced, named [Casting Light on Central Bank Digital Currencies](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Staff-Discussion-Notes/Issues/2018/11/13/Casting-Light-on-Central-Bank-Digital-Currencies-46233) \- a particular section is very interesting indeed...

""This note contributes to a growing body of literature on CBDC. Others have already explored this topic, including international organisations such as the Bank for International Settlements and several central banks (Bank of Canada, People's Bank of China, Bank of England.......""

Remember, this report is from November 2018 - so Central Banks and powerful entities such as the BIS, Bank of China and Bank of England have explored this topic in detail for longer than one initially assumes.

There are important points to discuss, as it could have huge implications for society in general:

1. The first is the trend towards a cashless society. The infrastructure required for using cash costs countries a fair amount every year. Also, younger consumers prefer the convenience of mobile payments.
2. What does this mean for privacy (particularly financial privacy)?
3. What does this mean for the most vulnerable in society who are heavily reliant on cash, such as the homeless?
4. As well as this, any trusted third party is a security hole - thus these centralised institutions are [honeypots for skilled hackers](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/capital-one-hacked-over-100-million-customers-affected/)
5. There is of course Facebook's Libra and the recent news of [China's plan to introduce the Digital Yuan](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/12/china-central-bank-close-to-releasing-digital-currency-pboc-official.html)

Outgoing Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has stated that [digital currencies can be used to reduce the reliance on the US Dollar](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/23/mark-carney-dollar-dominant-replaced-digital-currency)

So...

Demand is there, and Pandora's Box is now opened

IT SEEMS INEVITABLE THAT THIS IS THE DIRECTION IN WHICH WE ARE HEADING.

Here is my current take on the situation.

**\[DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE\]**

Things can change and you should conduct your own due diligence.

I think Central Bank Digital Currencies *will* happen and start the trend towards a cashless society.

This will also make it easier to collect taxes for Governments.

Unfortunately, I believe this probably will be a centralised network.

This means that funds can be frozen (which is bad for certain privacy conscious consumers), although it will mean that transactions will have reduced fees and that the 'middleman' aspect of the financial services industry will be hit (which is good for all consumers).

Therefore, Bitcoin will be (and already is my opinion) the decentralised hedge against bad monetary policy and centralised power structures.

Allowing for peer to peer transactions in a decentralised manner.

In terms of long term investment, I think that Bitcoin will hit $100K within 2-3 years, and $1MM within the next 15 years.

This will be a critical issue over the next decade that could have some very serious consequences for those who are not prepared for this transition.

As an investor, it is important to understand where the long term trend is heading.

Generally, this revolves around technological innovation that makes our lives more convenient and makes it more efficient to transfer value and thus drive progress and prosperity.

These developments are an indicator of that, but it is important to remember that those in positions of power and that control the flow of money are ruthless in their pursuit to maintain that power and maybe, just maybe, the guys at the NSA created a decentralised hedge against their incompetence...

# **Trade deal and earnings season could shape the market’s next moves  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/10/trade-deal-and-earnings-season-could-shape-the-markets-next-moves.html)**
*****
&gt; The stock market’s race to new highs could be put to the test in the coming week by two events — the signing of a phase one trade deal with China and the start of corporate earnings season.
*****
&gt; Stocks have been gaining steadily since it became clear late last year that the U.S. and China reached a truce and would agree to a phase one deal, rolling back some tariffs and avoiding new ones. But details of that deal have never been made clear, so markets will be focused on any information that will clarify how it will be implemented and what checks and balances there are to ensure compliance.
*****
&gt; The market has also reached a lofty premium that could be challenged if earnings disappoint, though analysts widely expect to see the majority of companies able to beat lowered expectations.
*****
&gt; Banks are first up with J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo releasing earnings Tuesday, and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs reporting on Wednesday. Earnings could be a slight positive for the market, analysts say.
*****
&gt; “I think earnings are going to be a good component,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “Companies have lowered the bar enough to where I think most of the companies will easily step over it, and we’ll all have a sigh of relief that the earnings this quarter won’t be as bad as it could have been. It won’ be strong. We’ve seen revisions across all of the sectors come down.”
*****
&gt; According to Refinitiv, fourth quarter earnings are expected to be down 0.6%, based on results of companies that have already reported and estimates for others that have not.
*****
&gt; Stocks started out the past week worried about a blowup in the Middle East, after the U.S. killed Iran’s top general. But by midweek, tensions dissipated and stocks were higher. On Friday, stocks sold off again, after a lackluster jobs report, though the Dow briefly topped 29,000 for the first time. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.9% for the week, at 3,265, and the Dow was off 0.7% at 28,823.
*****
&gt; The China trade deal is expected to be signed on Wednesday, and while it may be a nonevent, it has the potential for surprises. The deal most likely will be seen as a positive, but it is not expected to do much to curb technology transfers, which are expected to be part of the next phase discussions.
*****
&gt; “If the deal is more watered down than anticipated, if there’s skepticism about how China will adhere to its promises” it could be negative, Arone said. “There’s skepticism already. If there’s something in the details that suggest doubt about how are we going to police this or how are we going to enforce this, I think that could cause markets to move some.”
*****
&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group said he thinks the market has moved past the trade news. “I think they’ll try to emphasize some IP protection. I honestly think people have already moved on,” he said. President Donald Trump has also lowered expectations by noting that the next phase of the deal would not come until after the election.
*****
&gt;# Economy
&gt; Markets also will focus on some of the upcoming data in the week ahead, particularly CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for December on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Core CPI is expected to increase by 0.2%, putting the annual pace at 2.3%, and retail sales are expected to rise by 0.3%.
*****
&gt; “The holiday season when all was said and done should have been pretty good. You had low gas prices, rising wages and a super tight labor market. It has to be good,” said Joseph LaVorgna, Natixis chief economist Americas.
*****
&gt; There is also a parade of Fed speakers in the coming week, but they are unlikely to offer any clues about when the Fed will move off the sidelines. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who voted against the Fed’s rate cuts three times last year, speaks Monday. There are a half dozen more appearances by other Fed officials, including Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan, who speaks Wednesday.
*****
&gt; LaVorgna said the Fed could begin to focus more on the rapid rise in the stock markets, as Kaplan did this past week. “It seems to me the hawks might worry about financial instability and the market being excessively exuberant,” said LaVorgna.

# January Expiration Week: Mixed Bag Last 21 Years

&gt; Over the past thirty-seven years, since 1983, the S&amp;P 500’s performance during January’s option expiration week has been a tepid. Friday has been up 21 and down 16, and the entire week has been down five-plus times for every four times it has been up. However, in the past twenty-one years (1999-2019), the S&amp;P 500’s performance has taken a turn for the worse with expiration day falling ten times with an average loss of .08% and the full-week declining 14 times with an average loss of 0.74%. DJIA and NASDAQ have similar track records since 1999.

# 378 Days since Last 10% S&amp;P 500 Correction &amp; Still Counting

&gt; There is little doubt that 2019 was a good year for the market. DJIA advanced 22.3%, S&amp;P 500 climbed 28.9% and NASDAQ jumped 35.2% in 2019. Even for a pre-election year, those gains are above average. Gains of this magnitude also have a tendency to cause some uneasiness as valuations are generally getting stretched and thoughts turn to profit taking or the possibility of a pullback or a correction.

&gt; S&amp;P 500 completed its last correction (defined as a 10% or greater decline, but less than 20% because that would be a bear market then) on December 24, 2018 after falling 19.8%. That was 378 calendar days ago and it was the fifth correction of the current bull market that begun on March 9, 2009. Since 1948, the current bull market is the second longest in duration and magnitude. The longest was 4494 calendar days from December 4, 1987 through March 24, 2000. S&amp;P 500 gained 582.1% during that bull while enduring five corrections. Even though it has been 378 days since the last does not mean one is imminent. S&amp;P 500 has gone as along as 2553 calendar days without a correction before (October 1990 through October 1997).

# How Stocks Do During Geopolitical Events

&gt; It was a volatile night for the U.S.-Iran conflict.

&gt; S&amp;P 500 Index futures dipped 1.5% and global markets swung after Iran shot several ballistic missiles at U.S.-Iraqi military bases. Markets recovered their losses overnight on news that there were no American casualties, but tensions remain high in the Middle East.

&gt; As concerns over the Iran conflict continue to build, we’ve received many questions asking what this could mean for the market outlook. We discussed our initial thoughts regarding the conflict in our January 6 blog, but we believe it is important for investors to remember that there have been many times historically when stocks stood strong in times of conflict. In fact, the best ever annual Dow Jones Industrial Average gain was in 1915 during World War I.

&gt; “No doubt worries over Iran have investors on edge,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Stocks could be volatile for a while, but the impact to stocks from geopolitical events historically has tended to be short-lived.”

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&amp;P 500 fell 5% on average in 20 major geopolitical events dating back to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. However, the S&amp;P 500 recovered those losses in fewer than 50 calendar days on average.

&gt; A special thanks to Sam Stovall of CFRA for sharing the data below with LPL Research.

# Why The First Five Days Of 2020 Could Have Bulls Smiling

&gt; The first five days of 2020 are in the books. Although the headlines have been quite scary, equities have picked up right where they left off last year. In fact, after the first five trading days of the new year, the S&amp;SP 500 Index is up a respectable 0.65%.

&gt; Jeffrey Hirsch of The Stock Trader’s Almanac follows and tracks many interesting seasonal patterns. One that we find very interesting states that how stocks perform the first five trading days of a new year could indicate how the full year will go. Now, we’ll be the first to admit no one should invest based only on this adage, but the results have been quite compelling.

&gt; We did some research and found that when S&amp;P 500 returns in the first five trading days of a new year have been higher, the full-year total return for the S&amp;P 500 has been positive 80% of the time. Compare that to returns being up only 60% of the time when the first five days have been lower, and we have something that has our attention. What about big gains? Well, when those first five days have been up more than 2%, the full year return has been positive a very impressive 16 of 17 times! Only 2018 didn’t follow suit when the first five days were up 2% or more.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/do-the-first-5-days-of-a-new-year-matter.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “Should you ever invest for a full year purely because of the first five days? We would emphatically say no,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But put in context, this seemingly random bit of info does have a very impressive track record. It is only a small piece of the pie, but the good news is we still don’t see any major warning signs that this bull market is over just yet.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when the S&amp;P 500 has gained more than 0.65% the first five trading days of a new year—like 2020—the full year has finished in the green 31 out of 35 times, with a very solid 17.2% average annual return. Although we aren’t expecting gains quite that large in 2020, it does help support the case for the bull for at least the rest of this year.

# ""Take my crude, please""

&gt; Crude oil is just about as popular or maybe even less popular than tobacco these days. Sure, there was a brief spike in prices following the US drone strike on Iranian general Soleimani last Thursday night, but ever since then, crude oil has done nothing but trade lower. Just the fact that crude only managed to rally 3% in the lead up to what many thought to be a full-blown war with Iran shows just how out of favor crude is. This isn't the first time crude hasn't been able to hold onto gains either. As noted earlier this week, besides the last week, there have been two other periods of heightened tensions between the US and Iran over the last year where one would have expected prices to rally, but instead they sold-off.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011020-Crude-Chart.png))**

&gt; When a stock consistently opens at one price and then closes lower than it opened, it's considered a negative as it signals that investors are selling into strength. Applying that logic to crude oil confirms just how out of favor it has become. This week alone, the daily closing price has been lower than its open on all five days. The chart below shows daily streaks where crude oil closed below its opening price going back to the start of 2009. While the current five-day streak isn't anything to write home about, we would note that even before this past week's tensions in the Middle East, in late September/early October there was a streak of 13 trading days where the commodity closed lower than it opened, and that was the longest losing streak since at least the early 1980s! Before that, there was another streak of 7 trading days in July. In other words, two of the five longest streaks since 2009 where crude oil closed below its open both occurred in the last six months.

# Dow 29,000?

&gt; By posting this, we're probably jinxing it, but the DJIA is on the verge of topping another 1,000 point threshold less than two months after first topping 28,000. While the media makes a big deal of each of these thresholds, we would note that the road to 29,000 from 28,000 is only 3.4%. That's hardly a momentous move. Since Trump became President in January 2017, though, 29,000 would be the 10th 1,000-point threshold that the DJIA would cross under his watch.

&gt; The table below lists the date that the DJIA first crossed each 1,000-point threshold throughout history. For each level, we also include the number of calendar days that elapsed between the first cross of that threshold and the prior one, how large a percentage gain that the 1000-point threshold represents versus the prior one, and then how many times the DJIA has crossed each threshold (on a closing basis) both to the upside and downside. One of the most notable aspects of the table in our view is that even though each threshold is a smaller percentage than the prior one, there have been so few crosses (above and below) of most of the thresholds since the Dow first crossed 19,000 after the 2016 election. 19,000 was only crossed once, and six of the other nine thresholds since then haven't been crossed more than ten times. That's indicative of a market that has been rallying and not looking back.

stocks,"Gold mining stocks up 40% over the past year, outperforming SPY and still highly undervalued. Gold at $1563 an oz (up around 20% over the past year, 50% in the last 4 years).","40% is the average, but if you have your own picks of quality companies you’re up anywhere from 60-100%. The correction in gold is over and we are well on our way into the new bull market. The gold stocks don’t get much coverage, but they’ve been the best performing sector and will continue to do so. 

The federal reserve has injected over 500 billion into the repo markets; if you take a look at a chart you can see spikes of green directly corresponding with the amount of liquidity injected. We’re well into QE 4, it’s laughable that the fed won’t call it that; but if they did they would be admitting to debt monetization. Who gives a fuck what they say, care about what they do. They flip flopped on monetary policy last winter, rates going back to 0. Its honestly fucked up how they teach monetary policy and inflation to children. Scumbags would rather see the stock market up in nominal terms, than actually do their jobs and not get involved. 

We’re headed right into a currency crisis. Surprisingly gold has gone up before the drop in the dollar has even started; shows just how weak the dollar is, and how the risk premiums are starting to be built in. 

Now I don’t expect the public/general investors to hop into gold until it is well over $2000 an oz. Increasing demand has come from central banks globally, they’ve been buying large amounts of gold and selling off US treasuries. Some people will take advantage of this undervalued asset and buy while it’s cheap; most will be deterred from the stigma. 

A lot of people will get caught up in the passive investing scheme. General investors WILL ride this market all the way down. Out of greed they won’t sell, they’d rather lock up their money for years while waiting for it to come back.",finance
personalfinance,"New salary, how should I manage my debt and prepare for my future.","Hi /r/personal finance,

Looking for some recommendations, reassurance, or just different ideas. 

I am currently married, live in the Midwest, and just got a 30% pay raise. Looking to see what my best options would be given the debt below and future plans..


My wife and I make a combined ~$150,000 given my new salary.


Student loans - ~$165,000 @ 5.5% average

Mortgage - $130,000 @ 4.25

Car payment - $30,000 @ 4.99


Future plans: have a child within 1-2 years 


Option A: Pay the hell out of student loans, pay them off in 5-6 years as they currently stand


Option B: Refinance all student loans to get low interest rate, refinance mortgage to 15 yr, pay down both simultaneously so that when time comes to sell the house, have more equity built up.


Option C: Leave mortgage alone, refi student loans to ~3% @ 10 years and let em ride while beginning to invest. 


Regardless, we are going to start budgeting. Currently we just live freely, bills are on auto pay, and we just coast, this has to change before anything else. 


Thanks in advance! Looking forward to responses!",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing an already refinanced student loan,"I refinanced my PRIVATE student loans in November of 2018. I had to have a co-signer because I was a newly graduate and did not have any credit whatsoever. 

I recently received notification that I “may” be eligible to remove my co-signer from the loan. Right now, my term is 15 years for the loan on a variable interest rate. I owe roughly $99k.

I have heard that when you request a personal loan for paying off credit card debt, do not list it as such. . . is there any truth to that?  If so, whats the best answer to give a loan company when they ask for the purpose of a loan?  I have pretty decent credit (roughly 730), and the loan company I intend to go through I have used on several personal loans (all paid off) as well as an auto loan (paid off).

investing,Puzzled on Bonds,"Hello fellow investors,

Still new to investing and the markets, and trying to gain a grasp on how everything comes together. 

I can't seem to make logical sense which way the bond market is headed due to conflicting thoughts...

**Bonds Bullish case:**

Like everyone is mentioning, equities are far overreached to the upside and possibly due for a correction. Due to the negative correlation between stocks and bonds, this would indicate bonds are due for an uptick if the equities market takes a dip.

**Bonds Bearish case:**

Yields are at life time lows. I can only see interest rates being raised over 2020 which would point to bonds going bearish.

In addition, every time in the past few decades when the 2's-10's yield curve goes negative the curve pops pretty strongly to the upside, again indicating bonds going down.

personalfinance,Question regarding housing options,"Myself and my wife got approved for an FHA loan up to 160k. The only issue is that we cant afford a decent down payment plus closing costs. We can afford at least a 10k downpayment if we can have seller cover closing costs. 

We found a house that we're in love with. Listing price was 152k. We put in a intial offer of 155k plus 6% closing. The countered that they would accept the 155k but only pay 3% of the 155k towards closing. We countered with 159k plus the 6% closing. 

Told the mother in law and she gave me attitude and said it was stupid when I explained to her my reasoning and that we should just pay the other 3% closing instead of offering 159k. 

Here are the facts. At 155k and 3% closing we would only be able to make the bare minimum down payment which would give us a interest rate of %4.375. Our monthly payments would be around 1400$ without utilities. 

At 159k with no closing costs on our end would allow us to make a downpayment of at least 10k with an interest rate of %2.99. Our monthly payment would drop down to 1150-1200 without utilities. 

Over 30 years we would pay around 120k in interest at 4.375 vs 80k with 2.99. 

While we may be slightly overpaying for the house, in my mind the interest we would save over the years could offset the difference if we end up selling in 10 years. 

What I mean by this is that every year we'll save 1300 in interest. In 10 years that's 13k. So we wanted to sell the house we could drop the price by 10k and still break even. 

Additionally I know we'll be staying there for at least 10 years. And during that time I expect a recession of some sort so a lower monthly payment would also be a plus. 

Trying to see if I'm off in my thought process. This is our first home and I'm looking at long term.",finance

personalfinance,[Update] Bank won't let me take money out of a savings account I have with my late father,"[Original Post](https://reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/edvbui/bank_wont_let_me_take_money_out_of_a_savings/)

Pinging /u/Wulfwinterr and /u/AxDeath who wanted to know the update on this.

Thank you everyone for the advice on my last post. Truly, thank you. This has been frustrating, to say the least.

TL;DR of original post: bank manager  prevented me from accessing to my account that I jointly shared with my father who had passed away. The manager was stating that I couldn’t access the account for 40 days after his passing and that I’d need to provide a death certificate to gain access to the account.

TL;DR of this post: I got my money.

Thanks to the citation of /u/poe_todd, I had some legal backing to stand on and did a bit more research into this to find out that in 2017, a California court had ruled that in the event of a death of one of the people on the joint account, the other person on the account cannot be prevented from accessing the money.

I went back to the bank the following Saturday and went forward with my transaction. I just said I wanted to take this money out of my account, never mentioned anything else, and the teller went back and spoke with the same manager from the Saturday prior. The teller came back and told me the same thing from the week prior, saying this was a bank policy. I cited the 2017 ruling and said that if that really is bank policy, it’s in violation of California law. He went and got his manager and she came forward and said that she had just told me last week that I couldn’t have access without a death certificate and without waiting 40 days. I said that I understood what she said, but what she and the bank were doing is in violation of California’s laws as this was a joint account and I showed them documentation proving that I’m joint on the account. She stood firm in this position despite me citing the actual ruling that would have said otherwise. Never looked into it, just was adamant based on bank policy.

Admittedly, I forgot to report them using the link provided by Poe_Todd, but it doesn’t seem that it would have mattered since it wasn’t the right institution to report a bank to. That California agency sent me a letter a week later saying that even though it wasn’t their jurisdiction, they forwarded my report to the right agency for banks which was the FDIC. I haven’t received anything from the FDIC regarding this report since, though.

After leaving the branch, I contacted the corporate headquarters for this bank to report this manager. I was surprised to hear that they don’t “go over branches’ heads” with decisions they make. So no recourse there.

I stopped off and got some food and made the report regarding them and also began searching for a lawyer. Being a Saturday, not many lawyer firms were open but I finally got in touch with one who seemed to agree with me that I was in the right. I really contacted him for consultation to be sure I was in the right based on the laws. He said that he would contact the bank and get back in touch with me and give me an invoice for what he would do if he would be doing anything else.

We texted a few times and he said he would get in touch with me again shortly before January 1, 2020, but I haven’t heard from him since. I think he figured it wasn’t worth it for him in terms of money or that the 40 days would be up soon so I wouldn’t need his services to get my money. So I don’t think he’ll be contacting me again, to be truthful.

There was a day a few days ago that marked the 40 days since my dad had passed, so I figured I’d go back and play with their rules and deal with the legalities after the fact.

Really, all I wanted was my money. That’s it. It’s mine and I want it for various reasons. I’m not looking to start trouble, I just wanted my money.

I visited the bank today although I avoided the branch I was having issues with and went to another branch a few miles down the road.

I went in and just told them I wanted to make a withdrawal. I didn’t say anything else, and they were very kind and did exactly what I wanted. Even waived the fee for the cashier’s check (like $8)! The teller said they sometimes do it to be kind, so that was honestly nice. I never had to show a death certificate either nor was my dad ever mentioned.

Funny thing was my primary bank was next door so I was literally in and out and had my money.

For those who said something about the “and” and “or”: I never saw anything like this on any of my documents for the account nor was it ever mentioned on any of my visits.

Moving forward, I’m hoping the FDIC contacts me because I really want this branch to know they’re wrong. My mom doesn’t understand, says that I got my money so why does it matter?

It matters to me because I’m honestly disgusted that this happened to someone. Thankfully I didn’t need the money, but what if I was a stay at home spouse and my spouse was my only income? What if I needed this for funeral arrangements? This money that is rightfully mine was locked away from my reach and if I needed it, I wouldn’t be able to get it. Gross.

So I want this branch held accountable. I don’t want this happening to anyone else.

I spent, no, wasted, 4 Saturdays and close to 200 miles in travel to get this all sorted out. I’m just beyond disgusted by this and don’t want this happening to anyone else.

Hope my story helps someone and nobody else has to go through this.

Thanks again for all your help.

Edit: received a letter from the FDIC today that they aren’t the right agency either and they’re forwarding my complaint to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.

I’m also going to follow other advice on other agencies to file a complaint with and looking for more if you have any.",finance
personalfinance,Advice for re-aging credit accounts,"TL;DR Paramedic school screwed up my credit payments and I want to re-age my accts in the smartest way possible.

Hey r/personalfinance, so I have some credit cards that are behind by a few months, and while I’ve been making payments every month or so, the interest rates and late fees are really prohibiting me from making a dent with my current finances. I’ve been working a TON (60+) of hours at my job so I can start using the snowball method to pay off my debt, but rather than paying these lump sums ($150-$200+ minimum payments) and eating all the late fees with no benefit, I want to call the companies on Monday and talk to someone about re-aging the cards. 

I know they might not take the bait, but I’ve also been reading and I’m hoping some of these companies may roll over the ‘past due’ months to ‘paid on time’ if I enter agreements with them. What should I ask for as proof of a re-aging agreement? Is there a specific dept I should speak with? How do I even go about asking? Thanks in advance :)",finance
personalfinance,Do I need to fill out an employee allowance withholding certificate?,"EDIT: I'm from California 

I filled out the new W4 for federal taxes yesterday. I used the IRS calculator to determine how much extra money I want to withhold and it was much more simple. 

The second document was for state tax and called the Employee Allowance Withholding Certificate. This document is a lot more complicated and frankly I feel like it doesn't apply to me. I'm a single man with one income and there isn't even an option for that under filing status. 

Do I need to fill this form out since I filled out the new W4 form?  Up to this point my tax returns have been massive and I'm trying to change that so come tax time everything balances out instead of recieving a massive return. 

For reference this is these are the forms I'm speaking of.

And the form that I'm required to use for the state tax is a DE4 form, but I'm much more confused by this form.Up to this point where I'm actively adjusting my withholdings I've never owed in state or federal taxes so I'm wondering if I should even mess with the DE4 form",finance

personalfinance,Need Advice Navigating the end of the Prime Directive,"Hi all, I've been following the [prime directive flow chart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png) and am currently on step six (the purple boxes). I was hoping to get advice on things to consider before deciding how to allocate my remaining ≈$1000/month. 

Currently, I am getting an good deal on rent, that beats out home ownership and other rents in the area. I foresee myself staying at this location for the next 2+ years. Currently, I have no strong preference for rent/own and would simply do what makes the most sense financially.

*Further Information*

* 26yr old single male, no children
* I have ≈$15k in student loans, with interest rates 3-4%
* Hope to retire early
* Will have maxed out ROTH IRA and HSA contributions for the year

Based on the flow chart, it sounds like the recommended options are

* Contribute more to Company 401k option
* Pay off student loans more aggressively
* Start saving for a down payment on a home
* Some combination of the above

Questions below

1. Are there any other options I haven't considered?
2. How, if at all, does a planned early retirement change one's retirement savings allocation between account types?
3. Should I start saving for a down payment to be prepared in case there is a change to my living situation or should I wait to have clearer aspirations of home ownership before I start saving?

investing,Need Help with DCF calculation,"I'm trying to study for CFA exam, beginner here.

I was just trying to see if i could come up with a valuation for FedEx stock, by calculating cashflows and then discounting back.

So I understand that predicting future cash flows is the hardest part of this, but lets assume I got that right for simplicity. If I could tell you the cash flows from now to eternity (I found a 9.4% growth rate for the cash flows) and knew the starting cash flow, how do I find the value of the business?

&amp;#x200B;

**Would I need to use a growing perpetuity formula with PV= D1/(r-g) where PV=Present Value, D1=Dividend or coupon at period 1, r=discount rate and g=growth rate?**

This sounds like what I should use, with D1= Cash Flow at Period 1 and g=9.4% growth rate. But the part I don't understand is, if I wanted to use a lower discount rate like Warren Buffett (maybe 5%), this formula would make r=5% and be negative.

&amp;#x200B;

So should I be using this growing perpetuity formula or should I be using the traditional DCF equation or something else? Again, remembering that I am trying to keep it simple and **assume I already know the cash flows from now to whenever growing at a constant rate.**

personalfinance,"Boyfriend has enough to pay off student loan, should he?","My boyfriend has a 50k student loan that he can pay off in a large lump sum. The question is, should he?

The interest rate is 5 percent. Basically he can pay it off now and move on with his life. Or he can continue to make payments and pay the same interest rate on each payment, thereby paying less in the long run (ie. A year from now he will be   paying 5 percent on 25k per month instead of 5 percent on 50k right now).

Or something like that.

personalfinance,Deciding between online banks,"Burnt out on physical banks and BS overdraft fees and such. My current credit union will overdraft me if I have 20k in one account but forget to move money to another account rather than even having an option to just pull money from the other account... even if they're both checking. And their online app and authentication are garbage that require regular support calls for resets and such. I'll spare the rest of the grumping.

Anyway, just moved cross country and decided it's a good time to go online. I see lots of good reviews for Ally, Simple, and SoFi.

Goals:

1. No BS fees; I especially hate overdrafts since I tend to forget to move money when needed
2. Solid mobile app with easy check depositing (another beef with current CU) and modern authentication (email password resets, not stupid security questions, etc)
3. Good chat customer service; dislike calling in
4. Good interest rate, especially if I can get it without a separate and (IMHO) stupid and redundant savings account
5. Preferably not affiliated with one of the big national banks, though that may be a pipe dream
6. Just need checking (and savings if there's a great interest rate to justify it); biz checking would be nice but not necessary
7. ATM refunds are nice but no biggie, I rarely use them so Ally's $10/mo limit is fine
8. Don't care about rewards programs unless it's all spending through a debit card or some other very broad category
9. A batch of free checks to start off with would be nice so I can get wife and I set with direct deposit easily

My read so far is that SoFi gives better checking rates (1.6%) while Ally beats it if I'm willing to deal with savings accounts at 2.2%. Dunno what makes people like Simple so much... the pitch is nice but seems like the other two have pretty much the same easy money management features, and I do my finances in Excel anyway. Is Simple mostly for college kids that need a hand?

personalfinance,Pay Off Student Debt Early OR Invest In Rental Properties?,"Long-story short, my wife and I are in pretty strong financial shape except for her student debt, which is tremendous and has interest rates mostly between 6.55 and 6.8%. She's already paying about $2k/month, which includes a little bit of extra payments. She earns too much to get any tax credit for her payments. At the current rate, she'll pay off her student debt in about 9 years.

We calculated that we could move some existing spending around (mostly my extra mortgage payments) and take the rental income from her house and up that monthly payment to approximately $3,700/month. Doing that would eliminate her student debt in just over 5 years.

That sounds like a big relief for us and a necessary step if we are going to retire early (goal: 10 years from today).   


But I wonder if we wouldn't be better off taking that extra $1,700/month ($3,700 - $2,000) and putting it into rental property investments so that we are using that same money to create profit. This additional income is also necessary for us to be able to retire early. We have a local mentor that is willing to help us in the real estate world. He already helped my wife buy her house (before we met) for a great bargain, and he helped find a renter for it after she moved into my place. So while we are new to the rental property world, we are already doing it successfully, and have a lot of local experience immediately available to help.

personalfinance,Where to put tax return $$ to increase my credit score the fastest,"Had to live off credit for a bit while finishing undergrad with sick spouse (more bills) and kids, and applying to medical school (expensive, but I got in!).

My credit score just dropped below 600. This could influence the interest rates for my medical school loans, I wanna lower my score ASAP for that and for other obvious “just because” reasons. Maybe more importantly, I don’t want this credit debt during medical school with a family. With student loans and spouse working a little bit the bare minimum my family could survive on during medschool is to have no more than $4k credit card debt remaining. I think we can get rid of it all.

I expect our family’s combined tax return to be about $6k.

Here are my cards, they’re ALL nearly maxed out (within $50, I just wrote their max limits below for simplicity) with interest rates between 18-21% unless otherwise noted.

1.  $9100
2.  $4000 (Zero interest for another month or two)
3.  $1000
4.  $900  (Zero interest for another month or two)
5.  $500

Currently planning to put at LEAST $1200 per month (hopefully more as I scrutinize our budget more) into credit cards, our financial situation recently dramatically improved, making this possible.

So where should we put that beautiful tax return bonus when we get it, emphasizing credit repair? Should I leave small balances anywhere? Which cards need to die first? Do I need to put a minimum of say $500 in ALL of them then focus on specific ones?

Edited to make question more specific:
Assume I get 6k in the return. I pay off the smaller ones (total 2.4k) leaving me 4.6k. 
Do I fully pay off the 4K? or because it’s currently zero interest do I attack the 9.1k first? Do I just split the remaining 4.6k between the two cards?

I currently have a credit score of 578ish according to credit karma 

In august I bought a car. I was put in a situation where it was either buy a car or quit my job, with very little in savings I didnt have the option to buy one out right like I have in the past. So I bit the bullet and took on my first ever  car payment at 28. 

Given my crap credit score and history I was surprised I even got approved.  It's a 2011. Nothing fancy. All in all the loan ended up being around 10k the initial cost of the car was 5k. The interest rate is about 22% I believe. ( dont have the paperwork in front of me right now ) for a 48 month term. 

I got an offer on credit karma to refinance. The refinance offer would take the payments from 230 a month to 171 a month at a 13% interest rate. I'd be starting the loan term over and go back to 48 months. This would save me monthly about $59 a month on the car payments. 

While it sounds like an okay deal because I havent had my loan that long. I'm not sure realistically if refinancing is the right call.

 I mean I filed for bankruptcy at 26 I dont have the best history of making good financial choices and I dont want to do something that could make matters worse in the long run.

He used my middle name as my first name, and my old address, trying to correct and find info ha been very difficult because of this.
* I quit my job a few months after my loan had gone through, due to my boyfriend being able to pay off most of our payments, with supplement of money being paid back to me from a friend I had fronted a ton of rent for. Also this year we are renting rooms out.

personalfinance,Heloc advice - your experience,"Hello all. Here's our situation. I'd appreciate your thoughts. We need to repair a good deal of dry rot and paint our home urgently. We essentially have the money to pay for this if the estimates come in exactly (has that ever happened haha!), about $13.5k. I suspect more dry rot will be found and related issues, so in my head I'm thinking to have another 4-5k in the wings would be good. And yes, we live in California near fire zones, so all prices outrageous to us.

We do not have this extra $ however, and wouldn't be able to borrow from family, and I won't put it on a credit card (plus the contractors don't accept them anyway). Nor could we save it in the short timeframe (need to fix asap in spring), or magically come up with it once job underway. 

I've looked into various sources and a Heloc seems like a good bet. We'd qualify it seems with a local credit union that has a good reputation, and what I think is a decent rate (5.75, although of course it's market linked). We were thinking of applying for 25k (minimum is 15k but that rate is higher).

Is a Heloc a good idea in this case do you think, and what would you ask the lender if in my position? I've established there are no closing costs for us (they cover), except $200, which will be waived if we don't avail of a mobile notary, and just go to Title company. There is an early termination fee of $750 (if ending heloc under in 3 years).

There doesn't seem to be any difference in interest rate even going up to 35k, but I'm loathe to request an amount just because we can (loan officer said you might as well max out your allowed amount as you only pay on what you draw down, but still). Equally,  I know there are fixed he loans, but then we pay interest immediately and are unclear what amount we'll really need.

I've seen helocs cast in both a positive and negative light from older reddit threads. I hate the idea of loaning more money on a 2nd mortgage, but we feel sort of stuck. At least with heloc, we'd hopefully only have to draw down lower amount (but then have the willpower not to touch it unless some form of big emergency), and solve our issue before it worsens.

Thanks for for any help, thoughts or good/bad experiences.",finance
personalfinance,Pay off small student loan vs. Finish building Emergency Fund?,"I have a small federal subsidized student loan from 2012/2013 that was deferred all this time  because I was taking classes at half-time or above. It used to be $2600 but now it is paid down to $1645 and is no longer deferred because I am currently taking classes below half-time (3-4 credits). Interest rate is 3.4%.

My spring semester is being covered by my job, but in the summer and fall of 2020, I am taking 2 classes, costing $930 each, and I'm responsible for paying those. I expect to cover those with pell grant and federal loan combination, but I would like to take care of my current $1645 before then (unless you guys suggest otherwise?).

I have no other debts.

As for my emergency fund, its currently at $8600. I'm married with children. I would need to get to $13k to have 6 months worth but my short-term plan was to get to $10k minimum and take a little break so I can put money towards some other things I would like to save for. Regardless, I have to get this stupid $1645 loan out of my way.

There IS a way I calculated that would let me pay off all $1645 by end of February but that would mean Emergency Fund would have to temporarily chill out at $8600 until then.

Any suggestions?",finance
personalfinance,Are (credit card) balance transfers a good idea?,"Hi reddit! 

I recently got approved for $3k credit for USAA Amex rewards. 

I currently have a $1,400 balance on my older credit card.

My amex card has an 0% APR introductory rate until May 2021. My older credit card has a 16% interest rate.

With that being said, would a balance transfer be a good idea? I want to pay off my older credit card (but still keep it open), but i’m not sure how my Credit Score will be affected (that’s my main concern at the moment.) I don’t want it to suddenly drop because my new credit card has a 50% utilization rate, (but then again, will my credit score rise because my older credit score has a new 0% utilization rate?) There is a 3% balance transfer fee ($45USD) but i think i can swallow that.


Sorry it’s all over the place, because that’s how i feel right now. lol

Any help or insight will be highly appreciated. Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,(UK) Could I get a bit of advice on juggling credit around?,"This might be a simple one bit I have had it running round my head for the last 4 months and I cant come to a decision.
 
 &amp;nbsp;

The Original Scenario (Figures are an approximation)

Credit Card A - Limit £15k, Balance £10K (18%)

Credit Card B - Balance 5K (23%)

Credit Card C - Balance 4k (34.5%)

&amp;nbsp;


What I have Done

I took out a loan that cleared off the 10K (over 5 years at 3%).  This meant that I knew that at the end of 5 years the debt would be gone and the interest rate was sooo much easier to swallow.  

&amp;nbsp;

The Conundrum

My plan was to wait for the now empty 15K card to send me a balance transfer offer and then bounce the remaining credit on to that card so I can have an interest breather.  However it's been four months and no offer is forthcoming.  

&amp;nbsp;

Does the PF hive mind think it would be better to just transfer the balance and be happy that the interest is lower (and will therefore at least save me a bit) or should I hang out and wait for a 0% balance transfer offer to save me more? 

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks for the input :)",finance

financialindependence,About two years out on pulling the trigger. Question on bridging the gap to my Roth conversion ladder.,"I'm hoping you all can help me out. I feel emotionally too close to this to make the right rational and logical decision. 

We're currently at about 27.5x my (well padded) yearly-expenses number. I'm currently planning to work about two more years.

Due to uneducated investing early in my journey I have a substantial amount invested in high-risk taxable securities (maybe slightly overstated; mostly individual blue-chip stocks). The current value is **6x** my yearly expenses; a perfect resource to get me through the opening rungs of a Roth conversion ladder. 

I know I'm not supposed to time the market, but the recent rally has been almost too good to be true, and I feel really over exposed to risk as it stands, particularly with my short time horizon. I've crunched the numbers and am coming to terms with the tax liability for capital gains on these securities.

So the big question comes to, **""If I were to sell, what do I do with the proceeds.?""**

Looking around at Annuities, Bonds, and CDs (ABCDs), the rates aren't great. One option that has come to mind, I've thought about in the past and immediately laughed off, but the more I think about it in this context the more sense it's made.

What if I were to pay off my mortgage (5x yearly expenses)?

* My mortgage interest rate is 3.375%; favorable compared to ABCDs
* The local housing market is promising
* No capital gains tax on primary residence up to $500k (MFJ)
* Peace of mind (trying not to weigh this one too much but concerned I may be)

Our plan is to move to a VLCOL area after retiring so the plan has always been to sell our primary residence. It's currently valued at 7.33x our yearly expenses. We're anticipating spending about 2x on our new primary residence so we would still have well over 5x left to climb the Roth conversion ladder not taking into account continued growth in value as well as increased savings without a mortgage payment (I expect to be able to save an additional 1x yearly expenses over 2 years)

So I'm ready to be talked out of this. What better options are there or what am I missing that makes this riskier than I realize?",finance

personalfinance,Am I paying my students loans off in the best way possible?,"I have a lot of loans... about half federal and half private. I really want to get the private loans payed off as quickly as possible as they have higher interest and they are also the ones my mom co-signed on so if she dies they become due immediately...

What I am currently doing is putting my federal loans in income based repayment and paying the minimum they tell me to pay. Yes interest is building but it’s not capitalized on this plan so I’m not paying interest on my interest. 
For the private loans, I am paying them off as aggressively as possible and basically putting all of my free money towards whichever of the loans has the highest interest rate while paying the minimum on the others.

When the loan gets down to about 3k, I’ve been just paying it off and then using the next few months and just paying the minimum on all of my loans while I recover that 3k in my savings. My logic there is that by digging into my savings to pay off the loan at that point I am avoiding any future interest on the loan and so it’s ok to go back to minimum payments for the other loans while I recoup my savings because I would have been making those minimum payments anyway.

I hope this makes sense.

As for details, I owe 125k in loans and make about 58k a year.... it’s been a long struggle to get where I am because I have actually payed quite a bit already in principle and interest but I want a family and I’m realizing I need to step up my game and make sure I’m paying this in the most efficient way possible. Please save your judgements, I’m sure you are smarter than me and that’s why I’m asking you for help

Edit: I like to keep 10k in savings as a safety net. Not sure if that’s overkill and that money would be better served paying off loans.

Also I currently have a car payment that I’m finishing off paying (pretty much my only other loan). It’s 243 a month so eating up a lot of my monthly payments but it’s lower interest rate than my student loans so I’ve been just paying it monthly. However it’s also a higher monthly payment since it’s over a shorter period of time so I’m not sure if it would actually make sense to just pay that off so I can put that large chunk of money towards my student loans",finance

personalfinance,Do I take our more student loans?,"I'm a late bloomer when it comes to college and only really decided to go back and (finally) try to finish the degree I started back in 2014. When I first started I had taken $3500 in a direct subsidized loan. Luckily, this has been the only loan I have had to take out so far, mainly because I stopped taking courses for a few years and now I am in a program that pays tuition up-front through my job. 

My question is, should I take out another $3500 subsidized loan? I still have about 2 years left on my degree and have begun paying down the first loan. Recently I paid off one of my credit cards using my savings as I was at the end of my grace period with no interest payments. My other card only has a few hundred dollars on it because of the books I had to purchase for the next semester (This amount will be reimbursed by my employer). I'm caught between just saving and paying down my initial loan as much as possible before I graduate and taking out a new loan as I could really use the money to replace my laptop (current laptop was purchased when I began school in 2014, but I also do have a desktop PC so it's not the biggest need), replace my mattress (nearly 10 years old, no complaints but I feel as if it's time), and taking my car into the dealership to get the maintenance up to date (127,000 miles without any services outside of normal maintenance). Worst case scenario and I don't pay my loans off by the time I graduate, the loans have a 4.5% interest rate, which I don't think I will find a personal loan or credit card with that sort of rate any time in the near future and I would like to work on my credit score as I do have ambitions of purchasing a house sometime in the future.

If I were to take out the loan, obviously I would be paying it down immediately and either plan on saving or just paying back on the loan with any leftovers from the above mentioned items.

P.S. Sorry for the long post and congrats for making it through the wall of text.",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan Debt,"I graduated in May of 2018, got a good job that lets me afford things I want and still save &gt;30% of my income. I have a loan on my truck, and I have student loans. 

I began making payments on my ($24,600 principal) student loans in January of 2019, but a few weeks ago I noticed that the total amount I owe on my student loans has increased over the course of 2019. I elected to pay the recommended amount through the loan servicing company, which was \~$155/month, but have ended up worse off. From what I have gathered student loans are expected to be paid off in 10 years for loans of less than $30k, and based on that I would end up paying much more per month towards the end of the loan. 

Currently, the loan is broken into four separate installments (one for each year I borrowed). They are all federal direct unsubsidized loans with fixed interest rates between 3.51 and 4.41%. 

$6,114.91     4.410%

$7,689.16      4.200%

$5,426.74      4.040%

$6,924.56       3.510%

Through 2019 I funded my emergency fund savings and feel comfortable with the amount in there, but knowing I am getting less interest on that account than I am paying on the student loans, I am wondering if it is smarter to pay larger sums on the student loans instead of just saving more money. Also, is it better for me to try and take out a personal loan to pay off all of the separate installments and make them one loan instead? 

I am currently renting, but am looking into possibly buying property this year, but I want to figure out the student loans first and feel comfortable with my repayment plan. There must be more effective repayment plans than my current one. Any recommendations will be appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Traditional vs Roth decision with inheritance,"To get the obvious out of the way, I know the normal guidance is never count on inheritance.  On almost all accounts I agree with that, and I'm setting my family up to do well financially without any reliance on anything from either of our parents.  I'm not depending on getting the inheritance, I'm trying to plan for it.

There's one area where I'm not sure what to do and I'm looking for opinions because it seems to me this has become a situation where there's just no way of knowing the best option.

We're currently in the middle of the 24% federal tax bracket(about $240k income MFJ).  We also live in NJ, so state taxes are pretty high as well.  In a bubble, I don't think we'll ever cross into the next tax bracket based on our income and based on our spending I think we would likely be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.  As a result, I've been maxing out my Traditional 401k.  This is the right move for us based on our income and projected path to retirement based on our own careers.  

Here's the twist though.  Her parents are well off and my mother is likely to come into a significant amount of money in the next few years.  If both sets of parents were to die, we'd be looking at an inheritance of millions to the point where the investment returns would likely push us up to the 37% bracket.  With that taken into account, I should be prioritizing a Roth 401k since 24% will be looked at as ""the good old days"" where I wish I had that rate again.

That's what's causing my dilemma.  Ignoring the inheritance, a large Traditional balance is the answer.  Factoring it in, I should be focusing on Roth.  If I continue maxing my 401ks for the next 30 years, The difference could be a cost of several hundred thousand in additional taxes.

So do I continue saving as if I'm not going to get the money and go traditional as planned?  Or should I be considering this and shifting towards Roth?",finance

We had the lender run the numbers of just my wife being on the mortgage, but we're in a high cost of living area and her salary alone couldn't quite get us into the houses in our area. We have about 15% as a down payment after closing costs, so we'll be paying some PMI regardless.

Enjoy!","**Please note, this is a rough, rough ROUGH draft of ideas I had when thinking of a plotline and certain gameplay elements for Fable 4, So certain ideas or plot points that need focusing or exaggeration will be in bold, just as a jot down of initial ideas. Other than that, if you can look past loopholes, inconsistencies and the like, just open your imagination and have fun reading!**

· The magic of Might, Skill and Will is making an sudden and astounding comeback, and with the current might of mechanical engineering, technological and revolutionary marvels, many uses are found to harness this power in varying degrees to help with modern day life.

· However, this power can also be used to harness great evil, as megalomaniacal power-hungry bosses and corporations use it as part of their workforce, as many others attempt to use the Will unlock the secrets of “The Gate”, but to no avail, even with the past decades worth of experience. Legend has it that the person who unlocks it has access to untold levels of mana, almost on par with William the Black during the days of the old kingdom, a world now reduced to scribble stories, burnt books and mythical stories of “Heroes”.

· Meanwhile, in the darkest of shadows, under hushed tones and cavernous systems, lies the Cult of Blades, a conglomerate of fanatics obsessed with The Old kingdom, believing that The Gate isn’t some form of mana well, but is in fact the last opening to The Void, the ancient otherworldly dimension, faced by William Black, or Scythe, during the darker days of the old kingdom when Jack/Queen/Knight of Blades ruled nefariously over Albion. In reality, prior to the events of Fable 1, the court created the gate as a last ditch effort of escape, should they be defeated. Realising their power and connection to the void, they order several more built during their rule by the common people, as an act of defiance, they deliberately sabotaged them, rendering them useless after William the Black. With the gate being built and their defeat successful, a prophecy would come about of “The world to end all worlds”, and the return of The Court would submit the world under a newer, more prevalent darkness than ever seen before.

**PLOT NOTE: With regards to the faux gates, I feel like there's a missing prospect involving the demon doors and their significance around Albion. However, it'd be hard to include them mostly around William The Black's timeline after the defeat of the court without him somehow mentioning their real purpose/power; The gates were never mentioned in the series up until this point, so it seems somewhat forced in order to keep the story going, in my opinion, but I certainly like their significance (or lack thereof) in the story, especially on the leadup to the ending, demon doors or not.**

· Our story starts off with our hero leading an exuberant life in Albion, family, children, and the idyllic home life. Simple chores begin yet another day, before his tasks lead him to being approached by a mysterious red robed figure, telling him that while his deeds are that of a modern person, they have much more consequences that they seem to realise. This figure, of course, is Theresa, and while she is not round with the player as much as previous games, she is still in the distance, watching your every move, but not interacting. 

**PLOT NOTE: One of the plot points in the prologue involve a dream sequence prior to meeting Theresa, where PC is walking/running through a straight, narrowing hall, not of walls, but red-robed figures turning to face him as he goes past, eventually hitting a large gate, before turning around to face red-robed figures turn to black, accompanied with screams of the damned before waking up.**

· Eventually, one of your quests involves saving a young man from a group of bandits, who thanks you for your help and invites you to help explore an abandoned cave system in search for treasure, or maybe even a Mana Well, if you’re lucky. What the expedition does uncover, however, is The Gate, inside a massive open cave, sealed inside rock wall with what looks to be a blood ritual sigil on the floor required to open it. Thinking nothing of it, you return to the town and continue on.

· Later that night, Assassins from the Cult of Blades attacks you and your family, leaving you as the survivor for unknown reasons. This prompts you to hunt them down in a fit of rage and sorrow, but not before your travelling companion vows to help you (mainly for the sense of adventure it seems)

· Your travels lead you all over Albion, with various remnants being out of place landmarks indicating the previous games locations, (dilapidated boasting platforms, ruins, various sigils similar to that of the Guild Seal) with one of your adventures leading your duo to a vast library, mostly on the history of the old kingdom and the Heroes Guild, which in the modern day, would be seen as a sanctuary and facility to mana-users, well away from their nefarious power hungry bosses, reintroducing the Heroes Guild in the game and placing the player in charge of it, now known as “Heroes Haven”. Theresa chimes in once more, saying that this level of power is becoming of you and your destiny, while mere starting blocks, will lead you on the path to greatness, but at what cost?

· Quest cards are reintroduced and the economy begins booming once more, if slightly, as deeds and various mercenary work is offered alongside the haven. Mana practice is rudimentary at best, but makes apprentices more prevalent, as well as revolts and strikes in the main cities against their masters. Your actions are justly applied to these scenarios, should you quell them and get paid an extortionate amount, or stand by your heroes and fight the system of injustice. Your friend, accompanying you with these quests, takes note and verbally voices his opinion on the matters quite frequently, questioning your actions or agreeing wholeheartedly; repetition creates normalcy for him, as your actions, while morphing your character just like in previous games, creates the personality for your adventurer companion.

· As years go by without incident of the Cult, will users and apprentices go missing, sometimes on quests, never to be heard from again. You, head of the Haven, with your companion go out once more to investigate. It becomes apparent that the Cult have had severe problems and setbacks throughout the years, often attempting to open the fake gate (found elsewhere from the one you found), and have since been kidnapping will users and sacrificing their will and mana essence to a ritualistic pit. Bodies of hundreds of people lie in this ruin, all seemingly discarded with no prevalent result.

**DESIGN NOTE: the Cult of Blades followers have a varying presence about them. While most wear masks resembling their idols in pattern, they are often misconstrued in design and come across more monstrous than normal, revealing broken stitched smiles, darker or alternative colour schemes, with the sacrifices darkening their appearance and bodily presence into more wraith-like reflexes and speed, indicating loyalty and strength levels. Lesser units are just typical fanatics akin to painted bandits with daggers and robed assassin like characters.**

· After slaughtering this offshoot of the cult, your investigations lead to finding an excerpt from a book called “The Bloodline”, indicating that the Cult was grabbing any and all magic will users to sacrifice in the hope that one of them is a descendant of the Archon bloodline in order to open the gate; were it not the Archon blood, their magic essence would be fed into the void in order to sate the courts hunger and power; essentially, if they can’t get the gate open, they’re still making the court much more powerful for when they do come back. It becomes apparent at this point that the duo must now find the archon descendant before the cult, and if all else fails, protect the true gate.

· At this point, Theresa begins to become a much more involved character, sensing that her bloodline is in danger once again, but at a much higher sense of dread. She takes our heroes to the spire as a respite to plan their next move. Player decides who to leave in charge of the Haven while on the long-term quest. Whilst here, Theresa informs the player of her relation to the bloodline, even going as far as mentioning her brother in canon context (All good, plus TLC) and even minor interactions with Scythe. At this point she asks the player to stand on a platform, hopefully indicating that he is part of the bloodline. However, the player is not. Our companion does so, and is in fact a descendant. PLOT TWIST!!!!!

**DESIGN NOTE: Possible inclusion that adds to Theresa’s character development arc that her years on the spire, in its archaic, destroyed nature still harbours dark energy that has had a slow but weaking impression on her form and mana, slowly subjecting her to becoming evil, complete with somewhat rageful outbursts or moral questioning; “I don’t see why you didn’t just kill them, they would’ve done the same and no one would’ve been none the wiser.”**

· All the actions of our hero never truly mattered to the world, but they did to our companion, whose taken your personal views into consideration and possible normalcy (because slaughtering bandits in their camp without quest or reason will make him HATE bandits), as well as your morality and quest actions, etc. It also comes down to how you handled various situations in the haven (apprentices coming to blows, accidental will damage, stealing, break-ins etc, whether you bought a library for historical knowledge and studies, etc) as well as villager interactions, etc etc. **Basically, while you believe your actions mattered to you and those around you, your actions matter more TO THE MAIN CHARACTER OF THE STORY, making you essentially an advisor to a character whose specific views will shape how the world becomes; more on that later!**

· With this revelation, the trio witness a cataclysmic event at one of the villages from the tower; think the Oakvale village attack in the beginning of Fable 1, amplify it by 1000. It’s complete chaos, buildings on fire, people running for their lives, being flayed alive, and the culprits are none other than a massed horde of Blades cultists, having tracked down another important piece of ancient technology imperative to their cause, but their done being devious and sly about their intentions and secretive cult. murder spree incoming! A huge fight commences. Retreating back to the Haven, you and a number of apprentices, mercenaries and will users fight with your cause, but depending on who you put in charge of the haven and your relationship with them, they will either bring reinforcements for your cause, or betray you inside the haven. 

· It’s a slim-win/crushing defeat depending on the outcome, but your numbers are now vastly slimmed. You question your advisors of the haven what to do next, with one of them indicating he “knows a guy”. He directs you to a port to a large battle barge just off the coast, “The Soul Tearer”, to meet with the captain about possibly recruiting reinforcements, in the form of bandits, with the captain being none other than REAVER, sailing from town to town, also being a minor inclusion in other disappearances, possibly relating to the Cult, to sacrifice to the shadow court for his immortality, which he has obviously over-exemplified with his legendary finesse and youth. You inform him of the situation, who sent you, and he will hear none of it. Theresa drops in again to give him a quick joking incentive of “You know im still haunting you.” Completely taken aback from this, he agrees to help, for a fee (and knowingly obvious that he’ll most likely betray you later), he shores up his men for the Haven, meets our hero, etc etc pleasantries out the way. 

· The cult by this point, still not having what they need, are growing more and more relentlessly powerful, uncovering old kingdom artifacts and old powerful spells. At some point, however, they begin hearing voices, seeing visions of the old world, slowly but surely following the pathways of the old kingdom to locate the true gate, as per their knowledge, and begin a quest; to find the shards of the broken Sword of Aeons.

· Our heroes, scowering the knowledge of the old kingdom library, also come across this information and set off to do the same. Our player is ambushed at a point, and taken to a gladiatorial pit by the cult (ARENA BATTLES, ONE MORE TIME!), facing off against ever increasing lunatics, cultists, and even demonic possessed disciples, just to visually indicate the severity of the situation. Player manages to break out, racing to a decrepit forest, facing off hordes of the cultists while Theresa attempts to psychically link up an old cullis gate with a direct link to the Spire. It works, but the player is transported elsewhere. The cult are now knowledgeable of the cullis gate existence, and moreover questionable as to HOW it was activated. They make their way to the spire, with Theresa being incredibly weakened by the link due to her age and lack of will power.

· More fighting off a daunting and unrelenting cult force. Despite you and your companions efforts, they kidnap Theresa, unknowing of her true bloodline, but very sceptical. The time to wait and see and grovel is over. The numbers you acquired from Reaver, The Haven, public image, various quests, etc. all comes to a head at this pivotal moment in time. You gather a large enough force to take the fight to the Cult in the heart of a HUGE sacrifical encampment, which was one of the villages that you lost contact with quests before after leading a shifty group of “Skorm fans” to it **(if not you, then one of your companions will talk about doing it, with humourous results; “I’m not even kidding you, that balverine tore that guy apart and played with his corpse like a ragdoll! It was incredible. Shame I had to put him down…Would’ve fed him the rest.”)** The fight is barbaric and a just cause, hoping to get to Theresa before they figure out the truth. In the ensuing chaos, you lost track of our Archon Hero, but continue to press forward to save Theresa.

· You arrive too late, as she lies there on a stone altar, about to be sacrificed, with the Sword of Aeons lying adjacent, still in shards. winds of chaotic Will magic score the air with the scent of blood and fire, as it drives into her chest. The cause came to an abrupt end with her death, as her aged, experience and everlasting soul was reaped from her body and into the sword, finally alongside her mother once again, as the sword completed itself into the fear-mongering sword of legend. The cult had figured out the necessity to unlocking the gate; it didn’t need direct souls to open the gate, it needed the sword as a key, full to the brim with souls in order to open it and feed the final pieces to the void and the court to ensure their return.

· An apocalyptic race back to the real gate, the defenders fending off more hordes of cultists, ravenous monsters, mutants and undead. You arrive very narrowly, as scores of dead commoner, guard and mercenary litter the cave path to the gate. You come across Reaver in the large hall, staving off relentless attackers before being impaled from behind. You fight them off and haul him to the wall, uttering the words “I think I’m done being immortal for a day.” Before dying. The cave then releases a quake of near unearthly proportions and realise the gate is opening.

· You race into the domain of the beginning of the end. Dark forces sparking electricity and screams from the never-ending Abyss of The Void. Standing on the precipice of the never-ending void, stands the antagonist. He bites into his carnal nature once more and begins a duel. Regardless of the outcome, he baits you into a feign attack and drives you to the ground, about to deal the killing blow, a sword thrusts through his chest from behind. Archon Hero delivered the backstab that saves your life, leaving you both to deal with the void and the sword. Realising his destiny as the last living descendant of the Archon bloodline, AH decides “fuck this” and jumps straight into the void with the sword, tagging you along to face off against the Trio of the Court in a vast empty open space, similar to that of [The Four Kings from Dark Souls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkBIV5FjdTI), only with less black and more electricity, fire, lava and magic, a distorted and darker version of Temple of Avo playing in the background.

· Each one of the court presides in 1 of each magic ability (Strength, Skill &amp; Will, being both their strength &amp; weakness) so it essentially becomes a test of stamina when fighting against them individually; Knight of Blades resembling Strength, essentially a stand-up sword fight. Queen of Blades resembling Skill, with admirable feats of speed, stamina and catching the player off guard and being resoundingly sneaky. Last up, Jack of Blades. Resounding user of Will Magic, will occasionally sword-fight.

· Upon defeating all 3 inhabitants of the void, all seems relatively at ease. SURPRISE, FOURTH BOSS IS A CONGLOMERATE OF ALL 3! Shape shifting abilities, jumping between all 3 areas of Strength, Skill and Will, also VERY OCCASIONALLY TURNING INTO THE JACK OF BLADES DRAGON FROM TLC.

· Defeating this one, has no desired effect, as you are tossed aside in the room as AH is left alone to face off against this monstrosity. The room erupts with fiery magic and flame, AH tapping into his ancestral blood and using all his might to finish the demonic entities. Throwing you the sword and fending them off with his Will, He tells you to run, to get out of the void as he’s fulfilling his destiny, all that typical uber hero jibber jabber, but it comes to a choice, either leave him there and run, or grab him and escape. 

· The option to leave him there, as he requested, involves you, sword in hand, jumping out of the void and turning the sword into the dais, forever sealing the gate shut once more and breaking the blade within the insert, leaving AH to die and sealing the void forever. While the battle has been won and apocalypse once again averted, you come to the realisation “Was it worth it?” as you walk past bodies of your friends and fighters alike, strewn throughout the cave, walking alone back into society, AH living on as a legend, the world remembers him and memorialises him, while you live your life in his shadow of differing opinions of morality, pondering what could’ve been different.

· However, grabbing him and escaping involves running to the creature, driving the blade through what could only be described as it’s head, stunning it temporarily, before pulling the blade out, grabbing AH and narrowly escaping the jaws of death. AH turns the Dais, closes the gate, breaks the blade, mission complete. He himself near enough has a breakdown, feeling like he himself is responsible for the dead around him, culminating in this epic moment, lost more than it was worth. You comfort him, saying anyone in the same position would’ve done the same thing. He questions this, and as your character walks away into the darkness of the cave, AH trailing behind, he hears a voice, resonating from inside the remnants of the blade hilt he was still carrying.

personalfinance,Bank not allowing me to refinance or lower my interest rate,"Hello,

So not sure if anything can help with this but I bought a car a year ago and got the loan from my car through Capital One. When buying my car my interest rate was high 11.6% interest rate. Now I only have had a credit card for less then a year so the deal said thats why my interest rate is so high because I haven't had credit for a while but they assured me that as long as I pay on time for a year I can call and ask them to refinance or lower my interest rate. Fast forward one year later and I've paid my car loan on time, put a little extra every month, have amazing credit and called Capital One only for them to tell me that 1. They do not refinance car loans and 2. they do not lower interest rates. Sorry but that seems wrong or illegal. Or am I just being naive? I feel like a company should hold another person hostage for this but they said the only way is to trade in my car. Again I feel like this is not right but anyone out there can help or give advice I would really appreciate it!",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage for Independent Contractor help,"Last September, I started a new job as an independent contractor in a new field (programming). I'm in an area with a low cost of living and would like to look into purchasing a home. I have a high income (over six figures), extensive savings, and a high credit score (+790). When I spoke with a mortgage broker they told me that I have no options because I need two years of tax returns as an independent contractor. 

I was wondering if this is true that I have no options? I feel like I have an overall strong application except for the work history part. I've been continuously employed for many years, but this is my first time working as an independent contractor. If there are loans that I qualify for, would it make sense to get one with a higher interest rate? Would that be more expensive than just taking a two year hit on rent that I'd need to get my tax returns in order? I'd appreciate any advice. Thanks!",finance

Please feel free to PM me with questions; I am happy to discuss the program, its curriculum, and Chicago's civic technology community.",technology
personalfinance,Lender bait and switch?,"I am trying to get my house refinanced, partly because the federal rates are low and some personal reasons.
My current lender is fine but I hunted for other loan estimates, and received one that sounds too good to be true.
One of the reasons why the payments are low in this LE is because the mortgage insurance is 69 while other two lenders are asking for 90 and 190.
The LE with the best offer mentions that the MI is pending on final approval of the loan and for final approval I have to appraise the house which will cost me $500, much higher than the other lenders. I am wondering if this lender is trying to bait and switch. What if he changes the MI on final approval and I am down by $500 on the appraisal. Can he really keep the MI conditional on loan approval?",finance

business,Trying to figure out how to legally hire my spouse as an employee?,"Background: I own an LLC as a sole proprietor. I am a psychologist, she is a therapist. While I am already licensed in South Carolina, she is still working on her SC license, so she can't yet see patients in the SC office (though she can see them in Georgia, where we live). 

According to the IRS website, I am what is considered to be a ""disregarded entity."" However, that also means that I can't hire anyone else or I have to change my designation? At least that's what it looks like. How can I hire my spouse as an employee in order to qualify for group health benefits while she is still working on her license in SC. At this point in time, my spouse will not be taking in any income, however it will be through the business.  Is there anyway to have her as a 0 income employee, qualifying the LLC for group health benefits, and not break any tax, federal, or state laws? What would be her tax obligation and what would be mine?

personalfinance,Bank of America suddenly closed my account citing fraud/ID theft. What to do?,"I applied for a BoA account Jan. 6 and was approved and told to look out for my debit card. A letter comes to me just now, dated Jan. 7, stating that my account has been closed. It doesn't list a reason, but it does state that this could affect my ability to open an account with them in the future, and that they may report their decision to one or two early warning services that could hinder my ability to open accounts everywhere for up to 5 years.

I called BoA immediately and the only information the representative was able to give me was that I had been marked for fraud/ID theft. This is preposterous. The only crime I've committed is paying my bills on time every month and being extremely responsible with credit. The rep told me she could connect me to someone else who could give me more information, but as is often the case with these types of phone calls, after she transferred me, I received an automated message informing me that the office is closed and to call back during normal business hours (i. e. when I'm working).

I'm running out of options. I'm 22 years old and have been sharing a bank account with my parents for my entire life. The interest rates are abysmal, and although my parents are trustworthy, they routinely change the password without telling me and it's like pulling teeth to get the new one. They also refuse to let me open accounts with (for example) Wealthfront to get a better interest rate, as that would involve giving our shared banking information to a third party. 

Several months ago, I tried to open an account with the online bank Redneck Banking because of their excellent interest rates. I was declined, and once again sort of just waved away when I called to ask why. No definitive reason was given, and they said apply again in six months.

I'm not married to Bank of America. I just need a bank that will let me store my money there. I'm not trying to do anything fancy. Does anyone have recommendations for what I can do? I work full-time and do not have the time, energy, or resources to spend hours and hours trying to shake information out of people. And this ID theft nonsense really has me worried.

personalfinance,Paying off debts in full vs. making payments and keeping a healthy bank account?,"Hello Everyone,

I am posting from a new account that will focus on me rebuilding my financial health and improving my credit score.

Long story short, I screwed up while I was younger and got into credit card debt for various reasons. I am now 27 and have paid off all of my high interest debt and am now at a job that allows me to start planning out my finances for years to come. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little bit about me

Job: Community Director of a student housing property

Salary: $52,000

Bonuses &amp; Commissions: $15,000

Perks: Free 2 bedroom town home, free internet and cable, trash and sewer/water

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my current finances

High Interest Checking: $13,000 (4% annual yield up to $15,000, $60 max monthly)

Secondary Checking : $1000

Stocks: $3700

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly Expenses

Car Loan: $260

Car Insurance :160

Electricity: $150 (Estimate)

Groceries: $200

Gas: $60

Gym Membership: $22

Student Loans: $61

Cell Phone Plan: $130 (I pay for my younger sister as well)

Various Internet Subscriptions: $50

Flex Spend (Misc): $250

Total = $1343

&amp;#x200B;

The way my budget works allows me to contribute $500 to my stock options and put about $1300-$1500 in my checking every month (more if I get bonuses). I am wondering if it is better to pay off my debts in full and move forward in life debt free or keep making monthly payments and keep a healthy number in my checking account.

&amp;#x200B;

Debts

Car Loan: $7200 at 4% interest rate ($260 minimum monthly payment)

School Loans: $5800 at 4% interest rate ($61 monthly minimum payment)

&amp;#x200B;

So after all this I am wondering which option should I do moving forward? I have already taken my credit score from the mid 400s to about 660 and am looking to increase it further but am unsure if paying off these accounts and then subsequently getting closed will hurt or help my case as I will only have one credit card open with a $3000 limit, and I heard that closing accounts can negatively impact your credit, at least in the short term.

Husband’s base salary is $350,00/year. For any extra shifts he works, he gets paid extra. These show up on his paystubs as “Staffing Bonus” (even though it’s just picking up a shift from someone else). As far as I can tell, these are taxed accordingly by his employer (as his Fed. Withholding is higher on paystubs where he worked these extra shifts)

Am I correct in assuming that on the W-4 calculator, I put these separately under “Bonuses” and check that his employer takes off applicable taxes?

personalfinance,Just found out I'm responsible for paying off loans that I cosigned on. Should I withdraw from retirement accounts to help pay down principal?,"31F, single, no kids, lives in US

**Debt:**

Without revealing too much personal info, I have $155k in loans from delinquent family members that I cosigned and am legally responsible for paying off. Nothing to sell assets-wise from these loans that I can use to help with this.

The $155k is two auto loans (seriously, these fucking dickheads) - one has $75k remaining with 4.7% APR, the other has $80k at 6%. They both are scheduled to end in Oct 2025 (69 more payments, nice) and the minimum monthly payment is \~$1300 apiece.

EDIT: Cars (and family members) are nowhere to be found. Selling them is not an option since I don't have possession of them or know where they are.

**Financial situation:**

Monthly take-home is $6500/month after taxes, insurance, and the minimum 401k contributions to get max company match.

Monthly essentials are $2000 for my rent/utils/groceries/ongoing medical stuff. No car, I live in a walkable neighborhood. I'm less than 2 miles from work, friends, and the few good members of my family. This ""essentials"" number seems high, but I'm in a rent-controlled place (with roommates). I could probably save $500/mo in rent by moving to a cheaper place, but it would take me to a neighborhood/city where I'd have to buy a car (offsetting most/all of the rent savings). Plus, my commute would go up 60-90 min, and it would effectively isolate me from friends/family/partner.

$6500 take home - $2000 essentials - $2600 for minimum monthly loan payments = $1900 leftover for fun money and paying down debts faster.

No other debts/obligations. $10K in checking. No savings. Retirement has $310k ($120k Roth IRA, $170k Traditional 401k, $20k Roth 401k). I'd estimate $60K of that is Roth contributions that are over 5 years old.

Expected to get a bonus in March of $3k (after taxes), and $2k-3k in state/federal tax returns around the same time.

Credit score is \~650. It was 780 until recently - the loans went 90 days without being paid (that's when the banks reached out to me and let me know that I was months behind, and I had to use half of my emergency fund to catch up on the missing payments + late fees). One of my credit cards has a feature where it estimates your credit score, and it says I'm at 650 now.

**Questions:**

Can I refinance this much in auto loans to get a better interest rate? Will my updated credit score screw me? Should (can) I roll them into a personal loan? Should use retirement funds to pay principal down? Finally, should I take out just the estimated $60k that's penalty-free or should I take out more than that?

Thank you lovely redditors, I'm struggling to accept with the fallout of all of this (massive debt, failing to realize how dumb cosigning loans is, basically losing relationships with family members over this), and I am extremely grateful for your advice on how to start fixing things :)",finance
personalfinance,What are the important things to compare when choosing between different mortgage lenders?,"Hi PF,

My wife and I are buying a home, and are a bit confused as to which loan offer is best. Obviously a low interest rate is good, but is buying a low interest rate worth x amount of money? Obviously it saves you more over the life of the loan, but is it worth all of the other fees, etc.

personalfinance,Why would a highly qualified buyer put 20% down on a house?,"About to buy a house in the jumbo loan price range for the first time (previous home was conventional) and shocked at the minimal difference a higher downpayment makes. 

We have a couple options:

1) 5/5 ARM, 2.85% at all downpayment levels: literal no change in rate for higher payment, just a change in PMI ($135 per month on a $650K loan after 10% down). I will likely take these terms and refi if rates start to trend up significantly after year 3 or so.


2) 30-year fixed, 3.6% with 20% down vs 3.75% with 10%: Bigger difference here since 10% would have both higher interest rate and ~$130 PMI but not enormous.

In both cases, PMI would definitely be gone in 2 years or less since i have the cash to get to the 80% LTV if I want plus home is in a market/neighborhood where real estate has been appreciating rapidly (will likely slow but unlikely to be negative barring economic collapse).

Given the above - why exactly are well qualified buyers still putting 20% down upfront vs keeping the cash to reduce risk? With interest rates this low it seems like keeping the cash is the obvious better answer, even if you assume you only get 2-3% back on the cash from low risk investments.

I live at home with my parents and have been throwing all my money at loans. I thought I could last longer at home but I am losing my mind and frankly I am pretty depressed being here. I live in a tiny ass room and just cannot do it anymore. I am also not a fan at all of my hour+ commute.

Is it crazy to pay around $1700 a month for rent on a place within walking distance to work while also paying \~$1300 a month on student loans? my monthly take home is around $4300. I do not have any other bills maybe just $100 for my insurance and $35 for a gym membership and Spotify. Ideally after all this and groceries I would have around 1k to throw at loans or save.

Being walking distance to work would mean saving money on gas and parking which i would be spending on rent instead.

I will have an emergency fund of around 8K or more if i wait an extra month. I am paid ahead on the parent plus loans so if times got bad i can skip a couple monthly payments but I will 100% avoid this if possible. What do you guys think? Am i stupid?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I do not want roommates after college. just cant do it. 

Edit 2: before I started I agreed w my boss for a 10k raise every six months (slows at 90k). I am due one in June. Does that change anything?",finance
Banking,Are payroll deductions the only means of depositing to an HSA?,"If your bank is the custodian of your HSA, can you walk into the bank and make deposits yourself (up to the federal limit of course), or can it only be done through payroll deduction?",finance
Banking,Chase - 2 issues in 12 days - no resolution - fed up with support - what do I do?,"I’ve been a Chase customer for over 8 years.  The convenience has been excellent and the tech and app have all worked flawlessly.  

Until 12 days ago...

Part A

1. On New Year’s Day I saw a charge on my Sapphire reserve that I didn’t make.  So called chase and reported it.  They immediately closed the card account (told me the fraudulent charge had occurred through Apple Pay?) and issued a new card number.

2. As soon as this happened, all of my cards and debit cards had become disabled in my Apple Pay wallet on my iPhone.  I was unable to re-add them, continuously getting an error that told me to call the card carrier.  I was able to add the cards to my wife’s iPhone, and was able to add a card from a different bank to my phone.  Telling me that this was a Chase issue.

3. Called chase (many times before reaching someone that seemed to have an answer) and was told that Apple Pay would start working once I received my new physical card and activated it.  Great, I’ll give it a shot.

4. Card arrived, activated, Apple Pay still not working for any of my Chase bank cards.  Called back, case was escalated to the “research team” and id receive a call in 1-3 days.

5. Obviously missed the call while I was at work.  Called back the number and extension that was left in my voicemail.  No one answered.  Left multiple messages with call back numbers.

6. Called regular support one more time - was told they closed the case, there’s nothing to do, call back in 30 days to see if they resolved the issue.  I was incredibly disappointed with this response....

7. Have continued to try to reach the research team with no luck, have requested the case be reopened - still awaiting another call back.

Part B

1. While waiting for part A to resolve, I went to deposit a check through mobile deposit.  My limit had been $5k per day over the last few years with no issues.  All of a sudden it was dropped to $2k for no apparent reason.  As a result, I could not deposit the check.

2. Called support - was told there was no explanation, there was nothing they could do.  It’s just “how the system works” and essentially too bad.  Asked to escalate and was told no.

It’s starting to seem like no one at chase is capable of assisting or at the very least providing an explanation as to why these things have happened.

My assumption is something to do with the fraudulent charge on my card?  No one has confirmed that, and I don’t understand why I would be penalized for that.

The convenience of Apple Pay and mobile deposits, which are frankly the two main reasons I even use chase, have suddenly disappeared over the last 12 days with no explanations or help from support after 8 years of satisfaction.

All I would like is a little bit of help or at least an explanation and to not just be told “it’s how the system works”....

TLDR

Fraud on a credit card, all chase cards no longer work on Apple Pay, separately mobile deposit limits suddenly dropped significantly after 8 years and support essentially told me “too bad, that’s how it is.”

Please help, or suggest a new bank that may be as convenient as Chase used to be....",finance
personalfinance,"Newly married, tax time coming, do we save for a house down payment or pay off credit card debt?","Hi everyone this is my first post but I have read lots of helpful information.  My now wife and I just got married this previous August and we are settling in with our budget.  We have about $13,000 in credit card debt between the 2 of us, on about 6 different accounts.  All of the interest rates are between 19% and 26%.  We are starting from scratch with our savings account and after paying the minimum balance on all cards and all other bills/necessities are paid for and we do not miss work for any reason we come out with about $1,000 leftover monthly to delegate however we please.  With tax returns coming up, we are wondering if we should save our tax returns and our $1,000 monthly and replace our $1600 rent with hopefully a lower mortgage or should we attack our debt and start from scratch with our down payment savings and a clean slate?",finance

personalfinance,Possible Tax Advice/Explanation for Young Adult Making &lt;$30k,"hey guys!

I'm super... duper confused on my taxes. so a brief summary so you can more or less guess how i'm filing. I'm single, support, spend basically all my income supporting myself on necessities. (to give you a hint, I make 28k a year and spent more than a third of my income on rent alone. not even utilities).

I work full time, no dependants, only worked in one state, only one source of income through my employer.  I claimed 1 on both my state and federal withholding. for the entire year. I've used turbotax to do my taxes this year. I haven't clicked file yet, but turbotax is giving me the following.

Federal Return: $292 ( $1973 withheld)

State Return: $140 ($1755 withheld)

So my question is...How is this?

&amp;#x200B;

I definitely can't afford a CPA or whatever it's called to help me out with this Last year I only made 10k and got back the following:

Federal Return: $531 ($531  withheld)

State Return: $321 ( $ 565.97 withheld)

I got that back and I claimed 2 in 2018, this year i claimed 1. So i get why i got that much back last year, because I made less than 12k or whatever. but how in the fuck am i only getting $335 back out of $3728. and that's just income tax. please.... if nobody can help, at least please explain how a 20 year old making barely enough to support himself in an expensive city pays more in taxes than a $11b company.",finance
personalfinance,Invest $4170/month towards index funds or towards mortgage’s principal?,"My goal is to pay off my house by the time I am 35 years old. I am currently 26 years old and I live in the Bay Area, CA. I did my due diligence and searched ""investing vs paying mortgage"", but it really depends on a case by case basis.  About 1.5 years ago, I bought a house costing me $635k and as of now I currently have a $388k mortgage. I am renting my house and my tenants are paying me $2500/month. I have a 30 year mortgage with a 5.37% interest rate. The only reason why it is so high was because I had a low paying job at the time and I was in a rush to get a house right away since my dad was my cosigner and he was extremely sick. I will 100% for sure refinance to get a better interest rate. I recently got a new job paying $100k/yr. I currently have a little over $100k in my Viobank savings (1.95% interest) and no debt at all. Because I am a vandweller, I spend an average of $1000-$1200 (mortgage not included) a month for my cost of living. After taxes I earn [$5,923/month](https://i.imgur.com/0AqW2dn.png) and each month and I need to decide if I should allocate $4170/month ($50k/yr) towards my mortgage’s principal or if I should invest that $4170/month to index funds. As of now I am leaning towards investing in index funds. If I invest in index funds ([10% returns](https://www.financial-planning.com/slideshow/index-funds-with-the-best-returns-over-10-years-led-by-technology)), I will end up with up with [$969,765](https://i.imgur.com/oORW1tT.png) ($775,812 after paying 20% capital gain tax) in 10 years and then I will be able to pay my mortgage and have a bit extra. In addition I recently discovered about mortgage interest deduction which I need to do a bit more research on. 

Please tell me what are your thoughts. I do understanding paying extra towards my mortgage gives a peace of mind. However index funds gives about 10% interest rate which is extremely enticing.

TLDR: Allocate $4170/month ($50k/yr) towards mortgage’s principal ($388k mortgage) or invest in index fund and pay off my mortgage after 10 years?",finance

personalfinance,Unorthodox idea to pay off my debt. Advice Needed,"My goal is to be debt free from my mortgage and 2 auto loans so I can decrease my overall monthly expenses. I'd like to invest and start my own business, but would feel more comfortable taking that risk once my major debt has been paid off. I've heard from all my friends that I should start paying off my highest interest rate loans first, and then move on to the next highest rate after. Instead of following the highest interest rate first method, my idea is to pay off the debt that has the highest monthly payments first, so I can use that additional cash flow as additional payments for the next loan. Everyone I've asked advised against it. Here is my idea:

Current monthly savings from Income: $4,000  
Current liquid savings: $100,000

Mortgage Balance: $175,000, Monthly Payment $1,040, Interest Rate: 3.625%  
Car #1 Balance: $62,000, Monthly Payment: $1,200, Interest Rate: 4.49%  
Car #2 Balance: $75,000,  Monthly Payment: $1,600, Interest Rate: 3.24%

Month 0: Use $62k of my liquid savings and pay off Car #1. Keep the remaining $38k as my safety cushion money. Free up $1,200/month

Month 1: Start making $5,200 additional payments on Car #2. $1,200 from the free cash flow from Car #1 and $4,000 from monthly savings from income.

Month 11: Car number 2 will be paid off. Free up $1,600/month. Now I have $2,800/month of freed up cash flow from both auto loans being paid off.

Month 11:  
Option 1: Start making $6,800 additional payment on the mortgage. $1,200 from the free cash flow from Car #1, $1,600 from the free cash flow from Car #2, and $4,000 from monthly savings from income.  
Option 2: Deposit the $6,800/month into a savings account. Accumulate it until you have enough to cover the remaining principal on the mortgage balance. Pro: I have liquid money available for what ever emergency. Con: I will pay an additional $7k in interest.

Month 37: Mortgage will be paid off from Option 1.  
Month 38: Mortgage will be paid off from Option 2.  
Month 38: Start saving $7,840/month. $1,200 from Car #1, $1,600 from Car #2, $4,000 from my monthly savings from income, and $1,040 from my mortgage.  
Month 46: Liquid savings reached back to the $100,000 mark.

Does this make sense? Or should I follow the traditional method of paying off Car #1 first, then mortgage, then Car #2 because of their respective interest rates.",finance

personalfinance,Should I max out my retirement savings?,"My wife an I make a combined $152k and live very comfortably. We currently put away $26k a year (including employer match) toward our retirement accounts. At retirement, we will be receiving a combined $84k (today's dollars) in pensions. We'll also have federal medical coverage. We could be investing more toward our retirement, but I'm questioning if that would be wise. By all projections, we would still have a considerable amount of wealth when we die. Does it ever make sense to invest less than you can afford?
Background info:
We are both 37 years old and can retire in 20 to 23 years.
Scheduled to be making a combined $199k in 9 years, so we'll have significant disposable income to invest
Current debts: Auto at $10k and 1.9%, SL at $45k and 7% (these are for my wife and she works at a school, we're actively looking into loan forgiveness, and if that seems unfeasible, this debt will become top priority) and mortgage at $270k and 4%.
We have roughly 5 months expenses in a savings account. We also have 2 children aged 4 and 6, and will be socking away a significant amount toward their education.",finance
personalfinance,I have my car loan with AFFCU and its bad...,"I have about 8k left on my car loan and I am finally at a place where I am paying above my monthly payment to get it payed off early; my goal is by summer 2021. However, multiple times now, I have mailed my payment weeks before to make sure it gets there on time, and they have not deposited before the due date of the payment. The check is mailed out before and dated before. The first time, they called me days later to say they got the original check, at which point I had paid over the phone and cancelled the check. 

They don't let me direct payment online unless it is from their savings account, which I don't want to use. Should I a. just call every month, sit on hold and pay over the phone, b. do nothing, c. use their saving account and just transfer money over, or d. refinance. The interest rate is pretty high (9.5%) as I got it when my credit score was \~100 points lower than it is now.

Edit: Refinanced to lower rate (yay), still plan on paying more than the minimum payment and in the process of switching to Ally for bill pay etc. Thanks again r/pf !",finance

personalfinance,Cons to a longer loan term,I am taking out a HEL for debt payoff purposes. The lender that I’m working with lowers interest rate if the term is extended. I intend to pay off the loan within 3 years. Is there a downside to paying off the loan in three years if I take out a 30 year term?,finance
personalfinance,Buying apartment condo with cash or mortgage in DC area?,"So I’m in the market to purchase a place, and recently decided that I would rather get a 1-bedroom and live on my own rather than getting a 2-bedroom and renting one out until such time as I have a live-in-SO again. I figure that if it comes to it I could rent out the place relatively easily and make some money off of it that way, while moving into another place. 

When making this shift I realized that I could afford to pay cash for some places, and still have a good amount left in savings, which I know is better in some ways and not as good in others. But I figure folks here can tell me if this is potentially a good decision or likely a disaster waiting to happen. 

Some stats:

Federal government job - $100K/annual salary (plus potential for some bonus and good pension/benefits)
Condo I am looking to buy: $193K
Condo fees (includes gas/electric/water/trash/any maintenance on the building, including plumbing and electrical within the walls): $630/month
Similar units rent for: $1500/month
Property taxes on similar units: $2300/annual
Liquid/semi-liquid savings: $260K
Retirement accounts: $200K
Best Mortgage rate available to me: 2.9%

I don’t really do a lot of investing aside from my tax-protected vehicles (max contributions to 401k and Roth IRA, not much aside from that). Would it make more sense to try to do more investing and get a mortgage, or pay cash and build up my savings a bit faster (since I would have lower monthly costs)? I don’t have a lot of other deductions so with the change in taxes a year or two ago I don’t think even with mortgage interest it makes sense to itemize. The one caveat about that is that I know that could change if I did move out and rent it out, as it would be deducted as a “business” expense.

personalfinance,Software Dev - Government or Contractor Job? How to quantify pension?,"At 33 years old, I have worked for the government for the past 10 years. My family and I are considering a move to a new city. Through my government work I have made many contacts at this new city, one of which has offered me a job. I am having trouble quantifying not only the cost of living difference but all the compensation my current job offers compared to what the new job offers. I was hoping that anyone from either side of this could provide their input/suggestions.

I am still trying to get numbers for the new position, but so far the comparison looks like the following:

Benefit | Govt | Cont
:--:|:--:|:--:
Pay|$100,000^1|$160,000^2
Health Insurance | $191 / biweekly paycheck | unknown
Dental Insurance | $33.11/ biweekly paycheck | unknown
Retirement matching | 5% | 3%
Paid time off | 20 days / year | None
Paid Federal Holidays off | 10 days / year | None
Sick Paid time off | 13 days / year| None

^1 : Low Cost of Living area

^2 : High Cost of Living area

The hardest thing I am having trouble comparing, and probably the most important is the pension that the government offers. The details of it can be found [here](https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/fers-information/computation/), but basically it boils down to the following equation:

X * Y * Z

X: The average of your three highest salaries. For example, if I worked for 4 years and got 70k, 80k, 90k, and 100k then this number would be 90k (average of 80k, 90k and 100k).

Y: .01 (1%) if under age 62 or age 62 with less than 20 years of service. .011 (1.1%) if age 62 with at least 20 years of service.

Z: Years of service

If my high 3 average was ~90k, and I only served 10 years, then this number would look like $9000 / year. That is a rough value of what its currently worth for me. If I worked here for 30 years, high 3 average was $120k then this number would look like 30 * $120,000 * .011 = $39,600 / year. So how do I quantify the opportunity cost of that pension?

The other potential thing that I am having trouble quantifying is the fact that if I work at least 5 years before retirement with the government, they will continue to cover their cost of the health insurance after retirement.

personalfinance,Good idea to refinance car loan if I'm paying it off within next 6 months?,"Have owned my car for the past year. 2018 Toyota Corolla, used. The loan was for about $10k. Since then, I've paid off about $2k of the car. The interest rate is at 8.2% , with a monthly payment of $190.

Fast forward to now, and we're pretty aggressively paying off debt. My credit score has jumped maybe 70 points since then, and is somewhere in the upper 700s depending on what tool you use. I pre-qualified on IFS via NerdWallet to refinance at about 4% over 72  months. It brings our monthly payment down over $60, which would be really great for us over the next 6 months. 

Is this something I should do? Is there any catch or downside to this? We're definitely paying the car off by June/July according to our schedule. This week I will be dropping money to finally eliminate our credit card debt entirely (another $190 a month).

It looks like I could get a lower interest rate if I go for a higher monthly payment for a shorter term....but if we're paying the car off indefinitely in 6 months, will it really matter all that much? Just want to make sure I'm making the right decision!",finance
personalfinance,Considering switching from Roth 401(k) to traditional,"My wife and I (both 27) have a combined annual income of roughly $150k. This puts us firmly in the **22%** ~~24%~~ federal tax bracket. We are also in a high-tax state (NJ).

Currently, I max a Roth 401(k) with 10% company contributions into a traditional 401(k). My wife maxes her Roth IRA. We also max an HSA account. Because of this, only the HSA contributions lower of taxable income.

Since I am starting to pay attention to taxes a little bit more, I have been thinking of switching my 401(k) contributions either wholly or partially to traditional, in an effort to shelter some of our income from the **22%** ~~24%~~ tax bracket.

~~Even though we are relatively young high-earners, I don't anticipate us ever reaching the 32% tax bracket (326,600 for married couples filing jointly), so we will likely stay in this same bracket for our earning careers~~. Thanks to u/kbc87 for pointing out that we are actually in the 22% tax bracket. This means we may reach the 24% tax bracket at some point. 

Additionally, we are savings aggressively for retirement in pursuit of an early retirement, when our expenses (and investment withdrawals) would likely be less than our earnings are today. I don't really have any insight on or care to try and predict if tax rates will rise or fall in the future.

Would it be foolish to switch to a 100% traditional 401(k) contribution strategy? Are there other factors that I am not considering that I should be?",finance
personalfinance,Thinking about purchasing a home in Colorado,"My girlfriend and I moved to Colorado 2 years ago so that I could take a new job. We have been renting since we moved. I have started my Masters degree, which my employer is paying for, that will take me 3 years to complete. My employer has a clause that says  I have to stay with them for 2 years after I complete my coursework. We will be in Colorado for a minimum of 5 more years.

I make $102K/yr before tax. My girlfriend is unemployed and in school, but has a large lump-sum of money. We are renting a small townhouse now for $1950. They houses that we are looking at are in the $385,000 range. I watched the Khan Academy Rent vs Buy videos  and using their framework I came to the conclusion that in my area/situation it's ~$7600/yr cheaper to buy a house [calculations](http://imgur.com/gallery/kS3TBGu). My assumptions were that I could get a 2.75% interest rate on a 15yr fixed loan and that we will put down 20%. Property taxes where we live are at 0.55% and I assumed 2K/yr in upkeep although the houses that we are looking at are brand new. I am currently taxed at around 25%. In the case of renting I assumed that we could get a 5% return on our $77K down payment money and subtracted that from the cost to rent per year.

What are some other things to consider? Do you have any suggestions on how I might structure this deal with my girlfriend? I have about $20K in savings and would likely depend on her to cover significantly more of the down-payment and pay her back until we are even over time.",finance

personalfinance,"Receiving a Small Windfall, Unsure What to do with It","In the next few weeks I will be receiving around $5,500.00 from the sale of items that my deceased grandfather gave to me. While I understand that that isn't a whole lot of money, it is fairly considerable for me. I'm unsure what to do with it to make the most of a good situation. Details below:  


\- I currently make around $41.5K annually - working full-time. I live in New York State (upstate) and am 24.  
\- I have a 6 month emergency fund which covers housing and utility costs - but not costs from loan payments.  
\- I otherwise have no savings. I have maybe $500-$1,000 extra dollars sitting in my checking account, but it fluctuates depending on my expenses.  
\- I have not yet started a 401K, but I do now have access to one - albeit a crappy one with no match - through my job. I haven't begun investing in it but plan to soon.  
\- I have an auto loan on a 7 year term requiring a minimum of $230 per month. I pay $350 per month, and have been for about 6 months in order to pay the car off faster. I don't know the interest rate off the top of my head, but it's pretty good by my understanding - maybe around 4%? I believe I owe around $10K on the vehicle.  
\- I have a total of $38,015 in private student loans at a 7.58% interest rate. I pay the minimum payment here of $520/month. This is broken into four loans of approximately $8,950, $10,500, and two at $9,300.  
\- I have a total of $19,250 in public student loans at rates between 4.04 and 4.41%. This is made up of four separate loans at $2,825, $6,225, $6,850, $3,350. I pay a few dollars over the minimum every month, at $260.  


My grandfather told me before he passed away that he wanted me to use this for something smart - he said a down payment on a house, but I don't really see that as being reasonable right now despite wanting a home someday. The only other relevant factor is that I would really like to propose to my girlfriend of five years soon. She doesn't want an expensive ring but I'd like to get something nice for her, and we have no savings for a wedding. Also, I don't know what the tax implications are for income like this? I don't think it was technically inheritance since it was not in his will and he gave it to me before he died.

personalfinance,Help with taxes during a buyout?,"(Throw away due to the amount of personal information)

Background: Me 32(M) - income of $135K with bonus, Wife 31(F) - income between $65 and 85k depending on hours.

I recently accepted a buy out offer from my company, and signed onto a new job with a signing bonus (salary is basically the same). At the same time, my old position offered a 457(f) where my new one does not so I will be forced to take the approximately 10K I had saved in there as income.

All told, I will be receiving approximately $75K in buyout/signing bonus/457(f) distributions. While it is great to have this problem, I am seriously concerned about the tax implications of this. I live in a very high-tax area and this injection of money (plus the amount I was previously putting into a 457b that will now be in my paycheck) will be taxed at an extremely high rate (over 40% once state/local/federal are all accounted for), and leads to other problems such as pushing us over the income limit for Roth IRA contributions, loss of tax credits for certain expenditures, etc..

Is there any way to defer taxes on this and/or lower our AGI for the year? Spread out the tax burden over several years? Anything? We don't need this money now and would be perfectly fine with putting it in some kind of retirement-like account we can't access until 59 1/2.

MachineLearning,[D] Model fairness: Practical steps for ML teams to avoid bias?,"I'm researching _practical steps_ that data science/ ML teams can take to ensure model fairness[1]. If you practice data science/ ML engineering in a regulated environment or where your work has the potential to significantly impact the wellbeing of people, I'd love to hear how you go about identifying bias in your data and models and ensure fairness. 

There's been plenty of recent research into model fairness and bias, but not yet much discussion around processes and practices that data science teams can adopt to systematically address these areas. (The [FairDM model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00176v2) is an interesting start, though.)

Some thoughts on how one might go about building fairness into standard practices:

# Exploratory data analysis includes evaluation for systemic biases
- Analysis of data includes removal or marking of features that are either directly related to protected sub-groups / classes (or similar) or are highly correlated with same.
- Data augmentation with public or proprietary datasets in order to achieve the above (e.g. augment zip codes with race distributions from census data in order to identify other features correlated with race).
- Analyze the risk that the training data itself is biased and likely to perpetuate systemic biases.

# Model training evaluation
- Evaluate metrics by subgroup (for e.g. false positive rate by gender)
- Understand feature importance, model interpretation using SHAP/ LIME etc. Potentially slicing by subgroups.

# Post-hoc analysis of production inference results
- Alongside regular model monitoring, evaluate metrics by subgroup/class.

What other practices are used by your teams?

What tools and frameworks do you use to do the above? Aside from general-purpose data analysis tools available to R/Python/etc users, that is.



[1] I don't want to get into a debate about the merits of model fairness or the definition of bias. In the US, Federal law and regulation describe a set of protected classes that may not be discriminated against. Federal and state courts have over the last 50+ years debated the situations where these laws and regulations apply and tested class definitions. This is a fairly well-understood problem space from a legal perspective. What is new, however, is understanding how to comply with these laws and regulations when building systems that attempt to infer a result while relying on data generated in the past under regimes where the laws were not complied with.",technology

personalfinance,Debt Payoff Question...,"Hi everyone,

Looking for some advice. My family is in a pretty stable financial situation for our age (I'm 34). We are saving for retirement, ~~have little to no debt~~, and have at least 6 months of expenses covered. We just did the budget and the only debt we have is 1 car loan (16k left @ $415/mo. that I pay $515/mo. for at 2.99%) and school loans ($67k @ 4% fixed). I have recently been given an opportunity to have up to $500 additional school loan payment money matched to help pay down those loans faster. Additionally, I have the extra cash to pay the car off and still have roughly 6 months of money in the bank. I don't have an additional $500 in the budget to do both. I also want to start paying myself 15% into retirement/school planning for our children...

EDIT: removed ""little to no debt""...I guess I'm excited to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Removed it.

Here's my question, do I take out some cash to pay off the car and then put that $500 a month toward my school loans? Do I keep the cash and just make monthly payments because the interest rate is so low? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,"Make 11k more a year, making $16 dollars more a week, any ideas how and why?","Hello all, I apologize if this is not the right sub. I recently started a new job and I was truly excited to be offered 11k more a year. However, after receiving my first week of pay I have noticed I am only making $16 more than I was at my last job. $80 of it comes from my health benefits, and that makes sense. But does this sound or seem right? To make it clear and easy, I was making $76k at my old job and I make $87.5 k in my new one.

I am the primary breadwinner in my house and am supporting my family while paying a ridiculous amount in student loans a month. I lived paycheck to paycheck and was happy to take a new position with more pay only to realize I will be living in quite the same way. 

Does anyone know if this sounds at all right or if I should be claiming more withholdings? I believe I'm currently withholding 3 but I could be wrong. The federal taxes that came out of my paycheck were $444 dollars for one week, which seems very high to me, roughly 25% of my pay.",finance

Thus, that 33k\~ was really closer to 45K\~. Her interest rate is currently 4.49% APR, so she's really paying close to 60K on that 33K car. In other words, she got fucked over because she wanted a lower monthly payment (661). The problem now is the car has 246,464 miles, check engine light is on, and there is a rattling noise. We went to a mechanic and had a bunch of stuff fixed, but the check engine light is back on and the rattling noise is still there when idle. At this point, my mom is tired of the car and wants to get a new one. My mom is an SUV-type and hates small cars, so she's looking more into the Toyota Highlanders. However, her current loan still has 11.5K dollars left at 18\~ months. My mom only buys new cars and the Highlander that  she's looking at is around 40K. What's her best option right now? If it's a cheaper car, is there another type of car that is an SUV that is similar to the Toyota Highlander? She essentially drives 48K a year to her job, so an SUV that has a high rated reliability would be priority.",finance
personalfinance,About fed up with Vanguard,"I switched jobs a year ago, from government employee to private sector. As a state employee I had two retirement systems: a personal account (I think a 357b?) and the overall retirement system, which is not based on stock market or what you pay into it (basically after 5 years of employment and at age 65 you can retire with X% of your paycheck, paid indefinitely).

So I left my funds in the overall system to stay vested, and I’ve been trying to roll the individual account into my new 401K. Vanguard (the new retirement) says no problem, it will roll over. Empower (old retirement) says no problem.

Six. Times. The check has been issued, and forwarded, per directions. Six. Times. Vanguard has failed to put any funds into my account. It’s like the check and paperwork never appear in their mailbox. At this point I’ve been notified by Empower that my funds are about to revert to “unclaimed property.”

Customer service has not been helpful, so at this point, what would be the best method for “damage control”? I’m thinking of just cashing it out, paying the taxes, and using it to live on while maxing out my contributions to the new 401k to kind of “counteract” the lost rollover. It is not a whole lot, but still six years’ worth of savings, so a decent chunk.

personalfinance,"Made a dumb decision 3 years ago regarding a car. At a crossroads, what should we do?","My husband and I made a very dumb decision three years ago to purchase a brand new, overpriced car ($60k) for a five year term. We made this choice due to a 0% interest rate (classic, as we never would have bought that expensive of a car at a different interest rate). At the time we were making quite a bit of money (more than enough to cover the car, invest, had $80k in emergency funds etc.) and we purchased our home (so we weren’t saving up for any purchase). We were living just fine and had more than enough so it didn’t hurt us.

Anyway in the past three years our finances changed drastically due to the birth of our child. I ended up quitting my job to join my husbands business where I did take a pay cut. The last year we made a choice to invest very heavily into our business and took home little aside for my paycheck. We made this decision as we have a fair amount in the bank and we believe in the business. Although it will take a few years of doing this to see a good return. 

As you can imagine our previous lifestyle inflation is eating up more than we are adding so we are at a deficit each month which stresses me out. We are investing heavily for at least the next year again into the business so I don’t see this getting better and adding more income is difficult as we are putting every spare minute into the business or our child. 

We would have never purchased this car if we knew what we do now or how different our lives would be in 3 years. It was a dumb decision but we are not sure what to do. Should we sell it (it would be at a slight loss), eat the cost and continue making payments as is or just pay it off?

Income: $60-70k a year 
Car payment: $963.00 a month (I know... 😞)
Basic Living expenses: About $3,000 (mortgage is $2k due to living in a very expensive city)
Investments: $200k
Savings: $150k

Car: 
We owe $26k with 28 payments remaining.

If we sold the car it would be at best $24k.

We have the money to pay it off but I’m nervous about using that much money as our we are putting so much into our business and expenses are going to be going up for childcare in the next few months (an additional $1,000).

At the end of the day we are sick about our decision to purchase this car. I want to sell the thing and just get a normal car and live within our means. My husband is stuck on the losing of a few grand. I see the opportunity cost in tying up that much money and the future expenses of maintaining it and the lower insurance costs of a different car.

cybersecurity,Career in CyberIntel,"I'm about four months out from graduating with a Master's Degree in International Security Studies (PoliSci/IR field). I've got a job lined up with a Federal contractor as an Intelligence Analyst doing OSINT Global Counter-Narcotics Analysis and investigation support. This isn't the type of intel I really wanted to support, but I'm happy to begin my career here nonetheless. 

I've wanted to get into Counterintelligence/Insider Threat etc. And as I look at job openings so I can plan for the future, CyberIntel for CI &amp; IT is understandably huge. In a few years, I'll have Intelligence Analysis experience that I know will be desired for a career in this field, but I have 0 knowledge of Cybersecurity.

Where should I start? I literally have 0 background knowledge of anything computer related (I've avoided it like the plague, but I've since realized that I've got the critical thinking, analytical skills to be good at it). 

Having done a little research now, and I've become super confused on all of the Alphabet soups of trainings, coding languages, Operating Systems, etc. My initial plan is to start with Codeacedmy to learn coding languages for Data Analysis (Python, SQL)- their website and reviews make it seem like a great option for someone like me who has 0 experience. I understand that in  cybersecurity, one should learn how to Operating Systems, so I figured online courses in Linux, Windows, Mac would be the next step. 

My University, which I'll still be living close to with my new job, offers a Graduate Certificate (4 classes/ 12 credits) in Applied Cybersecurity. I figure that after a few years learning on my own after graduation, a formal certificate in Applied Cybersecurity would be a good step to signal to future employers my ""skills"" in Cyber.

I am looking to start saving for a home as a new financial goal in the next five years. I am not in a rush, and I have a pretty great financial living situation, so I think it's the best time to save. Any ideas how best to go about doing this? I am planning on saving at the minimum, $60k, in order to place a minimum of 20% down payment on the value of a home. (The homes I would be pretty interested in would probably be at the 300k range, I would assume)

Status:

* 88k salary, take home around $820 a week after deductions.

* 23% of income into company 401(k) - Just changed today, on track to max contributions this year to $19,500.
* Maxed Roth IRA for 2020. (Been doing so since 2016)

* 4k left on car loan with pretty low interest rate (3.24%). $300 a month. No other loans.

* My rent is real cheap, so I would guess I save around $1800 a month after taxes and utilities/food/entertainment.

* Currently have $29k in checking account and $10k in a low yield savings account emergency fund with my local bank. Terrible interest rate on both. (&lt;1%)

Questions:

* Should I pay off my car loan immediately? The interest is pretty low, but I suppose I can save $300 a month.

* I am planning on moving most of my money away from my local bank, and opening a high-yield savings account with CapitalOne the next time I see they have a good offer. Is there any repercussions to closing my savings account with my old bank and moving most of my money away from the savings and checkings account to CapitalOne? Do I have any other options for an HYSA?

* Is it wise to mix my house fund and my emergency fund within the same HYSA?

* Is there anything else I'm missing? Any tips? Should I put my house fund in a CD instead?

I have no idea what that means but I’m certain I’ll have to file for taxes because I’ll be making around $20,000 this year.",finance
personalfinance,My employer forgot to deduct a pretax benefit for 7 months. I just noticed. What should I be ready for next?,"My employer (USA) offers standard commuter benefits which are deducted pretax bi-weekly. Every month, I have the same order set to autoload on my commuter card. I use the card for the bus, my employer deducts the same amount every month, and then when the card is empty it automatically reloads. Everything runs smoothly.

I don’t have a need to audit this process more than once a year because the system hasn’t malfunctioned in 5 years of employment. If direct deposits are hitting close to my expected bi-weekly sum, I assume everything is working just fine.

Today, I looked at my first paystub of 2020 and saw no deduction for this benefit. Confused, I assumed maybe the timing was off and it happened the previous pay period. That wasnt the case. Same for the one before. I had to go all the way back to the first pay period of May (2019) to see the deduction I expected.

This adds up to 7 months of missed deductions- or roughly $700. I reached out to the third party vendor who provides the specific product- and all they confirmed is that they provided the product as ordered and they received payment from my employer. I called my employer and all they were able to immediately do is assure me I won’t get hit with a lump sum deduction in the next pay period and it will likely be spread out. They opened a support ticket which will probably take a few weeks to resolve.

One more thing you should know... the reason I didn’t notice the drop off in deductions is that they roughly coincided with a planned raise. So when my direct deposit bumped mid-year, I assumed it was due solely to the raise and not the raise + missed deductions. I know, I should have double checked.

Anyway... while this takes a while to work through the system, I wonder what I can reasonably demand from my employer. The assurance from them that I won’t get hit with a lump sum is nice, but if the resolution of this is ultimately what amounts to a payment plan to my employer, that seems like an unfair burden of cost to me.

For example, I budget so I have very minimal excess funds in my checking at the end of the month. I like to make sure I invest as much as possible- and this isn’t exactly the best time to be missing out on the market. If their offer is to deduct an incremental amount to what I already have planned/need for commuting in 2020, I not only will have a difficult time adjusting my expenses to cover the gap, I will be missing out on putting that money to better use.

Sure- you could say I got extra money for the last 7 months of 2019, but I didn’t ask for that and I especially didn’t ask to be taxed for that ( an extra 200$ to Uncle Sam, by my count)

Btw.. I checked if I reached a max benefit deduction and I wasn’t close. 

Also- if anyone is wondering why I didn’t accept their mess up and just set some money aside for if the bill ever came due....not my style. I need certainty in my finances and this problem didn’t fix itself in 2020. I also want to see if I can get some tax refund for this in April. 

So my question... **what is standard procedure when an employer has a miss like this? Is it reasonable for me to expect them to reduce the total obligation by the cost of unwelcome federal tax withholding? When will the tax impact of something like this take effect?**


Thanks in advance ! First time posting so sorry if this isn’t set up correctly...

TLDR- my employer stopped deducting benefits  and I kept using them. It’s 2020 and they are going to fix it. Should they assume some fiscal responsibility or is this all on me?",finance

I'm a senior in college (with a few victory laps under my belt) and will finally be graduating this summer. I'm currently paying for my tuition with federal student loans. When I was younger I received a small inheritance that was locked into a trust, with the plan that I would receive the first larger half when I turn 25, and the remaining when I turn 30. My plan has always been to use the money to pay off my federal student loans.

I turned 25 this month, and with everything said and done the check of the first half of my inheritance came out to $15,000 (it had gathered interest over the years). The second half of my inheritance will most likely come out to be $10,000-$12,000.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

personalfinance,Loan For Credit Card Balance,"Here’s my situation. Aside from a federal student loan balance that’s been paid down steadily to $13,000, my only other debts are in my two credit cards and my car payment for a total debt balance of $26,500.

My car is a monthly payment of $260, with ~$12,000 remaining. I regularly pay more than the minimum, and am on track to pay it off a year or so early assuming no refinancing or resale of the car occurs. Refinancing will definitely be happening in the next few months once I’ve reduced the cards and given my score time to inflate.

My cards are about $1,500 of $1850 combined, which I can pay off over the next two months with little to no impact on my normal spending habits.

Now my question is in regards to the credit cards. While I can pay it on my own easily, would a small loan to pay both of them off immediately, and then just turning around and paying it off in the next couple months instead increase my credit more quickly?

My thinking is that not only are the cards the highest interest rate of the debt, but it will immediately wipe out the utilization ratio while also showing that I have another current account towards my total of would-be 7. The last account that I opened was a credit card, about 8 months ago. There are no recent soft or hard inquiries since.",finance

personalfinance,Advice on buying an apartment with my SO.,"Hi guys, I could do with some advice please.


A bit of background:
My Girlfriend and I (both 24) have been dating for a year now and the relationship has been fantastic. We want the same things in the long run, weve talked about marriage alot, were open about our finances, we have the same goals and aspirations, were both driven ambitious people with solid career paths and decent incomes etc. 

We have both been renting for a couple of years and in the workforce for more and both of our leases are expiring. We took the decision to move in together, we have basically been living together for the past couple of months as shes always at my place or im at hers. So we started looking at rental options and also discussed the prospect of buying a place in the next year or two. 

With that being in the back of our minds, and us having a solid idea of what we can afford, we also looked at what buying options are available for the future, just to get an idea you know.

Anyway, long story short. We found a fantastic little gem at quite a steal in a desirable area that is close to our work and also doesn't cost an arm and a leg. The bond repayment is lower than what we were thinking of renting for, excluding rates and taxes of course but that is also not too expensive for the area.
So just for interest sake we found a bond originator to evaluate us and we got approved for almost double the apartments price at a prime interest rate. 

Now the question is, should we do it? We both earn about the same and our credit score is seperated by only a few points. We would both be contributing 50% with ease and sharing the cost of utilities, my mom is a conveyancer and has already agreed to set up the relevant legal documentation that covers the ""what if's"", basically stating that should we break up we can either rent the place out and both receive half of the rental income, we can sell and split the profits or one can buy out the other. Shouldnit come to this we have legal aid available to make it less stressful.

Like I said both of us are financially stable so bond payment wont be a problem at all. We would like to put money into renovating the place in order to increase it's value and splitting those costs 50% as well. All the legal costs and 10% deposit will also be split the same way.

Were looking at this as an investment, due to the apartment being quite a bit cheaper than anything else in its class or area. Im of the firm belief that even if we break up and sell this place down the line, we could both profit from it. If we rent it out we would be able to get a hair under the bond repayment for it so the investment is still there.

Please let me know your guys' thoughts on this, our offer has been accepted, I just want an outside opinion before going ahead and applying for the loan.",finance

personalfinance,Interesting article - Clear your overdraft with credit cards.,"**TLDR; Overdraft rates are going to rise massively in the UK up to nearly 40% in March 2020 onwards. Avoid huge overdraft fees by using a balance transfer credit card. Advice from** [**money.**](https://money.co.uk/)

Just been reading a really interesting article on the [Mirror.co.uk](https://mirror.co.uk/) about how to shift overdraft debt - apparently there's a change coming to the overdraft limit in the UK?? Up to 40% interest rates!?!? Not what you need when you're living in your overdraft, especially right after Christmas :( :( :(

Anyway;

""*Whether it’s because of unexpected expenses, poor money management or a monthly wage shortfall, using an overdraft on a month-by-month basis is becoming an increasingly popular borrowing option. With overdraft fees currently sitting at around 15-20% APR, or between 50p and £3 per day, borrowers will see a huge increase in their overdraft fees in 2020 with some banks increasing their fees to as much as 39.9% APR.*

Borrowers and overdraft users who stay within their authorised limits will see a giant spike in fees in 2020, as several banks and building societies raise their overdraft fees to almost 40%. This comes off the back of changes being introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to prevent banks from charging higher prices for unarranged overdrafts than for arranged overdrafts.

What does this mean for borrowers?

These changes mean that providers will have to display an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) to enable borrowers to shop around for the best deal. So, in theory, these new rates are designed to help borrowers understand exactly what they will be charged for borrowing money. Figures show the cost of a £1,000 arranged overdraft could see a 129% increase in charges via First Direct and a 105% increase in charges via HSBC (Advance) this year. For example, for an arranged overdraft of £1,000 over 30 days, First Direct charges could increase from £9.15 to £20.99 per month.

If your current account overdraft facility is with M&amp;S Bank, Nationwide, or RBS, you can expect to pay 39.9% in fees for your arranged overdraft from 14 March 2020. Nationwide Building society customers are already paying this rate across all adult account types.

""I’m stuck in my overdraft, what do I do?”

If you’re one of the two million people currently sat in their overdraft, all hope is not lost. With careful money management, credit cards can help to reduce overdraft fees and pay off overdrafts altogether.

Salam Haqqi from Money.co.uk suggests that a “0% balance transfer credit card is a great way to avoid paying interest on debts, as long as you can afford the monthly repayments”. By moving your overdraft debts from a costly authorised overdraft with 40% fees to a 0% interest credit card, you can avoid the huge fees and manage your debt.

The dangers of 0% balance transfer cards

However, Haqqi’s advice comes with a caveat: “While using 0% interest balance transfer cards can provide invaluable breathing space for those seeking to clear their debt, they do require careful management”, he warns

Even though a 0% balance transfer card allows you to switch your outstanding debts to a new card and pay them off without incurring interest for a set period, it’s crucial to pay back the balance in full before the end of the interest-free period. Otherwise, you may end up paying even higher credit card fees.

It's important to note that most money transfer credit cards apply a fee of approximately 3%. However, this could still be significantly less than your overdraft fees if you bank with one of the providers who are planning to implement a 39.9% interest rate on overdraft amounts.

How to pay off an overdraft with an interest-free credit card

If you have a large overdraft to shift, you can limit the impact of expensive overdraft fees with a [balance transfer credit card](https://www.money.co.uk/credit-cards/balance-transfers-credit-cards.htm). By making a 0% money transfer from your credit card to your bank account you can remove your overdraft within the limited 0% period. Just as with a normal 0% balance transfer deal, cardholders can pay off a high-interest debt without the interest.

But remember, it's vital to pay off the whole credit card balance before the end of the 0% period for this financial hack to work. Otherwise, the debt will have simply been moved to a credit card and after the end of the 0% period this balance will need to be paid with interest.

personalfinance,Advice on buying a home in the US before repatriation / new jobs secured,"Edit to add: I think more precisely, this question is around an asset-backed mortgage vs. paying cash.

Original question: We will be moving back to the US after living abroad. We would like to buy a house before moving back so it's ready to move into directly upon repatriating.  Any advice re: securing a mortgage under these conditions vs. paying cash?:

* Liquid / easily liquified assets total approx 5x home purchase price
* We could pay cash in full, but would prefer to secure a mortgage for \~50% of value due to better investment ROIs
* We currently have jobs abroad, but will quit these and search for new ones in the US
* Of course it's possible neither finds a job in the US, in that case we can FIRE while still affording the home (we prefer coast FIRE hence the job search, but could FIRE now)
* We would like to get pre-approval now, meaning  we'd be seeking preapproval when we have jobs we know we will quit, and before we've found new jobs (but again, we can pay cash if needed and are able to FIRE if needed)

I have no debt and a have a job making $70,000 a year as an Electrical Engineer. I was in the armed forces previously and contributed 15% of my salary to my TSP and have about $15,000 in the L50 funds. I was told that I could roll over a 401K into my TSP and that it would be a good idea to do so. I have $80,000 in savings.

My job's 401K is vested on day 1 and is 50% matched up to 3%. My plan was to invest 15% of my salary into my 401K and try to roll it over into my TSP when I could. Are there better options than doing that? Should I only invest up to 3% and then invest the rest of it into a Vanguard account? What should I do with my savings? I held onto throughout college just in case I needed it but now that I am gainfully employed I want to invest in somehow but I am afraid of making a stupid move and losing a bunch of it.

I am also looking to buy a home. I was looking into the VA Home Loan from a bank like Navy Federal. I live in the Midwest so homes aren't that expensive and not only do I understand that it is an investment like any other but I have house life goals as well. How much of a down payment should I make on my home? Is it better to buy a larger home and then rent out the rooms with the assumption that my salary will increase over time? What kind of interest rates should I expect and what are the disadvantages of 15 versus 30 years?

 [Full blog post with all the tables](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-twelve/) 

#  The Experiment:

Instead of hypothetically tracking cryptos, I made an actual $1000 investment, $100 in each of the Top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap as of the 1st of January 2018. ***I then repeated the experiment on the 1st of January 2019***. Think of it as a lazy man's Index Fund (no weighting or rebalancing), less technical, more fun (for me at least), and hopefully still a proxy for the market as a whole - or at the very least an interesting snapshot of the 2019 crypto space. I am trying to keep this project simple and accessible for beginners and those looking to get into crypto but maybe not quite ready to jump in yet. I try not to take sides or analyze, but rather report and document in a detached manner letting the numbers speak for themselves.

The Rules:

Buy $100 of each the Top 10 cryptocurrencies on January 1st, 2019. Hold only. No selling. No trading. Report monthly. Compare loosely to the [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty-four/).

## Month Twelve and Year End Tally – UP 2% since January 2019

After a strong October, 2019 ended with two straight bloody months, each of the 2019 Top Ten cryptos finishing in the red.

Here’s the **finally tally** after one year: after generous rounding, the 2019 Top Ten ended the year UP 2%. My $1,000 investment on the 1st of January 2019 is now worth $1017.

For context, this same group of cryptos was up +114% at the peak in [May 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-five/). The worst month (and the only month in the red) was [January 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/).

Additionally, the portfolio has fallen well behind the stock market as measured by the S&amp;P 500 (see below).

## Ranking and December Winners and Losers

Very little movement in December, with most of the cryptos glued to their positions. Only **Stellar** and **Tron** budged, each slipping one place to #11 and #12, respectively. 2019 has been a remarkably static year in terms of Top Ten positioning: most of the coins stuck close to their starting place. This is certainly not the case in the [2018 Top Ten Experiment ](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty-four)where coins have fallen and fallen hard.

***December Winners*** – **Tether**, again. As always, when **Tether** is the best performer it signals a not great month for this portfolio. While not the nightmare it could have been, **Tether** won the majority of the months in 2019, as you can see in the chart below. **Bitcoin** finished in second place, down -2% in December.

***December Losers*** – In addition to dropping out of the Top Ten, **Stellar** lost about one-fifth of its value followed by **Tron** which was down -15%.

For those keeping score, here is the 2019 year end tally of which coins had the most monthly wins and losses:  **Tether** had twice as many wins as **Bitcoin** and **BTCSV**, which finished tied for second place.  **Bitcoin SV** also finished the most monthly losses, finishing last in four months in 2019.

## FINAL YEAR END RESULTS after tracking this group for 2019: Bitcoin far ahead, followed by Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. Stellar and Ripple at the bottom.

Let’s start with the winners: **Bitcoin** is up +89% and single-handedly prevented the entire 2019 Top Ten portfolio from finishing in the red (just barely). **Bitcoin** carved out a healthy lead in 2019: it is well ahead of second place **Litecoin** (+34%) and third place **Bitcoin Cash** (+22%).

Many others ended 2019 flat or nearly flat. **BTCSV, EOS, Ethereum**, and of course **Tether** all finished the year close to where they started.

The final three had significant losses: **Tron, Ripple**, and **Stellar** finished the year at -33%, -46%, and -61%, respectively.

2019 also saw **Tron** and **Stellar** booted out of the Top Ten, replaced by **Binance Coin** and **Tezos**.

Quite the fall from grace for **Stellar,** which was the champion of the [2018 Top Ten Crypto Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twelve/).

So there you have it. After one year, three coins in the green, four coins flat, three coins in the red.

## Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

Even though the year ended in a downward trend, the crypto market overall has had an undeniably positive year.

**One Year (2019) Final Market Cap Figures:**

* *Since January 2019* – the total market cap for crypto has **increased** \+49%
* *Worst Month* – January 2019 ($114B total crypto market cap)
* *Best Month* – June 2019 ($321B total crypto market cap)
* The last time the total market cap reached **$300B:** August 2019
* The last time the total market cap reached **$200B:** November 2019

## Bitcoin dominance:

**Bitcoin** dominance ticked back up in December and ends 2019 at 68%, a level not seen since September 2019. The range since the beginning of the year has been between a low of 50% in March and a high of 70% in September. The 70% figure in September also marks the **Bitcoin** dominance high since I started the experiment back in January 2018. The lowest level was 33% way back in [February 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-two/).

## Overall return on investment since January 1st, 2019:

After an initial $1000 investment, the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio is worth $1,017, UP about +2% in one year.

The humble +2% gain of the 2019 Top Ten portfolio is dwarfed by the overall crypto market’s +49% gain and **Bitcoin’s** \+89% gain. As mentioned earlier, the value of this group of coins was dragged down by the four flat cryptos and the three that finished deep in the red.

* Lowest 2019 Top Ten portfolio value: January 2019 **($915)**
* Highest 2019 Top Ten portfolio value: May 2019 **($2139)**

Here’s what the 2019 Ten Ten portfolio has returned throughout the year:

The [2018 Top Ten Experiment ](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty-four/)is faring far, far worse, down -86%.

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom line: **after a $2000 investment in both the 2018 and the 2019 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies, my portfolios are worth $1,153.**

That’s down about **-42%**.

## Implications/Observations:

Congratulations to **Bitcoin** which significantly outperformed the rest of the field to end the first year of the 2019 Top Ten experiment on top. **Litecoin** and **Bitcoin Cash** deserve honorable mentions as well, finishing in second and third places.

**Bitcoin** also came out on top after the first two years of the [2018 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty-four/).

Unlike the 2018 Top Ten, there were examples of months in 2019 where holding this Top Ten group cryptos outperformed the overall market. This is surprising, as this has not been the case with the other group: for each of the first twenty-four months of the 2018 experiment, the strategy of solely holding the Top Ten Cryptos was a losing approach.

That said, the year end difference between a +2% gain with the Top Ten approach vs. the +67% gain for the market overall of course implies that I would have done a lot better if I’d picked different cryptos. Or just stuck with **Bitcoin** and its +89% gain.

In retrospect, it seems an easy/obvious choice, as choices normally do when looking backward. But by tracking the progress of these experiments monthly, I’m able to report another obvious point: crypto is a highly dynamic market. [**Stellar** was the best performer of 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twelve/), for example. And **Litecoin** looked like it was the crypto to beat for much of 2019, up +300% at the mid-year point.

I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options. The S&amp;P 500 is now up +29% since the beginning of 2019. My initial $1k investment into crypto would have yielded about +$290 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P.

## Conclusion:

Although the 2019 Top Ten ended the December fairly flat, the overall market and **Bitcoin** in particular had a very strong year. The year is staring off with a bang, the market is up, the halvening approaches, and current sentiment towards crypto seems positive – 2020 will no doubt be another interesting year for cryptocurrency.

## Thanks and Future of the Experiments:

Thanks for reading and for supporting the experiment(s). I hope you’ve found them helpful. I continue to be committed to seeing this process through and reporting along the way. Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports. If you’re interested in the 2018 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment, you can check it out [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty-four/). 

As for the future of the experiment:

1. I’ll continue to hold and will report on the Top Ten Cryptos of 2018.
2. I’ll continue to hold and will report on the Top Ten Cryptos of 2019.
3. I’ve also decided to repeat the experiment with the Top Ten Cryptos of 2020.

It also doesn't have any incoming international wire fees which is how I will be getting some of the payments that'll contribute to this account. 

For Discover, I can use the savings as an overdraft protection account, but I never overdraft. It also has 2.10&amp; APY compounded daily, which I think is better than Ally's daily rate? 

I've also looked at Money Market Accounts and CDs, and thought I don't quite have a full understanding of it, I don't think this will be suitable for my situation.",finance

personalfinance,&gt;$40k in student loans have gone to collections.,"I've done a piss poor job with my finances for a long time, (currently am 27), but I've been working on it over the last 12-14 months. 12 months ago my credit score was lower than 500, and I managed to pay off all my outstanding credit card debt, which brought my score up to 579 where it's kinda floated. Then recently I applied for a credit card and was approved, and then my score shot up to 643 (not really sure why, but I'll take it?).

I have a car loan which I've only missed one payment on and will be done paying off in the middle of this year, so the last thing to deal with is that student debt. Like the title says, it's a bit over $42k of federal loans spread over 10 different accounts on my credit report. They've all been sent to collections at this point, but I honestly have no idea how to even start dealing with this. Would there even be a point in trying to dispute any of it at all? I definitely owe it. My biggest worry is that back when I was 22 and they originally started asking me to pay for it, they were asking for payments of $1k+ per month, which I couldn't afford then, and honestly still couldn't now. I know I should've addressed this at the time instead of just ignore it, but I'm trying to fix things now.

Also, my three previous credit cards (were closed down due to non-payment and I've since paid them off) are still appearing on my report with a $0 balance but show several late payments. Is there any way to have these removed??

Please, any pointers or tips on how to start tackling this would be incredible!

Edit: Thank you everyone for all of the insights! Will be calling the collection agency TONIGHT to ask about getting set up for a loan rehab program.",finance
personalfinance,"My car is in my boyfriends name because of past bad credit, but I pay the bill. What is my best financial move when moving it into my name?","Hi /personalfinance,

&amp;#x200B;

Long time lurker, first time poster. I have a 2014 mazda 3 that is currently only in my boyfriends name. The interest rate is around 11%  (not great) but my interest rate would have been way worse considering past credit fumbles.  

I make 50k a year now, boyfriend makes 110k and has a score in the 800's. 

My credit is now in the low 600's, I'm working on bringing it up to the 700's sometime this year. However my credit lawyer suggested adding an incremental loan to help raise my score more. (Hired a credit lawyer to pull it out of the 400's in less than a year). 

So I was thinking of taking this car loan that I've already been paying on and move it into my name. But, I want to do it strategically.  Should I pay off more of the principal before moving it over? Should I just save that money and put it toward the loan once its in my name? What is the best course of action?  


I plan on paying this car off not just staying in a perpetual cycle of car loan/ownership.",finance

personalfinance,"Should I take out student loans and pay them off immediately, or pay for school as I go?","Hi everyone!

I'm halfway done with my first semester of law school. I'm fortunate enough to be attending on a scholarship, and there is a $15k/year difference between my award and the school's amount. Overall, it will cost me $45k to attend school for the 3 years. I currently have enough money between my personal savings and a college fund to pay for this in full. I have no debt from undergrad.

I'm not sure if it would be better to pay for my education as I go - shelling out the $15k per year out of pocket - or if it is better to take out federal loans and then pay off the loan in one big payment when I graduate.  I ended up taking out a $15k loan for my first year, but I'm not sure if this was the right decision. From a credit standpoint, having some debt and being able to responsibly manage it looks good to potential future lenders, but I personally do not like having any amount of debt hanging over my head.  My loan is at 6.6% and there are no pre-payment penalties.

I'd appreciate any advice or insight, and please let me know if I can clarify anything further.

So long story short I couldn't attend school last semester and withdrew at the beginning of the semester. The school still tried to collect the tuition even though I didn't attend classes and couldn't attend this semester due to family medical reasons. Anyway the school told me to file an appeal. After I filed the appeal I spoke to a counselor who informed me that given my circumstances they would most likely recall the debt, but they would have to meet and discuss my case and get back to me I two weeks. Cool, but the debt collector that was assigned my debt has called me multiple times regarding this. The first time I explained to them that I would get a decision and the debt would most likely be recalled in two weeks and to wait then. I have been very nice, open, and honest with these people. They said they would mark it on my account and won't contact me for two weeks. But almost every day they have called my phone despite agreeing on the phone to not call me in two weeks.

I currently drive a 2008 Jeep Wrangler with 240k miles on it that I bought two years ago (bought with 182k miles)  I currently owe $9k on it and have had nothing but repairs since I drive a lot every year. I’ve put about $12k into the vehicle in two and a half years and I just got a notice that I’ll need another $700 in repairs as well as regular maintenance (shocks, coolant flush, new transmission fluid, tires) in the next 12 months totaling about $2500.

I was recently given the option of a private loan from a family member who was going to just reinvest at a rate of 1.5% and will instead loan the money to me for 2% which is well below the rate I would be getting from my credit union of 2.89%.  

Is it smart to purchase a new vehicle given the significance in interest rate that I’m being given  and not have to worry about repairs for a few years OR keep my current vehicle and not take on the $30k+ in loan and have another 4-5 years of payments?

I have been looking different banks and different interest rates that I might be able to get. It seems like credit card savings accounts (e.g. Discover, American express, etc.) have an interest rate of about 1.7% APY which seems great but they are through online banking only (never tried that before). Other banks (e.g. Charles Schwab, Wells Fargo, etc.) provide an APY with an interest rate that seems to float at under 1.0%. I am wondering why there is such a difference between the interest rates? 

I would like to go with the higher interest rate, but I am wondering if it is one of those ""it's too good to be true"" rates that gets you in the door with an account, but you regret it soon afterwards. Or if it would be great for savings that is long -term?

Here is a link to an example of the form, [CP2000 Form](https://www.irs.gov/pub/notices/2030_letter.pdf).

Now, this may seem stupid, but I can't tell how much I owe them.

On the right hand side of the front page is a little SUMMARY section which states the following:

&amp;#x200B;

Tax You Owe: $4,127

Payments: $3,165

Interest: $41

Proposed Amount Due: $1,003

&amp;#x200B;

Now, it says I have to pay the $1,003 by the end of January, but as I am reading this, I am confused. Does it mean that I really owe the full $4,127 but that I have since paid $3,165 in Federal Taxes so far, so because of that, I do not owe the full amount, that paying the remainder will settle me up for that tax year?

&amp;#x200B;

If that is the case, then doesn't that mean that this is $3,165 of money that will not count for this upcoming tax filing? In which case, I would still owe it anyways, right?

25 year old male with a Bachelors in Management Information Systems. I’m pretty much a stay at home kinda person and I usually play video games when im home. I cook for myself and eat out about 2 times a week. I occasionally go out with coworkers to hang out but its very infrequent. 

Currently, I live in Massachusetts and my annual salary is $60k with a $15k maximum bonus at my company. I put about 10% of my paycheck into my 401k and I’m still on my fathers insurance

Here are my monthly expenses. The only amount that’s variable is the amount I spend on food. I don’t have transportation costs associated

* $1200 for rent, internet, and electricity combined (I live with 2 other people)
* $350 for food (includes grocery shopping and eating out for lunch/dinner)
* $800 payment towards loans (currently have $60k in loans. Federal unsubsidized, subsidized, Parent PLUS, and Perkins loan)
* $150 transportation costs

I am talking to a recruiter for a company out in California in San Mateo, about 30 minutes out from San Francisco. The position, according to the recruiter is between $110k to $145k OTE. 85% of those numbers will be my base salary and the additional 15% will be from bonus/commission. So im estimating it around $93.5k to $123k, depending on my experience and other stuff. 

My plan was to assume the lowest pay ($110k OTE or $93.5k base salary). Here some estimates per month if I consider moving out assuming the lowest base salary:

* $2800 for rent, internet, electricity (1BR 1 Bath)
* $500 for food
* $800 loans
* $500 if I get a car + insurance

This would net me around $4600 per month expenses, or $55,200 yearly. Using [neuvoo.com](https://neuvoo.com/tax-calculator/California-93500), it looks like I’d walk away with $67,000 after taxes. I brought that down to $63,000 to be more conservative. In total, that would bring my yearly savings of $7,800 per year.

My question for the sub is, given my estimates, am I thinking about these numbers logically? Even if I dont get this job, and I end up getting a similar salary offer out in California, is ~$90k in that part of California livable comparing to how I’m living out in Massachusetts?

We take home a combined total of about $90,000 per year. She was never able to finish school due to discovering she had an autoimmune disease. So far our plan has to been to concentrate on this other debt we have and continue to pay whatever the lowest amount possible per month for the college loans (we instead call it a 'life tax'). We basically have given up on actually paying this off ever and instead just treat it like a reduction in pay. We are rethinking this strategy but it is overwhelming thinking about how to even go about paying this $105,000 on a $90,000 take home pay. Once our other debt is taken care of, we can probably pay $1000 per month but that would be nearly 9 years until this is paid off and dramatically impact our way of living (including whether or not we should have a child).

financialindependence,"My experience buying, owning, managing, and selling a single family home rental property","A number of years ago I wanted, nay, I needed to do something to accelerate my time to being financially independent. This was basically me trying to turn frustration into something productive. I ended up looking into buying rental property. When I was initially considering buying a rental property, I had an easy time finding a ton of people trying to tell me what to do, but a hard time finding actual examples to think about myself. So I guess I'll post my experience in the hope that it's useful for people thinking about rental property as a source of income!

## Phase 1: Searching for properties
I spent over a year watching properties before I finally pulled the trigger and bought one. What I did during that time was spent time researching neighborhoods, attending classes on how to be a landlord provided by a local non-profit that mainly covered federal, state, and local laws, and making sure I understood the local residential rental market sufficiently well to convince myself I wasn't tossing money out the window. 

As part of my search, I developed [this spreadsheet (note: I just converted this from an Excel spreadsheet, there might be minor formula errors in it)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15D5l6Xkyo8Acs9LLZ99RkvZd2JVosPaduxAMumFewJQ/edit?usp=sharing), which gave me a chance to make sure I understood roughly what I was getting into, and also let me compare potential residential property purchases easier. The basic concept was I was comparing the total cost of ownership (purchase, maintenance, PITI, selling costs, income) against a hypothetical 8% investment return if I just invested the money in the market. If a property on paper could beat that fairly high hurdle, I would consider purchasing it. What was a bit frustrating was the number of variables that went into my spreadsheet, few of which I had control over. In general, my approach was to underestimate expenses and overestimate things like vacancy rates. Other factors I considered included things like distance from home and work, and general neighborhood feel and quality.

All in all, I evaluated 36 rental properties before purchasing one. 4 duplexes, 2 quadplexes, and the rest single family homes.

## Phase 2: The purchase and initial updates
I ended up purchasing a 3br/1ba single family home on a short sale (the one in the linked spreadsheet above) for $175,000. One interesting note here was that the seller's realtor was doing the work pro-bono, and I used a real estate lawyer to purchase, so the total cost of the transaction was $900. There were many things to remedy, so I had saved up about 2 weeks of vacation and my plan was to take all of my vacation and remedy everything I could reasonably do for $5k. This turned into 2 60-hour weeks of work, and then 2 more weeks of 20 hours each (in addition to my normal work week) to get everything in shape for renters, and that wasn't even including the time my wife spent helping me. Basically every surface was modified, including drywall, carpets, refinishing wood floors, refinishing cabinets, refinishing wood trim, and many other minor repairs. The mortgage I was able to get required 25% down at 4.5%, so a down payment of $43,750. Since I immediately had to put $5,123 into it, this meant my immediate investment totaled $48,873.

## Phase 3: Landlording
My process for evaluating potential renters included background checks, calling previous landlords, verifying employment, and meeting the renters in person. I had 2 landlords with decades of experience that I met through some of the earlier mentioned landlording classes that helped me decide on renters. The main lesson I learned here is that no matter how careful you are, you won't be able to avoid all potential problematic renters. I had 3 renters in the ~3.5 years I ended up owning the place, and there were issues on some level with all of them. My rent started at $1630 the first month, and increased slowly over time.

I ended up owning the property for just under 4 years total. Here are the numbers from that time:

| Year | Rent    | Principal | Interest | Tax&amp;Ins | Maint  | Improve | Deposit | Cash Flow | Net Income | Hours Spent | 
|------|--------:|----------:|---------:|--------:|-------:|--------:|--------:|----------:|-----------:|------------:|
| 2016 |  $9,780 | $1,046    | $2,943   | $2,459  | $0     | $5,123  | $0      | $3,330    | ($745)     | 248         |
| 2017 | $19,560 | $2,166    | $5,814   | $5,417  | $750   | $0      | $550    | $5,962    | $8,128     | 47          |
| 2018 | $20,040 | $2,264    | $5,715   | $5,730  | $1,100 | $0      | $0      | $5,223    | $7,488     | 59          |

To be clear: 

 * Cash Flow = (Rent + Deposit) - (Principal + Interest + Tax&amp;Ins) - Maint
 * Net Income = CashFlow + Principal - Updates

Net Income isn't really useful, the improvements column wasn't something I could deduct immediately, improvements are basically treated as new investments that start depreciating on their own schedule, so I could only start depreciating a small fraction of them. Tax&amp;Ins in the above table is just the property taxes. Income taxes were more complicated. Here's another table for it:

| Year | Cash Flow | Bracket | Depreciation | Income Taxes | Carryover |
|------|----------:|---------:|-------------:|-------------:|---------:|
| 2016 | $3,330    | 28%      | $3,872       | $0           | ($572)   |
| 2017 | $5,962    | 28%      | $4,079       | $367         | $0       |
| 2018 | $5,223    | 24%      | $4,079       | $274         | $0       |
| 2019 | $2,934    | 24%      | $4,435       | $0           | ($1501)  |

Note that the ""Carryover"" for 2019 is going to be subtracted out of the 2019 tax bill a bit later.

## Phase 4: Selling
I decided to sell late in 2019 and managed to close before the end of the year. There were significant repairs made prior to the sale which I was allowed to deduct, and proceeds from legal action. Hey, how about another table (edit: I borked this table somehow, falling back to lines of text):

Sale Price   $248,500 

Realtor Fees $14,910
 
Repairs/Imp $35,111 

 Net Legal  $3,600  

The adjusted cost basis for the property given the depreciation and repairs/improvements is $198,769. The adjusted sales price minus the realtor fees is $233,590. This means that I have $33,320 in capital gains after subtracting the remaining carryover from 2019. So my total taxes due are the capital gains at the capital gains rate, and depreciation recapture at my top federal rate capped at 25%, or: ($33,320 x 0.15) + ($16,465 x 0.24) = $8,949. There are various other modifiers to that tax bill, for example, I finally had unrented time, and there were other small deductions I could make that I'm not going into here, that bring my bill for 2019 to $8,455. This means that after the entire sale process, I netted $24,865.

## Phase 5: Totals and comparison against total market over the same time period

OK, so how did I do in total? I ended up making $45,914 on my initial investment of $48,873. Woot. 

If you remember from way back at the beginning, my hypothetical threshold was comparing the money I invested ($48,873) at a hypothetical 8% investment return. I'm not including the second round of improvements because they were basically put in place immediately before selling. I could also compare against how the market actually did over that same time period. OK, let's do all of the above. I bought the place in April of 2016, so we're using April 1 as the start date, so the first year was only 3/4 of a year. I sold a few days before the end of 2019, so I'll count 2019 as a full year.

 * If I invested $48,873 @ 8% APY, I'd have $62,260
 * If I invested $48,873 in VTSAX, I'd have $81,618
 * If I bought the property I did, I'd have $94,787
 
So I actually outperformed the crazy market over the past almost 4 years. The thing I haven't added in though is the 696 documented hours of time I spent working on the property and things related to the property. If I were to value my time at $20/hr, I'd underperform VTSAX. Yikes.

I haven't actually filed my taxes yet, I got an actual tax professional to help me through this year's taxes, so the tax numbers are estimated but should be pretty close to the final values.

TL;DR: Buy VTSAX",finance

personalfinance,Gifting options to non-married partner with no income to reduce total capital gains tax.,"I have recently made a significant, non-realized sum holding options, and anticipate further gains. I have a partner of 5 years who lives with me and I trust completely, we are not married yet however. I generate the entire income between us, and as such would incur a significant tax bill should I simply realize the gains myself, especially considering they are short term capital gains. 

I was considering gifting the options to my partner, and using the yearly and lifetime gift tax exclusions to not pay gift tax.
Then my partner would sell the options when we deem ready and have him claim the capital gains on his taxes, as his income.
As my partner has no income as of right now, I estimate that this would potentially save us $10,000 in state and federal taxes.

I may then have my partner gift back a portion of the proceeds, again using the yearly and lifetime gift tax exclusions.

I have several questions:

1. Is this legal/allowed? I dont see why not, but perhaps this is disallowed somewhere.

2. Would I have to actually transfer the options to a separate brokerage account under his name? Would it be possible to ""gift"" the options on paper while remaining in my account, and then when we sell, we simply claim the capital gains on my partners taxes (along with reporting the gifts)?

3. If I cannot ""gift"" on paper as above, can I move the options to a joint tenancy brokerage account and when we sell have my partner claim all, or almost all, of the capital gains?

4. Should I be required to move it to an individual brokerage account under my partners name, does any one know of any that can do account to account transfers of options? Little information exists online and most only mention the ability to transfer stock, bonds, etfs and the such. 

Thank You!

Edit: These options are Calls of a publicly traded company, I purchased on the open market though an existing brokerage. My current brokerage does not support gifting of securities of any kind.",finance

**Livongo Health (**[$LVGO](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=lvgo&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d)**)**

* A consumer digital health company with a vision to empower people with chronic conditions to live better through the combined power of technology, real-time personalized information, and support from their chosen care team.
* The platform analyzes data to build a picture of a person’s patterns, while dietitians and physiologists give them real-time advice about diet, medication and exercise by apps or text message. If a patient’s blood sugar is dangerously low or high, a coach will call to warn them within 60 seconds. Inspired by how big tech companies personalize services and nudge people into certain behaviors, Livongo — short for living-on-the-go — started by treating diabetes, before moving on to hypertension, weight loss and mental health.

**Why?**

* Livongo provides a truly disruptive technology and they're targeting a massive TAM (total addressable market). 90% of the $3.5 trillion spent annually on healthcare is dedicated to people with chronic and mental health conditions -- this is only expected to increase.
* It also just signed its [largest contract ever](https://www.businessinsider.com/livongo-lands-biggest-contract-yet-2019-10) for the US government, allowing it to provide its diabetes solution to 5.3M employees as part of the Federal Employee Health Benefits Platform starting in 2020. Launching at the start of 2020, the tool will be available to 5 million federal employees and their families — and Livongo is optimistic that the partnership will afford it 45,000 new members and a revenue boost of up to $60 million through 2021. That's a significant lift given that Livongo brought in a total of [$68 million](https://e.businessinsider.com/click/18262001.4/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9BcmNoaXZlcy9lZGdhci9kYXRhLzE2MzkyMjUvMDAwMTE5MzEyNTE5MTg1MTU5L2Q3MzEyNDlkczEuaHRt/5d233c18f730436f2414784fB050eba75) in revenue in 2018, it reported in its S-1 filing.
* LVGO's clients include 20% of the Fortune 500 (Target, Pepsi, Microsoft, Merck, and Citigroup) and boast a high retention rate of \~96%. They reported a 121% YoY growth in Q3 2019 and continue to grow exponentially.
* Announced partnership this week that they were collaborating with Dexcom ($DXCM) on user data dissemination. In a joint press release, the two companies said that users of Livongo's health information platform would be able to sync their data from DexCom's G6 glucose (blood sugar) monitoring system.

###Windows

A critical zero day of the Windows CryptoAPI was announced today alongside the release of the patch.  [Tenable threat intel suggests exploits are available](https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/132865) and describes the exploit as follows:

&gt;A spoofing vulnerability exists in the way Windows CryptoAPI (Crypt32.dll) validates Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) certificates. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by using a spoofed code- signing certificate to sign a malicious executable, making it appear the file was from a trusted, legitimate source. The user would have no way of knowing the file was malicious, because the digital signature would appear to be from a trusted provider. A successful exploit could also allow the attacker to conduct man-in- the-middle attacks and decrypt confidential information on user connections to the affected software. The security update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring that Windows CryptoAPI completely validates ECC certificates. (CVE-2020-0601)

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinancing Prior to Medical School,"Hi guys! I am currently in a bit of a bind and I was wondering if I could get a little advice from you lovely people. Also, I apologize if this has been asked but I'm having a bit of a hard time finding too much info. I graduated undergrad in 2018 and have been working since (~$39,000 a year). Recently, I have had the fortune of getting accepted into medical school! Which is awesome since it is my dream, but now has me in a panic in terms of paying. I sit with a very ugly ~$82,000 of undergrad debt that I have been paying since my grace period ended. $49,000 of that is in private loans, which sit at a very ugly 12.1% interest rate. In order to prevent that $49,000 from really ballooning over the 4 years I will be back in school, I was looking to refinance it prior to going back to school. The perfect match seemed to be SoFi, mostly because they allow in-school deferment so I wouldn't have to make payments once I went back. My current loan holder (Sallie Mae) allows me to do that as well, but like I said, the 12.1% is just awful. My credit score sits in the 720-750 range, but SoFi will only approve me with a cosigner, most likely due to my lousy income and unfortunately I have no one to ask since I am in this battle alone. This is basically just a long wind way of asking, does anyone else know of a company (besides SoFi and Earnest bc Sallie Mae) that will let me refinance my Sallie Mae loans and let me defer payments while I am back in school. Any and all help will be appreciated!!",finance
personalfinance,Should I refinance my car? Hoping to buy a house.,"About 6 years ago I went through a bankruptcy due to major medical bills. I was out of work for a few years due to health issues that are pretty much fully resolved now, and had mid six figures in medical debt. At the time, I didn't think I'd ever work again (I was misdiagnosed -- long story.) Bankruptcy seemed like my only option because the creditors were getting aggressive.

I've since put my life back together. My only debt now is my car.  I owe $18.5K on a 2017 Jeep Renegade Trailhawk that is worth around $21K, so I assume I will be able to refi it. My credit rating is 740, my monthly payments are 375 and it's at 7% interest. (Despite having a credit rating of 700ish when I got the car, that was the best interest rate I could get because of the bankruptcy in my past.)

1. Do you guys think I'll be able to refi it to bring the payment down, with a history of bankruptcy six years ago? I've kept my finances totally clean since the bankruptcy -- no missed payments on anything, lots of deliberate credit building choices, etc. i.e., I have a credit card with a $6000 limit that I use for groceries and pay off every month, I have kept the same bank account since I was a teenager despite being none too thrilled with the bank, that kind of thing.

I've been hesitant to try to refi it because I don't want the ding on my credit for the hard pull if I'm declined. (I show seven credit checks right now, six of which were for declined credit cards, and one for a declined refinance six months after I bought the jeep.)

2)  I want to buy a house either this fall or in a two years, depending on what the economy does. I'm currently in an apartment and hate it. Will refinancing a car impact my ability to get a home loan? I'm hoping to qualify for loan with down payment assistance as my savings are limited. This may be an impossible dream at this point -- my experience with getting credit and loans has left me a bit bitter -- but I'm hoping. 

(I can afford the car payment, but that 7% interest rate is eating at me. My credit rating, before I got sick, was always in the 800's and I was usually able to find very low or zero % car loans.)",finance
MachineLearning,[D] [R] Why does skipgrams use MSE + logsigmoid instead of CrossEntropy?,"When doing skip grams, the loss I see online is like the following

`loss = MSE(logsigmoid(matrix_mult(focus_word_embedding, context_word_embedding)) , target)`

However, why not just tweak the forward function(i.e logsigmoid(matrix\_mult)) into something resembles more of the forward function in continous bag of words, with the result of the forward function being a tensor of two elements, that can then be fed to CrossEntropy like

personalfinance,$50k Upstart Loan a Good Idea?,"Considering taking a $50k Upstart loan to consolidate credit card debt and wanted some more opinions on whether it's a good idea.

Current credit card debt is right at $54k. I make around $85k a year, pay more than the minimum each month on all of my cards, and have stopped using the credit cards altogether. But all of the cards have an interest rate of at least 16%, with the average interest rate being 19%. My current payments are a little over $1,300 a month.

I checked for debt consolidation loan offers, and prequalified for a 5 year, $50k Upstart loan with a 12.86% APR (10.08% interest with a $3,071 origination fee). The monthly payment on this loan would be $1,064 a month, and I would be able to pay off all but one of my cards with this loan, leaving a payment on the other card of around $200/mo. So not only would this lower my monthly payments, but I would also have a lower APR on the loan vs. the credit cards.

I know there are negatives to doing this, but I'm having a hard time seeing them right now and wanted some help before I made my decision.

Thanks in advance!",finance

I have relatively low expenses as I don’t have any rent or mortgage costs. I want to know how best to invest my current cash and the future earnings I have as even now I am able to put away upwards of €800 a week after paying  my bills and funding my social life.

I am also relatively financially uneducated so don’t really know what to do or understand financial jargon.

personalfinance,"Auto place I've never heard of did a hard pull on my credit, and I was denied a loan by my credit union the next day. How can I fix this?","I'm fairly new to the world of credit and you guys have been helpful, so I'm hoping to get some guidance on a weird situation I find myself in.

I'm starting a new job next week, but one where I'll need to drive instead of taking the bus. This isn't a huge deal as I've been considering getting a car anyway, and while my credit isn't great, it's by no means as bad as it has been.

I had planned on getting a loan through my credit union but there are a couple of things that they require that limited my choice in cars, namely they won't finance a vehicle with more than 150k miles, which I understand, but most of the cars I wanted in the price range I liked were in about the 175k miles range, so I wanted to do some shopping around.

To that end I checked out a couple of online sites with pre-qualification offers. Most were shit, but a couple were decent. In the end I decided I'd be better off going with the credit union. About a month ago I checked in with my credit union and the told me that so long as I have no repos or collections and my score was well above 600 then I'd be fine.

Monday evening I'm watching Netflix when my phone lights up. It's a bunch of alerts from apps like Credit Karma and Nerd Wallet telling me of a new inquiry from a local Ford dealership I've never heard of. I checked and sure enough there's an hard pull from a place on the other side of town. What's worse is that it lowered my score by 9 points, dropping me into the lower-than-620 danger zone I was trying to avoid. Needless to say I was pretty pissed off.

I called the dealership and they told me that nobody could talk to me until today, but today I had an appointment to test drive a car that I really wanted.

The test drive went great, so I got the purchase order and went to the credit union and talked to the same nice lady who I'd talked to before. I gave her the info and she ran it into the system and then told me I was denied for a combination of too-new of a history — which I understand — and too many recent inquiries. I asked her if I hadn't had one the day before if I'd be OK and she said she couldn't say, but that it's bad to have a pull right before going into your bank.

So here I am, carless. I called the dealership and their person to talk to is out until tomorrow. I tried to dispute the action on TransUnion, but there's no mechanism for challenging pulls, apparently.

So my question is this: Do I make a fuss and see if they can pull the pull from my report? And does anyone know of one of those shady ""second chance"" auto financing places that isn't completely shit? The car I'm trying to get is only about $3k, so even with the sub-prime interest rate I'm only paying a few more bucks a month, which I'm OK with.

How to make childcare cheaper

Butt

No sense that childcare is so expensive 

Make it 7% or lower

Its happening to all income groups though

Work hard just to pay for it.

Federal dollars and subsidizing childcare to build this industry and train people

Status quo is disadvantage to woman for example but sounded dumb explaining it

Warren

Universal child care with small payments (tax)

When I was a young mom, child-care was hard.

Ended up using family and got lucky

Woman have been derailed and young parents life is hard

Tax to address this problem and raise wages of blacks and minorities in this industry 

Its a big investment in people, economy, claps

Sanders

0-4 years of life. Current industry is bad and wages are low (is too negative when compared to Warren)

Compares us agains to other countries (getting annoying, who cares)

No more tac breaks for billionaires 

Lost opportunity, Warren +1

Biden

Free universal infant care

Biden was father, family killed, starting Senator and had a long commute. Bad math and looked dumb (didn’t need to). I will tripled amount of money for childcare

Tax credit for woman. 8k

sanders idea, Raise salaries

Biden makes joke neutral funniness 

Butt

Expect and help everyone get through 12th grade.

Public colleges offer subsidies.

Make college expensive for wealthy kids

Doesn’t make a good point

Changes topic and brings up poverty

Ramble

Target tax dollars on where it’s important

Don’t use tax dollars to subsidize college

Warren

Need a wealth tax

19 million tax

Bigger picture

Wealth tax on corps, because that’s how we bring down deficit.

More taxes make investments easier.

Free college for all

How to connect education system with the economy

personalfinance,80/20 mortage vs 3% conventional loan,"I've been looking into purchasing my first home and am debating between different low down payment options.

A credit union nearby offers the 80/20 option which sounds nice, except for the fact that the 20% portion is given at a higher interest rate.

I could do a low downpayment loan but then I'd have to pay PMI till I hit 20% principle correct? 

Is the extra interest paid for an 80/20 loan lower than PMI to make it worth it? Or is 80/20 just a trap for people that have no savings?",finance
personalfinance,Looking for the equation for Making Additional Payments to principal,"I'm trying to work out in excel my payoff dates for different debts and whats the optimal strategy for where to put any excess payments.   

I have the PAIN equation: P = A*i/(1-(1+i)^(-N)). This will tell you what your monthly payment needs to be given the starting principal amount, the interest rate, and the total number of monthly payments. For Example with a $100k loan, at a 4% interest rate, to be paid off in 5 years, you would have monthly payments of P = $1841.65.

P = regular periodic payments (1841.65/month)

A = Principal amount borrowed. ($100k)

i = periodic interest rate (0.04/12)

N = total number of payment periods. (60 months)


How does this equation change if I want to make an additional x=$100 monthly payment directly to the principal? (NOT just an extra $100/month payment to the loan).",finance

personalfinance,Will refinance home for better rate... but to cash-out or not?,"Hey guys,


I'm about to embark on a home refinance journey and our plan seems convincing to me. Definitely want to hear if you guys think otherwise. This is a big deal for my family so I want to make sure we're making the right moves.  
  



We currently have pretty high household income with decent amount of savings. Over the next 1.5 years we expect to:  

1) Pay off remainder of mom's car, $10k  

2) Buy car for brother (replace lease ending Sept. 2020)  

3) Buy car for me (replace lease ending June 2021)  

4) Investment property up to $300k in value  

We live in a SFH and plan to keep it long-term. We signed at a 4.375% three years ago.Worth $920k, remaining mortgage is $420k. Pay $2250/mo.  



Preliminary research says that we can refinance at 3.375% and take $50k cash-out to pay for the planned expenses above while also lowering payment to about $2100/mo. Closing fees considered, but not a problem.  



I understand the increased lifetime interest paid, but is this route logical if we keep the property long-term? The immediate funds would enable us to pay off all our cars and help when the investment property purchase comes along. In fact, should we even consider taking more cash-out? Interest rates generally seem unaffected by the cash-out due to our high CLTV ratio.


Even with no cash-out, we can afford these expenditures but will require us to either dip deeper into savings or sign car loans at higher rates than this refinance.  


  

Any thoughts are greatly appreciated. Thanks!! :)",finance

personalfinance,Recent college grad - where should I focus on putting my money?,"I‘m 22 years old and graduated college in June. In August, I started a job with a $90,000 salary that cane with a fidelity 401k plan that will match my contributions up to 12% of my base salary after 1 year at the company. I am putting 13% of my salary in right now which leaves me with around $4100 a month after my contributions, taxes, and my FSA, which has $1000 in it right now.

Every month, I also put $1800 into a HYSA which has $10,500 in it right now.

My current monthly expenses are roughly: $925 - rent, $75 - utilities/internet, $210 - public transport (I take the train to work and don’t drive), $100 - groceries.  I typically spend $50-$100 on recreational things/eating out. 

I will also start semi-aggressively(?) paying off my student loan debt next week by paying $500 a month to a total debt of  $27,000 with 4.1% interest rate to get the debt out of my hair in 4 years. My company will also $150 /mo to my debt for the next 3 years.

After each month, I leave any leftover money in my bank account for large purchases that may come up such as driving school or travel, and have around $8,000 sitting in my two checking accounts - some of which has also been collected in there from old jobs/gifts over the years.

However, I still feel like I have no idea what I’m doing. I feel like I should be investing my money, however I don’t have the slightest bit of knowledge on doing that. Additionally I am still so unsure of my future plans and goals, which makes me nervous about target date index funds. I know I want to buy a house, have a wedding, and have children some day, but I also would like to travel a lot more in my early 20s.

Our mother died and we are looking at an inheritance of $50,000 each from the sale of her home. It would be nice to update our home, go on vacation, etc. but I am determined not to squander this windfall.

Any advice you can give as how to best use these funds will be greatly appreciated. Or, what kind of professional should we consult?

Edit 1:  I appreciate the comments about getting a different job, no savings, etc.  I get it.  I do.  But that part is more complex.  The question is how to use the inheritance responsibly.

personalfinance,"My wife's credit has some problems, how long will it take to fix?","Thanks in advance everyone.

I got married last December and my wife and I are still combining our finances. We've been planning to buy a new house together this summer and yesterday I told her if there is a problem it might take time to fix, so we checked and she has some problems.

She has 4 delinquent accounts on her credit currently, and she missed 2 car payments that are on the report. Her score is 660.

Three of the delinquent accounts are small amounts for medical bills she didn't know about. I told her to check on these today and determine if she really owes them. If she doesn't remember paying them we can pay them in full today.

The Fourth is her old apartment, they apparently tried to bill her for damages but they definitely never actually contacted her for payment. They so didn't do a move out inspection so I'm not sure if it's legal in this state (GA) to attempt to collect damages.when there was no move out inspection. I did take photos of everything before we left the apartment for the last time, and I'm not sure what they are trying to charge her for but she's going to call today and see.

And finally, the 2 late car payments: One was her first payment, it was years ago. The other she disputes was late as she uses auto-pay since she got the car. Should we/can we dispute the 2nd reported late payment?

But the main question: Assume we pay all the old accounts and she never makes a late payment again, how long will it take for her credit to recover?

PS: My own credit score is 750. My understanding is that she has to be on the mortgage and they will probably use the lower score to determine the interest rate?

Edit: Thanks for all the responses. It turns out we are definitely on the hook for the apartment damage even without the move out inspection, and I'll try to get all the bad account s to delete the negative reports for full payment. Either way they will be paid in full by the end of the month. 

In the meantime we can definitely buy a house on my income alone so her credit is much less of a factor for us than I had feared. :)",finance

I graduated in 2015 with a degree in Electrical Engineering. I was getting by just fine for a while and put tons of money away to make a down payment on a house in a rapidly growing area. I purchased a house in late 2017 and have been extremely happy with my purchase. I initially got my second job (beer tender mostly on the weekends) to fund house projects for my home built in 1942. While working a second job can be stressful, it offered a lot of opportunities to meet new friends.

I was able to pull in an extra $10K from my second job over 2019, but my second job did not withhold enough money and now I owe $2000 between federal and state taxes. It seems as though you are taxed much higher for having two sources of income. On top of that, I have been contributing HEAVILY to my 401K and Roth IRA (6% of my income from my full time job of around $72K per year into both the Roth and Traditional IRA, so 12% total) which is also taxed because I ""put too much money towards my roth"".

personalfinance,Pro v Con: filing taxes separately because of student loans under PSLF,"Hi all, facts first:

As of 2019:
My salary: $90k
Husband's salary: $66k
Business school loan: $115k. Graduated in 2014 and have made 4 years of qualifying payments under PSLF. Since 2015, my payments have been about $500/month and I'm a few payments away from all interest being paid off. I plan to stay in the nonprofit sector indefinitely so it's in my interest to stay on this plan until I complete the required 10 years. 

My husband and I married in 2018 and filed jointly for the first time in 2019. In September of 2019, I filed my annual confirmation of my full time employment in the nonprofit sector as well as my salary confirmation with the student loan agency. Because we filed jointly, my monthly payments shot up to about $1100/month. This is not sustainable for my family. I spoke to the student loan organization (1 loan, federally managed) and they said that it might be wise to put the loan into forbearance for the rest of the year, file separately, and have the loan payment only reflect my income. I now make too much to file under the income-based program but they estimate my payments will be substantially reduced by filing separately. 

As of now, I did put the loan into forbearance (november-april) and hope to do just that. As a side note, I'm also pregnant and that will also reduce my payment as they consider it a household size change. 

So my question is, is there a real downside to filing separately if it's almost guaranteed to bring my payment back down to a reasonable level? We also hope to buy a house within the year so I'm not sure if that impacts the situation. I understand I should also talk to a tax preparer but I'm coming to you first. Thanks in advance!",finance

politics,"Hello, Reddit! My name is Mark Caro, and I am a Chicago-based writer who has just published a readable, comprehensive, factual novelization of the Mueller Report. AMA!","The Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election”—a.k.a. The Mueller Report—may be the most-cited yet least-read government document ever produced. President Trump and many Republicans claim it proves he was not involved in the Russian government’s efforts to throw the election his way. Many Democrats assert that it doesshow such coordination, as well as presidential efforts to obstruct justice. Yet few people on either side actually have made their way through the 448 pages of legalese, tiny footnotes and onslaught of names presented with little context.
 
Since the report’s publication in April, there have been attempts to repackage this material in more digestible versions — a graphic novel here, a staged reading there, a CliffsNotes-like summary over there — but we still lacked one that was comprehensive. So I took a crack at it, imagining that Robert Mueller had become so fed up with partisan efforts to undercut his conclusions that he created his own people’s version of his report. His narration is the only fiction in the book [The Special Counsel: The Mueller Report Retold](https://www.amazon.com/Special-Counsel-Mueller-Report-Retold/dp/031649626X). Everything else is absolutely true…and often terrifying. 
 
Pulling also from related indictments and news reports, this brisk retelling conveys the full extent of the Russian military’s massive, deceptive social-media campaign to spark pro-Trump/anti-Hillary Clinton activities, as well as the hacking and coordinated release of sensitive materials from Democratic leadership computers. It also breathes life into White House dramas and betrayals such as the president’s actions against FBI director James Comey, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Mueller himself.
This is history as political thriller, as well as information necessary to process the impeachment proceedings. As Republicans push an unfounded conspiracy theory that pins 2016 election interference on Ukraine instead of Russia, you should know how former Trump campaign chair (and current federal inmate) Paul Manafort passed confidential campaign data to pro-Putin Ukrainian oligarchs, including at least one to whom he was in debt.
 
I was a longtime Chicago Tribune reporter who wrote the award-winning nonfiction book The Foie Gras Wars and has contributed to Chicago magazine and The New York Times. Considering my journalistic background and how much time I’ve spent digesting the Mueller report, I thought I might be able to help answer any questions about its relevance to either the recent impeachment proceedings or the current news cycle.

Is it worth it to pay off the loans now, and rebuild the emergency fund?

personalfinance,Review my long-term plan for home purchase,"Hi, longtime lurker here and I just have to say that the community at r/personalfinance has been a huge resource for me in getting my financial goals on track. So, thank you to everyone who contributes to this community!

Now to jump into the situation. I work in software development (68k/yr.) and my fiancé is a teacher (50k/yr.). We are both 25. We hope to be able to save for a house while at the same time contributing the max to my roth ira, HSA, and 4% 401k match from employer. We hope to purchase the house around Oct. 2021. The timeline for purchase here is flexible because our priority is to not stretch ourselves too thin so we can wait if we need to. Below I've listed our current finances in as much detail as I could.

Salaries:
118k combined

Debts:
94k in student loans, owing 1k/ mo.
We are responsible for 1/3 of the student loans, the other 2/3 will be paid for by parents

Investments:
Vanguard IRA = 12.5k (maxed out for 2019, 0 for 2020 but +500/mo to contribute max for the year)
Fidelity 401k = 4k (+226.66/mo which will net the entire match of an additional 226.66/mo)
HSA = 145 (+290/mo. + 500 contribution from employer per year)


House Savings:
18 mo. CD ending in March 2020 = 10k @ 2.4% (for downpayment)
Savings Acct. = 2k (+1k/mo. for the next 6 mo. and then +1.5k/mo after that) (for downpayment)
Vanguard Brokerage (taxable) = 5.5k (for downpayment)
Savings Bonds = ~5k. (for downpayment)
Credit Card Cash Back = 1k across multiple cards (continuing to rise at about 600/yr on organic spend)

Credit Scores:
760+ and 740, both on the rise

Home Purchase:
We are hoping to be approved for a 350-400k house.
We plan to get as close to a 20% downpayment as possible in that timeframe.

After home purchase:
Step 1.) Paying off mortgage up to 20% as fast as possible in order to remove PMI.
Step 2.) Tackling the highest and largest interest rate student loans @ 6-8% to knockout our 1/3 responsibility and letting the rest be paid for by parents on their own timeline.
Step 3.) Opening and maxing out wife’s roth ira every year from now on and increasing my contributions to my 401k above the company match.


Also of note:
1-2 years after purchasing the house we plan for my wife to take off work for atleast a year for childbirth and parental leave with the hope to do this again a couple years later. I realize that this is the most likely to stunt our home purchase plan since that is potentially years where we can only count on my salary to pay the mortgage and other expenses. Contributions to retirements investments may be put on the back burner at this point if necessary.


Questions:
Does this all seem feasible?
Would it be more beneficial to front load the IRA, HSA and company match on 401k this year and then to shift back to saving for the house at a higher monthly contribution than 1k/mo.?",finance
personalfinance,"Im 18 years old, and I have a complicated tax situation. I dont know what to do.","Last year in August I quit my regular job at a fast food restaruant, and started to drive for Doordash, Postmates, and Caviar. Ive been making *really* good money delivering food in Portland, OR. Nearly double what I made working in fast food. 

The problem is, I was incredibly stupid and didn't even consider taxes. Reading some old threads on Reddit, a driver for those companies is considered an ""independent contractor"". Apparently I was supposed to pay estimated taxes for each quarter last year (in my understanding I should have payed once, since I only started to work for food delivery in August), but I never payed anything. 

I have been tracking my miles using Everlance, and for last year I logged $5850 in mile deductions (.58 a mile). I am not sure on what other things I can deduct. Since I will be doing the standard mileage deduction, can I also deduct the price of new tires, oil changes, insurance, or phone bill? I dont have the original reciepts, but according to the IRS website, a bank statement is enough proof of a purchase for such things. 

According to my bank statements, all of the delivery jobs combined earned me $8365 from August to December 31. I also have an additional $10,550 from working in the restaruant earlier in the year, and according to the checks I dont think they were withdrawing any taxes from my income. 

I realize now how badly I fucked up. I could owe the IRS nearly $3000 in taxes from all the income last year, and maybe even a penalty for not paying estimated quarterly taxes, and I dont know what to do. 

If I try to file my taxes using TurboTax and their ""Self-Employed"" option, it would cost me nearly $160 for Federal and State taxes. Is their website easy enough for me to file all my taxes by myself (including deductions, the 1099 form from the delivery jobs, and the W2 form from my fast food job)? Or should I try to do it in person like at H&amp;R or Jackson Hewitt or something? 

I'm kind of freaking out because I cant believe I didnt know about this earlier. And I dont know what to do. I would really appreciate any help.",finance
personalfinance,Any drawbacks to using a small local bank for a mortgage,"I'm a first time home buyer working through the process.

personalfinance,"Figuring out how to manage two incomes, only one will have taxes withheld. I think I have a plan, but is there a flaw in this that I don't see?","Hi all,

I make $33k/year as a graduate research assistant. Starting this year, $24k of my salary is going to come from a federal fellowship, which will not have any tax withheld. My boss will top off my salary with the remaining 9k, which will still have tax withheld at the usual rate.

I was dreading having to deal with the rigamarole of paying taxes quarterly and whatnot, but as I was thinking about this today I came up with another way to deal with it that seems pretty clever to me. I just want to check with people who know more about taxes than I do and make sure there's not a factor involved that I've forgotten.

So what I'm thinking I will do is check to see how much tax is withheld from the new $9k paycheck, and compare that to the amount when the full $33k had tax withheld. Then re-file my W-4 (and state tax form) and request an additional amount be withheld equal to the difference. E.g. $33k has $150 withheld, 9k has $30. So I request an additional $120 to be withheld from that paycheck.

Theoretically this should just cover my tax burden for the year without having to pay an additional amount quarterly. Good plan/bad plan?",finance

What are some general tips to get better at aiming on mouse/keyboard? Growing up I was a big console player.

What can I do to be better at spotting players cause in rust normally the first person to spot the other is in a big advantage of the fight, most fps are like this.

I got a decent mouse I think steel series rival 310.

I just want to be better and I guess more focused into what I am actually doing in the game which is more of a mental thing to overcome, I have been shooting moving targets in the combat tags server, could just mean I need to clock in the hours on doing that and finding general pvp in the game to feel more natural.

Currently I have 
~4.5k personal loan 6.5% (I’ve been aggressively paying this off for the last few months)

I recently changed my HSA contribution limit to the maximum, so after everything I’m left with about 3k every month. 

2019 tax season is ending in a couple months. 

My question is to know whether it’s worth opening an IRA (I’m thinking of Roth) and maxing it’s out first. Or pay off the loans and potentially lose out on this years IRA contribution...or do a mixture of both?

My original intent was to pay off the loans asap and then focus on other stuff such as savings, retirement, and investment funds. But now, I’m wondering whether contributing to a Roth IRA and maxing it now would yield a greater return than my loan’a interest rate. I already have a 3 month emergency fund.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a fascinating Bloomberg interview with Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan about today's monetary policy. Figured I'd share some tidbits of his that I found interesting for the sake of discussion.

**On Repo and Balance sheet growth**:

""In order to address this repo issue, we've grown the balance sheet...But I'm very sensitive from here that we need to be finding ways to limit and temper the growth in the Fed's balance sheet...

**On ""Not-QE""**:

""On the one hand it's not QE because we're not buying on the long end of the curve, but on the other hand it's having some effect on risk assets. **It's sort of a derivative of QE. When we buy bills and inject liquidity, it affects all  risk assets. I'm of that view**....This is why I say growth in the balance sheet is not free, there's a cost to it, and we ought to be sensitive about it.""

He also mentions it's important that they communicate a plan to wind down/temper balance sheet growth in the future.

**On inflation**:

Discusses that although employment is low, inflation is limited due to structural technology ""issues."" Sees inflation to be muted in the future due to this, and how it isn't susceptible to monetary policy.

Thinks we'll see changes on how they articulate inflation targeting, whether it be via a range or a longer averaging period.",finance

personalfinance,Finally trying to take control of my finances.,"For the longest time I've just been living paycheck to paycheck mainly because I didn't have an actual full time job, and so my checks would come in, go to bills, then whatever was left would be gone by the end of the weekend for gas or something stupid. One of my main goals for this new year was to take control of my finances and specifically to be out of credit card debt by the end of the year at the latest. I've finally found time to sit down and plan it all out and I figured I would share it with you guys for advice and tips!


Now that I have a full time job I'm working 80-85 hours in a pay period @ $12/hr (5 hours of OT at $18/hr, also expecting a raise/promotion near the end of February) making my checks a little over $1000 pre-tax, so around $2000 pre-tax per month. My bills come out to $140 for the minimum payment on my two credit cards, $450 car payment, and $100 phone bill. I don't have to pay rent as I live with my parents for now while I'm finishing up college. The car payment obviously is a large chunk of cash each month, but there's too much on the car to be able to pay it off quickly, I was a dumb kid and wanted a newer car to look cool, bad idea.


One of my credit cards is maxed at $1,000 and the other at $5,000. Both were maxed out with medical expenses for a condition in my eye that my insurance would not cover (I have now gotten a cornea transplant in August so no more of that). The $1,000 CC (Discover) has am APR of 23.49% and the $5,000 CC (Navy Federal) has an APR of 18%. My plan was to aggressively pay them off as soon as possible starting with the Discover card which should take no more than a month and a half. Then putting at least $750 each month towards the Navy Federal card after the discover card is paid off. I'm not sure if that's the right order in which to pay the two off so suggestions would be appreciated. Whichever order I do, I should have both paid off by September, October at the latest.


Doing this will free up an extra $140 per month that I can begin to put towards my car to pay it off even faster, or use to invest each month. I'm definitely excited about the prospect of being out of CC debt by the end of this year and taking control of my finances the best that I can and would love any tips or suggestions you guys have!",finance
personalfinance,How should I handle my college debt,"Hello!

I’ve been lucky enough to have gotten a full time job before I graduated and been able to save a lot of my income while still in school. It is to the point where I now have enough savings to pay back the loan in full and still have enough emergency funds left. (Would have about 6K left in savings)

personalfinance,Improving Just-Damaged Credit Score,"I know this is still far from the worst situation to be in but I feel so ridiculous and kind of hopeless right now. I am hoping someone can chime in and tell me what I can do or what to expect. 

I recently caused my credit score to dramatically drop with late payments and am not sure what I can do. 

I have about $200,000 in different federal student loans. No other debts or anything negative on my credit report. One credit card, which I've had for about 4 years. This past year I messed up with the income-based recertification for my loans and then missed payments for months. I got some dings for 90-day late payments. 

My bank has a FICO score tracker. It says that last month my FICO score dropped from 762 to 548. Obviously I am so angry with myself for tanking my  score in a way that was very avoidable. To make things much worse, I need to move soon, but I highly doubt that now anyone will rent to me with this kind of a credit score even though I have the income to pay for it (about $4,000 after taxes). 

If I get back on track with my loans, does anyone know how soon my credit score could recover, what amount it might go up in a few months, or anything else I can do to help it? I'm pretty desperate to move.",finance

personalfinance,"Planning to make additional payments starting with credit card with the highest APR, is that correct?","I'm really going all-out to try and get out of debt in the next few months. I'm kicking myself over a few stupid purchases the past couple of months (I got my own apartment, got too excited and wound up getting a couch and chair that I probably shouldn't have), and I figure it's time to really hunker-down.

Right now, I have a balance of about $1800 on one card (which is 0% interest until September, no early-payoff penalty or anything), a card with about $1500 (*VERY* high APR; I just called to request a lower interest rate, but not holding my breath, it's like 26% APR), and another card with about $200 (not sure the APR; I normally keep it totally paid off).

Just knowing my own personality, I know that when I have money sitting in my bank account, I typically become a bit more lax about spending. I feel like the best solution is to take any excess money, and immediately start throwing it at the 26% APR card, which I could probably pay off in a few months. Then immediately shift towards the $1800 card, hopefully before the interest has a chance to kick in.

Does that sound correct?

Worth noting, I also still owe about $6800 on my car, 12% APR.

I'm happy to provide more info if needed.",finance

politics,Megathread: US Government Accountability Office finds Trump administration violated the law by freezing Ukraine aid,"Today, the US Government Accountability Office issued a legal decision concluding that the Office of Management and Budget violated the law when it withheld approximately $214 million appropriated to DOD for security assistance to Ukraine. The President has narrow, limited authority to withhold appropriations under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. OMB told GAO that it withheld the funds to ensure that they were not spent ""in a manner that could conflict with the President’s foreign policy."" The law does not permit OMB to withhold funds for policy reasons.

personalfinance,Mortgage company won't accept payment from me and is threatening foreclosure.,"I refinanced my home a few months back and the loan was bought up by Amerihome Mortgage
I set up my bank info on their website, get the first payment made, and then go to set up auto
draft.  They way their system is set up you can *only* auto draft from an account that matches
your name, if you want to auto draft from an account that does not match your name, you have to
mail in a voided check.  I have a different bank account for house expenses for accounting
purposes.  I send in a voided check, the new account shows up in the website, I switch the
auto draft over to the new account and go on my merry way.

The auto draft fails.  I happen to check back on the site later and I see that I'm late, so I
call in to see what's going on, the Amerihome Mortgage phone rep tells me payments are not
working and they cannot help that I'll have to call my bank.  I figure, this is more headache
than it's worth, I switch auto draft back to the first account, confirm with the Amerihome
Mortgage phone rep that it looks right, make a manual payment and go on my merry way. The
Amerihome Mortgage website reported that a payment had been made.  Next month the auto draft
fails again (this is the account that it was working on before, and that I'd been making
manual payments from).  I don't notice for a few weeks, so of course loan then went unpaid
and I was unaware of this. The loan fell two payments behind, I happened to look on the site,
and saw that the auto draft was seemingly not working.  Calling them does not seem to help
so I figure I'll give up on auto draft and just make manual payments every month.  It's
super annoying, but it's not like you can argue the bank that owns your house. So I make
a manual payment from the account with my name.

I get an email from Amerihome confirming that I paid.

Just to be sure though I then contacted their support on the Amerihome Mortgage website
(amerihome.loanadministration.com), and they tell me:

Amerihome chat support rep:

    Thank you for your recent email regarding your loan payments. This message is to inform
    you that your January 2020 payment was posted on January 6,2020 .

    Thank you for providing us with the opportunity to assist you.

    Sincerely,

    &lt;support person name&gt;
    E-mail Support Representative

Of course, it gets reversed in the next day or so, but I don't notice for a week.  When I call
in to find out what's going on, I then learn that my account has been locked and for the next
year I have to send in a wire or certified funds (cashiers check or money order).  This is
annoying, but it's my own fault for trusting these guys.  So I call in, confirm I can wire
them funds through western union ask what I need to know (apparently there is a code) get the
western union code, drive to western union, and the western union cashier cannot find Amerihome
Mortgage in the list of companies.  I call Amerihome Mortgage from western union, eventually
get through (all they want to talk to me about is how to go into foreclosure, I explain that I
don't want to go into foreclosure I just want to pay them) they tell me that they stopped supporting
western union today.  I ask how I can pay.  Since I cannot wire to their bank account directly and
I can't wire through western union or moneygram.  They inform me that only remaining way to pay is
to send them certified funds, but am I *sure* that I don't want to talk to someone about going
into foreclosure?  I explain again that I just want to pay them.

So I overnight fedex a money order in.  Track it and it arrived yesterday morning.  I call in to
confirm that they got the money order.  All they want to talk about is my foreclosure options,
eventually we get through the whole thing and they tell me the money order will show up in my
account that afternoon.  I check the next afternoon and it has not appeared on the site.  I
check the next morning and it has not appeared on the site.  I call in (and go through the whole
""Did you know you owe us money?  Do you want to talk to someone about your foreclosure options?"")
so I explain the whole thing again and I'm assured that it will post this afternoon.

The representative asks if I need anything else, I let her know that I'm doing everything that
I can to pay them, but it is seemingly impossible.  She tells me that I should call back since
the website is untrustworthy and she has no idea what I can do and that she's terribly sorry.

I'm concerned that at this point I have literally *no* avenue to pay them that they will accept.
All I want to do is give them money and I they seemingly will not let me *and they keep pushing
foreclosure*. This seems predatory to me.  Do I have any options?  What do I do if they refuse
the money order or ""lose"" it?",finance

GDP growth in Germany was a paltry 0.6% last year!  Manufacturing contracted 3.6%.

Additionally the gas automotive industry represents about **a quarter** of Germany's economy.  That's a big issue considering electric cars don't need all the gas automotive parts Germany produces and the current leader--Tesla--is a primary competitor to German car companies like BMW and Mercedes.

&gt; “The next decade will be a decade of underperformance, and people may once again start talking about Germany as the sick man of Europe,” said Joerg Kraemer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.

...

&gt; Germany’s weakness is bad news for Europe, and not just because of its size, accounting for about **a fifth** of the EU’s total gross domestic product.

A few impact highlights:

* Will cities, for example, be able to afford their infrastructure needs as climate risk reshapes the market for municipal bonds? 

* What will happen to the 30-year mortgage – a key building block of finance – if lenders can’t estimate the impact of climate risk over such a long timeline, and if there is no viable market for flood or fire insurance in impacted areas? 

* What happens to inflation, and in turn interest rates, if the cost of food climbs from drought and flooding? 

* How can we model economic growth if emerging markets see their productivity decline due to extreme heat and other climate impacts?",finance
personalfinance,Multiple Mortgages,"Its all around mortgages.  I just can’t wrap my head around it…

So based on amortization, when you get a loan, let's call it a $400,000 loan, when you make payments, you pay a large interest payment and a small mortgage principal payment.  Even 60/40 or 80/20 for intrest to principal ration.  If you refi the loan in say, 5 years, then you’re effectively paying the bank some really high-interest rate, call it even 50% right?   You only ever get down to the 4% that your lender quoted you if you hold onto the loan for all 30 years.  

So, I hear about people that take out a HELOC loan, and immediately apply all the money to the principal of the mortgage, so on a 30-year loan, you put an additional 75K from the HELOC down, and then make payments on both.  I assume if you have the cash to do it, that work, but is there a point where this doesn’t make sense to do?  Or why would people do it?  Same as the above question?  How to calculate the ROI on this?

I have properties that have appreciated, and I’ve always re-fied them back to 80/20 LTV and bought another property.  I can continue to do this, but at some point, I assume I should just continue to pay them off in a snowball fashion of some sort, but when should I start that?  I guess that's based on my personal retirement goals, and then also based on the snowball.  But, let's say each property that I buy adds $200 of cash flow, I should just continue to do this infinitely, of course assuming the properties don't depreciate,  

Basically I think the only one winning is the banks since the average time in a house is 7 years, no one is ever only paying 3.5% or whatever, everyone is paying 15-50% on those loans.  Am I wrong?  What am I missing?",finance

personalfinance,Is a debt consolidation loan a good idea for me?,"Hello, 

I am a 25, a teacher and I am in a lot of credit card debt from living beyond my means and traveling. I am much less stupid than I was at 18-22, but I am still drowning in the debt I created for myself. I am considering a personal loan for debt consolidation. 

Here's the financial situation: I have almost no savings, (like, 100 bucks in there on a good month) and after taxes and a little contribution to a 403b my take home pay is about 2600/month, which almost entirely goes to rent/utilities, car, student loans, and my credit card bills, and whatever other expenses. I can definitely live on it.. I haven't used a credit card in months, but I haven't been able to save much either. My student loan is a fixed 10yr payment plan at a decent rate (I took out only federal loans) so I am not trying to pay that off with this loan. My credit rides the line between good/fair (in recent months 675-700)  because I pay on time and over the minimum payment (even if its just a little bit) but I am nearly maxed out on all my cards so the available ratio isn't good. Aprs on my credit cards are between 15-24. 

The best loan option I am seeing is 24k (sadly that's what I would need to pay things off all the way), 5 yr fixed rate of 602/month, 17.42% interest rate, with a 1540 origination fee. The company is Upstart. I am not concerned about making that payment. This sounds not super great to me rate wise, but its similar to my credit cards. Is it worth doing this? the things I see as benefits are:

 1. Peace of mind of having this paid off in a fixed amount of time, without managing it on my own. Right now its a big source of stress and anxiety and the numbers seem pretty insurmountable with a little over minimum payments slowly chipping away. 

2. Improving my credit by increasing my available funds (which I will absofuckinlutely not use, but will probably keep open for that purpose) or will the loan affect my credit negatively in some way I don't know about? 

Is there anything else about these kind of loans I should know about? Can I pay more than the fixed price per month and pay it off faster if I figure out how to fix my budget? Is there some big negative I am not considering? Should I continue to shop around or is this a typical APR and repayment rate? (I have done like 2 days of actual research about this but have been thinking about this for a long time) 

Thanks for your time!",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing student loan. Is this a good time to switch to a variable interest rate?,"I'm trying to refinance a student loan and trying to decide between fixed and variable rates.  Rates are pretty low right now so I'm trying to take advantage.  I currently have a five-year 3.25% fixed loan through Laurel Road that has 4.5 years to go.

I haven't done the hard credit pull yet, but my preliminary rate for a refinance would be 2.95% fixed or 1.74% variable over five years.  I'd most likely try to pay it off in four years.  With the current economy, I feel like rates are going to stay low for a while and I could always refinance again if rates start to climb, but it's still sort of risky over just taking the fixed rate.

My other option is to go through First Republic and get 1.95% or 2.2% fixed for five years.  But I lose all student loan protections and have to fulfill all their strict requirements (I'd have to have 20% or 10%, respectively, of the total loan amount in their bank for the life of the loan).  But I'd also get a 2% rebate of the total loan amount back if I pay it all off in four years.

So now it's decision time.  It seems I'm reading everywhere that interest rates are most likely going to stay low for 2020 (although that was in relation to home loans).  I'd save quite a bit if my rate is under 2% for a year.",finance
personalfinance,I'm going to be working abroad for 6 months and would like some advice.,"As per the title, I will be working abroad with my current employer for a period of six months. I am going to be provided housing and weekday food (on site) as a goodwill gesture. The country in question does not allow alcohol and most employees don't spend much whilst out there.

My current situation: I bought a house in 2019 with my partner, it made financial sense at the time to buy with a 95% mortgage as soon as possible and we were offered a 2.8% interest rate locked for two years. The property was bought for £238,000 and since my partners father renovated houses, has helped us increase the value to £275,000 with a spend of £12,000. Therefore the cost to us is £250,000 total on a property now worth £275,000. By the end of the term (a couple of months after I return) our interest rate will drop and we should have just shy of £50,000 capital in the property. 

SO, at the end of my time abroad I anticipate to have a minimum of £20,000 accumulated after deductions and taxes. 

I was wondering what other people would do with this money, whether it's best to put it into the house, or save for a future marriage, or invest in a low risk option. Or even begin to save towards a second property to hold as a rental, but I'm not sure if that's a good idea with the current situation in the UK.

personalfinance,Saving and Loan Payment Advice,"Hi all. I am looking for advice on how to best optimize my saving/loan payment funds given a few facts:

I am a young professional taking home $60,000 after taxes.

Since August 2019, I have paid down my student loans from $28,000 to $20,000. The remaining $20,000 consists of 4.29%, 4.45%, and 3.76% loans. I have paid off everything over 5%.

For every paycheck of ~$2,500, I put away $800 for savings/paying down my student loans. 

Because my company doesn’t match until I’ve been employed for 1 year, I have been putting that entire $800 towards my student loans.

My questions:

Should I consolidate my loans to 1 loan with a higher interest rate? (About 4.849%) what would be the benefit of this?

Would it be better to pay off all of my loans as quick as possible, or put $250 per paycheck towards a Roth IRA, which would max me out at 6k per year?

As is tradition for many young soldiers, mine got himself a 20% APR on a $24,000 loan last August for a crossover now KBB'd at $14,000. I am just finding all of this out as he just transferred to my section. His credit is in the low 500s so my first suggestion of refinancing through Navy Fed or USAA was a bust as they wont touch it. Now even if he traded it in he would still have be in the negative about 10-9k he is lucky and there is no guarantee of a better interest rate out there.  He was looking at another $14000 cross over but i told him the dealership would only pay the trade in price and they would roll the remaining balance to his new loan. I also told him voluntary repossession would negatively effect his credit and he would still be on the hook for the remaining balance after the car is sold by the bank.

It is worth noting that he is currently supporting his wife and 3 children. This being the case not having a mode of transportation would be a huge burden. He did try to refinance already so I would like to help him asap so the credit checks do not further compound on his credit issue.

personalfinance,"A lot of savings, not sure what to do with it","Hi everyone! I’m sure this question has been asked in some form or another but I figured I would ask my version. 

So right now i’m 21 and living at home, about to graduate this May from college. I’ve been working part time for the past 4 years and have around 15k in savings. Last year I invested 2.5k of it in stocks. I’ve been wanting to put the 15k, or at least most of it, in some account that has a higher interest rate than just my savings, but I’m not sure what that would be. Right now my expenses are really only gas for my car, school stuff like textbooks, groceries, and personal things for myself. After I graduate I plan to stay at home to pay down some of my student loans while working hopefully somewhere local. If not I would probably move out within the year. 

My question is what can I do with my 15k or where can I put it so I’ll make more money with it. Is it best to invest it in more stocks, or put it in some fancy account? I’ve done some research and have come up with putting it in a growth market money account, but Im not sure if that’s the right choice. Also, I’m looking for something more long term that I can pull out when I’m much older. I appreciate any help you can give me !! :)",finance
personalfinance,Determining salary increase needed to make up for pension?,"Hi all, federal govt worker here.  My employer offers a TSP (read: 401k) + FERS pension retirement plan.   Im 13 years in and I've had one promotion in the last 10 years, and it doesnt look promising for the future.   Simply not enough promotion funds to go around, promotion statistics are roughly 3 promotions per 140 people.

I'm considering jumping over to private sector, but want to make sure my math is right.   

Current Job:

* Minimum retirement date: 01/01/2041 (age 58)
* High 3 (pension based off this): 270k a year
* -Calculations for that # are as follows:
* -Im assuming by 2041 even with promotions as sparse as they are id be able to max out at a gg15 step 8.
* -Additionally, im assuming cost of living increases at 2% a year

This results in a pension of 

$4796 a month (federal taxes already subtracted out)

386 a month (Health insurance included)

657 a month (life insurance included)

Other facts:

If i pass away, my pension will pass to my wife at a reduced amount of 3500 a month.  


Assumptions:

* I will live to 87
* over that 30 year time period, a rough net of 1.7M would be provided by the pension

Salary Increase Needed:

Assuming i retire at the same age (2041, age 58), I would need to earn an additional 1.7M between now (2020) and then in order to make up the pension.    This comes out to about an additional 90k a year needed.   

I just need  quick sanity check to see what im missing, so if i choose to jump ship i know where salary negotiations would be worth it.   

As far as attainability of that +90k salary, i have specific highly valued skills that would make that pay range reasonable.",finance

Got a letter from ""Company A"" recently that I'm pre-approved for a Debt Consolidation Loan that would cover my $25,000 in credit card debt with an interest rate of 3.86% and a monthly payment of $161.70. I decided to give them a call, it's obviously my number one priority to resolve some of the mistakes I made. My ""financial consultant"" takes the call, says he will review everything and calls back informing me that my credit score of \~660 does not qualify me for a traditional loan but that I qualify for a ""0% Modification Program"". He explains everything and of course it seems to good to be true, they offer to set me up with \~36 month payment plan of $550 to make me CC debt free. They told me the sum is lower than the total debt I'm in because they negotiate with my creditors and come to a settlement. I asked him to email me a pdf summary and he reaches out to me via e-mail from ""Company B"" and it's a Client Retainer Agreement from ""XYZ Legal Group"".

This all seems weird to me because I'm paying less than I borrowed and almost 33% of it is legal fees.

personalfinance,Is it wise (or even possible) to have zero federal withholding from your paycheck if you have debt to pay?,"My first question is whether or not this is even possible, or if a federal tax withholding is mandatory if you're making an average income.  If so, if I have a student loan, or especially credit card debt I'm trying to pay back, isn't it better to take the extra money in my paycheck that gets withheld for federal taxes, and instead use it to pay down my debt first?  

I'd think it would be helpful so long as I have enough to pay my taxes come April the following year.   
 If I waited 1 year to take that money as a lump sum in a tax refund I'd have accrued a lot of interest fees in the meanwhile that could've been avoided had I paid down the principal with the amount I'd normally have withheld for federal taxes.

I've also heard that some people prefer taking the money and investing it over the year, then pay their taxes each April with their more liquid checking/savings accounts.  However, the person I heard that from owned their own small business so maybe it was only possible because he wasn't a regular employee.

personalfinance,Need some help with finances/feasibility of moving. could use some advice,"Hi,


I'll try to keep it as brief as possible. I'm 23, single living right outside of Detroit, Michigan. Currently I live with my parents. I  make $55,000 pre-tax with my first real job right out of college. This will probably bump up to $65k after a year. I'm not the most financially educated person so forgive me if some of my information provided is not enough or not relevant.  Just ask for clarification, I don't care if friends/family can identify me from the information on this thread.  



Financial information: 

I have $13k in student loan debt - 8.5k of this is from a family member and the remainder is federal subsidized at 4.4% (with payment beginning in 5 more months - 6 months after graduation payment begins).

I have a bank account with a credit union with a debit card +checking account and also an AmEx that I recently just signed up for.

I pay $140/month for benefits through my work. This means Dental, Medical/HSA, etc. My company matches up to 6% for my 401k so I am putting 6% in my 401k.  




Situation:

I currently do not own a car and need one for work. This is a requirement for my job. Public transport is not an option. 
I plan to purchase one or would leasing be better? I would probably spend roughly $250/month -- max --. I would also be paying $80/month for a parking pass. 

The second part of my issue relates to commuting. My work is 30 miles away, and is a solid 50 min commute every morning and every evening. This is excluding weather. With snow this is easily 1.5 - 2 hrs each way. If you live in Michigan or the Midwest, I'm sure you know what I mean when I say the winters are brutal. It feels like I really don't have time anymore with this commute. Each day is literally waking up, leaving for work, getting home, eating, 1-2 hr to myself then preparing for the next morning. Not to mention it's just dreadful. 


I'm curious if it's feasible to move out, I don't know how to calculate whether or not this is economically feasible. There are apartments near work at $750/month (2 bedroom apartments so I'd be splitting the $1500 monthly bill with a roommate) that would be a 10 minute drive max, vs paying for gas + time wasted each day/dread/wear&amp;tear (is there a way to calculate approximately how much this option would cost me over a year?). I could probably find ones that would be less - probably like $650/mo if I look around. A side question -  would I also need to cover utility bills when renting? Or is the only expense just the monthly rent.

personalfinance,"Maintain large balance, low payment federal loans vs. paying down private debt","Sorry in advance for the long post. I have seen a lot of threads about paying down debt and the various methods of doing so. I have used a lot of the advice contained therein. However, one topic I personally haven't seen is something I feel is very common: Income-Based repayment loans. With that in mind. I would appreciate your input on paying down those loans versus payment on other obligations.

I started a new job as a personal injury attorney about 4 months ago. My base salary is $75,000, and I get percentages of the fees I bring in as a bonus. However, for debt payment purposes I am not taking potential bonuses into consideration. (I want to come up with a steady payment plan without the bonuses, and any such bonuses would go right on the desired loan.). I have $10k in emergency funds

I currently have the following PRIVATE debt obligations

Mortgage (Inc. taxes, escrow, and insurance, 30 yr) - Current balance $56k, 4.5%, $497/mo

Car Loan - Currnent Balance $14k, 5.99%, $269/mo

Private Student Loan (consolidated) - Balance $36k, 4.69%, $451/mo

*However*, I also have a large amount of federal debt (college and law school). It currently sits at $109k, of which almost $7k is unpaid interest. The reason being is that I am only paying about $135 a month on it right now because of income-based repayment. (If it was a standard payment plan, it would be about $1300 per month). Another wrinkle is that while it's one account, my federal debt actually consists of 12 smaller loans ranging from $3k all the way up to $25k from law school. So I could in theory pay these off individually so they stop creating interest. The average interest rate across all of the loans is 5.22%

After all of my monthly expenses are met, and after all minimum payments above are met, I have about $1000 per month to throw on these loans. So, my main question is, should I work on the federal debt (which I can barely put a dent in, and the progress I do make will be almost completely erased by the interest), or do I pay down my private debt in chunks, thus freeing up more money to throw on the federal debt?

My current plan is to use the $1000/mo to pay off the car this year, then to take $1300 per month (the extra I'll have from the car payment) on the private student loans and pay that off in another 2 years, then take $1800 per month and start chipping away at the federal debt. 

I'm just not sure what the best route is to take. Do I make small, almost insignificant progress on the large balance that is racking up interest, or do I take care of the smaller obligations to free up more cash later? I appreciate any help you guys could give me.",finance

Current plan:
We pay $1,000/month per car which will pay off both cars within 18 months. My repayment to my previous job for student loans is $250 and my federal is 70. Once my employer is repaid, I will add the 250 to the federal. Any commissions and bonus will go towards paying down student loans.

So we do have some money left over, some goes into savings some goes towards spend and we've been good so far now that credit cards are gone. I've noticed that using debit cards we spend less.

2 year plan:

We will be selling our house. It's a new townhome built in 180 and comps around my neighborhood have sold for 250+. The issue is, the HOA is mandating us to put a deck on by the year 2021 and needs to have one before it's sold. That will cost us 5k, so we will use our tax return and no touch our growing nest egg for that. We will buy a cheaper 80-100k home on a short 15 year mortgage closer to family and use the equity to renovate it (which is ideal because it will keep the taxes down).

At that point, we will also have next to no debt making more than double our expenses and plan to start going on some nice vacations and investing more into retirement. The only downside is, we are right now living decent. We go out to eat twice a week, we will go on 3 mini vacations (costing between 500-800/each) but will be paying for all of them with cash. We will be gifting her sister $1500 as a thank you for her bday for helping my wife our years ago and I am spending $800ish on my wife's 30th birthday. But my goal is to do all of this with cash and using as little savings as possible.

Not in a hurry to pay off, figure interest rate just on the boarder of low/high.  No other debt, credit score 832.  Current 401(k) $14,000, contributing 12% +3% match.  Would like to buy a house in the next two years, have been renting since 18 and am just done with sharing walls with other people.  Plan on using a first time home buyer program which allows as little as 3% or so down.  In two years I will have the 3% + closing costs + $10,000 in reserves.  Wondering if it would make sense to reduce 401(k) contributions down to minimal the next two years, so 6% to still get the 3% matching, in order to either have a bigger down payment and/or have more in reserves/emergency fund.  Is my planned $10,000 in savings after buying going to be sufficient or do I need more?  Thank you very much for your help/opinions.",finance
personalfinance,How to respond to a collection letter?,"Just got a collections letter the other day in the mail saying I owe around $16,000 for student loans. I did go to school and had a loan out a very very very long time ago. Talking 25+ Years ago. As far as I know everything was paid 20+ years ago. They have my first name incorrect but have my last name and address correct.  I looked up the collection agency and its a valid agency.

Do I start off with a dispute letter or a validation letter? Not sure if we have some identity theft from 25 years ago or this is for something that got paid off but isn't paid off or what or this is some type of scam. Not sure why they have my name wrong - maybe they are looking for somebody with my last name and just trying me up? They are naming US department of education is who holds the loan - which would indicate federal loan and not private. Private SOL would be way over with.

So validation letter or dispute the bill letter. Or combine both into one?",finance
personalfinance,I am straddled with my parent's higher interest loans from college. What's the best course of action for tackling the debt?,"When I started out college, my father had a relatively high paying job (around 150 grand a year).  Due to his high income, we were issued loans from the government.  I took out $15,000.  My parents took out $45,000.

Fast forward a couple of years, my dad loses his high paying job and is now making considerably less.  My mom has a chronic illness which prevents her from being able to work.  And so, they've asked me to take on the payments for their loan. 

Which I'm totally fine with.  The only catch is that because they were issued a parent loan, there is a higher interest rate (by about 3%) which amounts to thousands more that I'd potentially have to pay back.  

I'm curious as to what the best course of action is for tackling this debt?  Should I consolidate it through a loan servicer?  Take out a personal loan of my own at a lower rate?  I'd appreciate any advice.",finance
personalfinance,Quest Diagnostics Billing Directly Due to Their Error,"My wife and I lived back in California where we had Tricare West for our insurance (HealthNet Federal). She had a test done in June of 2019 at Quest where she had other tests done before and always had them successfully paid by Tricare. No issues.

We receive orders to the east coast and move from there and forward our mail. We receive a letter from Quest billing her for $300 for the test because ""Insurance rejected the claim because member was not found in system"". 

First thing we notice is her name is spelled incorrectly with 3 letters off in the last name and 1 off in the first name. This is why Tricare rejected the claim. Since we moved to the east coast, we switched to Tricare East which is Humana Military - technically a different company. 

We called Quest and fixed the information and told them to submit a claim to Tricare East with the correct information. Months later we receive a second notice with the same bill and corrected name. No mention of a claim just a bill. We call and are told that no effort to bill the insurance was made, we just need to pay. I told them to submit a claim to the insurance so they can receive payment. Months later another third notice with bigger scarier font and the usual ""do not ignore this notice"" etc spiel. We sent an email to them on the website and received a confirmation email that it was received but they decided not to write back. No response from their Facebook page either.

Not sure where to go from here. In the past in billing or collection disputes I dealt with for my father I always communicated via certified mail and sometimes email. I would like to send Quest a letter via certified mail but am unsure of where to send it to since they don't have a correspondence address. Just a PO box where to remit payment. 

I am also not sure if there is an office specifically in California which regulates medical billing to which I could write to and hopefully get Quest to stop ignoring the communications we are sending. Is there such an agency?",finance

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

economy,"US economy modestly expanding, but trade tensions weigh – Fed","The U.S. economy has grown at a moderate pace over the past six weeks of 2019, but uncertainty about U.S. trade policies has continued to harm firms, according to a survey by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday.

https://preview.redd.it/r0lpu6qb0bb41.png?width=696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62e0f1a7dc1b371eec22fc25b1a02e345a210c53

In many areas, tariffs and trade uncertainty continued to put pressure on some enterprises, the Fed said in a report compiled from unofficial data from business contacts across the country.

The Fed cut interest rates three times last year, changing course after three years of periodic rate hikes. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell described rate cuts as insurance against slowing global growth, trade tensions, and moderate inflation in order to maintain record economic growth.

Since then, the Fed’s legislative bodies have made it clear that they intend to keep interest rates unchanged for the foreseeable future, citing an increase in the economy after last year’s cuts and easing tensions in the US-China trade war.

If they succeed, it could doom the US economy","https://www.eurasiareview.com/17012020-the-world-looks-to-abandon-the-dollar-as-us-sanctions-tighten-their-grip-oped/  

TL;DR  
US allies are working on an alternative to SWIFT. They have grown far more wary of leaving the financial system in a place where it can be so easily dominated by the US regime. If Iranian banks can be “unplugged” so easily from the global system, what’s to stop the US from taking similar steps against German banks, French banks, or Italian banks?  

If the US finds itself no longer at the center of the global financial system, this will bring significant disadvantages for the US regime and US residents. A decline in demand for the dollar would also lead to less demand for US debt.  This would put upward pressure on interest rates and thus bring higher debt-payment obligations for the US regime.",finance
worldpolitics,The GAO says the Trump White House violated the law in withholding funds from Ukraine and everyone is going crazy. Does it matter?,"If a mere GAO finding is sufficient to justify impeachment, then President Barack Obama ought to have been impeached at least seven times over for each of the following cases in which the GAO found that the Obama administration had violated federal law.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and United States Secret Service (USSS) were found to have violated section 503 of the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, and the Antideficiency Act, in 2009 after the Secret Service reported that it had overspent on candidate protection in 2008 by $5,100,000, and used money from another program to cover the shortfall. DHS failed to notify Congress 15 days in advance of the “reprogramming.”


The Department of the Treasury was found to have violated the Antideficiency Act in 2014 when it used the voluntary services of four individuals. “Treasury did not appoint any of the individuals to federal employment, nor did any individual qualify as a student who may, under certain circumstances, perform voluntary service,” the GAO found, adding that there was no emergency that might have justified using the individuals to perform several months of work without receiving pay.

The Department of Defense was found to have violated the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2014 and the Antideficiency Act in the infamous Bowe Bergdahl swap, when President Barack Obama traded five high-level Taliban detainees for a U.S. Army deserter. The administration transferred the five Taliban from Guantanamo Bay without notifying relevant congressional committees 30 days in advance, as required by law. Republicans complained; Democrats were silent.


The Department of Housing and Urban Development was found to have violated the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, and the Antideficiency Act in 2014 when the deputy secretary of the department sent an email to “friends and colleagues” asking them to lobby the Senate in favor of a bill appropriating money to the department, and against amendments offered by Republican Senators.


The Environmental Protection Agency was found to have violated “publicity or propaganda and anti-lobbying provisions” in the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act and the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act in 2015 by using some of the department’s social media accounts in rule-making for the “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS) regulations (which have since been repealed under the Trump administration).

Two officials in the Department of Housing and Urban Development were found in 2016 to have violated Section 713 of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act by attempting to prevent a regional director within the agency from being interviewed by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. (Notably, the GAO reversed its earlier decision that the department’s general counsel had not violated the law once it was presented with more evidence.)


The Federal Maritime Commission was found to have violated Section 711 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, as well as the Antideficiency Act, in 2016 when it failed to notify the relevant Senate and House committees that it had spent more than $5,000 to furnish and redecorate the office of its former director in 2010. (The total amount spent was $12,084 over three years, as noted by the GAO in a footnote reference to an inspector general’s report on the excessive expenditures.)

My point is the GAO makes these findings all the time.  Dropping it just before the impeachment trial seems like a political statement to me, but regardless, it isn't enough to add new impeachment charges, if Obama's years as President are any indication.

EDIT:  A lot of you are writing to tell me how wrong I am to suggest this doesn't matter, and some of you are getting in snits because you think I am defending Trump.

Trump deserves to be impeached. He abused the power of his office for political/partisan reasons that are unbecoming to a President. In asking Ukraine for an investigation of the Bidens, he crossed a line between his role as President and his role as a politician seeking reelection, in my view.   He also obstructed a congressional investigation of that behavior, refusing to assist.

However, what he did NOT do was commit the following crimes some of you are accusing him of:

Extortion:  Most states define extortion as the gaining of property or money by almost any kind of force, or threat of violence, property damage, or some other type of harm.

Blackmail: Blackmail is the crime of threatening to reveal embarrassing, disgraceful or damaging information about a person to the public, family, spouse or associates unless money is paid to purchase silence.

Some of you have even gone off the deep end with conspiracy theories about Trump setting up a shadow government (Really?) and at least one has said he is a War Criminal (careful.  President Obama killed more people with drones than Trump has.  He isn't a war criminal either.)  

Let's keep it to what Nancy Pelosi and the other DNC leaders have agreed they can prove:   Trump abused his office for personal political gain, and Trump obstructed Congress when they investigated that abuse.  Everything else is nonsense.",finance

investing,How The Us debt Will Cause The Next Depression,"The US has well over 23 trillion dollars debt right now and it's increasing fast. It has come to the point that Debt is growing faster than income, if the tide doesn't change the US will have to default. It isn't only the generation of people that live right now that will be hit by this debt, the future generations will feel it as well. They will have to pay their tax dollars to pay for debt caused by past generations.

&amp;#x200B;

The economic expansion has been mainly driven by debt and the availability of credit, pushing the government's debt and the people's debt to absurdly high levels. The average debt of a an USA citizen is near the level of the last crisis. Us debt is over 100% of the GDP. The GDP of Greece before their crisis was around 103%. US doesn't have the requirements to meet the standards of the EDP (excessive deficit procedure, requirements necessary to join the EU) at all, which has become a standard in my eyes as in what to see as a financially healthy country.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rule 1**: public debt (government debt &amp; that of public agencies) must not exceed 60% of GDP.

US: Debt to GDP 105%

**Rule 2**: their budget deficit must not exceed 3% of gross domestic product (GDP);

US: -4.7% 

&amp;#x200B;

What's worse there isn't any sign of consolidation any time soon and the budget deficits for 2019-2021 are expected to roughly double, due to the Trump tax cuts and other spending legislation. Spending on military is also on all time highs. Trump isn't good for the economy as people have been saying. His short term gain is going to give the next president an unwarrantable financially unhealthy system and going to cause taxpayers to pay a lot of money just for interest on the debt while their own debt is also high. The economy has cycles and the government should act on the best interest interests of to reduce the impact of those cycles trying to stop it or delay it like this is gonna make things worse. Trump is now shifting blame to the federal reserve while he keeps spending to keep his public image intact. 

&amp;#x200B;

If this keeps going on it won't be just recession it will be worse and much harder recover from this will be the next depression which tend happen once every 75-100 years and the last one was in 1929. The percentage of listed companies in the U.S. losing money over 12 months is close to 40%, they will also be hit greatly. The Fed printing money will reduce the buying power of existing money which at this scale can't go on forever. The interest is meanwhile at all-time-lows which gives the government less control in case a recession/depression hits. 

&amp;#x200B;

A majority of wealthy American investors are optimistic about U.S. stocks, but are still sitting on piles of cash, according to a UBS Group survey. One of them is Warren Buffet. They don't seem very talkative on why they don't invest, but I think they know all this, they know what's coming. They know there is going to be a Economic pullback. Economic pullbacks are usually caused by misallocation of money in the market and what if the misallocation of money is in debt this time? 

&amp;#x200B;

This gives the concept of how eagerness to boost the economy by presidents/governments will wreck havoc on the economy in the long run. Low interest pushes higher debt that hurts the profitability of banks. Tax cuts boost spending and decrease government income. The government takes debt (self-contradictory) to increase their spending and pushes the economy even further. The government prints money to send the economy even higher. The debt from the government and people will rise till the point that debt rises faster than income and everything falls apart.

&amp;#x200B;

Rent: $1,440

Gas: \~$20-$30

Water: \~$70-$90 (billed by apartment so I dont know if this is just split evenly or usage by apartment)

Phone: $201 - (5 people) 

Car Insurance+Renters: $120

FIOS: $68 (includes modem rental)

Electricity: \~$80-$100 (I pump a/c in the summers. Winter is set 73-74)

Federal Student Loans: $2,000 (On a 25-year term but trying to get rid of in 10)

1. Should I dump my E-Fund into the remaining 6.5 CC and start saving again? 

2. Should I look into buying a FIOS modem to save a few $/month?

3. Is my rent/gas/water too high? The water/gas are billed through my apartment management and I never bothered to figure out if its evenly split or somehow pro-rated by apartment.

personalfinance,Seeking advice on paying off CC debt with a balance transfer card.,"Hello r/personalfinance. I've made a throwaway to post this. Here's the gist:

I have a $14,300 balance on a Navy Fed card with a 16.9% apr. It has a 17k limit. 

I can spare about $800 minimum monthly towards paying off the debt, and not charging anything else to it. Some months I can pay more because I'll work OT.

I've just been approved for a [Citi Simplicity](https://citicards.citi.com/usc/LPACA/Citi/Cards/Simplicity/ps_A/index.html?cmp=KNC~01~110901~CRDACQXX~Google&amp;ds_rl=1282344&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-O787vWK5wIVE5SzCh1jrQm3EAAYASAAEgLeNvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;BT_TX=1&amp;ProspectID=A3B18216F5F14E4F9531EA42F995BD47) card with a $1,000 limit. 21 months no APR on balance transfers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I balance transfer the max to the Citi card, pay it off, and repeat until the Navy Fed card is paid off? Will that further hurt my credit to have that card maxed? The only bad thing on my credit is high utilization. (I have another CC with a 1600 limit, 0 balance.)

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone been able to negotiate Navy Fed to give a lower interest rate? I've heard of companies doing that, but it just doesn't make sense as to why they would.

I hope these questions are allowed. I read the FAQ and couldn't find quite what I was looking for. Thank you SO much!",finance
personalfinance,"Tax service claimed $7200 in charitable giving on my taxes. Why, and should I do something about it?","So, I should begin by stating that I am now much more involved in my taxes being filed.  So I don't see this as an issue going forward.

I used a tax service to prepare my taxes last year (I have always done so), and I am never present when it is being done.  I send all my forms with my mother, and she gets everything taken care of.  She has used the same tax service to prepare our returns since before I was born (I'm 35), and this last year, the owner retired and sold the business.  So she found a new service, and we continued our normal method of filing returns.

The new service claimed $7200 in charitable giving (which I did not ask for).  I only found out recently because my state income tax return was lower than what I expected (discovered while preparing taxes for this year), and I decided to follow up.  My state basically disqualified all itemized deductions because of that one item.  I'm filing an amended return for the state to fix that issue, but should I do the same for federal?  I've received no communication from them, but I wonder if it will affect future returns.

personalfinance,"Do state and federal witholdings go in the same ""pot"" for estimated tax purposes?","Hello all! I have a very specific tax question. I tried to find the answer here but it looks like nobody has asked it yet, so forgive me if it's a repeat.   


My husband worked as a contractor for the first time last year and we (stupidly) did not fully understand how estimated payments worked. We have saved enough from each of his paychecks to pay the amount we owe for 2019 in April easily, but I'm trying to figure out if we are going to have to pay an underpayment penalty.   


I know that if we had 100% of our total 2018 tax witheld from my (w-2) paychecks we will be okay on the underpayment. My total federal witholdings from my paycheck (medicare, social security, and federal income tax) are $2 short of our 2018 federal tax liability, but my state witholdings are about $1000 greater than our 2018 state tax liability. So, basically We're more than covered if all the witholdings are counted together, but $2 short on the federal side if they count separately.  


So, are we going to have to pay a penalty and if so, how much? Will the 6% be calculated based on that $2 (not a big deal) or will it be calculated based on the total liability from my husband's contract work (A lot more than $2!)

personalfinance,"Bad Credit, Bad History, how long to rebuild?","My credit score is low, I have a few debts that I will be paying off once I start working. My employment history isn't the best (worked jobs for 6-9months, rinse repeat).

I am starting next week at the USPS as a CCA. My orientation and training will take probably a few weeks to a month, but I start getting paid my first day in orientation.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have a vehicle right now, and have been looking at some options, because my orientation is in another town, and I don't know where I'll have to go to the academy, and getting to work hopefully I can take the bus. I spoke with my dad a bit, and did some car searching looking for something that was around 5K that I might be able to get into and just have a car for a few years. He doesn't want to co-sign for me, because his debt/income ratio is already fairly high, and hes worried that he will get denied (which would be bad on his credit score) and just the past with me. I get it and understand.

&amp;#x200B;

He thinks that if I work at the post office for 2-3 months, that I will be able to walk into the bank and get an auto loan on my own. Does that seem possible?

&amp;#x200B;

My original thought/plan, was I found a decent car (2007, 90K miles) that was 7000. I was going to use my tax return as a down payment (1000), try and get an auto loan for the remainder (through navy federal CU, since we both bank there) and pick a term where I was paying 200-250/month for the vehicle. My rent/utilities comes out to $400/mo, and I looked up insurance, for my age/record full coverage would cost me 80/mo. My cell phone is $50/mo, and other than my debts, I have no other bills. I would be able to get into a car, pay 3-350 a month for it, and be able to get to work and back. My starting pay is 19.xx/hr

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My credit score is 450, I have 2 credit cards that I pay minimum on to keep afloat and plan to pay them off with my first few paychecks(1 is 400 the other is 500). I have 2 accounts in collections (1 is 380, other is 180). and Student loan thats differed for 33K. Lets say I pay off my 2 credit cards, 2 collections with my first few paychecks and all I have left is my student loan. Would I qualify for any sort of loan within 2-3 months of working a federal job?

&amp;#x200B;

My concern is my dad is willing to rent a car for me for a week for my orientation and again for my academy (don't know where/long it is) and then I can figure out getting to work on my own for a few months (work is like 5 miles away), but isn't willing to co-sign on a loan for me to get a couple thousand dollar car that would get me to all that stuff, and even if its a POS, it would probably last me at least a year, which I feel my odds would be a lot higher on securing a loan myself vs in a few months..

We received a little over $4,000 each. The vehicles and house went to my sister and one of my brothers. My brother and I were executors of the estate. I live in Kentucky and have called both the KY dept of revenue as well as the IRS and can't get an answer as to how to claim this as income, or if i'm supposed to. I've done some research online and from what the KY dept of revenue website says, class A beneficiaries are exempt from paying inheritance tax, but when I called them, they said that it would be based on what the federal government does whether or not they do, so to ask the IRS. I called the IRS and was transferred to a tax law dept that no longer answers calls but directs you to the IRS website. From what i've found online, there doesn't seem to be a federal inheritance tax.

personalfinance,Transitioning to Single Income Family,"For personal reasons, my husband is wanting to transition out of his current full time work to establish a new freelance career path, and I am 100% supportive of that, but want to make sure we have our ducks in a row, as he will likely not be pulling in much (if any) income for a good while.

He has made it clear to his job that he is willing to help them until an adequate replacement is found -- so we are estimating roughly 6 months for us to move from a DINK household to a SINK household. I have a few questions on transitioning to help ensure we are covered:

* Taxes: What is the ideal status and claims on my W-4 I should adjust to? Currently, I claim married filing jointly-1 and I think he claims married-0 on our W-4s. I don't care about big tax refunds and I want to break as close to even if possible, but I also don't want to be worrying about writing a big check to the IRS.
* What additional insurances should we have in place? I get health benefits from work, and have a modest life insurance through them (2x my salary). I tried to meet with Northwestern Mutual about life and disability insurance before, but it really felt like a rip off and stressed me out.
* Do we need more liquid emergency savings in place?
* Should we start funneling his income into liquid savings? I am considering setting up an auto transfer of his paycheck into savings so that we don't even see it in checking at all.

We will be losing about 1/4th of our total net take-home without his paycheck -- I make good money, but I admit that we have been bad about excessive spending in the past year that has left us breaking even a few months. I am not too worried about my own job stability right now, but if I did lose my job I feel confident I could likely get a similar job inside of my severance period.

We are now using Mint to set a budget and try to be strict with it through the transition.

Debts:

* We just refinanced our home, so we have a lower interest rate and no PMI, and have taken our P&amp;I payment down to $1100/month from $1500/month. P&amp;I + Escrow is $1350/month.
* My car is only 1.5 years from being paid off (0% interest, $400/month). I could make extra payments to get it paid off sooner, but I have avoided this because at 0% interest it made sense to contribute more to my retirement fund -- but maybe getting rid of this debt will add as an extra assurance with only 1 income?

Savings &amp; Contributions:

* Emergency Savings: $12k (\~6 months of expenses estimating $2k/month conservatively)
* My Retirement Contributions: 15% (10% trad 401k, 5% roth 401k -- 5% employee match into traditional 401k)
* Employee stock buy: Contribute 2% of my salary and buy at 10% discount -- I usually sell right away at the end of the buy period for 10% gain, and then move into a brokerage account.

I'm asking for a divorce soon. Prelim verbal disclosure is $200K equity in the home, $80K previously undisclosed personal debt my husband has, $20K personal debt for me, and $15K mutual debt (down payment loan from his parents). Splitting 50/50 would leave about $30K each in the end.

My debt is four active accounts - two bank CC's (maxed, $10K &amp; $5K respectively), a personal loan ($5K, payoff complete next year), and a very small retail CC ($150 balance which I'll pay shortly). I am **NOT** on the mortgage (my credit was bad 10 years ago and I made very little money at the time), but I **am** on the title.

While I don't think $20K debt is unmanageable for my salary, I am **not** comfortable with having debt at all. I got the personal loan to pay down the credit card balances at a lower interest rate, and right after I got it, my STBX got a DUI, totaled his truck, and was living with his parents for 9 months because he wasn't welcome home for a while. My CC balances rose again while we were separated, because I couldn't drastically change the standard of living during that limbo.

I likely plan on consulting with a lawyer regarding his debt - we live in a community property state, so I assume I'll have to eat it, but I'd like confirmation on my options.

I'll be continuing to pay down the open balances as well, and they'll be paid when the divorce is finalized.

personalfinance,True Gross Income,"I am currently applying for a mortgage. We are a little close on the DTI limit because we want to sell our current home after we move. 

The point is...for gross income, I told them my salary number, which is on the top of my paycheck. 

On the bottom of my check is a federal W2 gross. That is after all my pre tax deductions, like insurance, hsa and retirement. The underwriter says that is my gross income. 

I assume since this is their job, they are right, I am just surprised. The fact that I dump 15% of my income into my HSA and 401K are going to cost me this loan?

I am only higher DTI because I am not selling my house to get this loan. Once the home sells I can pay off the other debt and the mortgage is actually less than my current mortgage.",finance
personalfinance,Origination fee and federal student loan question.,"So my girlfriend got a direct parent plus loan with an origination fee of 4.236%. The loan was for $10,500 and the school says they received $9,639. I’ve never dealt with loans so I don’t understand why the origination fee seems to be doubled.

personalfinance,3 jobs isn’t enough,"I graduated in July and had to move back in with my family and it took over 8 months to find a job. I’ve started working only gotten two paychecks, one was a training paycheck so it was short the next was the holidays so it was also short. I THOUGHT I had 60k in student loans and my payments would  be $479 a month and I was so excited to get a new job offer from 10/hr to 14/hr. 

but my dad called me today he saw in my mail that I actually have another student loan for $80 a month. They are private so they can’t be reduced and the payments are $559 all together monthly. That amount doesnt even include my federal loan. My credit is dropping like shit, I’m working two jobs and a side job, late on payments of course, and I already don’t pay for shit on my own. The funniest part about it is I don’t even need a degree for the job I love. 

I’m desperately trying to find other ways to make money on the side without too much time because I work so much. Trying to think of an online class or something I can sell or something. Will private loans ever decrease? I’ve always been told they do not offer income based for 2/3 

Please offer any ideas to generate revenue/options I have. I am so so tired of failing.

A bit about my friend: she, along with her husband, has a household income of \~200-250k USD. They are childless and in their early 30s. While not necessarily rich for a big city in the US, I would imagine they shouldn't have any problems paying their bills.

Yesterday I learned that she doesn't pay off her credit card bill in full every month, instead electing to pay only a portion based on reasons unknown to me. I doubt that she lacks the funds to pay off her bill, so I don't understand her decision.",finance

personalfinance,Student loan @ 4%: Pay it off or invest?,"I've seen a lot of advice that says if your student loan interest rate is low enough, right about the level mine is at, you're better off paying the minimum if you are able to make reasonable retirement contributions and save/invest. However, Dave Ramsey and some people here recommend paying off all non-mortgage debt if you have the means, which is attractive to me from a psychological perspective. Which would you do in this situation? I've read the prime directive, but am curious what people think. 

tl;dr: Should I (mostly) liquidate my emergency fund to pay off 4% student debt 4 years early?

Details: 

* 30M
* Student Loan debt: Private 37k loan @ 4%, a little under 5 years remaining. Can't deduct interest anymore
* Monthly payment: $734
* Salary: 101k in high cost of living area, very low risk of job loss, but unlikely to make significantly more in the next few years. GF makes \~90k but isn't saving much
* Retirement: contributing 10% into 403b, employer contributes 10%. 80k among Traditional Rollover IRA and 403b
* Emergency fund/savings: 33k, should be 6 months without a change in lifestyle, nearly a year if I am extremely frugal. Deposited 200 of every 2-week paycheck to a HYSA, will be 250 going forward. Usually move some excess money from my checking every few months as well
* No CC debt, generally pay my cards off every month
* Renter, looking to buy a home in 3 years if possible, would need 100k+ for a downpayment between me and the GF in this area to avoid PMI
* Have access to an interest free 10k loan from work, if I need cash quickly

I know I probably have too much cash in the emergency fund, I was going to start putting some into a Roth and ETFs to try and grow that down payment more quickly, but having 700+ of additional cash flow every month would be fantastic. I think I could keep 5k in the fund and pay off the remainder by the end of 2020, if not a little sooner.",finance

personalfinance,Can different people claim a dependent on FAFSA and federal tax returns?,"My girlfriend (we are not married) is working on filling out her FAFSA and one of the questions is whether or not you have dependents. Thing is, she doesn't work and as a result, I provide the majority support for our child.  However, if she does not claim a dependent, she is considered dependent and must provide her parents information on the application.  For obvious reasons, we all know why that part sucks. I feel like many people have been in that situation where parents do not support their children's education financially and yet their income somehow affects the child's ability to receive aid.

Anyway, long story short, my question is this: can I claim our child on federal tax returns while my girlfriend claims our child on her FAFSA?",finance
personalfinance,Free Checking Accounts WITHOUT ACH or debit card use requirements,"Hi everyone,

Does anyone know of some good, completely free checking account options that don't require a certain number of debit card purchases or an monthly ACH threshold to waive the service fee?

I find that the ""envelop method"" but for bank accounts is by far my preferred style of financial management. What I want from the account is the ability to transfer and withdraw money online -- I'll probably never use an ATM/debit card and don't need local branches. I need to be able withdraw money/pay bills routinely though, so while I *do* have multiple savings accounts that I use to save for various things, I'd like more checking accounts since unlike savings accounts you aren't limited with regard to how many withdrawals/payments you can make in a cycle.

I'm self employed so I don't have ANY ACH deposits, though could do routine regular transfers into the account if that would ""count"" toward it...but they seem to typically require the deposit be ACH rather than a transfer between accounts.

I use credit cards or mobile payments for all my expenses and very much don't want to use debit cards instead, so that's not really an option either.

I already have the Discover free checking account (which is the only actual free, no-requirements account I know of), along with a Chase checking that I either eat the monthly fee on or try to suck it up and use the debit card six times a month, and a Penfed checking that I keep above 1K in to avoid the service fee.

If anyone knows of other options at other banks/credit unions, I'm all ears and would greatly appreciate the info!",finance

Yes yes i know that isn’t correct, however at the end of the year it leaves me only owing around a couple hundred and leaves more cash for me during the year. 

This new form makes sense to me, but how would I fill it out based on claiming 3 on my previous form? The reason I ask is because I just multiplied the number on there by three and wrote the number (6,000) in there. 

I literally had 0.00 taken out of my check. Back when I had claimed three on my previous w4, I always had roughly 20-30 dollars taken out for federal. This was PERFECT. It left me with plenty of money. I’d rather pay in a couple hundred at the end of the year, rather than give the government an interest free loan.

personalfinance,"Unexpected pregnancy... How much to save, and in what accounts? Should I be worried about federal student loan repayments, too?","Hi, all. This is a throwaway account. The past year or so I have been working  to get my finances together, getting a second job towards the end of last year to pay off some creeping credit card debt. I’m at a bit of an impasse in what I should now do to best prepare for the future as I just found out that I'm pregnant. Surprise!

&amp;#x200B;

Debts and assets:

\* No credit card, car, or house (I rent) debt

\* $1.5K in HYSA (just started saving)

\* $25K in 401K; was contributing 16% and just dropped down to 6%; no employer match; no management fees - I think the rate of return last year was like 18%?

\* \~28k in federal student loans at 6.5% interest

\* As I said, I just found out I am pregnant (!); may be starting a new job before I qualify for PFL (NYC), and will lose my accrued sick and vacation time at my current job, so I am possibly looking at 6 weeks of mat leave (short term disability) followed by 8 weeks of paid pat leave for my partner. He's also eligible for 10 weeks of PFL in 2020; I would likely be eligible for 10 weeks this time next year, so within the first year of the child's life, but not at the time of the child's birth.

\* Take home pay from job #1 is $2,600 monthly and from job #2 is between $600 and $1,000 monthly. I definitely can't keep working the second job at as many hours after I have the baby. As I just finished paying my credit card debt, I am able to save $1k per month.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Budget:

\* I have one! It’s working well, although it could probably be trimmed in certain places in an emergency.

\* My partner makes a higher salary than I do and could realistically split child care costs.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

\* What’s a reasonable emergency fund amount to focus on, considering my HCOL area and my impending addition to my family? I estimate that $5K is enough for three months of expenses as things stand now (considering my partner pays more in rent than I do), but should I be aiming for higher considering my family situation? My partner’s insurance (which we are looking to add me to in the next couple of months) is very good, and we don’t anticipate extremely high birth costs. I’m mostly worried about child care costs following the birth.

\* Should I be stopping all 401K contributions for the moment to either save or pay debt? I don’t have any IRA accounts, and we don’t yet have an HSA. I worry about doing this since my retirement accounts are not that big at the moment.

\* Should I be focused at all on paying more on my student loans at this point? I know that the interest isn’t great, but I’m not sure if that’s the best direction to take my money in. I'm in PSLF as well as IBR and I'm likely to pay off most of the loans within the time-frame for forgiveness, which makes me wonder what the point is of drawing things out....

What should I do with all this money. I feel like I might spend it on amenities in life and being lazy if I don’t have a plan for it. I want to start a business but the planning for that may take a year.

I have a pretty simple question regard my student loans. I have about 15k left to repay and my monthly payments are currently about 320. Interest rate is 5.75% and is currently my only interest bearing account in my name, so there aren't any higher priorities necessarily in terms of debt.

My question is: I have more than the loan balance saved... so, is there any reason NOT to just knock out my student loans in like 5 months of 3k payments (or something similar to reduce the interest pretty much completely)? Using an online calculator it looks like I'll spend around 2k in interest at my current rate.

# **Earnings will decide whether the market continues to hit new highs after another week of records  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/17/earnings-will-decide-whether-market-continues-to-hit-new-highs.html)**
*****
&gt; With the Chinese trade deal out of the way, earnings could be the biggest driver for stocks in the week ahead, as big tech, financial, consumer and industrial companies report.
*****
&gt; So far, the early rush of earnings are beating estimates at a pace of about 70%. Just a few dozen S&amp;P 500 companies report in the four-day trading week, including IBM Tuesday and Intel on Thursday. Johnson &amp; Johnson reports Wednesday; Procter &amp; Gamble is Thursday, and American Express releases results Friday. The stock market is closed Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday.
*****
&gt; President Donald Trump travels to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum, where he speaks Tuesday. With the China trade deal signed this past Wednesday, strategists say they are now watching for any signs of a bigger trade row brewing between the U.S. and Europe.
*****
&gt; There are a few economic reports, including existing home sales Wednesday; leading indicators Thursday, and the Markit PMI data for manufacturing and services on Friday.
*****
&gt; But it’s earnings, where investors will take the pulse of corporate America, and decide whether forward guidance is justifying the stock market’s record highs and price earnings ratio of more than 18.5. The S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 2% in the past week, its best week since August. The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record 3,329 Friday and is now up about 3% since the start of the year.
*****
&gt; The Dow and Nasdaq also ended the week at new highs. The Dow ended up 1.9% for the week, at 29,348. The Nasdaq rose 2.3% in the past week, ending at 9,388.
*****
&gt; Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist at Credit Suisse, said the fourth quarter could be a turning point for earnings, after a poor performance in 2019. So far, earnings are down about 0.8% this quarter, based on actual releases and estimates, according to Refinitiv. If not for the drag from energy companies, profits for S&amp;P 500 companies would have been 1.9% higher.
*****
&gt; “2019 was a year of lousy earnings, and the fourth quarter is the end of a lousy year,” said Golub. “I think earnings surprises will be fine, but what the real story here is, it looks like magically the 2020 numbers are going to be much, much stronger than 2019.”
*****
&gt; Golub said there are two big themes this earnings season. “The first one is tech-related companies. Many of the mega caps had okay earnings, but their margins were under a lot of pressure and it subtracted earnings growth in 2019. Those trends are supposed to reverse. So what was a negative because of easy comps becomes a positive,” Golub said. “The same thing with the energy sector which was a disaster in terms of earnings growth in 2019.”
*****
&gt; He said the market rally can continue in part because investors are not yet on board with the earnings story.
*****
&gt; “While everybody is looking at the fourth quarter, I think they’re not really reading the right script, and the script they should be reading was this was the last quarter where tech margins and energy sector headwinds are overwhelming the market,” he said.
*****
&gt; The hearings on Trump’s impeachment are so far ignored by markets and will be underway in the Senate. While the market continues to shrug it off, traders are monitoring the situation for any change in tone.
*****
&gt; “Will there be new evidence/witnesses at the Senate trial to make it politically significant?,” wrote Deutsche Bank foreign exchange strategist Alan Ruskin. “Let’s not forget that for many voters, the President seems to be the main motivator for voters on both sides of the political spectrum — for and against. This argument runs along the lines that Trump is running against himself/‘the anti-Trump’, and, the election will be heavily impacted by which Democrat candidate least impacts the ‘anti-Trump’ vote — a view that some argue tends to support centrists like Biden.”

# Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading Mixed since 1998, But Improving Lately

&gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 22 years since, the market’s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.79% by DJIA to 0.14% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last eight years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.

# A Closer Look At Election Years

&gt; 2020 is off to a roaring start, picking up right where 2019 left off. Many investors are eyeing the upcoming presidential election as an impending storm for the stock market. In the four-year presidential cycle, pre-election years have tended to be the strongest for stocks, as sitting presidents have taken measures to boost the economy and stock market higher to garner votes. It sure worked out well last year, with the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 31% total return.

&gt; Returns in election years, however, have been quite bifurcated.

&gt; “If an incumbent president was up for reelection, stocks tended to do extremely well,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “On the other hand, if there was a lame duck president in office, returns were quite muted.”

&gt; Note that a “lame duck president” means the sitting president either isn’t running for reelection or has already fulfilled the maximum two terms. It makes sense, as the president could be less motivated to do things to heat up the economy if they know they are leaving office. Possibly, investors may also get cold feet knowing a change is coming. The S&amp;P 500 was down in 2000 and 2008, and the sitting president was a “lame duck president” both years.

&gt; In the LPL Chart of the Day, we break down election years by whether the president was running for reelection or a lame duck. The chart shows the S&amp;P 500 up an impressive 11.7% on average if the President was running for reelection, compared to up an average of 2.4% if president was a “lame duck president”.

&gt; Given most presidents who have run a second time have tended to win, this could be the market’s way of saying it is comfortable with the status quo over change.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011720-pic-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Another encouraging historical trend is that the S&amp;P 500 hasn’t been lower during an election year with an incumbent president up for reelection since 1940. To be clear, stocks have been up during election years when the incumbent president actually lost. In 1980, the S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 26%, but Jimmy Carter still lost to Ronald Reagan. In other words, this does support the notion of higher stocks in 2020, but higher stocks can’t always tell you who will win in November.

# Q4 Earnings Season is All About 2020

&gt; Fourth quarter earnings season kicked off this week with 24 S&amp;P 500 Index companies slated to report results. Our expectations are for a marginal increase in S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS) on a year-over-year basis, based on current FactSet consensus estimates (-2% year over year) and the average historical upside of roughly 3 percentage points.

&gt; We’ve become accustomed to meager earnings growth. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if fourth quarter results are anywhere near expectations, 2019 will end up as a year with S&amp;P 500 returns of more than 30% and no corporate earnings growth to speak of. That means expanding stock valuations drove the market’s gains last year, a trend we do not expect to continue.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Earnings-blog-011520-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “We expect earnings growth to drive stock market gains in 2020,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “With valuations elevated, corporate America will probably have to do the heavy lifting to get stocks much above current levels.”

&gt; Accordingly, the key to this reporting season will be whether the optimistic growth outlook reflected in consensus earnings estimates for this year remains intact after companies issue guidance. Many companies will be commenting on 2020 for the first time. Our estimate of $175 per share in S&amp;P 500 EPS for the entire year represents a 6–7% increase from our $165 forecast for 2019. Based on the latest consensus estimates, that growth rate may get pushed up a bit. We still think $175 is attainable if capital investment picks up after stalling last year and wage growth remains stable.

&gt; Trade progress may help. The United States and China will sign the phase-one trade deal later today. While negotiations on the next phase will be tougher and could even stall out, businesses would welcome the additional clarity that de-escalation can provide, something that clearly weighed on corporate profits last year.

# January Off To Stronger Than Usual Start – But 2nd Half Is Weaker

&gt; Stocks are off to a stronger that usual so far in January 2020 when compared in the chart above to the average performance over the most recent 21-year period. As of today’s close DJIA is up 1.41%, S&amp;P 500 +1.61%, NASDAQ leads the pack +3.11% and the Russell 2000 was in the red until the past two days and is now up 0.44%. This is well above historical average performance in recent Januarys.

&gt; The market was up nicely today until reports hit the newswires at about 1:30 pm ET creating uncertainty that the Phase 1 trade deal expected to be signed tomorrow between the US and China may be pabulum. The realization that the tariffs on Chinese goods may remain in place until after the election as the review process runs its course drove stocks lower this afternoon. The market gave back most of its early gains with only the Dow and Russell 2000 eking out gains today.

&gt; However, as you can see in the dotted lines so far in 2020 the indices are tracking the last 21-years rather closely. If the pattern continues to pan out this year, look for a little strength over the next two days. Then weakness has been prone to appear just after mid-month after the eleventh trading day with mild average losses from on or around the eleventh trading day to the fourteenth trading day.

# January Trifecta Jackpot for Stocks

&gt; Solid across the board gains this year have put another January Trifecta Jackpot in our sights for 2020. So far our January Trifecta is two for two. Our First Five Day (FFD) early warning system came in positive up 0.7% on January 8 following up on a positive reading for our Santa Claus Rally (SCR) on January 3. The January Trifecta would be satisfied with a positive reading from our January Barometer (JB) at month’s end.

&gt; We just published an update on The Incredible January Barometer: Only 11 Major Errors in 82 Years that runs through the reasons behind the efficacy of the January. We discuss how the passage of the Twentieth “Lame Duck” Amendment to the Constitution in 1933 created the January Barometer. We also compare the January Barometer results along with the full year results, the following eleven months results, and the subsequent twelve months results to all other “Monthly Barometers” using the Dow Jones Industrials, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite

&gt; The best case, most bullish scenario is when all three indicators, SCR, FFD and JB, are positive (in table below). In 31 previous Trifecta occurrences since 1950, S&amp;P 500 advanced 87.1% of the time during the subsequent eleven months and 90.3% of the time for the full year. However, a January Indicator Trifecta does not guarantee the year will be bear or correction free. Of the four losing “Last 11 Mon” years, in the table, 1966, 1987 and 2011 experienced short duration bear markets (2011, S&amp;P 500 –19.4% peak to trough). In 2018, S&amp;P 500 retreated 19.8% from its September high close to its December low close.

&gt; Even if S&amp;P 500 was to suddenly reverse course and finish the full month in the red, the prospects for the next eleven months and the full year remain decent. Of the last 10 times since 1950 that the SCR and FFD were both positive (and the full-month January was negative), the next eleven months advanced 80% of the time and full year advanced 70% of the time with gains of 7.4% and 2.9% respectively.

&gt; A positive SCR and FFD are encouraging and further clarity will be gained when the January Barometer (page 16, 2020 Stock Trader’s Almanac) reports at month’s end. A positive January Barometer would certainly boost prospects for full-year 2020. The December Low Indicator (2020 STA, page 34) should also be watched with the line in the sand at the Dow’s December Closing Low of 27502.81 on 12/3/19.

# Global Equities Closing In On A Breakout

&gt; Below is a chart of the Bloomberg World Equity Market index, which is a cap-weighted index made up of nearly 5,000 publicly listed companies around the world (including the US). While the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 15% from its January 2018 high, it's notable that we still haven't seen equities break out on a global scale. As shown, the Bloomberg World Index is now just a hair below its prior all-time highs (22 basis points to be exact).

# Three Months And Counting Since Last 1% Decline

&gt; It has now been over three months since the S&amp;P 500's last decline of 1% or more back on 10/9. While it seems like an eternity, the current streak of 67 trading days is nowhere near any sort of record on either a long or short-term basis. The chart below shows historical streaks without a decline of 1%+ for the S&amp;P 500 dating back to 1928. The record for the longest streak was back in 1963 when the S&amp;P 500 went 174 trading days - a full eight months - without a 1% drop. Even more impressive is the fact that in both the 1950s and 1960s there were numerous streaks of 100 or more days. For a decade that is looked back on as one with a lot of upheaval in the US, the 1960s was a period of relative calm for the equity market.

&gt; More recently, the current streak of 67 trading days doesn't look all that impressive relative to streaks we saw back in 2017 and 2018. Right after the election in 2016 and into March of 2017, the S&amp;P 500 had a 109-day streak without a 1% decline, and then from late 2017 through January 2018, there was another streak of 112 trading days without a 1% drop. Even in October 2018, there was another streak of 74 trading days. In other words, in just the last three years there have been three longer streaks without a 1% decline than the current one. In the S&amp;P 500's history, there have been 26 other streaks that have been as long or longer than the current one, and half of those went on to last at least 100 trading days.

personalfinance,Which debts should I pay off first?,"I have a few debts this year that I'd like get rid of, if possible. None of them are terribly high, and I'd hope to be able to make good progress toward at least one or two in the next year, but I'm wondering which one I would benefit most from and that I should focus on first?

* Car - balance is at \~$7900, my payments are roughly $500, with an APR of 3.99%.
* Student Loan - balance is at \~$7500. This had a graduated repayment, but at a certain point the payments became a bit too high for me and it was refinanced, so the minimum payments were actually only like $100, but I usually try to pay around $400, if I can. They also keep pushing my due date though, since I overpay, so there are some months when things are tight that I just skip a payment. The interest rate on this is 7.9%
* WF Home Improvement Credit Line - balance is at \~$10,000 My house has to A/C units, and they both died within 6 months of each other, so I needed to get 2 new units. This cost around $13,200, which I didn't have, so it was financed using the Wells Fargo Home Improvement Line of Credit. As long as I make my payments on time, it is 0% interest (I'm sure this was rolled into the overall cost somehow though). The problem with this one, was that I needed to be approved for the LoC (which was fine, my credit score was somewhere around 805) but they approved me for exactly the amount due, which means that I maxed out this LoC immediately, which dropped my credit score down around 740. After about a year of making payments, my score is up to about 760, but I'd like to get it higher again.

I'd like my credit score to go back up, if I aggressively pay down the WF LoC, would it go up right away? I don't need any new financing at the moment so I suppose credit score isn't critical. If I continued making my scheduled payments, I could probably have the car/student loan paid off in a little over a year, but I'd like that to be quicker, if I can. Which should I target first, and why?

Any insight is helpful, thanks for reading!

personalfinance,My mother puts $50 a month per grandchild (7) into a savings account each month as a college fund. What are some simple options I could offer her for alternative ways to grow this $?,"My mom is happy with her current savings plan, but I would like to present her with some possible options  for her information.  I say ""simple"" options because my mother has no real knowledge or interest in investing or financial planning and anything that she would deem too complicated or risky probably won't be considered.  The savings account it at her regular brick-and-mortar bank.

My mother has 7 grandchildren by 3 children.  First family has an 8 y/o and 3 y/o.  Second family has a 5 y/o and 3 y/o.  Third family has a 5 y/o, 2 y/o and 1 y/o.  I give the ages because she definitely started this when she had less than 7 grandchildren, but I have not asked her how much she currently has in the account.   

She still works full-time.  I do believe that my parents will be with us when the kids are going to college, but if all the kids completed college in 4 years (hahahaha) they would be be 70 &amp; 75 when the first one went off and 81 &amp; 86 when the youngest finished.  I cannot imagine any conflict between my siblings and I around splitting the funds up (I am sure i might get pushback on that statement!  Just want to put out there that any options designed to safeguard certain funds for certain kids/families aren't going to be high priority and probably won't appeal to my parents.)

My mom will be resistant to any change that isn't very accessible and easy to wrap her mind around, so maybe the savings account is the best option for her.  I would at least like to encourage her to put it in a Ally savings account with a higher interest rate.  Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

investing,Market are overvalued: Using DCF Analysis with a Fed Fund Rate of 5%,"Everyone on here says stocks are not overvalued when interest rates are at 2%.  But 2% is a *short term anomaly*.  Historically, the Fed had to cut 5% to get us out of a recession.  5% fed fund rate is *a healthy economy and full normalization*.

Therefore, using a 5% fed fund rate for DCF, stocks are very overvalued.

BUYING at these prices is mainly chasing the repo liquidity, which is fine, but the long term, it seems like a dangerous play because its based on liquidity and not fundamentals.

THE other corollary is that well be at 2% or lower for longer implying stock prices are elevated and not in a bubble. BUT if you hold that view you must also accept we are in a liquidity trap.  IMPLYING that if the Fed ever reduces the balance sheet the financial markets will collapse.",finance
personalfinance,Should I put 3% down or use my retirement account to put 10-20% down?,"My spouse and I are in our early-mid 20s with a household income of $150k. We have $75k in retirement accounts (Roth IRA), and $15k in savings. We were planning to wait until we had 20% down in savings, but are tired of paying rent. Our lease is up and we need to move. Houses for rent in our area for 2-3br/1-2ba is $2000-2500/mo before any rental insurance or utilities and increasing by $100/mo or more each year.  

We are looking at a $350k-500k mortgage ($350k is the lowest houses in our area can go) which would be $1800-3200/mo including principal, interest, PMI, and home owners insurance. 

**I see 4 main options:**

* Put 3% down on any house in price range ($350-500k) with a conventional loan from our savings, then aggressively pay towards 22% equity to get PMI removed
* Put 20% down on a $350k house with either a FHA or conventional loan using our Roth IRAs to get better interest rate and avoid PMI
* Put \~10% down on any house in prince range ($350-500k) with either a FHA or conventional loan using our Roth IRAs to reach FHA minimum and have enough equity to sell if necessary
* Find a house to rent for $2000-2500/month until we can get 20% down in savings",finance

personalfinance,Pay off a car loan to improve debt-to-income ratio?,"We are trying to obtain the best mortgage rate we can, and we would appreciate any insight about whether we should take action to improve our debt-to-income ratio (most likely by paying off car loans).

Background: in the US, credit score is high (700+), two investment properties, two car loans, no standing credit card debt. All loans are at pretty favorable rates:

* 3.75% for mortgage on property #1

* 3.375% for mortgage on property #2

* 2.79% on car #1... $20k remaining, $400/month payment

* 1.75% on car #2... $8k remaining, $600/month payment

Issue is that our debt-to-income ratio looks worse (on paper) than our true situation. If we buy a place and enter into another mortgage, our debt-to-income will exceed the notional 43% benchmark. Our understanding is that might hurt our ability to land the best mortgage rate we can get. We could pay off the car loans (via non-retirement investments) right now, the reason we have not done so is the car loan rates are very favorable.

Both investment properties used to be our primary residence(s), thus the nice rates, then our careers had us move across the US. The houses are in growing areas where we easily keep long-term renters. Though our monthly cash flow for both of them is near-zero, the equity gains are very nice! Problem we heard from lenders is that they assume a 75% occupancy rate, so those investment properties ""throw off"" our debt-to-income ratio quite a bit. We are not too keen on refinancing the mortgages because we would get the ""investment property"" refinance rates. We would end up incurring refinance fees AND getting higher interest rates. We would like to avoid going down that route.

This has us reexamining our car loans. It's great having very low rates on those car loans, since we keep more $ in our non-retirement investments. But we could improve our debt-to-income by paying off one/both of the car loans immediately. Is that something we ""should"" do?

And if we should pay off the car loans... which one should we wipe out, or should we knock out both? It is cheaper to wipe out the the $600/month payment entirely, but it is at a lower rate than the $400/month payment.

Thanks in advance!",finance

financial,My employer changed my tax prefrences,"First I apologize if this isn't the correct subreddit to ask this question but I'm not sure where else to post.

I work a lot of overtime so my checks fluctuate a lot so I never even realized that my checks were larger than they should have beeb. After some digging I realized since 2019 I've been claiming 3 dependents. The problem is I was not the one to make the change on my tax prefrences nor did I ever sign any paper work to have them changed. When I was hired on in 2018 I claimed single and 0 dependents and haven't messed with any of it since. Has anyone ever had a situation like this happen? I now owe $4,800 in federal tax.

personalfinance,Backdoor Roth IRA 2019 and tax filing,"So 2019 was the first full year where I was working and the first time I started Roth IRA contributions, but I'm kind of uncertain about how to proceed with respect to finishing up my 2019 contributions this year (2020) before filing 2019 taxes and whether a backdoor would be worthwhile.

* **In 2019 I opened up a Roth IRA with Vanguard and 'contributed' $10.00**, it's in the 'settlement account' (Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund) so not actually 'invested' yet but AFAIK that's still considered a contribution (?) as it has made some gains (it's at $10.13 lol). I set it up to 'reinvest' any gains.
* I make a few thousand more than the beginning of the Roth IRA contribution phase out window (which starts at $122,000), so I AFAIK **I would not be able to contribute the full $6,000.**
* **I (mistakenly?) waited until 2019 was over** so that I could do a lump-sum backdoor IRA, which I thought was necessary to minimize the window during which it might accrue gains which I believed (misunderstood?) would complicate my taxes.

Questions:

1. Is it worthwhile to do a backdoor IRA so that I can contribute the full $6,000 or is it not worth the hassle over a ~$1,000 difference?
2. Is a backdoor IRA even possible given that I have a tiny fraction ($10.00) already contributed? Would it then entail doing a backdoor IRA on the difference? $5,990? Or exclude the gains too so $5,989.87? Or does that existing $10 Roth IRA 2019 contribution make a backdoor way too much of a hassle if not impossible?
3. I think I've read that taxes become more complicated if I do the IRA 2019 contributions the year after (right now, 2020). Is that for my 2020 taxes or for my upcoming 2019 taxes? Would this be made easier in any way since I use something like TurboTax? Maybe it can import my Vanguard data and figure most of it out?

Sorry for the many questions, I would _REALLY_ appreciate any guidance!

**BIG EDIT**: I just remembered that I shouldn't be using my salary but my gross income for 2019, which is different from my salary because I got a raise during 2019. My gross income according to my W2 annual statement:

* Gross pay: 122,500
* Reported W-2 wages: 122,340

So I would be just over the $122,000 starting phase out. I don't know if I have any extra deductions that would put me under that $122,000, are there any I wouldn't know about?",finance
personalfinance,Haven't taken investing risks... now I feel super behind.,"Hello,

Anonymous account as I would rather not divulge my financial details on my main account.

I am 30 years old, Canadian citizen, who moved to USA around 2.5 years ago. Before moving to USA, I had a Canadian bank account of CAD $150,000 (accumulated between 2012-2017 from working) which I kept in a regular checking account for the longest time because I thought I will eventually buy a house in Canada (was in a serious relationship). I never invested the money because as everyone says that if you need the money within 2-3 years, don’t invest and my plans at that time were indeed buying a house in 3 years. Turns out that didn’t happen and I ended up moving to USA in 2017. Because the CAD to USD currency rate was so horrible, I decided to keep the savings in Canadian banks and wait and see if the rates get better. I again didn’t invest the money because I thought I will move it to USA soon, and that was 2.5 years ago. During that time, I have accumulated 80,000 USD in savings which now I am keeping in a savings account because I plan to definitely buy a house end of 2020 (married now), and then move the Canadian savings ($150,000) to USD and buy an investment rental property… so I am again not investing any of my savings.

So basically, this is how it looks like:

Canadian Savings Account: $150,000 CAD (2.3% interest rate)

USA Savings Account: $80,000 USD (1.85% interest rate)

401k: 12,000 USD (I joined a company 1.5 years ago that offers 401k, before that, the companies had no retirement programs. I make $115k, contribute 6% in order to get the 4% match)

Roth IRA: $6000 USD

I also personally don’t keep any of the interest rate and donate it to charity so basically my net worth has only increased by the savings from my job. I feel like such a failure when I could have invested all my savings in the last 5-6 years and probably doubled/ tripled.… but instead I kept on playing it safe. I also feel like I am way behind on my 401k savings and should increase my contribution (currently doing 6% contribution with 4% match by company) to makeup for the lost years.

Note: I haven’t bought the rental property or my own personal residence is because my significant other was going through medical fellowship in east coast and we weren’t sure if we will stick around in the area after the 3 years of medical fellowship so buying a house/ rental property didn't make sense if the visa issue would lead us to going to midwest or west coast. We are now pretty hopeful that her visa will be approved in June 2020 and we will be sure that we will stay in the same area. From June to Dec 2020, we are hoping to tackle all her debt (from med school etc.) and then buy the house (using my USA savings as the 20% deposit).

Question: Should I increase my 401k contribution? I plan on also maxing my Roth IRA ($6000) every year. I don’t think that I would like to retire early... but who knows how I will feel when I am 50 so maybe I should? I just don't want to make any more mistakes..sorry for the really long post.",finance
investing,Leveraged investing,"With the bull markets we have been seeing, and nearly no signs of stopping I am thinking of using a small percent of margin money to borrow and invest in the market. Current interest rate on my margin account is 5.5% per year, so to make money I have to actually do better than that. I have been thinking 50% of the borrowed money to invest in AAPL or MSFT and the other 50% with some good dividend paying stocks such as ABBV, T to cover the interest with dividends.

The downside is if market tanks, but I am planning to use only 10-20% of my margin balance, so hopefully even then I won't get called to cover forcing to sell my current holdings. And as long as I still cash in the dividends I should be able to pay off the interests. Does that seem like a good strategy?

gaming,"Just wanted to rant a bit about a frustration I am having tonight with ""live service"" games [long-ish]","This post was inspired by my aggravation with Borderlands 3, Division 2, and Anthem primarily. I enjoyed the hell out of these games when I played through them (Anthem MECHANICALLY was fun, fight me) but lost interest because the endgame got dull and didn't live up to the dev's or the audience's expectations.

Now all 3 of these games have reworks for the systems that people don't enjoy about them, but won't be ""fixed"" for months

Borderlands 3: Excellent game, but Mayhem is just not fun in its current form. This is why the devs are working on Mayhem 2.0, but haven't shared any info about it yet, or given an ETA. I played through the game a few times on different characters, farmed a bunch of crap, got my builds nerfed, so I left. Now I am waiting to see what the new Mayhem stuff is going to be so I can go back

Division 2: Super fun game with solid gameplay and mission settings, but the loot system and gearing are just utterly ridiculous. Now the devs have a shown a bit of what is intended (A complete overhaul and re-roll of the gear we've earned), which is great, but months away. This is after delaying raid content and episodes. As much of a shitfest Division 1 was for some, they had released multiple new modes to it at this point in it's life. Now I am sitting here waiting to reinstall when I get a date for the reworks inbound.

Anthem: Fuck me what a let down. Again, I will say, combos and flight make this game  a JOY to play, for 2 days. In the past 11 months, they have added 1 permanent thing to the game, and it's a stronghold no one runs because it's inefficient for gear farming. They did the Cataclysm event, then pulled all the content it added to the game (including some build defining gear you couldn't get again until the recent Icetide event). This game had such potential, but the reasons for its failure have been talked to death but I won't go into that again. What I do want to say is that there is a big revamp coming to the game at some point that is supposed to address some of the issues with the game after some of its leadership has left, and we are just sitting here waiting.

Now I am just sitting here on Saturday while my fiance is gone wishing I was passionate about any of the games that I was so hyped about last year

The environment I’m going in to isn’t as fun as where I’m at, but I have an opportunity to work with some pretty awesome tech. If I end up being miserable there are more chances to move around to different agencies in the federal sector. 

I’ve stayed with government because I like the stability and want a good pension/retirement.

I’m posting this to see others views. Will federal government be stable, offer good retirement, and offer an enjoyable workplace?

UPDATE: Thank you everyone for the responses, it’s overwhelming. Right now the decision is a no brainer, I’m definitely going to accept the firm offer once my clearance is complete. All the comments about the job I love now changing for the worse is possible...our director will be retiring in the next few years. As for the extra 45%, I will be maxing out a TSP and IRA and keep my lifestyle needs the same. I’m grateful for everyone’s responses, and am looking forward for this new opportunity and challenge.

personalfinance,Continue Paying Student Loans or Refinance through bank?,"Hello all,
I graduated from college in 2016 and took out some loans as many do. They were all from the US Dept of Education and I currently Pay for all of them (4) through Great Lakes Borrowing. I have a pretty low interest on all of them because I am in the military. However, Navy Fed keeps offering to refinance my student loans. Would this be a good move? I have good credit and feel like I could get the same rate if not a bit of a better one. My biggest relief would be that I’d have all my accounts under the same app, aka NFCU. 
Any advice? Any of you refinance student loans and felt it was better? Any body have experience with Great Lakes? Let me know!",finance
personalfinance,How hard is it to buy and then later sell a home vs rent? (NJ),"Been a long time renter here saving up for a down payment for a house of our own. We never were really sure where we'd be long term although we've ended up staying in the same area for awhile now. We have a household income of \~155k, track every dollar in a monthly budget and have built up a 6-month emergency fund, maxed retirement accounts, and built up a portfolio of mutual funds of \~$40k or so in a taxable brokerage account as well. We've started saving up a down payment in addition to our emergency fund and other savings and so far are up to around $20k. Goal was to have a 20% down payment for our next home.

We've been renting a condo at a big discount from a family friend that has really helped with this. However, this friend has decided they wanted to sell the condo. They inquired if we wanted to buy it, but since we're not sure if this is where we want to live long-term we declined and started looking for other condos or small houses to rent in the area.

We found a few places we like, but the monthly rent for most has been around $2500. We could afford this without adjusting spending or retirement savings. However, with the monthly increase vs. discounted rent we had enjoyed, this would severely hamper our down payment saving rates, even with making some hard choices in other areas of the budget.

After a few drinks it got us thinking, what's actually involved with buying a home that we may want to sell if we move in a few years? Looking around online we've seen house prices in the $325k-$375k range. Using the 30 year fixed rate 0 point interest rate from our main bank, a $20k down payment, and $325k-$375k house prices the SmartAsset NJ mortgage calculator estimates a monthly payment of \~$2200-$2550 a month for mortgage, HO insurance, and property taxes for the property tax rate the houses reside in.

Thinking about our timelines, when we were planning to rent to save a down payment we were figuring we'd be in the next rental 2-5 years or so. The places we like are asking $2,500 for rent, and it feels like at that level we may as well be building equity towards something instead of burning the money.  If we buy instead planning to sell at some unknown point, I know we would lose closing costs and other fees at purchase, plus I read somewhere to expect to drop at least $10k or so in repairs within the first few years of home ownership. This would be a first house purchase so I believe we'd get a tax break as well. I just never considered buying a house so early so there's a lot unknown.

TL;DR:

Rent, or Buy First House and Sell if we move?  
Looking to move in next \~2-3 months.

Household Income: $155k gross

Est Duration: 2-5years

personalfinance,Taking out student loan?,"Any advice on this? I've read a little over federal and private and good grief. Never had any student loans so looking for a little first time guidance.

Basically wife is going back to school. She has a BA already and is going for her BSN then into the NP program. Both of us work and aside from house and utilities have no other debt. Well some child care but no car payments. I do have an emergency fund but don't want to tap that. I can afford to pay for some of the school as she goes but not all and I'd really like to have the flexibility in paying. Credit scores are around 840.

Now from reading it looks like my best bet is to go the federal loan route?

How does deferment work on these?
As long as she goes x hours a year we only have to pay a portion and then full payments when not? 

Can I still make extra payments? I do have access to 10k from work but that won't cover everything. 

Do I apply for x amount only for 1 year and then ask for more later or do you apply for a lump sum up front?

Thx for any guidance.",finance

personalfinance,W-2 shows Federal: 0 Tax Blocked,"I received my W-2 today and discovered I hadn't paid any Federal Taxes at all for the months of October to December. I know this to be a mistake partly on my end for not noticing sooner on my check stubs.

I paid into Federal for the entire year up to October. To the best of my knowledge and little bit of research I have done, there is no way to file Exempt from paying federal taxes on a W-4(filed 0/Single so that they may take what they feel necessary and lower risk of owing at the end of the year). I made close to $30k for the year of 2019, for the months October through December I made $8800. My problem I have is that I am receiving NO refund at all for not paying federal taxes on less than a third of my income? Also owing back into Federal. Do I have any options to fight this or do I just roll over and pay the amount owed to Federal? I have filed Exempt from taxes before which was for state taxes.

personalfinance,Am I thinking about my finances correctly?,"I am 20 years old, turning 21 years old in five months. I currently live in Chicago, IL and make about  $39,520 per year (19/hr) full time, with chances to get overtime at 35/hr while I do school part-time at my local community college. My commute to work is about 25 minutes in the morning and to get back another 25-35 minutes. 

I drive an older, yet reliable car that has 185,000 miles on it and gets me where I need to go. I make a habit of filling up gas at CostCo, using my mom's card to fill up at a discounted price and buying groceries for lunch so that I can avoid spending money at the cafeteria at my new job (started a month ago, I have worked menial jobs until my landing this nice office job).

I am fortunate enough to have my mom to help fund me with things like my classes at college, gas, and groceries and not charge rent while I save at least 90% of my checks each week. (I love my mom very much for doing this and she encourages me to save and tells me I can live with her rent free for as long as I want to save up money.. i'm incredibly grateful)

I am planning to save MINIMUM $500-550 weekly in my separate chase savings and have $75-100 to spend every week in my checking which I will also use for food, gas, extra savings, and maybe even some fun if I feel I deserve it.

Let me tell you why I feel I don't deserve fun with money. Up until this money, I have been TERRIBLE with money. 

When I was in high school, I didn't know the value of my time or how to save money, and was making very bad wages. I frivolously spent the money I earned and didn't understand that I needed to start thinking about my future, saving, investing, creating a business, getting a better paying job, buying a home, car, etc.

Currently don't have a 401k, I filed as single and claimed 1 so that hopefully I won't owe any money to the government (I don't know how this works, never did my own taxes or filed a return my parents helped do this and I think my mom claims me as a dependent?) not sure.. if someone thinks I should change to zero please let me know.. as of now for 32 hours of work I get paid $608 and get taxes withheld at $125 (Federal Tax) so I end up making $483 for 32 hours after taxes.. I hope I don't owe money at the end of the year, I believe my mom and dad claim me as a dependent. 

Here are my stats, I know my saving account is not very big but I want to save 10k by my 21st birthday and then maybe think about starting a SEPARATE savings for a car when I grow the saving a little bit more than 10k.. 

Currently.. 

Savings: $1700 + $1000 (I gave mom $1000 to hold onto last year cause why not lol)

Checking/Cash: $35.34😂

Credit Card: I have a credit card that my mom pays the bill for so that I can build credit, she does not mind doing this so I can build some history and she uses the card too so that I can build some positive credibility. (love u mom)

Student Debt/Car Payment/Debt: $0.00 (I'll drive my car till it dies and buy another beater until I have $100,000 in savings i think)

Monthly Payments on anything: $0.00 (No plan on doing this for anything hahaha)

401k: N/A Have not started thinking about that.. should i start contributing? how do i start

Investments: N/A Have not starting thinking about this.. I am interested in stocks but i know i need a lot to start if i want to make big money, is it worth starting now? 

Re-cap: Will be saving $500-$550 every week and will have $75-$100 weekly for spending money every week starting today.. 

Should I continue saving this much for a long time and then use the money in my checking to invest or put into a 401k? How should I play the game of money so I win, reddit? I am trying my best to live frugally because I want to be rich through investments one day and make money while I sleep so that I can enjoy the real luxuries in life like spending time with family, living comfortably, having financial peace of mind when I sleep at night, and giving back to the people who helped me succeed.

personalfinance,Refinancing VA Home Loan IRRRL question(s),"I'm 5 years into a VA home loan (USAA) and owe $97,000 on the original $110,000 loan at 3.75%. Sites like Zillow's zestimate are at $159,000, and USAA's estimate is $145,000. So, I guess I have 30-39% equity.

A new USAA 30-year VA loan is listed at 3.446% APR. However, reading about Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loans, it says:

&gt;You may NOT receive any cash from the loan proceeds.

This is my first home, so I'm a novice, and the whole point of refinancing would be to get cash to pay off other debt. I also don't see an advantage in terms of the mortgage APR if refinancing as a conventional loan.

1. So, to confirm, the IRRRL would not serve my purposes because it doesn't allow you to get cash?
2. If so, would I be better off just getting a conventional (USAA) loan at 3.786% APR? That would be a bit more than I'm currently paying, but if it allows me to pay off other higher interest rate debt, in the long run . . .

personalfinance,How likely is it that FedLoan will remove late payments from my credit report?,"Long story short, I was over 90 days late on student loan payments last year for many reasons I don't have enough time to get into, and rather than call FedLoan Servicing I decided to just stick my head in the ground and pretend it wasn't happening. My credit score took a massive hit and dropped 140 points overnight (from 680to 540).

I finally was able to bring my account current in November of last year and have been making on time payments since, even setting up the automatic withdrawal feature to force myself to stop ignoring payments. I've been able to raise my credit score up to 611 since the drop.

I've also recently started a new position with a significant pay increase and according to the budget I've set myself, I'll have enough money to pay way more than the minimum payment (minimum payment is $313, and I've budgeted out to be able to pay $1800 a month), and even be able to pay off my student loan debts completely by mid-next year.

If I told FedLoan the things I laid out above - go into detail about why I was late on my payments, bring up that I've brought my account current and set up automatic withdrawals, and that I'll be able to pay 6 times more than the minimum payment - would they be likely to remove the late payments from my credit report so I can try and fix my credit score?

I currently live with my parents on a rent-free basis as the military only pays *career* soldiers well, not conscripts.

However, I do not intend to put down anyone who is currently serving, career or conscript. I thank you for your service to your country.

Having read links on *Emergency Fund vs Debt Repayment,* my strategy so far is to fully fund my emergency fund before tackling my debts because of my limited time left in the service, hence a limited time to earn the income, however paltry. I predict a lull period of unemployment for me, as I await a job offer. This is where my emergency fund will come in handy.

My debts to my father and SO are interest-free and they are both very understanding with my tight money situation right now (my father was also drafted at my age). They have not set a repayment date in stone or writing but I aim to do so by my discharge date. Despite it being interest-free, I have planned to pay back ""interest"" as a nice meal with a stay-cation.

We are a working class family. My father has paid for everyone when eating out, groceries, household bills and even managed to give his disabled brother and aging mother a monthly stipend. I pale in comparison - I only pay my telco bill. I feel ashamed at times for looking like a leech. I have taken a baby step when he stopped giving me an allowance at 20, as I had built a small emergency fund by then from my contract job.

I have not contributed any money to the sinking funds yet, but I hope I get to enjoy all those before I turn 30. For now, I have decided to take a gap year after my discharge to earn more income for university.

I have since learned to budget using the zero-sum approach. And it works for me. I don't like micromanagement - a simple 50/30/20 will do for me.

1. Should I continue with my strategy of funding my emergency funds first? Or should I tackle the debt first?
2. What counts as my emergency fund? Just Bank A, or A, B, and/or the endowment plan?
3. Should I take a bank loan or personal loan to pay off my university fees?
4. What are some money mistakes I may be doing without me realizing it?

personalfinance,New grad couple - realistic budget with $80k student loan debt?,"I [24 F] will be graduating in May with a masters degree and have secured a job with a salary of $57,000 a year + $3k sign on bonus. I live in the Midwest and have no student loans or credit card debt. Job is in Cincinnati, OH. Looking to make some big decisions in the next few months and would love some advice on my budget and plan. 


My boyfriend of 3 years is also finishing up his masters degree and will graduate in May. He is in the job search process and plans to move to join me in Cincinnati. Unfortunately, he has about $80,000 of student loan debt, a mix of federal and private. $57k is in his name, and the rest is in his parents name. No credit card debt or other debts. He is in a pretty specific major and wants to go into a design/architecture/branding field. Being very honest, I don't expect him to make a bunch of money right away, and it might take him awhile to find a job. I do want to say, that I feel my boyfriend did things mostly right when it came to college - he went to an in-state school, started at a community college, and worked during the year to pay for his living expenses. It took him 7 years to finish his undergrad/masters though, so the loans are mainly for tuition. 


What I am now trying to figure out is what a realistic budget looks like that takes into account his loan repayment, but doesn't require us living on rice and beans. I love my boyfriend and am completely on board with supporting him and helping him, however, I don't want to completely give up my standard of living or forego saving for my retirement to pay off the loans ASAP. My current plan is to try and pay as much of our shared expenses and let him use his salary to pay for his loans. 


Estimated monthly income, after taxes (my salary): $3640

Expenses
Rent: $1,200 (one bedroom) -$1,600 (two bedroom) in a great area, walking distance to my work   
Water/trash/sewage: included in rent  
Electric: $70   
Groceries: $250    
Car/gas: $140 (we would share 1 vehicle; my parents charge me $100/month for my 2016 Corolla)  
Parking: $105  
Auto/renters insurance: $90  
Health insurance: $0 - staying on parents plan; after I turn 26, my premiums through work would be about $50/month   
Medical: $50/month slush fund  
Phone: $70  
Wifi: $45  
Entertainment/eating out: $150  
Misc expenses (Netflix, Apple music, gifts, household supplies, public transport): $180  

Savings:
401k: $280 (enough to get employer match)  
IRA: $500  
Additional savings: $450  


The above budget would pay for the majority of our expenses. However, it would not completely cover everything for my boyfriend - he would need to pay for his phone, clothes, any fun things he wants, etc, as well as his loan payments and retirement savings. If he was able to contribute ~$500/month towards household expenses, that would add some breathing room, but if not I still think the above budget is doable. 


I currently have $1,300 in an IRA and about $7,000 in savings ($3k emergency fund, the rest is savings for the move/furniture/car/random things). I plan to add my $3k sign on bonus to my emergency fund. 


So a few questions/concerns - 

1. How does the budget look? Missing anything? Are retirement savings good?   
2. My ideal apartment is at the higher end of our range - $1,500-$1,600. Is this doable? Having the extra space of a two bedroom would be amazing but not totally necessary. Not sure if its worth the extra $400 a month that could be saved for other purposes (see #3).  
3. I don't feel like we are saving enough for future expenses. In a few years, I would love to be getting married, getting a condo/house, etc., and I know how expensive these things are. If we are only able to save $5k-$10k/year for these goals (not including retirement savings), are we ever going to get there?

personalfinance,Considering a personal loan to pay off about $9k CC debt across multiple cards,"(I know a million of these posts are here, I've dug for a similar situation and haven't had much luck)
Hey PF, I just got married in October and our next financial plan is to tackle CC debt head on. 
I have 3 credit cards all with about 25% APR:
#1 - Cap1 $3,200 
#2 - Chase Freedom $2,135
#3 - Chase Sapphire $3,200

Husband has 2 credit cards for a total debt of $1k (not super worried about these)

We currently spend $800 monthly on payments for all 5 cards, but with interest it seems like I'm not making a dent. Avalanche method hasn't really done much since they all have such a high interest rate, paying minimums on a few and a ""big"" amount on one card doesn't seem to add up.

I've recently started considering a $6-8k personal loan to get my utilization rates down and focus heavy on one big payment rather than several small ones. (I would want to pay more than the minimum on the loan each month) 

Upstart has offered $9k for a 36 month period with 16% APR ($300-400 monthly payments) . I haven't dug into my options super intensely just yet, but I am considering going this route. Does the lower interest rate make this a decent choice? Or am I better off seeking other options?

personalfinance,How much can I adjust my paycheck withholdings as low as possible after receiving a bonus while coming out even on tax day?,"My gross income is $175,000 a year. I'm paid twice a month, $7,291 per paycheck. My federal withholding is ~$1,275 per paycheck.

personalfinance,US Savings Bonds Help,"Hello all, I don’t see much about Savings Bonds on this sub and was looking for input. 

I have about 950$ purchase value in savings bonds bought between 91 and 02 (I was born in 90). Current value is 2110$. Final maturity is between 2021 and 2032, but mostly after 2027 and early 2030s. 

Interest rates are between 1.5 and 4.8%. Without listing them all, what’s the general consensus to do with Savings Bonds? 

I don’t think I need access to the money; I have a savings/emergency funds account along with a regular checking account, but I want it to be gaining. If I took them out early I would probably invest them in an index fund. 

Is it as simple as doing the math of what they will end at vs what an average index fund might gain me? Any input would be appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Which is a better checking account?,"I’m looking into opening a new checking account.

my options are:

A. 1% cash back Discover or 1.5% Quontic

B. 1.75% earned when you spend $500 signature based purchases/month

C. Simple bank 1.75%. Don’t see any mention of requirements.

Ideally I want the highest return / interest rate but that usually means more requirements like debit card transactions to get 3/4%. I like the cashback offered by Discover Bank which is only 1% because its earned regardless of pin or signature based transaction and as I spend. Discover also has savings accounts which would be a huge advantage for mobile deposit/transfering money. At what point would it make more sense to earn cash back as the money leaves the account rather than sit in the account to earn 1.75% or even 3/4% with lots of debit card transactions?

Also open to other suggestions. I want to avoid all checking accounts/credit unions that do hard pulls. This is money that would definitely be spent for living expenses.",finance
personalfinance,Me and my wife opened a joint account and started budgeting. It's going very well and I thought this sub might find it interesting.,"[The joint budget.](https://imgur.com/xKFnxGo)

We both agreed that we wanted to keep our own accounts and maintain our own personal savings/checking. We do that through TD bank. The joint account was opened through Ally, particularly because of their high interest rates. Ill go into more detail shortly, but basically we deposit a sum of money each month to cover bills and other various things, and we each keep our own personal budgets for our own stuff. The image above only displays my (M/25) personal budget on the bottom half of the sheet.

Just FYI, these records are kept on a shared google sheet. We also make roughly the same amount of money.

The nitty gritty:

* The ""Item"" column displays the particular budgeted item. Those highlighted yellow are on auto-pay from the Ally checking account.
* We split the total cost, usually down the middle. I pay more for food and alcohol because I consume more.
* The ""Total"" column automatically adds the two values and displays the monthly cost of each item.
* Totals highlighted orange go into the Ally checking and totals highlighted blue go into Ally savings.
* The ""Total Monthly"" row (row 17) shows each of our total monthly contributions to the joint account.

So on the first of each month, we each make two deposits, $617 into Ally savings and the rest of that ""Total Monthly"" into checking. We use our Ally debit cards to pay for all of the consumables listed in the ""Item"" column and manually subtract each purchase to get a current amount left for the month, shown in the ""Current"" column. As you can see I haven't done too well with our food budget this month! I'll reconcile that with some deduction from another part of the budget or a subtraction of that number from next month's food budget.

In the ""Current"" column, I add the total contribution for each item at the beginning of each month so we have a clear picture of how much we have available. Example, on February 1st I will manually add $200 to our current $1170.36 emergency fund to keep track, and do the same to food, alcohol, food stuff, ect. Its only one number in the Ally account, but I can see how its split up on this sheet.

One of the coolest things about this is the ""Fun"" item. If me and my wife want to go out to eat or do something together we deduct from this line. I no longer feel guilty spending money on things like this because we have specifically allowed for it in our budget. It sounds strange, but its very freeing to budget your fun activities.

A few more notes on that first half of the sheet:

* Our gift budget goes towards things we buy for people ""as a couple"". Most of our christmas gifts are like this. If I get something for my wife it comes out of my personal account.
* We plan on having roughly 6 mo. of living expenses in our emergency fund in roughly 3.5 years.
* We plan on having $55,000 for a house down payment in 3 years. We already have a nice chunk. As you can see this is a pretty big priority for us.
* The ""Due"" column displays when autopay is generated.
* For power and water, every month I calculate a new average number and adjust our contributions. Haven't been able to do this in practice yet. We'll see how it goes.

&amp;#x200B;

The second half of the sheet operates from my personal TD checking account.

* Random purchases are basically things that are difficult to categorize. Like I needed compression shorts for running and a new bike tire pump because I lost my old one. If I decide to get a drink or a bite to eat by myself Ill take it out of this fund.
* The Coffee number comes from a monthly amazon purchase (2 33oz bags of 8 o clock coffee). My wife doesn't drink it so I left it out of our joint food budget.

So the personal saving items are pretty much all contingent on the fact that I'm going to be hiking the AT in 2021. My goal is to have 20k in personal savings and 2.5k allocated for trail expenses. These were the first maths that I did in this section. Anything left over goes to saving for other items, like new trail runners, work shoes, a trip to the dentist, then eventually a new knife sharpener, probably a better jacket for next winter, ect. I am also saving to build a PC, but if I go over budget on anything, this is what I take from to compensate. Its the lowest priority thing I'm saving for.

The ""Me Total Monthly"" number is the exact amount of money I make every month (salary). Every penny is allocated and accounted for somewhere on this page.

I have also used a SUM formula for all of the Total cells and they adjust themselves around the sheet when changes are made.

I didn't show this, but below the attached image I log each purchase so I can go back and see where I'm spending too much.

Overall I'm very happy with our system. It doesn't feel like a pain even though there's a lot of manual data entry. I hope this can inspire some of you to take on the daunting task of budgeting or opening a shared account with your SO.

Bitcoin,"A question about scaling, transaction costs and CoinJoin","So I'm about to finish the excellent ""The Bitcoin Standard"" by Saifedean Ammous, and in the chapter about Bitcoin's scalability, he says a couple of things I'd like to get some feedback on. 

Bear with me here: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. The current block size has a capacity of \~500,000 transactions per day which we now meet, therefore the transaction fees have risen significantly. 
2. Since all network nodes require to keep a copy of the entire ledger, it means that the cost of recording transactions will be far higher than for any centralized solution. 
3. CoinJoin can potentially raise the transaction volume for only a fraction of the space needed otherwise. This can raise the tx volume to compete with the likes of VISA, **and as the transaction costs rise higher**, this is more and more likely to be a popular option. 

So my question is, why would the tx costs rise higher if we can kill the cap of 500k tx per day through CoinJoin?

personalfinance,pitfalls of requesting the removal of PMI?,"Hi PF-

I purchased a house 3 years ago with 5% down/ loan-to-value (LTV) of 95%. Since then, I've paid off 6% of the mortgage, bringing the LTV to 89%. I recently refinanced my mortgage to get a better interest rate and, I hoped, see if I might be able to get rid of PMI.

The lender ended up waiving an appraisal and accepted the new home value *I* assigned: somewhere between the Redfin (lower) and Zillow (higher) estimates. That ended up lowering my LTV to about 81%. I've since paid another 1% and requested PMI to be dropped. My lender sent me a package that said, among other things, that Fannie Mae would do an automated appraisal to see if they could drop PMI. Here's my question: **is there any risk that Fannie Mae runs their model and decides that I'm only at, say, 85% LTV and wants me to wait longer than if I just paid off another 2% and had PMI automatically dropped at 78% LTV?**

investing,How to understand the yield curve of emerging market economies?,"I can understand it in a developed market economy. If the US Feds wants to decrease near-term interest rate, it can (through Treasury and Mint) print money and, with the money, engages in open market operations by quantitative easing. By doing these, the US near-term interest rate will indeed decrease, and the yield curve will steepen.

If an emerging market dictator orders his central bank to print money and give it to himself to spend, I'm not sure if this should follow a Neoclassical model like the West, or follow a New Keynesian model. If the newly printed fiat money is used to buy weapons and to pay his military (instead of used to buy bonds via OMO), the yield curve may actually flatten. That is, the near-term interest rate will increase. Am I right?

oil,The closure of oil ports in Libya,"The UN is concerned about the closure of oil fields in Libya, Secretary-General of the organization Antonio Guterres said at a press conference.

“We are very concerned that several ports from which oil was exported were closed. One very important oil field also stopped operations. Of course, we believe that effective reform of the national oil company should be part of a more comprehensive solution, transparency should be established, and we hope that it will be possible to restore the normal state,” according to the statement that Guterres made.

Earlier it was reported that Libyan tribes and local public organizations in eastern Libya called for the closure of oil terminals in protest against the actions of the government of national consensus in Tripoli.

The Libya Settlement Conference was held on Sunday in Berlin, with representatives from Russia, the United States, Turkey, Egypt, the EU, the UN, and other countries invited to attend.

The Berlin conference was held after the inter-Libyan talks in Moscow with the participation of representatives of the Russian Federation and Turkey. Haftar then left Moscow without signing a ceasefire agreement with the Tripoli government of Sarraj. The delegation from Tripoli signed a deal and then went to Istanbul.

After the overthrow and assassination of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, Libya virtually ceased to function as a single state. Dual power reigns in the country now. The parliament elected by the people sits in the east. In the west, in the capital Tripoli, the Government of National Accord, formed with the support of the UN and the European Union, rules. The authorities of the eastern part of the country operate independently of Tripoli and cooperate with the Libyan National Army of Marshal Haftar.

I've been paying the minimum on the federal and $500/month plus whatever else I can on the private (paid off $13k in 2018). My take-home is currently around $1000 a month after bills like rent, groceries, phone, gas, TSP contributions, etc. and two allotments of $350 each to my HYSA and Roth IRA. I currently have about $14k saved up for emergencies/new car fund in the HYSA (I drive a 2003 rusty beater w/ 129k miles).

My question to you all is should I stop the allotments to my HYSA and IRA and direct that extra cash towards the loans? This would allow me to put about $1200/month towards the private loans and pay those off in 1.5 years but I wouldn't be able to save or invest.",finance

personalfinance,Paying off car early - do finance charges decrease?,"Background info: bought a new car in August 2019, and got a loan at a 1.9% interest rate. Payment schedule was set to be $773 a month for 36 months.  
Contract says (roughly):  
\- Finance charge (the amount the credit will cost you): $820  
\- Amount financed: $27000  
\- Total of payments (the amount you will have paid after you have made all payments as scheduled): $27820

Later on in the finer print, it says: ""You may prepay all or part of the unpaid part of the Amount Financed at any time without penalty. If you do so, you must pay the earned and unpaid part of the Finance Charge and all other amounts due up to the date of your payment.""

So far, I've made monthly payments of $1250, hoping to reduce my eventual interest cost (and trying to be car-debt-free sooner, before we're starting to pay for daycare). However, I'm wondering if I will actually end up paying less than $820 in interest by paying off early. If I pay off early in installments of $1250, will I still end up paying $820 in total interest, just spread out over fewer installments? Or will my actual finance charge go down? I guess I'm just confused by the ""earned and unpaid part"" phrasing.

Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage Re-Finance and Survivorship Deed,"Hopefully, this is an acceptable place to ask for assistance in this matter, if not please excuse the mis-posting.   


Mom (76) is in the process of doing a no-money out re-finance of her home in order to take advantage of the built up equity and favorable interest rates to achieve a lower monthly payment and save significantly on interest over the term of the loan. This re-finance has not been completed; however the Loan Estimate document indicates that the loan will be sold on completion and that it is not assumable. (Which I understand is pretty much standard these days)

This has relevance as she and I are also working with her attorney in order to arrange her finances and estate, with me being both the executor and sole beneficiary. She would like, if at all possible, that the new mortgage be transferred to me without the need for me to take on new loan terms. 

Her attorney recommended that she place me on the mortgage. In discussing this with our mortgage broker, his recommendation was to make use of a Survivorship Deed, as it is his belief that it would save on structuring costs, as well as potentially save us on accrued interest. (I have decent credit, mom has near perfect credit) 

My question is if a Survivorship Deed will, in concept, accomplish what we are looking to achieve: ensuring that the loan and it current, favorable terms, will pass to me in the event of her passing.   


\*\*\* As a side note for anyone reading - It is difficult a very difficult topic for all parties involved, but try to work with your loved ones on estate planning earlier, rather than later in the process. For parents, please try to remember that while advanced life planning is a scary thing getting those details ironed out will alleviate a lot of stress and pain for your children.

For children of aging parents please try to remember that it is incredibly scary for your parents. Patience and support is imperative as it may likely take many conversations and small steps for your parents to come to terms with and work on advanced life planning. Trying to tackle everything in one big go, can result in significant emotional stress for everyone involved.",finance

personalfinance,Settle debt for less: Yes or no?,"**Background**

I've been at my current company for about 5 years and recently moved into a more lucrative position. Prior to this, I was making just enough to make ends meet. As such, I'm now in a position to start really paying down my debt. My wife and I think we may be able to wipe out all debt before the end of the year, then generate enough savings to purchase our first house with an FHA loan in late summer of 2021.

**Situation**

I have a credit card with Wells Fargo which I fell behind on and stopped making payments to about 2 years ago. It has recently moved to collections. The amount owed is ~$3,100, which I have on hand, but I'm for some reason unable to pay the full balance through the web interface. I'm instead being offered a settlement for ~$1,200, which will reflect on my credit report as being settled for less than the full balance.

This puts me in a weird place. I have other debt, and I intend to Dave Ramsey ""debt snowball"" it away, so being able to roll the ~$1,800 difference into my next credit card would almost eliminate the second debt entirely. On the other hand, I'm unsure if settling at $1,200 will prevent me from purchasing a home within 2 years.

Secondly, I have other accounts with Wells Fargo (checkingx2, savings, line of credit). Will settling the debt potentially cause Wells Fargo to close these accounts?

Here's a layout of my finances for the curious:

Income: $75k  
Rent: $1,670 (2br townhouse, Minneapolis suburbs, me+wife+kid+dog)  
Debt:

|Interest Rate|Amount|Description|
|---|---|---|
|???|$3,100|Wells Fargo credit card in collections|
|25%|$2,200|Capital One credit card|
|19%|$4,800|Wells Fargo line of credit|
|13%|$13,200|Auto loan (needs refinancing)|
|8%|$900|Credit union auto loan|
|7%|$500|Student loan 1|
|7%|$500|Student loan 2|
|5%|$800|Student loan 3|

**TL;DR** Should I hang on to $1,800 and potentially jeopardize my ability to buy a home in 2 years?",finance
personalfinance,0% intro rate credit cards question,"So we just moved into a new house that needs a lot of work (about $55k more than we currently have saved), and I'm considering different finance options.

personalfinance,Turbotax vs HR Block online e-file tax refund question,"Hi guys, I was playing around the turbotax and hr block's online refund calculator. In the HR block's calculator, I entered educational expense (for grad school in 2019) for the life time learning credit, however, in the final summary page, it shows my education expense is 0.

Then I tried the turbotax,. Compared to HR block, the turbotax calculator can correctly show my entered educational expense, which boosted my refund amount. I also saw that turbotax has a field dedicated for 401k contribution (traditional 401k). I entered my 401k contribution last year and it boosted my refund even more -  eventually turbotax ended up showing a +$2000 difference vs HR block's estimation.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are:

1. does HR block allow customers to enter contribution to a traditional employer provided 401k account?
2. why is HR block showing 0 educational expense for me? A bug?
3. why traditional 401k contribution can boost my refund? I thought the amount is non-taxable before I take it out of my account. Are the federal and state withholdings based on pre-401k deducted salary ?

personalfinance,"New grad, whether to go abroad or try to stick it out in the US?","For a bit of background, one of the biggest driving factors in my decision is that I am unable to drive due to a vision disability, and I seem to be unable to find work that pays well in a place I can actually function without a car. Currently the only thing keeping me sane is that I live in a heavily urbanized part of Northern Virginia, but I know that come May when I graduate the rent will kick my ass once I need to find a place to live. Most places in my field hire on new grads around 45-47k/pa pre-tax, and that's if you're lucky.. Knowing how much rent and health insurance can cost in this country, I don't think it's a wise idea to stay long term. My degree is in political science, but I am currently helping design indie games and websites with nonprofits in my free time, as well as tutoring web development (and politics coursework) in my final semester.  

I have 20k in student loans, interest rate of 3.5%. I am planning on aggressively paying it off within 3 years. I completed an internship for a group of people that brought me on (I'd argue) in false pretenses. I did nothing especially related to my degree, as much as I did programming a fully fleshed out mobile application under mind numbing budget constraints (ie $0, when I needed API keys to do what they wanted). If I could get a job in programing, I would. I'm currently taking a few more classes while I still can, but the way the CS department works I won't be eligible for a CS minor. 

I dont yet have EU citizenship but am eligible and going through the process with the relevant nation. Right now my parents are sort of hanging over my head because they don't, I think, want me to go to Asia. Financially the implications a little citizenship would not just allow me to work in other EU nations but also I wouldn't be taxed my worldwide income with that nation, and itand it is still fairly cheap.


Until then, the only realistic option I can think of right now, is to basically go to China or elsewhere to teach English for $30k(ish) per year for two years maybe three max. After that I would either go to the Peace Corps or some other endeavor. In many of those cases what I hear is that you get housing paid for either directly by the teaching institution you work with or by a stipend.

 Theoretically in my head I think that earning $30k is a better option then have until live in an area where I can't work without severe quality of life implications and pay a majority of my salary into Uber because there's literally no other liable means of transport on the day-to-day. A lot of the cities where I seem to look for finding work in the United States you need a car, that's just a given. Where I currently am you would be forgiven for thinking that on the surface a car not necessary but in actuality unless you live in District of Columbia proper you do really need a car. Many people get by without them, but the fact is most people earn way more than I am expecting. 

In a lot of these cases I've heard from talking with friends they make out very well, definitely not a six figure salary, but they can same spend down their student loans, live very comfortably. My hope would be to also learned the local language whether Korean or Mandarin Chinese or Vietnamese whatever. 


TL;DR: about to graduate college with 20 grand in student loan debt at a very low interest rate but not really sure about my financial future of the United States due to vision disability. I can function in normal society fine on my own, I don't need a cane, the biggest issue seems to be my perception of salary expectations and cost-of-living versus the benefits. Or I failed to come out college with the job paid me 60 Grandier 70 grand a year I would be perfectly fine, or at least more comfortable with the idea of staying in the US. I figure that i I'm young and I can still travel I should take advantage of that and do so productively. Am I overthinking this? I don't think I have ""grass is always greener syndrome"", I've been to Europe, Japan, so I know that wherever I go there I am and that every place has its own kind of suck, even so I don't think it would kill my career to take two years off, go learn an in demand language and make money while doing it.

personalfinance,I’m thinking of moving to California,"I think realistically, I won’t move until June of 2021, so would like to begin saving. I’m realizing that my biggest personal support systems are in California in both San Francisco and LA. I know these cities are stupidly expensive to move to and even though I’m a Chicago native, I always feel a melancholy going back home after visiting either city. 

I currently live in a two bedroom apartment alone in Chicago and know that I would have to downsize apartments if I move to California if I expect to pay a similar rent of $1,500. I also understand that I may not be able to live in SF proper, but could swing a one bedroom in West Hollywood or Koreatown in LA. 

I work in a global HR consulting company and could ask for a transfer, but know they will not pay for relocation costs if I initiate the ask. I would much prefer to keep my current job as my retirement benefits include a 401k and my pension is fully vested and has been for five years. I started at that company as a contractor making 20K and now am a Talent Management/Compensation Analyst making 65K with a 5% STI. The company has been incredibly good to me and I’m building my consulting project management skills so am not really looking to move jobs. 

How much should I realistically be saving to do a cross country move? As of now, my max rent tolerance would be 1500. I do not own a car and do not want to either. I own a bike and am comfortable with the idea of biking for my main mode of transport. 

I also know that I need to curb my current spending today so would love to hear thoughts about where and how to budget monthly with some leftover for saving to move next year. 

Current monthly net income is about $3,400. Gross income of it matters is 5,416. Spending habits is coming from my NerdWallet December report

Rent is $1,500

Monthly commuting pass is $100

Student Loans are $313

Utilities (heating/electricity) are $176

Cable/internet is $186

Dining out/bars is $443

Groceries are $167

Shopping is $35

Entertainment is $110

Travel (lyft/Uber) is $63

Gym is $30

Total for the past 30 days is $3,123

I also automatically put $100 into a savings account with my primary bank and tend to not touch it... using it only when I know I want to fly out or make a large purchase. 

The disparity in my gross/net income comes from a mix of my 401K matching (matching the highest contribution my employer does), and I took out a loan from my 401K back in 2017 to pay off some debt that was preventing me from finishing school/my degree as well as all applicable taxes/HSA/Health/Dental benefits. The loan will be resolved in 2022. 

This is my first year with a bonus incentive and I planned on just throwing the 5% (if fully funded) into my student loans, but would it make sense to just keep it in my savings? Speaking of student loans... I have a total of $64.7K of student debt (from when I tried college the first time, but had to drop out in 2008 when my parents lost their jobs and we didn’t understand anything about financial aid). All of the loans are federal, none are private. 

I focused on fixing my credit score from 2016-2018 and have a credit score in the high 700s for transunion and low 700s for equifax. I keep my credit card utilization around 20% and the only negative impact on my score is the age of my credit since I just refinanced/consolidated my student loans and built my credit (getting my first card in 2016). 

I’m also thinking of cutting cable all together.

It's much more immersive, it's easier to make beautiful or sexy characters and the world comes alive. I likes when a game feels like a more ideal or interesting version of reality.

Sticking out like a sore thumb in this budget is $680 a month to student and car loan payments. Both have negligible interest rates and will be paid off within four years of regular payments, so roughly $20k balance total right now. We have an investment account from her childhood that has performed well and has $40k in it. It seems like a no brainier to us to use the investment account to pay off the loans early and super charge our savings goals. Are there reasons we shouldn't do this?  We could redirect to an emergency fund and her (new) retirement savings plan. We know we would need to withdrawal more than $20k to cover taxes, but are there other factors to consider?",finance
personalfinance,Hot take on Private Mortgage Insurance,"Ok so no one here likes insurance, but I am well aware of the fact that it is a necessary risk hedging service for some aspects of life. But Let me see if anyone else gets what I am saying. Because mortgage insurance specifically, sounds like a legit scam to me and I would like someone to make sense of it. 

So I want to buy a 500k house. Lets say I want to put 5% down and I get approved for a 4% 30 fixed rate. Well, because I am under 20% Loan to value Ratios, I have to buy mortgage insurance. 

Here is my issue. If I pay for mortgage insurance, then the loan that the bank gave me is essentially risk free because in the event of my default, I will have an insurance company step in and pay the bill for me. 

So If I am a risk free lender when I have insurance, why am I still paying the  4% interest on my loan? Essentially I am paying the insurance company to bear the risk of my default for the bank, then on top of it I also have to pay the bank an interest rate bear the same default risk that they hold no exposure too? Either charge me a higher interest rate, I can understand that, or offer me a lower rate while I hold insurance. This just feels like I am double paying.

Edit: I honestly wanted to see if this sub could provide some valuable input into my situation. But it seems most people (although not all) commenting don’t really understand the concept of risk transfer. And no, interest does not = profit. Although I’d have more money if it did",finance

I've done a decent amount of research and it seems almost irrefutable that the market is overvalued and bubbles are forming. Naturally overall sentiment about the market is lukewarm, but earnings, performance, and production continue to rise at the corporate level. Moreover, the Fed seems committed to keeping interest rates low. I can't make much sense of it, and would just like some opinions. Should I invest now or continue to watch and wait?

personalfinance,Refinancing early before the original loan has been processed,"I recently purchased a new vehicle and I got a 4.9% interest rate on it. The loan's first payment is due on February 28th, which is a long ways away. Meanwhile, it is accumulating interest. 

I just got approved to refinance it to 3.1% and to complete the refinancing, I need to provide information regarding the original loan. However, since the original loan hasn't sent me information like how to access it online and make payments, I am unable to finish refinancing it.

Is there a way that I can access this information earlier? Not sure what to do. Right now, I'm just waiting until February when there's more time passed so that I get online access to my original loan account. But I guess every day is additional interest that I'm unnecessarily paying.",finance
personalfinance,"Unsure about my future, 22 Y/O College Grad","So I just graduated with a Marketing degree at my University, with a minor in Business Analytics (which was way too fucking difficult to be a minor), currently still working a retail job making around $11.50 an hour. I've been applying to actual salary positions with no luck yet but it's only been about 3 and a half  weeks since graduation. Realistically when I find a job in the area, I'll start off making between $30,000 - $40,000.

I have around $22,000 in federal loans and $8,800 in private loans through Discover. 

I was living with my college roommates but I had a close friend pick up the remaining of my lease, so I can return home. I won't be paying for rent, utilities, food, etc. I will only be paying for any gas or whatever I choose to pay for, which will mostly be my loans. 

It's been hitting me kind of hard, I'll have to be spending my early 20's stuck at home and just working or going to the gym, while a lot of my friends will still be in my college town with our group. I feel like I'm leaving behind friendships and any chance of having other relationships. In a way I'm giving up my independence so it's just tough to swallow. I know how good of a position I still am in though and do not take that for granted one bit!

personalfinance,Paying Off Credit Card,"Hi guys! I have 2 credit cards, one from Amazon rewards and another from Smith's rewards. I'm currently thinking of canceling my Smith's rewards card because the Amazon one has better rewards and benefits for my personal use. I only applied and got accepted for the Smith's card just because I would buy groceries there every now and again from Smith's and it was during the time when they stopped accepting Visa credit cards (Amazon uses Visa while Smith's uses Mastercard) that I applied for the Smith's card. 

However, I have substantial debt built up on my Amazon credit card from buying a new smartphone to replace my old one and an iPad for college (currently a junior) of almost $2200 from that and a bunch of other stupid purchasing decisions (buying takeout and delivery WAY too often). At this point in time I am able to pay off my Smith's credit card completely but I read online that it is a better decision to pay off the card that has the highest interest rate (I don't remember which rate is higher but I requested cardmember agreements for both). 

Let's say  the Amazon credit card has the higher interest rate, should I pay that off completely first before tackling the Smith's credit card or pay the Smith's one off, regardless of which one has the higher interest rate, then cancel it which will completely divert my attention towards the Amazon card? The ideal situation would be that the Smith's card has the higher interest rate and I just pay it off right now and cancel it.

I'll consider all of your suggestions and thanks for the help :)",finance

This is a very embarrassing post to make but I (23M) don't know where to turn. I recently had to relocate unexpectedly and it caused me to take a very high interest rate loan. I would like to get a loan at a more reasonable rate, but I've been turned down everywhere I go. My credit score is only about 600 and I'm trying to turn my finances around but unfortunately I've racked up some bills and have some credit card debt (~$11k). The sad part is that I make decent money, but I feel like I can't get anywhere with such high interest rates.

personalfinance,Pay off debt? Invest? Sit on it?,"Right now, I have about $50,000 in debt.

- $5,000 left on an auto loan @ 3.84%, $272/month, 1.5 years left
- $2,500 CC debt @ 0.0% until August. Purchased a bike and smart trainer this year for about $10k total and have been paying it off in chunks.  My gift to myself after putting off the new bike purchase for three years.

Gross income was $90,000 this year with a lot of bonuses and overtime.  This next year looks leaner, so I'll probably be closer to my base of $74,000.  Prior to last year, I was only making about $55,000.  Right now, I'm contributing 7% to my 401k, and I have about $45,000 put away there mostly in Vanguard funds. Credit score is north of 800.

Rent is $875 ($1750 split with girlfriend) and I budget $1400 for living expenses, but frequently exceed that.  Typical is closer to $1700.  

In terms of assets, I have about $9,000 in stocks that have returned about 125% in the last three years (AMD, AUPH, MSFT), and about $5000 in cash.  What should I be doing with these liquid assets?  

Part of me wants to pay off debts.  Considering my car, the cumulative interest left on the loan is less than $200, but would free up an extra $270 a month.  I'd also like to take chunks out of my student loans because they just kind of loom over me. I've considered refinancing, but kept them federal so I can put them in forbearance if that's ever needed.  Though, refinancing is still an option.  The other part of me says put more in the market, as long term gains are going to far outweigh whatever interest is left on my debts.  Obviously, that's not guaranteed, and things are probably aggressively allocated, but I'm comfortable with that level of risk. There's also the question of the emergency fund.  Right now, I could probably go about 5 months without considering forbearance, girlfriend taking over rent (which she offered to do while I'm paying on student loans, I declined), etc.

Looking at my options, I feel a lot of analysis paralysis, and having cash sitting around makes me antsy.  I feel it should be in the market or paying off debt.",finance

personalfinance,ForwardU Guard - have I bought a crappy life insurance?,"REPOSTING HERE FROM r/eupersonalfinance..  
 Hi! at the beginning of january I went to see a OVB Hoser Mairinger  private banker. I'm 27, married, no children, my wife has a solid full  time job (she makes around 18k net yearly), I work on the family  business (we are wealthy family and I'm making around 30k net yearly). I  wanted something long term, but I'm afraid of buying ETFs right now  because I wanted to wait for a bearish period. So I asked the private  banker some long term alternative to ETFs that I could pay month by  month and he offered me [this life insurance](https://cdn.forwardyou.com/files/static/products/it/20190404_FWU_IT_FIE1_SetInformativo_4c_06-x3_ES.pdf).  
To sum it up, this is what he told me:  
80€  monthly, 30 years period, If I take money off before the 15th year it's  crap but if I hold to it around the 25th year I'm gonna see around 7,  8% interests yearly (he showed them to me through the iPad on the  ForwardU website). The constraints would have been fine for me because I  don't need that money at all and that would have been the first of some  investments that I wanted to make.  
But then I looked at the KIID  that he gave me, and the interest rates that are written in it are way  lower. I can't seem to find the data that he showed me on the internet. I have until the 30th of january to chicken out (i already paid  the first 3 months) and have the cash back. My guts tell me that this  life insurance is crap and that I should just save money, wait for the bear or start dollar cost averaging and buy passive managed ETFs as you guys always say here, but maybe I'm just paranoic. Can you please have a look to the KIID and give me  an opinion? I'm Italian and there's literally nobody else I can ask -  nobody in my family or friends do even know what an ETF is, and the  private bankers are usually incompetent lazy douchebags here.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

business,"How a poor, high school dropout from India built a business empire of $25Bn in 2002, which grew upto $140 Bn in 2020 to become the most profitable company of India.","1) The Struggle in Aden, Yemen :-

Born at Chorwad in Gujrat to a middle class family, nurtured by his school teacher dad and housemaker mother, dhirajlal ( aka dhirubhai) saw all ups and downs in his childhood. He had to drop out of school after 10th to support his family income.

""If you’re born poor it’s not your fault but if you die poor it’s your fault.""

-Dhirubhai Ambani

with the above mindset dhirajlal did a lot of jobs and finally went to Aden, Yemen to work at A.Besse &amp; Co. where his brother used to work. He joined as a clerk and being a Gujrathi medium student he didn’t know english. He faced a lot of difficulties in handling work out there because of language barrier. But do you think this can be a reason to quit?

This clerk out there was not the one who would complain about hurdles.

""Pursue your goals even in the face of difficulties, and convert adversities into opportunities.""

-Dhirubhai Ambani

He actually punched the difficulties and learnt english by reading books, dictionaries and with his dedication got promoted.

But after Yemen’s freedom , Dhirubhai returned to India with his wife and 9 month old Son Mukesh.

2) The Birth of Reliance :-

After returning India, with a dream of establishing business in India, dhirubhai started Reliance Corporation, which basically dealt with spices.

But Dhirubhai Ambani wasn’t the one who would settle for small things!

""Our dreams have to be bigger. Our ambitions higher. Our commitment deeper. And our efforts greater.""

-Dhirubhai Ambani

With a big dream and high ambition, as dhirubhai believed, he made up his mind to start Yarn import business without even knowing the if’s and but’s of it. Was it a good decision?

Why not if you have self confidence!

Dhirubhai learnt about this business from trade magazines, business journals and other sources and set his feet towards the biggest venture of his life.

But wait…he didn’t had money also!

But again this couldn’t be the reason for Mr. Ambani to stop. He convinced some money lenders and promised them to return the money with higher interest rates.

""Meeting the deadlines is not good enough, beating the deadlines is my expectation.""

-Dhirubhai Ambani

The man of words Dhirubhai, actually beat the deadlines and returned the money with quite higher rate of interest.

3) The journey from Reliance corporation to Reliance Industries :-

After a while of running the business smoothly, the import business almost got closed in 1966 because of fluctuation in currencies.

But he was the not the one to give up!

""Challenge negative forces with hope, self-confidence and conviction. I believe that ambition and initiative will ultimately triumph.""

-Dhirubhai Ambani

He actually challenged his failure in yarn business and now he dreamt even bigger!! He decided to open a Synthetic fabric mill in India.

""Only when you dream it you can do it.""

-Dhirubhai Ambani

He again didn’t have much knowledge about this business but like his past experience he again had faith on his abilities and he studied and lot on this and finally opened the mill in Naroda, Gujrat.

He gave a new dimension to the textile business by marketing the textile and this turned the whole market of textiles and this confidence and determination of dhirubhai led him to the title of “The Polyester Prince”.

To curb down the domination of the other mills in India, dhirubhai made use of marketing a lot and launched a brand Vimal.
And this efforts of Dhirubhai led Vimal to become the premium clothing brand of India.

And now to curb down the politics of other competitors and government policies he decided to expand Reliance.
He reported to banks for the same and returned with refusal as he needed 2 crores rupeed at that time.
But he never gave up and launched the IPO of Reliance and against all odds this time he got the support of public and they oversubscribed Reliance.

""Between my past, the present and the future, there is one common factor: Relationship and Trust. This is the foundation of our growth.""

-Dhirubhai Ambani

By always standing firmly on his priciples he grew an amazing trust with the public and rest is history!

Today, Reliance is one of the most profitable companies in India, the largest publicly traded company in India by market capitalization, and the largest company in India as measured by revenue after recently surpassing the government-controlled Indian Oil Corporation.
And this business legend left the world in 2002, leaving a huge empire of business which has expanded its wings in all the possible sectors of business led by his two sons, Mukesh and Anil Ambani.
On 18 October 2007, Reliance Industries became the first Indian company to exceed $100 billion market capitalization.

Bitcoin,"My Trezor (MEW?) account got compremised, funds were stolen","Hello ladies and gentleman,

I hope you can help me out somehow. I put it in bitcoin as well despite its ethereum but its about trezor and the btc part is involved.  In mid september all my ethereum and ethereum based stuff was cleared from my MEW accounts for roughly 38k USD. Trezor couldnt help me at all and we went through all the topics and questions they had which lead to nothing exept an basic answer “your seeds got compromised in the past“, which doesn’t make any sense and I will explain why.

Lets say, Im a person with some basic tech knowledge and worked as admin and I use common sense to handle my crypto stuff which is part of my business and daily task since 2 years.I check all things again before sending. Adress, amount etc and never had any problems before.I never was on a fake page where I had to give my seed or passphrases inI dont open spam mails nor use my new laptop for something else then work, like visiting porn sites or shady stuff or use cracks etc. I didnt even found a malitous cookie after checking everything. The laptop I used was 3 months old and set up on my own with windows, firwall, antivir and anti malware stuff. Things I am doing form me and my friends since year 2000. No cracks used for programms, everything legal. I use a trezor one since then which is updated accordingly when the tool or page prompts me. I used to use chrome as my default browser (which i learned, over the past months trying to figure out what might have happened, is one oft the worst browsers).

No one has my seedsno one knows my pin to entert the trezorI dont store any of this information onlineI dont know my private keys from trezor

So what happened was that september 9 in the evening, a few hours after I sent some usdt deposit to my adress, I want to check if everything is there, login to my MEW account (online, not offline and url was correct. no addon used, just the shortcut in my browser which i safed there and always used and later checked i fit was linked to something else which wasnt), and the account was empty. Three ethereum adresses where i stored some coins, eth and usdt.

I realised that every transaction below happened while i was standing infront of my laptop (checked time happening), trezor connected cause i did some btc transaction before and chatted to customers on different chat tools like telegram or skype. Obvsly without signing any transaction at all everything was sent to other adresses. It seemed someone got the keys to those adresses before. Now, I dont even know my private keys to those adresses which are stored in trezor right? I wasnt logged into MEW before this incident for about 1.5 days. The btc part on my trezor is MUCH more valuable, but still there. After trezor couldnt help me about what happened and MEW treated me like the standard idiot who gets highjacked and then wonders why his money is gone, I went trough so many possibilities. For the most time I thought some kind of KRACK attack happened.

The only problem is trezor says they dont extract the private keys. Some gurus in this topic ( i read on reddit here) say its possible to get them from the network. Even parts are enough to encrypt the whole key after a while which would underline the timeline that it took 6 days from working in this hotel and having the unusual situation with the sending (down explained) till the accs got cleared.

The hotel incident happened the week before my accounts got cleared. I was visitting friends and coworking agents in Vietnam and stayed in a red doorz hotel in Ho Chi Minh. Using the Hotel Wifi and a nvpn.net VPN I sent some usdt funds via MEW to a befriended customer and something very stranged happened, which I never had before.I sent 4k usdt to a customer and the transaction took 13 min working working working and then failed. I’ve never had something like that. We thought it might be because of eth network or so but we never had that before, me and him sending a lot transactions every day.

Then i copied all details in again and send another 4k and somehow he recieved both!

check the screen. The one transaction processed nearly 13 min then failed. 2min later i sent a new one and without any evidence in this screen he recieved both.

later

[https://s19.directupload.net/images/200121/3todak3u.png](https://s19.directupload.net/images/200121/3todak3u.png)

So he sent me back the additional 4k and I shut down everything not thinking about this much anymore. Only when the accounts got cleared I was searching for any unusual happenings which could have let to this because pretty much all other “typical“ mistakes people normally do we could exclude. If somehow my seeds got compromised why only the ETH stuff? The btc parts on the trezor had much much more value. I never searched for trezor page on the web and used a link to access my wallets or to do updates. I always used the trezor bridge and made a shortcut to my wallet in my browser. For MEW i always used the same shortcut in my browser which worked pretty fine for the past years an everytime when setting the browser or pc new i checked it all before.

Because of the unusual thing which happened in Vietnam I flew back there (from philippines) prepared with tools and checking because I couldnt let go and I didnt find any other plausible cause. I even got back my old room. In this hotel there are three hotel wifi network and I remeber 100% that I used the 2nd one before cause it had the strongest signal. Anyway. I switched on wireshark and later on Fiddler, repeated all steps I used to do before. Checking if some rerouting, dns poisening or readressing or so is happening. Nothing unusual happened in the first when entering MEW (I sent some bait funds there).

In the 2nd network I used in september the trezor basically totally freaked out. He didnt let me enter MEW, I had to reenter my pin up to 5 times sometimes, It gave me error messages in MEW or it took 30 fucking seconds to enter it. Trezor writes about this:

“When you enter an invalid PIN a few times, the Trezor adds a forced waiting time between attempts.You can see this feature on the photo where the Trezor is making you wait for 15 seconds before another attempt.This countdown is then multiplied by the factor of two until you reach the 16th invalid PIN entry. After that, the device automatically wipes its memory - deleting all data from it.

The behavior of your Trezor at MEW is undoubtedly not standard or in any form pleasantly functional. Nevertheless, it also isn't anything superbly unusual or unexpected, taking poor internet connection into account.“

The thing is, the pin is 6 digits but pretty basic and I never ever entered it wrong. And I used the strongest wifi and could open webpages very easily .

As well as: “Sadly, this does not tell us anything about how your funds could be compromised. None of this could have ever exposed your private keys or made your device vulnerable in any way.

The Reddit thread you linked discusses cracking BIP-39 passphrases, which is irrelevant to your case. Cracking such passphrases assumes the person trying to break the wallet already has full possession of the recovery seed (recovery words). See, a passphrase is not your recovery seed or some additional password on your device. It is an extension of the seed, and it is also 100% useless without controlling the full seed.

The only threat you are exposed to when using Chrome is using Google itself. When googling ""trezor"" or ""trezor wallet"", you might stumble upon a phishing site which will present itself as a genuine Trezor website and force you to go through a fake ""recovery"" process. There you'd give out your recovery seed, which subsequently grants full access to your wallet and funds.

It's reasonable to assume that malware could guide you to such a website. To this day, we are not aware of any such incident ever happening, and even then, there are protections in place to defend you against phishing attempts.“

Basically, something I never did and all funds would haven been gone then.

I checked the 3rd network as well, and like the 1st nothing special happened. Only in the 2nd.

These are the funds and how the got cleared off the wallets.

I always show last transaction from me to the adress as well on the screens. So adress:

So, do you have any ideas? Questions? Feel free to guess or ask Im glad for everything which might lead to what might have happened. I somehow can’t let go off the feeling something inbetween the network, MEW and trezor ist he cause, but what do I know.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Credit Card Debt,"Hey guys,

   I have about $6000 in credit card debt. Right now I’m in a position to pay off about half of it however it would deplete my emergency fund. The interest rates are really high and making the minimum payments would take me a long time to pay it off. I have a large property tax bill that’s due at the end of this month. I can pay the tax bill with my normal monthly income and all of my bills for this month are already paid. Taking off half of this balance wouldn’t necessarily decrease my minimum payments however when I am eventually able to pay it off that would lower my monthly expenditures substantially by removing these credit card payments. I had every intention of using these cards like a debit card to gain the rewards however that didn’t happen as I was irresponsible. I cut up all of the cards except for 1 that I keep on hand in case an absolute emergency happens. What day you r/personalfinance?",finance
personalfinance,New job with raise. ISO Advice.,"Hi, I recently took on a new job and went from making $54,500 to $98,000 a year. I am 32 years old. This was a large jump for me and was kind of unexpected. After being so irresponsible with credit cards and money all my life, I want to fix that and not make the same mistakes again. 

I setup a budget for the first time ever. After taxes and 401k contributions (6%, company matches 100% of 6% after first year). I have about $16,000 in my 401k now (using index funds, surprisingly good options). I have about $1700+ left over that I can save or use to pay debt. I also have a part time job making anywhere from $200 to $500 a month, sometimes more. I have about $400 a month go into a high interest savings account. 

Debts:
1. $4,300. Credit card with 0% interest till June 25th, 2020. 
2. $14,000. Student loans. Average of 5.5% interest. Monthly payment is $123. 
3. $25,000. Car. This is my biggest regret. Interest rate is 5.6%. About $8,500 upside down. Brand new car with 10k miles. Payment is $536. I was an idiot, but I have seen the light! 

So I'm going to pay off the credit card in the next 2-3 months. 

After that, should I work on paying down the car or the student loans? I plan on continuing to throw money at these debts till they are paid off. I'd like to continue using the $1,500 as a payment towards principal (plus regular monthly payment) on one of the debts till it's gone. Does that make sense to focus on one at a time? I'd like to be debt free before I purchase a home in the next 3-5 years. 

Also, should I put money in traditional 401k to reduce taxable income and fund a Roth IRA as well? Or both Roth? What might you do? I only anticipate my salary going up over the next few years. 

Long time lurker of the sub. Thank you for your help in advance. This sub truly is awesome for some of the advice I read here every day. I read most posts and comments every day.",finance
personalfinance,Increase Home Buying Power - HELOC to payoff vehicle balances,"Howdy! SO and I are trying to increase our home buying power and were entertaining ideas to decrease our debt to income ratio so we can qualify for bigger home\\property financing. We've got about $140k positive equity in our current home (value \~$300k, \~$160k remaining note).  My personal FICO is \~770 and SO is about the same.

Target new home\\property budget $450k to $500k (max)

Current Monthly mortgage $1,300

Vehicle#1 monthly $800, remaining note \~$10k

Vehicle#2 monthly $600, remaining note \~$14k

If we took a home equity line of credit for the payoff of the two vehicles, we would need about $25k which would be repaid after we sell our home (minus interest only payments due in the mean time) $140k - $25k ($115k remaining)

I'm figuring high on closing costs \~$20K, leaving \~$95k for a down payment on the new home\\property.

I used an online mortgage calculator to get this estimated total monthly payment including home insurance\\property tax = $1,950

$450k home value

$95k down payment

$355k loan amount \\ 3.8% interest rate \\ 30yr conventional

With all of that said, we would ultimately be taking our monthly vehicle payments and rolling that into a larger monthly mortgage payment. Has anyone done something similar or is there a better option to increase our buying power?  I'm worried that if we attempt to buy a home that is more than a lender would allow because of our current monthly debt to income ratio, on paper we wouldn't be able to afford the new home or be granted the financing.",finance

personalfinance,Sell home and move out of state or stay the course?,"This is partially a ""What would you do/what's your opinion?"" question and a ""Are we missing anything?"" question. TIA!

tl;dr - should we sell our house for a huge profit and move somewhere cheaper to build our savings?

My wife and I have lived in our current home for four years. We live in Utah and bought our home just as the housing market here exploded. In our current situation, we could easily sell our house and pocket \~$100k (based on comps in our area and updates we've done). We live close to our jobs, close to family, and live in a fairly decent neighborhood.

Besides our home loan, we have one new-ish car loan and one that's nearly paid off. We have a little bit of CC debt (under $2k), no student loans, and a small amount in savings and retirement accounts. We're in our late 20s and have one kid. We've never been in financial trouble and have always made payments on time (CC debt is from some unexpected home repairs).

Anyway, recently we've gotten the itch to experience living out of state. We were both born and raised in the same city where we currently live and have never lived outside of Utah. As we looked into places to move, we realized that with the house prices in Utah vs. elsewhere (midwest and south, smaller towns) we could sell our house, pay off all our debt, and put a massive (50%+) down payment on a house in a cheaper area. In theory, we'd have a tiny mortgage, no car payments, and no other debt besides the mortgage.

The company I work for would let me work from home if we moved and my wife can easily find work in a new area if needed (she currently works part time).

Of course, this is all theoretical (based on some rough estimates that I've tried to keep realistic, e.g., realtor fees, moving costs, interest rates, etc.). Our plan was to move away for a few years, build up our savings by saving what we used to pay monthly for house, car, etc., and then move back to be close to family again. When we move back we'd (again, theoretically) have another huge down payment and a big chunk of change in savings and no other debt (again, besides the mortgage).

The biggest sacrifice we can see is leaving a familiar place and being far from family. But what might we be missing? What's your opinion of doing something like this?",finance
personalfinance,Just inherited a DROP account and 401K from my recently passed mother....where do I go from here?,"Just like the title says, my mother recently passed away from cancer in November and left her DROP account and 401K to my brother and me. The accounts didn't have a ton of money in them, but it's enough to make me question what I do from here. Her drop account has about $110,000 in it, and her 401K has about $140,000. My brother and I are both equal beneficiaries of each account.

My husband and I have been doing a lot of research over the last month trying to figure out the best route to go with the money – as of right now I am still trying to deal with getting the necessary forms for the accounts, these companies don’t make things easy – so we still have some time with trying to figure out what to do.

As of right now, I currently have about $75,000 in student loan debt that I am on schedule to pay off in 10 years with a 5.3% interest rate. When my mom was sick, she always talked about how, if she were to pass away, I would be able to pay off my loans. I know investing the money may potentially make more sense in the long run, but she was happy at the thought of me finally being debt free, and I would really want to honor her and pay off my loans. It sounds strange, but I just feel like if that’s the only good thing that comes from all of this, then that’s what I want to do. So, with that being said, I would really like to figure out the best way to take all of the money to pay off my student loans over the least amount of time, and with the least amount of taxes and fees.

After doing some research, we were thinking of rolling my portion of both the DROP account and the 401K into the same inherited IRA, and then taking out a portion of the money every year for 5 years or until it runs out. The amount we take out each year would depend on our income and how much we can take out without pushing us into a higher tax bracket. By our calculations, we estimate that we can take about $20,000 each year until it’s gone without being pushed into another tax bracket (again we know that's something we'd have to sit down and calculate every year).

I know we should talk with a financial adviser, and it’s something I think we plan on doing, but I just wanted to get some thoughts from you guys prior. We don’t have a lot of money right now, and it makes me nervous to pay someone to look at this, and potentially have them misguide us and then we end up paying more in taxes and fees than necessary or, worse, find out later on down the road we owe all this money in back taxes. I just want to make sure we are headed in the right direction first.

If this helps, my mother was only 61 when she passed away, so she had not reached the age where she could begin withdrawing funds, and I am currently 32.

Thanks everyone! I really appreciate any advise!",finance
personalfinance,2020 EV Purchase - Tax Implications,"I put in a reservation for a First Edition Mustang Mach-E as soon as they were available for reservation in November.

They will be eligible for the full $7,500 EV tax credit, which I will plan to take.

My question is this:
Will I be penalized if I pay no taxes this year? My plan was to put what I normally pay in Federal taxes in a savings account - So long as I buy the car, it'll go towards a downpayment. If disaster strikes and I can't purchase the car this year, I have the money in savings to pay the IRS.

My tax liability was $6,900 for 2019, and I expect it to be about the same or slightly more in 2020 (I will be making some extra money to increase the liability + potentially selling some stock for capital gains).

personalfinance,Saving for a home - Have heard I can use my IRA,"I've heard you can take $10,000 out of your IRA to buy your first home. Is this a wise decision?

I have been trying to understand buying a home (in Texas) and I'm uncertain if losing 10K, 20 if my partner does the same, is worth it to gain the value of having a home earlier and having more money for the down payment. Hopefully lowering the interest rate and of course the mortgage.

Edit: Everyone seems to agree that it's a bad idea, but I'm having a hard time understanding the why of it. Rather, while I understand that I will lose money in total, how much? After accounting for money going to a mortgage and not just rent and the minor lowering of interest on said mortgage, how substantial is the difference? Is it enough to justify putting off a house for another couple years? 

Not disagreeing with everyone, just trying to get a clear understanding.",finance

**Situation**: I currently have a bank loan of 11k at 12.4 interest rate. I got it exactly 6 months ago. The initial loan was for  $11,800. I have since paid in about $1650 but the balance has only gone down to 11k (ridiculous). I can refinance the loan with the same credit union but I gotta ask for more money. I'm not sure what the interest rate would be if I did refinance. I pay $200 per month towards loan.

**Second situation**: I have about 3k of student loan payments left at Nelnet. Interest rate is not that high, around 3 or 4 percent (don't remember). I pay $132.96 per month.

**Question**: Should I refinance my bank loan and ask for the additional 3k to pay off my student loans and only have the bank loan to pay off?

**Question #2**: With tax return upon us, I should be getting some money back and in total (including savings) I should have 10k. Should I just Pay off my bank loan, period?

**Situation #3**: I want to buy a vehicle on my 32nd birthday (my 1st) and it will cost me close to 30k. I want to pay as much as possible, so as to not have to worry about monthly payments.

personalfinance,Need help understanding what to do at 40 with no previous planning.,"Hello /personalfinance!

I need some help.

I'm 40, married, and never learned about investing or retirement.
I do have CalPERS from my current and a previous job but don't even really know what that is or does.

I realize I'm late to the game on this but I want to know more about these things and more importantly, what to do with my money to create wealth and retirement. Hopefully it's not too late for me.

I make my money, pay my bills, and the rest just kind of sits in a savings account.
It has been that way most of my life. I need to do better.

So basically what I'm asking is what should I do with my money at my age and not having done any investing or retirement planning?

I read the FAQ but not sure it counts for someone my age that's basically starting from scratch.

I make about $60,000 a year (after taxes, also in the market for a new job).  
I have about $32,000 in a savings account and owe $18,000 for three vehicles (4% or below interest rate).  
I rent and have no other debt. I'm not sure if I'll be in the same town in a few years so haven't been looking at houses.    
I checked my CalPERS and it's sitting at about $40,000. I've done nothing specific to contribute. It has just all been automatic.  

One more thing is that I was considering getting an I.T. degree possibly at WGU since it's self paced and I would accelerate it. I currently work in I.T..

Thank you for any guidance and advice! I'm in California, US.",finance
personalfinance,"Leave 401k alone, or roll to IRA?","So I started a new job at a new company. I'm going from a very large multinational to a very small company. I'll be making significantly more money, but the benefits are obviously not the same. I have a 401k with the old employer that I've been driving the federal max into and receiving a generous match on. I'm not sure if this matters, but lets say there is around a quarter million in the account. 

My plan was to simply roll this over into the new company's plan, but my boss has cautioned me against it. His advice is to roll the old 401k into a more standard account and let it sit, and just to start anew with the 401k at the new company. His logic is that because we are a small company, we get a way worse deal from the Fidelitys and Vangaurds of the world. The available funds are limited and the expense ratios are so high that it would lose money to subject the nest egg to it. Of course it still makes sense to max out on the new 401k for the tax benefit. So I would now have:

old company 401k, roth IRA, traditional IRA, and new company 401k.

financialindependence,FERS Off-Ramps Discussion,"I also posted this in /r/govfire, but the audience here is much larger, so I'll open it up here as well, at risk of getting dozens of comments moaning about how unfair it is that government employees still get pensions at all.

I've  been a federal civil servant for roughly 10 years now, and am currently  planning to RE in \~2030ish.  After crunching the numbers and doing a  lot of runs on [FIRECalc](https://www.firecalc.com/),  I've realized that, for the most part, the success or failure of a good  FIRE plan (for anyone retiring before 50) depends \*mostly\* on your  pre-retirement savings; both Social Security and the FERS pension kick  in so late that your plan has already succeeded or failed by the time  you're eligible for either.

With  that said, the FERS pension is still a nice perk that will help make  your 60's and beyond much more comfortable if your early retirement  worked out well, so I've been going through the various [FERS options](https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/fers-information/eligibility/), and here are my conclusions on the various ""off-ramps"" from government service:

1. Leaving  federal service after 5-10 years: Ok, you're probably not doing this  and jumping into early retirement.  This likely applies to people who  jump to a private sector career.  Still, if you've served at least 5  years under FERS, it's worth filing away that information so you can  apply for a small deferred pension when you turn 62.  Since it's not  adjusted for inflation until you hit 62, it will be \*very\* small indeed.
2. Leaving  federal service after 10-20 years:  This is the scenario that a lot of  people are planning around...and it's not ideal under FERS.  The only  advantage over option 1 (beyond the increased years) is that you can  technically claim your deferred pension at your MRA (likely age 57 for  most of us)...but there's a big permanent penalty for doing so, which  can be up to 25%.  And you won't even get a COLA until you turn 62.   Don't claim early unless you turn 57 and find out you have a terminal  illness.
3. Leaving  federal service after 20-30 years:  This is, in my opinion, a key  inflection point.  With 20 years under FERS, you can claim a deferred  pension at age 60, with \*no penalty\*.  That helps you out in multiple  ways - it leaves a smaller gap between your retirement (likely in your  40's) and when you receive your pension, which lessens the burden on  your savings, and reduces the inflation hit to your pension.
4. Leaving  at age 50 with 20 years, or any age with 25 years:  This is the best  option if available.  But unless you're in law enforcement or another  career where this is standard, this requires you to be offered a VERA or  be laid off in a RIF.  You can't really plan for this.  But it's **awesome**, because you get to walk away at 50 with a full pension, *and* you get to keep your FEHB health insurance.
5. Retiring  at your MRA with \~30 years:  Standard retirement.  Big pension, you get  to keep your health insurance...but you're also not really retiring all  that early, are you?

I dont currently pay much rent or bills since I am living with my family, so I was wondering where I should start planning for the future. I started saving money, and I am up to about 600 dollars in savings, with my federal tax return at about 1300 coming in soon, and an additional 300 or so with state afterwards. so about 2100 total in a couple weeks

I dont have a car, i was planning to put myself on the insurance for my mothers and pay for my share and gas. figured that was better than buying my own car right now (she doesnt drive much). I probably wont need my own till after college.

I opened an account with ally bank to generate more interest on this cash than my .25% apy bank.  
I'd like to maybe create a CD ladder for myself or start this dollar cost averaging thing on some stocks but Im not really sure what I should be doing. maybe the best plan is to just save it all in ally?  
Id like to make money off my money, as well as set myself up for retirement as well. I should mention the store i work at also has profit sharing which can be accessed after 5 years of service, and i am in year 2.5 about.

personalfinance,"Make larger payments on mortgage w/ higher rate, or minimums then refinance in a few years?","Hi there.

So I am purchasing a home, SE US, using a program that allows for minimal cash contribution in lieu of a higher interest rate (4.75%)

I'm doing this because home prices in this area are rising fast and I'm tired of putting thousands into rent with no equity to show for it. I believe that the net gain to taking a less than ideal mortgage loan is worth the risk. 

That said, as I'm not contributing much (only a few grand) cash wise up front, this gives me two options:

1) Make double payments on the loan I have now at the higher interest rate.

2) Make minimum payments, pocket the savings (and put it away), then in a few years, use these savings as a down payment on a refinancing option to reduce my interest, potentially substantially. 

My logic points to #2, but market fluctuations could make this a bad play. What are your thoughts?",finance

So I was a teenager and a young adult with untreated mental illness. I fell very much into the false belief that I could only ever have a good life by going to college. I did everything right (so I thought - I had absolutely no help, my parents never went to college), picked something useful (info security), found a school in another state because they had the program for a good tuition rate (at the time).

Come to learn I can't program, can't code. Can barely do the basic math. Dream shattered.

Mental illness rages for two years while I try to find something I can feasibly study, that I like, a few episodes later I fail out and end up home. I wracked up a lot of debt while I was there being crazy and struggling, and with interest rates it's only getting worse.

It's about $80k now. I understand I need to do something that has a high income to pay that off. But like.

I'm really not smart enough for any of the big high demand skills. Like I said, I can't program or code. Tried multiple times. Can't do anything more than basic arithmetic. Turns out I have something called Dyscalculia and ADHD but I'm not super inclined to believe those are real.

I'm a cashier right now. I make minimum wage. I have great customer service skills.

I'm an excellent writer and I've written professionally before. I want to pursue writing, desperately. But there's no money in that. Success is a lottery win and AI outperform us at most turns nowadays.

I'm still in college, at a local community college. I want my degree because I feel like all of my struggling and suffering, not to mention the debt, was for nothing. But I don't want to get a degree in something that doesn't matter, like English or philosophy. But I'm not smart enough for that which does, the STEM fields.

I'm taking a personal finance class right now because it fulfills the same requirements as a math class I couldn't pass and it's just reiterating to me how screwed I am.

The good news is I'm single, no children, I have an IUD so no accidents could happen, plus I don't date and I have no plans to marry or reproduce because of my debt. I'm stupid but I'm trying not to be irresponsible and ruin someone else's life on top of mine which is already ruined before it's even started.

One Grafana Endpoint to monitor everything

Running prometheus operator helm charts in the other slave accounts where all the alerting is done through the alert manager in the slave account 1

Prometheus - Default scraping from prometheus operator + additionalscrapeconfig for istio services

Alertmanager - alerts related to slave cluster 1 integrated with Victorops

Slave Account 2:

Running prometheus operator helm charts in the other slave accounts where all the alerting is done through the alert manager in the slave account 2

2. From the below article, I see alertmanager should be on the slave prometheus(reliability purpose), If so do we need to install prometheus on each bare metal again?
3. Can we use any existing loadbalancer for exposing prometheus, because in helm chart if we expose the service.type=loadbalancer it used to create new one(internet facing/internal)",technology

personalfinance,Befuddled by NYC income taxes,"Hey friends,

I recently moved across the country (SF -&gt; NYC) for an exciting job at an early-stage tech company that pays me $120k annually with an $8k relocation bonus (which was delivered as pay... not a bonus). 

My first official day was on the 13th and being so, I received a super-mini paycheck that aligned with the company’s pay period two days later (being on 15th and soon to be the 31st). 

Gross earnings for that initial tiny period (24 hours) were at $1384.62. After taxes, Net Pay was $594. That’s 43% of the gross. 

I hopped into my payroll and benefits platform (Gusto) to get the story behind this low. The YtD stats read as following (as of the end of today’s business day):

Hours worked: 24
Net Salary: $5,051.30
Federal Tax: $2,417.51
State Tax: $1,915.81
Employer Cost: $10,444.86

Correct me if I’m wrong here, but the take home there is around $717. That’s fairly awful. 

Last, I filed as a single person with zero federal deductions or multiple jobs. Across NY state and NYC taxes, I claimed a withholding each with around $125/pay period in additional withholdings. 

Am I doing something wrong here in regards to withholding allowances? Admittedly, I’m fairly clueless about this stuff at this point in my late twenties and my monthly expenses and budget (which I do track religiously) definitely cannot be supported with a consistent 42% take-home... let alone in NYC. 

Per usual, this community is a life saver I’m happy to be an open book about whatever needed here to help clear this up. Thanks ahead of time!

business,Small Biz Boss overspending and writing off EVERYTHING,"I'm at a loss to do with the business I work for. I happen to work with one of my best friends, and she's the owner of the company; I am the general Manager. She helped me years ago when I left my ex and became a single mom, needing an additional job. I could have found it anywhere, but it just made sense since she was also looking for extra help at the time. Since then, my position has grown and I have grown the business exponentially with my ideas, advice, and very very hard work. I have received flexibility in that I am the only caretaker for my daughter and sometimes need to leave if she is sick or has a doctors appointment. What I do not have is overtime, benefits, etc.

My boss has barely started taking a paycheck for herself from the company's funds, and has not been separate from the company until now. Also until now, she has been purchasing excessive things, and using the fact that she can 'write it off' on the taxes as an excuse to purchase it as a business expense - however it is not related to the business whatsoever. Best examples include $2-300/month for several months of essential oils (because they help her relax its a business expense), a full size espresso machine ($600) - im talking starbucks size, and like 15 of those giant flavor pump bottles all for her one bedroom apartment (we don't have real office space) and she writes that off as an expense too, because she uses it to stay awake to work. Food - she writes off 100% of her personal groceries because, I work from her house 2-3 times a week and she gives me lunch. I am not eating the organic pasture raised high end meats that are included on these grocery trips. 

Over the years she has expressed concern that we are not doing well (we are) and that shes not making any money (we are shes just spending it) When I talk to her about this she gets very defensive and thinks im trying to blame her for the business totals being what they are at the end of the year. ( I mean this is a big part of it). I am getting to the point that I'm fed up with the pressure of her complaining we dont make enough yet there being excessive amounts of 'supplies' and 'meals' being written off. All she says is her and her accoountant will deal with it.... 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for a standard or formula or rule to use for the business to determine what is really an expense and what is not. I was thinking of 'if this is something you can purchase for each staff member then its a business expense' kinda thing. Like ok $2-300/month in essential oils to help you relax, that'll help me, the other office managers and all the staff to relax too, so if it is an actual necessary business expense, we should all be entitled to it right? I deserve an espresso machine at my home too since I work from there more often than not and need to also stay awake for work - its a legit company necessity right?

investing,Calculating leverage and implied interest rate of a call option,"Say I wanted to gain leverage to a security through call options.

1. I select the strike price by solving the equation (current price) \* delta / (option price) = leverage. Is this the correct formula for leverage?  

    Now say I wanted to compare options to margin.

2. Can you simply calculate the ""implied"" interest of a call option by doing 
((strike price) + (option price) - (current price)) / (option price)? And normalizing it to an annual interest rate by doing (1 + implied interest) ^ (365 / (time to expiration)) + 1.

-----

Following is concrete example using SPY LEAPs (Dec16'22). SPY is currently priced at $331.60.

1. I want 3x leverage, so I choose call options with strike price $245. Interactive Brokers reports a delta of 0.857 and last traded price of $94.49. Computing leverage with the above formula gives us 331.60 \* 0.857 / 94.49 = 3.008.
2. There are 1061 days until expiration. The implied total interest rate is (245 + 94.49 - 331.60) / 94.49 = 0.0835. Normalizing it to an annual rate results in (1 + 0.0835) ^ (365 / 1061) - 1 = 0.0280.
3. This calculation does not consider that, by holding options, I will never receive dividends. Assume that the dividens yield is 1.74%. Now the implied annual interest rate should be higher, but by how much?
4. If the margin rate is lower than the implied interest rate, am I better off using margin? How do margin calls fit into this?
5. UPRO's annual expense ratio is 0.92%. Does this include ""interest"" (options/futures premiums)?",finance

I have $37k in loans at 4.5% fixed. I have $1300 each month that I can either use to pay down loans or pay into my investment account, which earns usually around 7%. 

It seems like I should pay $300/month on my loans and $1000/month into my investment account based solely on the interest rates. 

Any advice or critique on this would be great and I’ll happy provide more info if needed.",finance
personalfinance,Why payoff low interest rate debt?,"A lot of folks preach getting out of debt no matter what (Looking at you,Dave Ramsey) 

I have student loans that total 9.8K. My interest rate is 3.4% and the payment is $79 per month.

My wife and i bring home roughly $8.5K per month, so the payment is very insignificant.

personalfinance,Credit Card Pay Down Question,"I have a quick question about paying down my credit card debt. I have read up on and am familiar with a few different methods of paying off credit card debt. I have made a spread sheet of my debts that shows the current principal, interest rate, monthly payment, and the percent of the principal owed monthly. If my goal were to pay down the cards in such a manner that I were freeing up as much additional income as possible with each payment, would I not pay down the one that highest percent of principal owed monthly? I only ask because I originally though that that I would pay down the highest interest one first to do that, but my card with the highest percent of principal owed monthly is not my highest interest card.

personalfinance,"Wife’s Navient student loan has high interest rate, options?","I’m looking for some advice on how to approach paying off my wife’s student loans. She has 4 navient private loans ranging between 9k-13k balance. Each of these has around a 7% interest rate. She’s been paying the minimum around 500/mo spread among the loans, and this year alone paid $2900 in interest.

Obviously I think we should at least refinance for a lower rate, but the problem here is that she is not able to work for at least the next 6-9 months as we’re having our first child, so I am the only one with income at the moment. In order to refinance I’m guessing I would need to co-sign and put my name on these debts.

She also gets 2 bonuses a year that, combined, equal around $8,000.

Now, my wife got her first check of the year this week. It happened to be a bonus check of $1,500. HR held $0 for Federal taxes.

personalfinance,Experiences with ally and a credit card to help fix credot,"I am done with my bank, nextier.

Is there any other companies that offer those types of cards. I refuse to use capital one because they are anti 2a. Without the 2nd amendment we will soon not have the first.

I will also be looking for a car loan, but I do have a cosigner who's credit score is over 840 credit score.

personalfinance,401k allocations/rebalance,"Hi Folks, I'm 43 and a total investment novice, I largely ignored my 401k until last year when I realized I need to start paying attention so being the rookie I am in 2019 I met with an advisor about my 401k, he suggested 25% to 4 different funds.
Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (E.R. .04%)
Vanguard Mid-Cap Growth (E.R. .07%)
Vanguard Small-Cap Growth (E.R. .07%)
Vanguard Short-term bond index (E.R. .07%)
I made the changes he suggested, however, I just realized I still have money in the funds I was invested in prior to making those changes. There are 4 funds I have a balance in prior to the change. They are:
VG Growth and Income
VG Total Intl Stock Index
VG Emerging Mkts Stock Idx
VG Short-Term Federal 
 I don't remember him saying anything about what to do with those after updating my new money allocations. Is it better to leave those investments alone or should I transfer them to the funds he suggested and if the latter is that via a ""Direct fund transfer"" or a ""Dollar fund transfer"" and how do I best determine what funds to transfer the balances to? 
Knowing that I have a total lack of knowledge in this area, I am also tempted to just dump it all in one of the Vanguard Target Retirement funds and let it ride, Both new money and old money.

personalfinance,My employer stopped withholding federal income tax for about half of last year. What can I do beyond just paying it out of pocket?,"I've just entered my W2 for this year's tax return and came back owing over $2k when I've never owed in taxes before. I have been paid more than I do now, but it has never been more than $20k/yr, so I have always gotten a return back. I thought it very suspicious, especially since I don't exactly have that just laying around. 

I went through my paystubs, the ones I have at least. Of the 14 I have from March to last week, my employer hasn't withheld FIT on 9 of them. There's a gap between May and August, so I don't know the exact pay period it started happening, but the YTD for FIT matches between August and my W2.

I know that I would have had to pay all these taxes regardless, but I'm wondering if there's anything I can do. I didn't submit a different W4, nothing changed with my employment, nothing has changed.

Any additional info: I am married, I have filed as married before and we still got a return. The total owed was about $900 when I entered his W2, and shot up to $3100 owed when I entered mine. He made $100k, I made $13k. I'm hesitant to file separate since I bring him down a tax bracket.",finance

So my ex and I are going through an amicable divorce and we own a rental property. Good tenants at the moment. We bought the house in 2012 for $145K using a VA loan with the interest rate at 3.5%. We owe $120K, the house is in good shape and is in a very convenient and relatively safe neighborhood. Comps in the area are going for $190-200. 

We have a car loan together (her car) which she agreed to get refinanced under her name ($20K), and a $20K tax bill, all from her business (sole proprietor).   

On my own, I have about nine months worth of savings, just bought a house (conventional loan) on my own, and have $12K student loan left. No other debts, and make about $110K a year. I have a retirement account with about $70K in it and contribute 10% of my check to it. 

So on to the question. Should I refinance the house and buy her out? Or just sell it, pay off the IRS, and take the cash to pay off my student loan, or to invest in another rental (don’t think I can get anything at a decent price anymore in my area)?

personalfinance,Should I hold off on investing for the next 5 months to pay off my SL?,"Here's some quick info: 29 year old single male, make about $80000 in a union trade., currently in my second year of apprenticeship. I currently have an Emergency fund of $11,000 (which covers 6 months of expenses, something I really don't want to touch). I'm currently paying $500/month (min. payment is $259) towards my student loans, which has an interest rate of 7.14% and a balance of $9784. I'm also contributing 15% of my paycheck (about $240/week) towards a 401k. Through my employer i also have an annuity (balance of $25,000, this is based on the hours I work) and a pension (balance of $34,000).

If i continue to pay $500 a month it would take me about 21 months to pay off my SL entirely. I am thinking of stopping my 401k contribution for the next few months and throwing everything towards my SL. This would make it about a $1400/month payment and I would be able to pay it off in about 7 months. I also sporadically throw a few hundred at my SL when i save more during the month which could make it about 5 or 6 months. Once these are paid off I would immediately start contribution 20% of my paycheck (about $315) back into my 401k to kick start that again.

My question is whether this would hurt me a little in the long term? Obviously we're only taking half a year but that could be about $4000 that i lose in contributing to my 401k. However since my SL would be paid off id get an immediate 7.14% return on my money. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!",finance

Tesla: 7.6k KW system for $17,900 or 3.8KW system for $9,950.

One is to small, other is to big. If I went with the bigger one would the cost be lower due to needing less panels? 

One thing that stinks about this scenario is that I can’t oversize my system if I decide to add a EV vehicle in the next few years. Local companies here all cost more compared to tesla as well..

Here is my situation and a plan that sounds good on paper. Need some opinions.

- my salary is enough to buy the house at current market rates 
- my mortgage payments would be approximately the same ( because of lower interest rates and annuity vs linear mortgage)
- I would get the house at lower than market rate

financialindependence,Revamping the FAQ: glossary and portfolio creation,"A few months ago I posted a [draft outline](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/dpqrjd/faq_refresh_would_love_opinions/) of an envisioned refresh for the FAQ.

Here's a brief sample of something I've written up regarding a brief glossary of terms as well as a first crack at the common question ""how should I structure my retirement portfolio?""

#Investing

**I’m ready to start investing. How should I invest my retirement portfolio?**

Refer to the [FIRE Flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/c0p24cU.png) [In the final FAQ, this should be a link to the latest flowchart] to make sure you’re ready to invest (this happens in sections 1 and 3-6 in various accounts). Investment decisions should be considered whenever you have funds in a 401k/403b/457b, IRA, HSA, or taxable account. Your portfolio spans all these accounts, so asset allocation decisions should be assessed in aggregate across all accounts.

In general, the majority of this subreddit invests the majority of their retirement portfolio according to the [Bogleheads investment philosophy](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy). **This means choosing low-cost, diversified, indexed investments without trying to time the market.** 

* Low-cost refers to looking at the expense ratio (ER) of the fund, where lower is better. A 1% fee is equivalent to a 1% lower return, and [this graph](https://www.bogleheads.org/w/images/0/09/Annual_Return_-_Fee_Impact.png) shows how this can mean years of lost retirement savings. 

* Diversified means investing in many, rather than few, stocks/bonds in order to reduce volatility and choosing assets in various classes that have different characteristics (e.g. stocks vs bonds). 

* Indexing is a way to get the average return of an entire market (i.e. get the performance of the entire US stock market rather than try to pick the winners and losers yourself). 

* Market timing is avoided. They buy and hold assets according to predetermined investment policy goals. They’re not trying to ‘wait for a dip/correction’ because they know that no one can time the market.


In practice, this often means choosing a cheap target date fund that matches the desired risk tolerance / aggressiveness of the investor (in essence, the stock/bond allocation) or creating a self-made portfolio that often looks like the [Three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio). 

An example process:

1. Start by choosing the desired stock/bond allocation based on risk tolerance. A 25-year-old who believes they can tolerate the volatility of the stock market may choose 90% / 10% stock/bond for their portfolio. A more aggressive or seasoned investor may choose 100% stock, and a more conservative investor may choose 70%.
2. After that, they may choose to invest 60% of that stock portion in the US stock market and 40% in the international stock market. Briefly, this decision is grounded in the idea that the US stock market is responsible for around 50-60% of the total global stock market value at any given time. In general, numbers between 0-50% are chosen as the international stock allocation, with most people settling on a number between 20-40%.
3. They would thus arrive at an end portfolio allocation of 54/36/10 for total US stock / total international stock / bonds. This is arrived by taking the original 90% stock, and splitting it 60/40 (90\*0.6 = 54; 90*0.4 = 36). See resources below for which stocks actually invest in the total US stock / total international stock / bond markets.

They would look among all portfolio options (401k/403b/457b, HSA, IRA, taxable) and try to make their overall portfolio, across all accounts, match that 54/36/10 split. It is not necessary for every account to be split evenly across those assets (e.g. if your IRA is 10% of your overall retirement portfolio, you could hold all your bonds in there and just hold stocks, in a 60/40 US/international split, in the other accounts).

There are a number of excellent resources that provide additional detail about the investing process. In no particular order:

* [If You Can](https://www.etf.com/docs/IfYouCan.pdf) by William Bernstein is likely the single most helpful resource on getting started. In 14 easy-to-read pages he covers the critical whys, hows, and most common pitfalls for the new investor. 

* The Bogleheads [investing start up kit](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads%C2%AE_investing_start-up_kit) and [investing FAQ](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Investing_FAQ_for_the_Bogleheads%C2%AE_forum).

* The /r/personalfinance [guide to 401k fund selection](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k_funds).

**What do all these terms mean? (Roth, taxable, 401k/403b, HSA, etc)**

**Glossary of Terms**

**Tax Treatments**

* **Traditional**: The ‘standard’ retirement account tax treatment. Also known as pre-tax accounts. Money going into Traditional accounts avoids an up-front federal or state tax but is subject to ordinary income tax when withdrawn. Withdrawals before age 59.5 are typically subject to a 10% penalty, but this can be avoided through techniques such as the Roth conversion ladder or Substantially Equal Periodic Payments (SEPP).

* **Roth**: Money going into Roth accounts is taxed up-front at the federal and state level, but all withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free. Withdrawals of the contribution basis can typically happen any time without tax or penalty. Earnings are penalized 10% if taken out before age 59.5.

* **Taxable**: Money going in is subject to up-front taxes, taxes on capital gains and dividends while in the account, as well as applicable taxes on withdrawal/sale of the asset. This includes savings/checking accounts and brokerage accounts. Some assets (e.g. stocks) get preferential tax treatment for the earnings (i.e. capital gains tax) but others do not (e.g. capital gains for bonds are taxed as ordinary income). 

**Accounts**

* **401k/403b/TSP**: The ‘standard’ retirement account offered by your employer. The 403b is simply the non-profit employer equivalent of a 401k and the TSP is the government equivalent. Comes in Traditional and Roth varieties. All employer matching dollars to 401k/403b accounts are on a Traditional (i.e. pre-tax) basis. There is an employee contribution cap (19.5k in 2020) that applies across all accounts (i.e. same 19.5k cap across multiple jobs) as well as an overall contribution cap (57k in 2020, across employee+employer+after-tax contributions) that applies per unrelated employer. 

* **457b**: Another 401k-like account that is notable for having its own cap on employee contributions separate from any 401k/403b you may have (19.5k in 2020). Governmental 457bs also do not penalize withdrawals from the account before age 59.5.

* **IRA**: Individual Retirement Arrangement (colloquially known as an Individual Retirement Account). This is an account opened and managed solely by you (i.e. has nothing to do with your employer). Comes in Traditional and Roth varieties, with various income limitations on who can get a tax deduction for a Traditional contribution and/or who can contribute to a Roth IRA. 

* **HSA**: Health Savings Account. A special savings account that you can contribute to if you have a qualifying High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). Contributions to HSAs through payroll deduction are exempt from the usual 7.65% FICA tax, exempt from ordinary income tax, avoid taxes on capital gains and dividends while in the account, and can be withdrawn and spent tax-free if used for qualified medical expenses. If you are age 65 or older, withdrawals can be taken penalty free while only paying income taxes. As a result, they offer a lot of tax advantages for an area of spending that is near-inevitable in later life. There are special tax considerations for residents of CA or NJ.",finance

personalfinance,To prioritize paying off student loans or starting Roth IRA?,"Hey everybody, I am looking for advice on where it's best for me to allocate my money in order to both get out of debt and be able to retire early.

I'm a 26 year old with approximately 80k in student loans (5.37% avg interest rate across all loans). I have been aggressively paying down on these loans so far after putting money aside in an emergency savings fund in the beginning. At the rate I'm paying at now, I can envision myself paying these loans off in 2-3 years. My question is this: would it be best to keep using this strategy and get rid of the loans considering my interest rate and then begin to save for retirement, or start an IRA now and potentially max it each year to begin saving earlier to get the compounding interest sooner on the back end? I could afford this but it'd obviously be delaying my student loan payoff date and accruing more interest, but I'm unsure whether investing in a Roth would offset this or be dumb right now. Essentially, which avenue would be best for me mathematically to set myself up in the future and for retirement?

If anyone has some good advice for me on this I'd really appreciate it as I don't have any life experience with this type of thing. Thank you!

FYI I do not get a 401k/company match with my employer so that's why I'm asking about the Roth.",finance

personalfinance,Need help figuring out how much to put down on a house,"I'm in the process of relocating for work.  I'm under contract on both the house I'm selling and the house I'm buying.  My wife has secured employment in the new location.  I would also like to buy my wife a car after we get settled into the new house.  Her current vehicle is 15 years old with 310k miles on it, so it's time I think.  I'm trying to figure out how much I should pay down at origination of my new loan.  Here are some figures:

I have about $80k cash in the bank.  I will walk away from my sale with about $100k equity.  New house sale price is $245k and I'm putting at least 20% down on it with a 30 year conventional mortgage at 3.875%.  I estimate we'll spend $20-25k on a used car for her, but I haven't really looked into what the interest rate would be as we haven't bought a car in several years.  We are early to mid 30s, good health, no kids and no plans for them.  We are both contributing to health savings accounts and our retirement plans, but we don't have any other investments.  I make about $120k plus \~20% bonus annually.  She makes about $65k annually.  Let me know what other info is needed.

My question is how much do I put down on the new house?  My thinking is to pay it down to get a low monthly payment, but then pay what I was paying monthly on my previous house.  In the event of some emergency or unexpected job loss, we could just reduce back to regular monthly payment amount.  Maybe at 3.875% that doesn't make sense, but I don't know, so that's why I'm here.  Also, I assume paying cash for the car is a no-brainer, but correct me if I'm wrong.",finance

personalfinance,Looking for some advice on loan repayment,"Hello everyone, I'm hoping for any advice you can all share on how to tackle my situation. 

Here's some background: 

I recently graduated with my bachelor's in Computer Science and have since been working as an iOS software engineer (~5 months). I'm currently earning about $65,000/year as I'm both a newbie and employed through a contracting firm. In about 6-8 months I'll be offered a salaried position between $75,000-$80,000, provided I continue to work for this particular company.

I'm now trying to pay off my student loan debt. I have roughly $50,000 in private loans broken down as follows:
$15,000 @ 11.75% apr
$30,000 @ 4.5% apr
$5,000 @ 6.5% apr

In addition I also have $28,000 in federal loans with a 4.2% apr.

I also have about $2,500 in credit card debt. (Turns out moving 850 miles west about a month in advance to your start date is a bad idea)

My monthly expenses are as follows:

Rent: $550 - cost after splitting w/my roommate
Gas: $180
Utilities: $90
Private Loan Payments (sum): $600
Federal Loan Payments: $180

Now I should also point out that I'm not struggling to get by, as my roommate is also my girlfriend who brings home about $35,000 through her PhD funding.

I'd also like to consider going back for my Master's, but that's another conversation.

Here is where I am struggling; 

I am managing to make all my payments OK and can get by on the day to day. I am unsure if refinancing my private loans is a solid idea. I used an average loan calculator to see what my interest rate would look like and admittedly still was a bit unenthusiastic about the number (7.9%). 

I am truly unsure of what my optimal path to quick, but also forgiving, repayment is. I dont mind the idea of having to pay more in interest through refinancing as I plan to funnel money into paying off my private loans once my situation is a bit more stable (salaried).

Any thoughts or advice on potential solutions would be greatly appreciated. Let me know if you need any other info as well, I'm happy to provide.",finance

personalfinance,Moving money from an HSBC Overdraft Account (they are soon to double the cost of it),"This is my solution to pay off £3k. Or rather, move that debt to make it cheaper, and so to give me more time in which for pay it off.

  
I am not very good at this sort of thing, but I have done some research myself. I would appreciate it for mistakes etc. to be pointed out.

  
You may or may not be aware that HSBC is making changes to their interest rates on overdrafts. For customers in my situation, this means the cost of the overdraft will double (I've been using the overdraft as an 'inefficient'  borrowing option for quite a few years now).

  
Here's what I am planning to do;  
Open up a credit card (either with HSBC or somewhere else). This will be for about £1000 limit. The interest rate will be cheaper than the new HSBC one on my overdraft. I can then move some of the overdraft over, by making my usual expenses on the credit card instead of my bank account (by direct debits and payments at card machines, NOT by withdrawing cash at all, to a cheaper interest rate.  
Next;  
Open up a 2nd 'money transfer' credit card - I can shift another £1000 (approx) of the total onto an interest-free rate for 16 months.  
That will leave £1000 to pay off of the overdraft, which I will do first of all. Next, pay off the credit card, finally pay off the money transfer card, which is free for 16 months, and cheaper than the overdraft after that anyway.  
A downside that I can see is my credit rating taking a mild hit with opening credit cards. 

I hope if there's any flaws or better ways of doing it, someone could kindly point it out or make suggestions to consider.

I'm not in a financial mess or at the point of anything significant happening because of debt; I'd also like to point out. 

I am sceptical about 'moving' £1000 to two new credit card accounts. 

But also; I don't want to be sinking a fair chunk of my wages into these fees anymore, and especially now they're doubling them soon. Thank you.",finance

btc,About the proposed Dev fund change from the perspective of a small BCH miner,"So I've read the announcement about the proposal to include a dev fund that will be fed by our block rewards. This proposal is supposedly being introduced with the May upgrade.

OK. We had discussions in the past months about this topic, how to fund devs.

What I, as a miner, find concerning is the following:

* I need more info about this company that is supposed to control those dev funds. Who is controlling this company? How will the funds be directed? How is ensured that the funds will be directed as intended? Why Hong Kong?
* who of the dev groups is in favor of this and who isn't?
* since we all need to upgrade in May, will we have a chance to upgrade to a client that will not include this change?

Why do I have the feeling that transparency is missing here?

My personal opinion as a miner is the following:

* funding devs in some way sounds good to me.
* funding devs with our own money sounds better than letting a company controlled by shady investors do it sounds good to me
* if I cannot chose to back out of this proposed change if I'm not satisfied with how this company is being controlled and supervised, I'm going to be **very pissed**

I need more Infos! I need statements from each dev team! I hate the fact that things are being prepared and decided behind my back again.

That's my five cents.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT**: Ok this blew a bit up and I am just finding time now to gather more information. So here is some additional info:

1. **The coinbase can contain multiple outputs**. Meaning that no protocol change is necessary to enforce this proposal. Miners and pools each have to change the outputs in the coinbase.
2. This means that the collaborating pools can simply check if the coinbase contains a tx that transfers at least 12.5% (or whatever they decide is adequate) of the Coin Subsidy to the dev fund. They could do this right now, or tomorrow, or in may when we do the hard fork.
3. I don´t see why some users here start calling this a ""soft fork"". A soft fork is a change that some miners enforce, some dont. A soft fork is backwards compatible, meaning that the enforcing miners accept blocks from miners that dont enforce the change. The collaborating pools dont intent to accept blocks from miners that dont enforce the dev fund funding. They intend to orphan them.
4. From what I know now, this all means that unless everyone is on board with this, this will cause a mess in may.

From what I know about mining, I see two scenarios unfolding in May:

1. Devs and pools and miners and the market all agree that this is a good thing, so all miners will change their coinbase voluntarily and start funding this dev fund for six months. Nothing happens, everything is fine.
2. The collaborating pools are the only ones orphaning blocks from non participants while the rest of the network accepts all generated valid blocks. This will lead to a blockchain consisting of blocks mined by the 4 pools, and a blockchain consisting of blocks by the entire network. The 4 pools will basically just mine upon themselves, while the rest of the network will include those blocks from the 4 pools that dont contain tx that have already included in their own blocks. Consequently they also have to orphan blocks from the 4 pools.

&amp;#x200B;

If both sides are equally supported with hash rate, this will lead to the same mess that we saw during the previous hash war with nchain. The significant difference being **that users cannot specifically mark their tx by including a specific op code. Users and exchanges can´t do anything to pick sides.**

This leads to just one conclusion. This hash war won´t see 2 chains surviving. Its the right of the strongest this time. And we have a small group of people here that believe that they can force everyone to do what they want.

I still don´t know if this is good or bad for Bitcoin Cash. I just know this: I don´t like the way this proposal was announced to the public at all.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT 2:**

[Deadalnix responded to the proposal](https://read.cash/@deadalnix/on-the-infrastructure-funding-plan-for-bitcoin-cash-bd372a10) \- Supports it

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT 3:**

My opinion is starting to form after reading deadalnix response. I think I can support this proposal if:

1. this proposal gets support from the majority of developers
2. This proposal will get enforced via a protocol change
3. All dev groups that support and offer a client with this protocol change will be ensured funding
4. All dev groups that are against this protocol change can split of, taking opposing miners with them

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT 4:**

More thinking. What if we introduce a similar model that has been funding GPU mining development for years?

* By chosing the node client, you chose who you fund
* A minimum amount is defined to mine with that client by their devs, which can be increased by the miner
* The difference to the situation in GPU mining being: Transparency
* Competition between dev groups to keep their client up to date and have advantages over other clients will increase
* As a side effect we will finally know how many nodes are actually used for mining

It makes sense to me to support the devs whos node client I use.

personalfinance,Best Retirement (and general) Investment Strategy Given Age/Risk Tolerance/Other Factors,"So I'm 38. Last year was the first year I had any type of income where I could comfortably contribute to my retirement. I put the max in my Roth IRA($6000) for 2019. I also just deposited another $6000 for 2020. I'm  w/ Schwab in a few of their funds (SWPPX, SWTSX, SWMRX). Given my age and late entry into the fray, is there a better investment strategy? Anything anyone could recommend? Should I leave as-is for the current $6k and put the additional $6k that I just transferred into some other type of index fund (maybe something a little more risky)?

My employer finally started offering a 401k (they match 5%). I make roughly $95-100k/year and I'm maxing my 401k out this year. This is through Principal and I guess I have the same questions here. I'm currently letting Principal take the lead via their Principal LifeTime Hybrid 2045 CIT (which they refer to as a ""Balanced Asset Allocation""). Random question here -- does the 5% my employer contributes count toward the $19,500 max contribution?

Any recommendations would be much appreciated. Also, and an unfortunate aside, I have substantial student loan debt ($300k). I've been on an IBR plan since I graduated (roughly 2014) and hopefully my income will rise enough to one day to get this paid off as opposed to hoping and praying the federal government keeps it's word and forgives the debt after 25 years (and then having to pay income taxes on the amount forgiven).

There are a few other considerations (i.e., pretty large financial gifts from my family ... large enough for me to max out my 401k / IRAs (with plenty left over) but not large enough to satisfy the student loan debt). Any help would be much appreciated.

EDIT: I've read through the wiki and I have an emergency fund and no other debt.",finance

personalfinance,Bank cannot find record of my personal loan: now what?,"**UPDATE:** After calling again, the account has shown back up online with all the payment history. Looks like everything is back in order.

So this is a bizarre situation, and I'm not sure what to do now.

Back in 2017, I took out a personal loan with BBVA Compass. I believe the term was 6 years. When I took out the loan, I got an APR discount by setting up auto-pay from a BBVA checking account. Since I do not use BBVA as bank, I transfer the loan payment to that checking account, which is then used to pay the loan. For the last 6 months or so, I have been unable to view the loan online. Ever time I click on my loan, I get an error:

""System Failure. Please try again in a few minutes or contact customer support.""

Weird. About 5 months ago, I called and put a support ticket in. They said they'd look into it and get back to me. Months go by, nothing. Frustrating, but as long as my payments are going through, that's all I really care about. However, I got on the YNAB train and would like to get my loan linked up and whatnot. I can't do that. I can't view my previous loan history, I can't view my interest rate (I forgot what it even was), nothing.

When I took out this loan, I was pretty much at my lowest point of personal finances. With YNAB, I have since been able to adjust my finances and get on track, buy a house, and have been paying down debt. I now am trying to pay this loan off ASAP, and have a large chunk of money to throw at it. Enough to nearly pay it off. However, I cannot even make payments online. Same error. So I find a phone number for an automated system for loan info. I call it.

""Your records are unavailable at this time.""

Ooooookay, now what? So I call support again. After being transferred around, I get a very nice gentleman that was able to look into this for me. Long story (1 hour) short, he cannot see the loan info either. He can see my balance, and my last payment, but cannot see my payment history, original amount, interest rate, or even the full account number for the loan. He puts me on hold and contacts the ""loan department"" to see if he can get more info on this loan. He comes back and asks when I opened the loan. I told him a few years ago, likely 2017. He said, ""Oh, this is strange. The loan department says this is a brand new loan, opened January of 2020"".

So it appears that something happened and BBVA has lost(?) my loan details. I'm very confused as to what I do now. He put in a ticket and I ""should"" hear back from them within 5 business days, but after hearing that even the loan department does not have my info, I'm not sure what to expect. I know this is not a legal subreddit, but are there are legal protections for me if they lost my records? At that point, how can they properly prove what I took out, what I've paid, what I owe, etc?

stocks,"Microsoft, Tech Firms Fight Rule Restricting Low-Income Immigrants","Major tech firms such as Twitter and Microsoft don’t want the U.S. government to restrict immigrants who might end up relying on public benefits.

The federal government’s [“public charge” rule](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/11/20899253/trump-public-charge-immigrants-welfare-benefits-court) would determine whether immigrants are more likely to use public benefits such as food stamps and Medicaid; those who couldn’t satisfy 20 different factors for economic self-sufficiency would be denied entry. The rule has faced a number of courtroom challenges that so far have prevented it from going into effect. Now, a handful of tech companies have signed [an amicus brief filing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (PDF)](https://assets-wp.boundless.com/uploads/2020/01/Public-charge-amicus-for-Boundless-et-al-CA4-FINAL.pdf), putting their public weight behind rescinding the rule.    

Those companies argue that the rule will prevent them from hiring the talent they need. From the filing:

&gt;“American businesses depend upon an efficient immigration system to ensure that they have access to the talent that they need to grow and succeed. Although the American-citizen workforce is highly skilled, businesses sometimes benefit by hiring foreign nationals for certain positions, often sponsoring these workers for permanent residency. Immigration law has long recognized that, in such circumstances, businesses require pathways (such as H-1B and L-1 visas adjusted to 5 employment-based permanent residency) for foreign nationals to come to and remain in the United States to work… The Rule, however, would restrict American businesses’ ability to hire foreign-born workers, because, under the Rule, many skilled workers who would otherwise have been eligible for permanent residency would now be barred from receiving it.”

In other words, these companies feel that the rule is too broad: “Given the numerous and amorphous factors—and the unfettered discretion given to immigration officials—virtually any applicant could be found to have some basis for a denial.”

My only advice will come from you guys, here on Reddit.","If you take a look at my post history (one post), you'll find that I'm pretty hardcore about paying off my student loans. Like, borderline Dave Ramsey-hardcore. I paid off over $30k in 2019 and could potentially pay off $40+k this year. I am contributing nothing to retirement.

I live at my mother's, which is a huge benefit and makes life easier (I am very fortunate to have this option). But, I drive 1.25hrs to work, one way. I don't drive to work daily, though. On average, I make the round trip about 8 trips (15ish one way). It sucks. In addition to that, my girlfriend, my friends, and the activities I like to do on my days off are all down state, a 1hr+ drive one way.

Over the past week, I've had a sudden change of mind. I want to start saving for a move. It's to the point where I need to move closer to work. I want to move by mid summer, give or take a few months. I can save for this type of move, significantly, and quickly--only if I reduce my student loan payments. In addition to this, I want to start saving for retirement. I have an IRA, with only a little over $1000 in it. In April, my company will match my 401k dollar for dollar up to 4% (lousy, but still). My current monthly payment for my private student loan is $765 ($14,000 balance) and my federal loans are on a IBR plan of $0/month ($36k balance). 

I have no immediate family members or friends who can really offer solid advice. I'm not sure where this sudden change of mind came from, but I don't feel as obsessed with my loans as I used to. I'm not as worried about them, all of a sudden.

I have no other debt. I gross roughly $3000 a month, give or take, depending on if I can pick up OT.

So, should I change my goals, my philosophy? Would you pay less on your loans in this situation and save instead?

personalfinance,"Consider externalities when looking at your debt.

Our rate for each car was 0.9% and 1.99% on 15k and 28k respectively. Our insurance payment has averaged about 320/month to cover both cars. By paying both off, our monthly premium is dropping 80 dollars to 240/month. If we assumed that was just 40 dollars extra on interest per month per car, the real rate was closer to 7% and 5% respectively, which would have distinctively changed our payoff strategy.

- $29,600 all US federal loans (subsidized and unsubsidized) 
- lower interest rates than private student loans [4.6%]

I am a relatively recent grad (2018) who still lives at home. While my marketing job doesn't pay all that much ($45K), I have been saving up money in the hopes to pay back these loans and remove the proverbial piano that has been hanging above my head since I started college in 2014.

I understand the concept of 'making your money work for you' and investing in avenues with higher yields than the 4% I currently have to pay back on the loan. 

However, I am so sick of carrying this debt around and would like to be done with it. Aside from the ~250 a month I pay now for the loans, I am lucky enough to not have any significant monthly costs. And after I pay this down, I'd be left with about 10K in the bank and no debt. I do plan on moving out, but that would only be if I got a higher paying job in another city/state. 

Especially with the looming recession that most economists seem to agree is on the horizon. I don't feel entirely comfortable putting my money in the market and hoping to grow. I understand it would work well in the long term, but I'm impatient and sick of the student loan burden on my back.

personalfinance,Should I reinvest my excess emergency funds elsewhere?,"Little about me

- 25
-  Low six figure job
- no dependents
- $45k in student loans (avg interest rate ~5%)
- No other debt 
- Monthly expenses ~$2800 
- $10k+ in emergency savings

So i have over $10k in emergency savings. My high yield online bank that I keep it in only gives 1.83% interest whereas they used to do 2.5% so  I was at least beating inflation (all the former high yield online banks seems to have gone that route as well, Marcus by GS and others. I’m assuming fed rates got something to do with this?). 

Now that I am effectively losing purchasing power by just keeping $10k in there, would it be more useful to invest some of the excess I have in other avenues? 

I’ve heard proponents of both 6 month and 3 month emergency funds. Given that I’m relatively young, make a good salary, and have no dependents I feel like 3 months of emergency savings would be enough for me. 

I could then invest the excess cash from the fund into paying down loans, maxing out my 401k contributions up to the federal limit (did so last year and plan to do so again because my company matches), personal stock market investing, or even begin to fund my photography venture which I’m aiming to turn from a hobby to a side hustle this year. 

My question is, am I being overzealous in only having 3 months of emergency savings given my situation?

personalfinance,Bond yields question.,"I'm currently taking a real estate finance class in college and my professor confused me and still didnt explain the topic well.

We were looking at a 1 year vs two year bond. 

1 year - yield 2.05%
2 year - yield 1.92%

We were to decide which choice an investor with $1 should make for a 2 year investment.

Using a BAII we applied:
Option 1, the 2 year bond: 
PV -1
I/y 1.92
N 2

Cpt FV= 1.03

Option 2, take two 1 year bonds:
PV -1
I/y 2.05
N 1

Cpt FV= 1.0205

to solve for second year of option 2 we solved for the future prospective interest rate:
PV 1.0205
FV 1.0388
N1

Cpt I/y= 1.79%.

I'm so confused. Both bond options offered the same 2 year overall earnings ($1.03). Why would someone devote their money and lock it down for 2 years if they can do the same with two 1 year bonds and have the opportunity for a chance to back out their money (it being more liquid)? This is all about yield curves. I begged the question why 20 year bonds even exist if you can theoretically get the same earnings reinvesting 1 year bonds for 20 years.

financialindependence,My experience with college savings and FIRE,"TL/DNR: I oversaved for my kids' college, and the leftover money left over will help me FIRE.

For those of us with children, saving for college is a big part of our FIRE plans.  The perspective I offer here is that I have a child who is 17. After discussing other options (community college, trades, military) we agreed that college was the best fit for her.  She has applied to colleges and has received offers of aid.    I am now able to show how much I saved for her, how effectively this will meet her needs, and how this will affect my journey to FIRE.

Tax advantaged college savings

Like saving for retirement in an IRA or 401k, you want to use tax advantaged College Savings Plans whenever possible to save for college.  Money you put in to these plans is not tax deductible at a federal level like a tIRA contribution, but any growth can be withdrawn tax free as long as it is spent on college education.  Spending this money on other things would mean paying regular income tax rates and a 10% penalty.  The two main types are Coverdell accounts and 529 plans.   A Coverdell account has a 2000 dollar contribution limit per year, with a contribution phase out of 220K in income for a married couple.  529 plans are probably superior for high earners because they have much higher contribution limits which vary by state, and some states allow a deduction from state income tax for contributing.

My state did not have a 529 plan when I began this journey, so I opened Coverdell accounts for my kids.  (My state now offers a 529, but it is not tax deductible and I did not need a higher contribution limit, so I stayed with a Coverdell.)  That means I have been putting 2000/year into each of my kid's account since they were born.

There has been, of course, some growth.

||Age|Total Contributions|Current Account Value|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Eldest faithful daughter|17|36000 (in AAPL/QQQ)|129,578.71|
|Middle steadfast daughter|15|30000 (in DIA/QQQ)|88,986.97|
|Youngest heroic daughter|10|20000 (in SPY/QQQ)|42,978.06|
||Total|86000|261,543.74|

Is this enough money?

Eldest faithful daughter is an above average but not stellar student with a 3.3 GPA and SAT scores in the 93rd percentile.  EFD got in to eight schools, ranging in yearly costs from 21K a year to 60K a year.

The school that cost 60K gave her 22K in merit aid, leaving 38, over four years that would be 152k.  She has 129k, so I would need to pay 23k out of pocket over four years, assuming that the market doesn't rise.  She also recieved 16K in need based aid, leaving an out of pocket cost of 22K.  Four years at that school would be about 88K.  So the amount I saved was enough to afford the most expensive school she applied to.

The school she will probably go to is a state university with a strong program she is interested in.  That school costs 33K/year.  She got 1000 in merit aid, leaving 32k x 4 years, or 128k, so I have saved enough to cover that school  She actually also got 13K in need based aid, so her cost of attendance will be 19K a year or 76K total, which means (ignoring for the moment any market changes in the next four years), it looks like I saved 53K too much.

Saving less for college, more for FIRE

The first take away is that I don't need to save 2k a year for my younger daughters, which will free up a bit more money for FIRE. EFD's sisters are even better students than EFD (and MSD might even go into the military), so they may get a similar amount of college aid.  This means I could probably save half as much as I have been saving and be fine.  In addition, college money can be transferred to other family members, which means that I have the option to roll extra money down to EFD's sisters or even to their children if they have any.

Using the extra 53K to FIRE

Of course another option is to use this money to help fund my retirement.  Just like a Roth IRA, the principal can be taken out tax free at any time.  Normally, if I spent this money on non-college related expenses, I would pay the Regular income tax rates on the gain plus a 10% penalty.  The exception is if your child receives a scholarship or grant.  I can take out the amount of any scholarship or grant she was awarded without penalty, although I would need to pay the regular income tax on it. If the school she goes to costs 33K but my daughter has gotten 14K in scholarships,  I can take out 33K, pay 19K to the school, and then pay income tax on the other 14k (it is a bit more complicated that this because I only pay tax on the portion which is gain, not the original money I put in).    Another option is to leave the money in the account until I FIRE, when I might be able to cashflow my income such that I could take the money out at a lower income tax rate plus a 10% penalty.

So what would you do with this extra money?  How does college savings fit into your FIRE plans?",finance

I am 27, currently make 65K a year as a Data Analyst. I have been at this job \~1.5 years and have already been promoted. It's not set in stone, but all indications point to me making more in the next few years.  The next step would put me at \~75k annually.  In the meantime I receive \~5% raise each year.  I have full benefits and contribute 20% of my gross earning to my 401k along with an employer match. 

I do have \~30k in student loans however I work for an established non-profit so I am doing Public Service Loan forgiveness. I have the correct type of loans and am on the correct repayment plan. Therefore, it doesn't make sense to rapidly pay these loans down. I've already completed my masters degree and have no intention of going back to school. 

After all my bills, I am saving \~1400 a paycheck a month, roughly 52% of my take home income. 

I live in a high cost of living area where it makes more financial sense to rent rather than buy.  My long-term girlfriend and I currently share a small but perfectly adequate duplex apartment. Rent is easily affordable for both of us.  She makes $80k annually for reference and has a stable government job. 

In addition to the above, I currently have a $10K emergency fund and $3K in additional savings. 

**Here's the question:**

I'm a car nerd.  

I currently drive a 2000 Mazda Miata with 98,000 miles. I love this car but am worried about how it compares to modern cars in an accident.  It lacks basic safety features like antilock brakes, traction control, and any rollover protection.  I've thought about putting a roll bar on the bar but apparently that increases the risk of concussions.

personalfinance,VA Loan county loan entitlements limits have been eliminated starting Jan 1 for qualified purchasers.,"From the [VA Blog](https://www.blogs.va.gov/VAntage/70043/next-va-home-loan/)

&gt; On Jan. 1, 2020, it became easier for you to use your VA home loan benefit to purchase, refinance, or construct a home with no down payment, regardless of the cost of the home. The VA home county loan limits were eliminated as part of the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019 for Veterans and service members with full entitlement.
&gt; 
&gt; Historically, VA only guaranteed home loans up to the county conforming loan limits (CLL) as determined by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. These loan limits reflect the changes in average U.S. home prices at the county level. If you chose to purchase, refinance, or construct a home above the CLL, the lender would likely require a down payment from you before they would choose to close on the loan. In counties such as San Diego, Calif., or Arlington, Va., the limit is much higher to reflect the average cost of a home. This meant that when using your VA benefit, the lender–not VA–would require you to pay up to a 25% down payment on any amount above the county limit.
&gt; 
&gt; As of January 1, first-time homebuyers, or homebuyers who have sold their home and have full benefit entitlement available, will no longer have to worry about loan limits or down payment requirements when purchasing, refinancing, or constructing a new home.
&gt; When purchasing another home using your VA loan
&gt; 
&gt; Conforming loan limits will impact those who want to purchase a second (or subsequent) home using a VA home loan. For those that currently have a VA home loan and plan to keep it and purchase a new home using a VA-backed loan that is more than $144,000, the rules are different.
&gt; 
* You must be able to afford all the loans at the time of closing.
* The next home you purchase must be your primary residence.
*  VA may be able to back the next loan, but it will depend on your remaining entitlement and the conforming loan limit (CLL) for your county.
&gt; 
&gt; Your basic VA home loan entitlement starts at $36,000 and goes up to 25% of the loan amount. The amount remaining on your entitlement after purchasing your first home will impact how much of a down payment will be required for your next purchase.
&gt; 
&gt; If the county CLL is $500,000 and your last loan was for $500,000, then you have no entitlement remaining.
&gt; 
&gt; If your first loan was for $200,000 and the second is for $400,000, the CLL for your next home would need to be at least $600,000 if you want the no-down payment option, otherwise you’ll have to pay a down payment on the amount above the CLL. Note that the county that will determine your loan limit is the county in which your next home is located.
&gt; In practice
&gt; 
&gt; We’ve come up with more examples of how this would work in practice, which can be seen here.
&gt; 
&gt; As each case is different, your first step should be to request your certificate of eligibility, which will show your remaining VA home loan entitlement. If you need assistance determining what this means for you, reach out to your lender or a VA loan specialist.
&gt; 
&gt; As with any home loan decision, you should speak with your lender(s) or a loan specialist at your VA Regional Loan Center to go over your options when purchasing your next home.
&gt; 
&gt; Only you can determine what is best for your personal and financial needs.
&gt; 
&gt; Whatever the case, speaking to a loan professional about your options and shopping around for the best situation for you is key.

personalfinance,Repaid sub-$3000 bonus from 2018 in 2019. Can I get back taxes via an amended W-2?,"I worked at a company from early 2018 to early 2019. I received a $3,000 signing bonus in 2018 which had income tax and OASDI deducted as normal. The terms were that I had to stay for 2 years to keep the full amount and 1 year to start keeping a prorated amount. As I left shortly after the 1 year mark, I had to repay $2,877.

From searching around it appears that this is described in IRS publication 525. https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-525

If it was OVER $3,000 I could claim the taxes paid as a credit, but as I'm slightly under it looks like I could be out of luck. The $2877 I had to repay was all in the 22% bracket, so I paid a total of $633 in taxes on it (since I assume I can't get back OASDI). However, from googling around it appears that getting my employer to issue an amended 2018 W-2 might be an option, which would presumably allow me to get the federal tax refunded by filing an amended 2018 return. Not sure if that would entitle me to an OASDI refund as well. (My state has no state taxes, so no issue there)

A couple questions:

* Am I able to reclaim this tax if my employer is willing to issue me an amended W-2 for 2018? Are they obligated to issue me one? I'm still in touch with them and left on very good terms (essentially told the door was open if I wanted to return down the line).
* Could I make an agreement with the employer to repay the remaining $123 so that I'm over the $3000 threshold?
* If not, am I able to combine this with any other nonstandard deductions to exceed the $3000 threshold? (i.e. Student Loan Interest Deduction) Any other things I may not have considered, such as unpaid reimbursements by the employer?

personalfinance,Which Mortgage Option Should I Choose?,"Hi everyone,

I did something I thought I would never do:  I bought a beach condo that I can’t afford.   I haven’t even close on the property but already stressed out about the deal. I feel I’ve made a mistake but time will tell.  In any case, I’ve already signed the purchase agreement and can’t really get out of the contract.  

The condo is non-warrantable and is new construction.  So my options for financing are very few.  Here are the two possibilities I have to decide between. I’m trying to see which is the lesser of two evils.  

The purchase price is $550k

OPTION ONE

15% down, 5.15% interest rate and monthly payment is $3500. 

OPTION TWO

10% down, 6% interest rate and monthly payment is $4100. 


Basically, I’m leaning towards option one. The concern is that the amount of money I have to bring to close will pretty much wipe me out leaving me only the money in my retirement accounts. This is the definition is being house poor.  

Because the condo is unfurnished, I would need to borrow money for furniture. 

If I go with option 2, I should be able to pay cash for the furniture (again leaving me with no extra cash), but of course the monthly payment is higher. Of course I could borrow the money for furniture leaving me with some reserves as well. 

It’s nice being able to put 10% down but I don’t know how soon I’ll be able to refinance out of the non-warrantable condo. 

For what it’s worth, the condo will be purchased as a second home but I’ll be able to rent it out on air BnB when I’m not there - for an amount that hopefully covers (or come close to covering) all expenses. 

This condo purchase will put my DTI right around the 50% mark.  So this was definitely not the wisest of decisions. 

So which option should I choose and why?",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage repayment calculation,"Hi All,

So I get that the calculation (thinking with respect to a mortgage) for the monthly repayment of a loan runs as a geometric sequence.  What I'm trying to work out, as a point of curiosity, is how you create this calculation where an interest rate changes after a period of time or even where the initial payment for the introductory period is lower than that of the remaining.  

I get what's happening but can't work out how this can be put together in a formulaic manner to allow manipulation of the variables.

So far I have managed to make an excel calculator that works on a weighted average of the 2 interest rates and balances it across the term but I'm trying to add more flexibility to this model so I can work out what kind of mortgages are affordable to me.

btc,The One Thing EVERYONE Must Know About the Dev Funding Plan: IT'S COMPLETELY FREE.,"*sigh* I get so tired of having to stop working to put out a post explaining issues. If anyone else wants to join in I could use help. (actually I've seen Jonald F. do this before too, so thanks JF!)

Things are bad when [even developers don't understand](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/esxgzj/on_the_infrastructure_funding_plan_for_bitcoin/ffd63mx/) what's going on. So I'll try to clearly explain an important point on the Dev Funding Plan (DFP from now on) for the community: it's completely free. Yet we still get [panicked posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/esx0pe/enough_is_enough/) saying Please Save Us from the TAX!!! Somebody Help!

You may be for or against the DFP, but either way please at least understand what you're forming an opinion on.

Let's start from the beginning. We know Bitcoin works on blocks and block coin rewards. The block reward, which started at 50 coins per block, and cuts in half approximately every 4 years, serves two purposes: it's a fair way to bring coins into circulation, but more importantly it provides security for the network.

For simplicity, please think of ""security"" as being measured in *power bars*. When the network first started, with just Satoshi and Hal Finney, there was 1 power bar. This power bar was made up of the electricity their combined computer hardware used to find blocks. They were the first miners. Bitcoin uses a *difficulty level* to adjust how hard or easy it is to find blocks. This level is important for a key reason: we want the inflation rate of coins (how fast they come into circulation) to stay about the same, regardless how many miners (computing power) suddenly comes online. If the difficulty is set at super easy, but suddenly a super computer comes online that computer can gobble up thousands of coins in minutes if not seconds, creating massive rapid inflation. So the first thing to understand is that due to the Difficulty Level Adjustment the rate of coins coming into circulation will always stay about the same, regardless how many miners join or leave the network.

Getting back to *power bars*. So the point of Bitcoin is there is no center, no fixed authority. The problem is we still need a decision made about which chain is valid. This is where proof-of-work comes in. Satoshi's fairly brilliant solution to a consensus decision, with no leader, was to simply look for the longest chain (technically the chain with most hashing work). The reasoning was: as there are far more ordinary people than there are governments and dictators a Bitcoin supported by the all the world's people should always be able to muster more hashrate than even rich governments. 

So Bitcoin began and people saw the brilliance: even with a weak power bar level of 1 (a couple computers), Bitcoin was safe from 51% attacks and attacking govs competing for control of the chain because a super low hashrate meant Bitcoin wasn't popular and govs wouldn't bother paying attention. By the time Bitcoin was big enough for govs to worry about attacking it should also have so many participants the power bar level would be far higher, providing strong defense.

Let's say the ideal power bar level is 50,000. At this level no government on earth has enough resources to beat the grassroots network. We hear people brag about how much security BTC has. However, the marketcap for all of BTC is about $160B. Countries like the U.S. and China have GDP measured in many *trillions*; a trillion is 1,000 billion. Does 160B really seem untouchable? For numeric comparison the main U.S. federal food assistance program cost the government $70B in 2016, representing about **2% of the budget**. So the entirety of the BTC market cap is about twice the size of one welfare program, representing 2% of the overall budget. Where should we place the current security power bars if we want guaranteed safety from a determined U.S. gov? If 50,000 is guaranteed safe we're far from it. I'd say BTC is more like 5,000. That's still pretty decent.

Of course, BCH split from BTC... and didn't carry over all the miners and accompanying security. That's not an immediate concern because if BTC isn't on government's radar yet BCH sure isn't. However, that doesn't mean BCH doesn't need security from hostile forces. It's still a valuable network and needs defenses. Where would we put power bars for BCH? If BTC is 5,000 and BCH only has 3% of that hashrate then BCH has just 150. That's it.

**How the Developer Funding Plan Works**

Back to the DFP. What this says is as a community we agree to break off a piece of the block reward and instead of giving 100% to miners we give a small percent to developers. If each block is 10 coins and the price is $300 then winning a block means winning $3,000. Of course that's not all profit because miners have electricity and other expenses to pay before calculating profit. So if we reduce the portion of the miner reward by 10% so they get just 9 coins per block yet *the price stays the same* what happens? It means miners receive $2,700 for the *same effort*. We've just made it more expensive to mine BCH from the point of view of miners. What would any miner then rationally do? Seek profitability elsewhere if available. Suddenly BTC SHA256 hashing looks slightly more attractive so they'll go there. Hashrate leaves BCH and goes to BTC, but the key important point is BOTH chains have a difficulty adjustment algorithm which adjusts to account for rising or lowering miners overall, which *keeps the coin inflation rate steady*. This means BTC total hashrate rises (more miners compete for BTC) and its Difficulty Level rises accordingly, so the same rate of BTC pumps out; on BCH total hashrate *falls* (less miners compete for BCH) and its Difficulty falls, so the same rate of BCH pumps out. Inflation remains about the same on both coins so the price of both coins **doesn't change any**, beyond what it normally does based on news/events etc. 

So what difference is there? The difference is total network security. Hashrate totals have changed. BTC gains more miner securing hashrate while BCH loses it. So BTC goes from 5,000 to say 5,100 power bars. BCH goes from about 150 to 140.

Does any of that matter in the grand scheme of things? Not in the slightest. Part of the reason is due to our emergency circumstances with BCH we had to rework our security model. Our primary defense is an idea [I came up with](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9ylfc2/i_think_i_just_figured_out_how_to_beat_the_51/), which BitcoinABC implemented, saying it's not sheer hashpower that dictates what chain we follow. We won't replace a chain we're working on if a new one suddenly appears if it means changing more than 10 blocks deep of history. This prevents all the threatening hashrate hanging over our heads from mining a secret chain and creating havoc unleashing it causing 10+ confimed txs  to be undone, while exchanges, gambling sites etc. have long since paid out real world money.

Switching $6M worth of block rewards from mining to devs just means we lose a bit of hashrate security, while we gain those funds for development. Nothing more. Nobody holding BCH pays in the form of inflation or any other way. It costs literally NOTHING BECAUSE The block reward is ALREADY ALLOCATED. It will EITHER go 100% to mining security if we do nothing, or go to both miners and devs if the plan is put into effect. Hopefully this helps. 

:)

TL;DR: we switch security which we don't really need, for developer funding which we do.",cryptocurrency

For my W-2, under section 2. Employee Current W-4 Profile, it correctly lists my Taxable Marital Status as married. For state, however, it is showing that I am single. This should also show that I am married, right?

For my wife’s W-2, her Taxable Marital Status is showing single. This should show married, right? Like mine does. For state, however, it is correctly showing married.

As for exemptions/allowances, or how much you claim, what is the general recommendation here? It is just my wife and I, no children as of yet. I believe the recommendation is to claim 2 here, correct? Does this mean for myself, I claim 2 at both federal and state, and my wife should also claim 2 at both federal and state? Or is it cumulative, meaning I should claim 1 at both federal and state, and my wife claims 1 at both federal and state, for a collective claim of 2 since we are filing married jointly?

personalfinance,Should I get a HELOC before refinancing my mortgage?,"There's a lot of info here, but I'll try to condense it well:

I have $44k in credit card debt, which costs me a boatload in interest every month. I have a house with a ton of equity and would like to use that equity to pay off the revolving debt. I also want to buy a second house this year (I'll be renting out my current one) and would like to put the remaining equity toward the downpayment. The main consideration I have right now is whether or not I should open a HELOC only for a couple of months just to pay off my revolving debt and increase my score before moving forward with a cash-out refi in order to lower my interest rate. The ONLY negative factor on my credit is high utilization. Here are some numbers:

Mortgage balance: $270,000

Estimated value: $450,000

Max new loan amount to stay at 80% LTV: $360,000

Max value of HELOC or cash out: $90,000

Revolving debt: $44,000

Median credit score: 693 (expecting a jump to 740-800 after paying off revolving debt)

A couple of additional factors that I'm using to consider: I do think I want to end the process on a cash-out refi, because the banks I've talked to said that they do not allow use of HELOC funds for down payments on another property if I'm not going to live in the one that the HELOC is on (they called it a ""bridge loan""). Also, the front-runner for the HELOC that I am looking at uses a third-party system to value the house (saves me the $600 for an appraisal), and valued it at $499.5k, so they are offering up to $129k for the HELOC; is there any reason not to open the HELOC with the full amount and still just pull the amount I need to pay off the revolving debt? Wouldn't the lower utilization percent on the HELOC look good for my credit?

My main goals are to pay as little out of pocket/add as little as possible to my mortgage (origination/admin/underwriting/appraisal fees, etc.), end up with as low of interest as possible, even if I have to sit a couple of months on a higher one, pay off all of the revolving debt, and have some money left over for the next property. Are there any factors I haven't considered or any other loan products/processes that would be more appropriate for meeting my goals? Thanks in advance for any insight you can give!",finance

* Investment Risk Level: moderate, I am a big fan of index funds.

Questions:

1.  Besides the pension, my job allows me to save for retirement through a deferred compensation plan (457b) with no match. I can do a Roth or pre-tax contribution to this. Which one should I do? I know my income will be larger at retirement so I was leaning towards Roth, but I am worried about rollover/tax implications upon leaving the agency ( I do not plan to stay here longer than 2-4 years, will remain in government such as federal or municipal) I don't think I can roll-ver the Roth into my Roth IRA, but I can rollover the pre-tax into a traditional IRA or a future employer's plan that accepts such a rollover. More about the State of Illinois Deferred Comp Rollover can be found [here](https://www2.illinois.gov/cms/benefits/Deferred/Documents/emp_distbk2018.pdf). 

2. Being that early retirement is a huge goal of mine, how much should I contribute to this plan? I have read 15% is okay, but I wouldn't mind going up to 25% or around 650/paycheck for now. However, I don't see myself staying more than 2 years at this job, which is my dilemma with determining how much to contribute.

3. The deferred comp plan is through T Rowe but  funds are Vanguard. The management fee is about \~$70/year +  the expense ratio of each fund.  The pertinent funds available to me are:
 Actively Managed: Target Retirement 2060 Trust(.05 exp ratio)
Passively Managed by Myself (all with exp ratios of .015% )
Vanguard Treasury Money Market Fund /VUSXX , INVESCO Stable Return Fund ,
Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Institutional Plus, 
Vanguard Institutional Index 500 Trust , 
Northern Trust ACWI ex US Fund 
Northern Trust Russell 2000 Index Fund

I was leaning toward the 2060 Target date fund until the 2065 would be offered to me or a build-yourself portfolio with just the SP500 index %100 for now. Any advice on this?? I’m fine with managing it myself so I could avoid the more conservative 2060 TDF.

personalfinance,How should I use excess student loan money?,"Hi, I’m 26, currently in grad school in a high cost of living area. Last semester I had some housing issues and my SO’s parents very kindly let me move into my SO’s childhood bedroom while I looked for a new place. They also fully recognize that I’m not likely to find a place I can afford before I graduate next year and I am incredibly grateful.

Because of their generosity I ended last semester with a few thousand dollars leftover from my student loan, and I’m wondering what is the best thing to do with it. I’m considering:

* Simply paying it back to the loan it came from. A 6.08% interest rate.
* Using it (and a little bit of my savings) to completely pay off a loan with a 7.6% interest rate (my highest interest rate).
* Pay off the interest on all my student loans. My average interest rate is 5.97%
* Keeping it in savings so I have a bit more of cushion if I don’t find a job before I graduate next year. I have about $6,000 in savings not including the leftovers. With the leftovers I’d have around $10,000. 
* Wait to decide until I know if I get the Cal Grant (which I am finally eligible for), and use the extra to avoid borrowing more next year if I don’t. I’m hoping for the grant, but any loan offer will probably have an interest rate slightly lower than the 6.08%

What do you think if the best way to use the leftover money?",finance

personalfinance,Need some advice about wife’s situation.,"So my wife of 2 years just recently told me that over the past 4 years has opened up 4 credit card accounts without me knowing. Come to find out that she has defaulted on all cards and was sent to collections. I was able to pay off 3 since they were all under 1k. Supposedly they said it should be removed off her record in 30 days but I’m sure it won’t. Her last card though is over 2k. She also told me that she got a letter saying that her federal student loans are in default as well........ Long story short, we strived to be financially independent while married  these past 2 yrs but obviously that is not working out for her.  I just don’t know what to do about her students loans and how that affects on taxes or credit score.

personalfinance,"May get kicked out of house soon. No job, currently in college.","TLDR: Questions at the end of post

BACKGROUND:

- I'm 21 y.o male, foreigner for 5 years, still waiting for that permanent resident card.
- The government said they will interview me and my mom within 2 months for that green card. 
- As much as I'm grateful for my alcoholic stepdad providing a place for me to live in his house, he doesn't like me. He always try to find any details to blame on me even though it's clear I did none of that. He wants me out. My mom will also abandon me once me and her finish the paperwork for immigration.
- I'm a full time 2nd semester freshman college student.

FINANCIAL SITUATION:

- I work at a nail salon shop on my days off for my mom's friend and take home about 50-100$ if lucky a week.
- After being kicked out I want to find another job but I heard a lot of them require me being on time and work 40 hours a week. I don't have the time for it.
- I tried applying for work study during my 3 hours break on Wednesday but they are out of spots.
- I have a car and 500$ in my bank, plus about 600$ from FAFSA coming soon (tuition paid off + using online books)
- I go to the gym 2 hours everyday/ 5 days a week and my school has a free gym so I'm good with that. Also going to the gym mean my eating budget will be very low since all I eat is chicken and greens. (Plus potatoes once every week)
- I have a 0% interest rate debt of 800$ until next January, then 20%, and I'm putting aside money to pay for it later, but planning to keep it for now incase something happen to me.

SOME THOUGHT:

- The rent is very high in my area (NY), I looked for some and they all cost at a minimum 600$/month. I won't be able to afford that until I find a better job that suits my schedule.
- I tried looking for jobs online but they require resumes and work experience but I never work a real job before (nail salon is family run business, they are also foreigners so they can't help me with that)
- I sleep 6 hours a day so I can have the most time possible without sacrificing my health. Most of it goes into studying. I'm an engineer major and I'm currently taking 3 math classes this semester + other classes to try finishing gen ed as soon as possible, so I can get into 4 years school, and have a better job. 
- I don't plan to drop out my gym time to work because 2 reasons: I enjoy it, it helps my health, and reduces my stress; the gym times fit perfectly in the middle of my classes so I don't waste any time in between.

QUESTION: 

- What jobs can I do that has a flexible schedule that I can take?
- I heard bartenders, nightclub servers make good money in 1 night and I'm a night owl so how can I apply for it? Is there any requirement beside being 21? I'm already 21 earlier this month.
- What immediate actions should I take right now so when it happen, I'm ready for it?",finance

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

btc,What do negative interest rates and banning cash mean for Bitcoin (Cash) [BCH]?,"I watched an Elon Musk interview, where, he didn't see crypto as taking over the global economies (digital fiat), but as replacement for fiat cash. To me he was talking about physical cash. I regard him as a bit of a prophet; he's definitely more right than wrong.

I've been thinking about how this is all going to go down.

The world's governments and banks are going to do our demand generation work for us. Not that they have a choice:

In order for countries to continue their existances, they are choosing to 'default' on their debt, not by the typical means of defaulting, with no payment, but by restructuring, with lower to *negative interest rates,* while creating newer, cheaper, debt to replace the old, more expensive, debt. This declining rates environment is going to force them to *ban cash*. Make cash completely illegal if possible, but in most areas, have a maximum amount allowable ($10,000 AUD apparently). Cash, if it exists, will hold it's value more than the money in your bank account, because your bank account has a near-zero or negative interest rate. Not to mention fees.

People, that can't hoard cash, will hoard crypto (the original idea of Bitcoin still hasn't been surpassed, BCH right now). It's gone global, in terms of development, infrastructure, and marketplace. It has a history as a viable (but highly volatile) asset for over a decade. We'll see a feedback loop. Investment and usage causes demand which causes more investment and usage. This will decrease volatility over time.

personalfinance,Help me climb out of this hole,"Hello everybody, very new here so I apologize if this is against the rules, but I am seeking advice. 
 
I currently owe about $15,000 across various credit cards and have a personal loan with about $6400 remaining. My questions and concerns are as follows: 
 
1.	Would it be a good idea to consolidate my high apr (~20%) credit card debt into another personal loan? I can get a $17000 loan at 12.4% interest and $1k origination fee (15.11% apr) and the payments would be $381.61 for 60 months.
2.	Consolidate all my debt, including my 3 year, 8.5% (roughly 12% apr) personal loan and all my credit cards into one loan.. have an offer for a $23,825 loan with 12.4% interest, $1425 origination fee (15.16% apr) and payments would be $534.81 for 60 months. 
3.	I’m currently paying $340 a month for my loan and about $200 in monthly minimums on my credit cards. Which would be $540 a month but with the interest I would come out ahead with the larger loan rolling all into one, right? I would like to keep my low rate personal loan and just take out another one for the credit cards, but then I’d be looking at $721 a month and I don’t feel like I would be able to afford that. 
4.	I bring home roughly $2800 a month and I pay $135 weekly in child support, have a $780 mortgage payment and a $300 car payment. Is there some other option to help me pay off this debt faster while avoiding the high interest rates? I currently pay more than the minimums on my cards and have done balance transfers to 0% interest, but I won’t have them paid off before I’d have to do a balance transfer again. Any help is appreciated, and yes I know I made many mistakes and racked up huge amounts of debt, but I’m wanting to fix it, and I know it will take time. I am already working on my spending and am not using my credit cards at all anymore. Selling my car is not an option, it books for about 5k and I owe $12000 on it still. Tax return has already been allocated to paying off other debts :) Thanks again look forward to hearing your replies!",finance

personalfinance,Emergency Fund Paranoia,"Hi PF,

First time poster but I've been lurking for awhile now. 

1) I was in a very low place due to mental health issues at the end of 2012. I was unemployed for two years at that time. I am very thankful that I was able to get on federal assistance programs that allowed me to survive and attend therapy. 

2) After those horrible two years I was working part time jobs and trying to rebuild my life. I was doing my best to just survive and move forward. 

3) Three years ago, I actually got a full time decent job. I've moved up in the company and have finally been able to feel comfortable financially. 

4) For awhile after making decent money I still lived to the very basics, spending as little as possible. I put whatever I could in my savings account after paying off any debts I had regretfully took on. My savings is probably larger than I need it to be, but I was always worried my life would fall apart again. 

Here are the current numbers:

Pre-tax Salary: 54k/year
Emergency Fund: 30k
401k: ~25k
ROTH IRA: ~$600.00
Debt: one credit card paid off monthly

Current Expenses Averaged:
Housing: 850
Food: 600
Phone: 40
Transportation: 120
Insurance / Medical Expenses: 160
Gym: 125
Misc: 100

20% goes into my company's 401k. 
I have been trying to put more into my ROTH but that isn't done automatically so it is usually the last thing that gets paid. I'm not actively moving money over to my savings at this point. 

Yes, food is high. That could definitely be managed better. 


The logical side of me says that I should at the very least max out my ROTH contributions for 2019. I have a lot of fear holding me back. What if in the current world / political climate all of that is lost? 


TL;DR - Scarcity mindset has prompted me to have a large emergency fund. Should I invest a portion (how much?) or keep it in my savings account to maintain sense of security?",finance
personalfinance,Thinking of taking a loan against 401K,"Over the past 2.5 years, we've been able to get our act together and steadily pay down debt, even when incurring periodic significant expenses like doing a deck rebuild in the back yard ($12K), vacations (\~$3K/year), flooded basement ($3K), etc.  In that time, excluding mortgage, we've been paying down debt at a rate of about $300 a month, on average.  So, I think our habits are sound at this point.

We have about $50K in non-mortgage debt left that, like I said, we are whittling away at...but it seems to take forever.  $13K is a car.  $10K HELOC.  $23K credit credit cards/loans.  $6K of it is currently on 0% interest accounts, but the term on tha 0% is up later this year.

Minimum monthly payments on it come up to $973/month and we throw more cash here and there at it when our bank accounts start to build up.

We are putting 18.27% of our gross income away for retirement.

So, in summary, we're fine right now and looking good in to the future.  Net worth and emergency funds keep going up.  Retirement accounts keep going up and are already in pretty good shape.

But, we're increasingly loathing the idea of paying interest to creditors.  So, I looked into a 401K loan to just wipe the slate clean (apart from mortgage).  I would take out $50K and pay it off over 5 years with a 5.7798% interest rate.  It would result in a monthly deduction of $963 from my paycheck...roughly in line with what I already pay now, so no impact to cash flow.  It would, however, make me pay interest to myself and put a fixed term on when it is paid off (5 years).

My retirement modeling presumes a conservative 4.96% growth rate for my retirement investments, so pulling that money out and getting the 5.7798% interest paid to myself is actually better than my current plan for those investments.  Yes, the return I've been getting far exceeds either of those numbers, so there is certainly opportunity cost there...just can't fully quantify that.  I am also aware of the double taxation on that 5.7798% interest paid to the 401K loan.

For our emergency liquidity we have a general savings account with our bank, a separate savings account elsewhere and a cash equivalent account with our financial advisor...all summing about 3 months of bills.

For those that cite having to pay it back upon termination of employment - I've been with this very large, well established company for 26 years and have 10 years worth of very good to excellent ratings.  We currently have a shortage of personnel to keep up with the backlog of work.

Not sure what other details would be necessary for this decision, but I'm currently inclined to do it.  It would yield some certainty (debt paid off in 5 years), eliminate interest to all non-mortgage creditors, allow us to start the habit of paying off all card usage by the end of the month, free up HELOC to be a 4th level tier for emergency funding.

Am I missing something that would make this a bad idea?  The psychological relief of a clean slate would be quite large for my wife and significant for me.  My analysis leads me to believe there's no negatives in the short term and the only significant long term negative is based on my investments outperforming the interest rate on the loan.  Thoughts?

personalfinance,Need Advice On Refinancing Car Loan.,"I am 27, so bear with me, I'm not super knowledgeable on refinancing auto loans and have been attempting to teach myself good finance habits. 

Two years ago, I got laid off days after spending a ton of money moving and thus, didn't have a lot of money saved. I was also 25 and an idiot with finances at the time. (Only received two weeks severance and unemployment took forever to kick in). Luckily I was re-employed after less than two months. Unfortunately, I relied a lot on credit cards during unemployment and by the time I started my new job, my credit score was high 500s. 

A few weeks into my new job 2 years ago, I got into a bad car accident. For my next car, I decided on a 2015 Nissan Rogue, wanting an SUV because my car accident was traumatizing and I wanted to feel safe.

It was really hard to get approved at the time for a good car loan, so I got stuck with a 13% interest rate and a $378/month car payment. Being 25, I went with it even though my last car loan had been 6%. My credit was shitty so I believed I couldn't get approved for anything better.

Two years later, I've paid things on time with this loan and now owe about $13.5k and my credit score has improved considerably. I also have a few credit cards and student loan payments I make on time. I'm trying to think through if it's worth it to refinance. I know the longer I wait, the less worthwhile it is. Below are details.

Income: $72,000  
Car: 2015 Nissan Rogue  
Loan term: 13.05% for 72 months  
Balanced paid: 2 years, $5,000+  
Payments remaining: 4 years. 

Considering financing through a local credit union, but not sure how it all works when it comes to refinancing. I found some online calculators and I think I can save at least   
$1,000 in interest through life of the loan. Advice appreciated. Thanks!",finance

- Paid twice monthly  
- Most recent pay period was the 15th (this will make more sense in a minute)

personalfinance,How to maximize a gift as a broke graduate student,"Hello everyone,

This is my first post after years of lurking. I could use y'all's help.

I just received a large (&gt;$15,000USD) cash gift and I am fighting the urge to drop everything and go travel for a year (kidding, kind of).

Context: I am currently attending a master's course in a foreign country and I am not fluent (yet!) in the local language. This has made local employment a difficult prospect. I am working on learning the language but not quite there yet.

School is going really well and I am confident that I can find a job after I graduate, but I am about to begin my second semester of a two-year program and I need to find a way to support myself until the end of next year. The course is quite difficult and time-consuming and I have been very stressed about finding a job and how to balance 30hrs/wk of work combined with a full-time intensive study program.

Before arriving here in September, I worked very hard (70 hrs/wk) in Australia for a year to build up my savings before arriving here. These savings have lasted me until now but I just spent the last of it on bills. A lot of this money went toward one-time expenses around my visa application, student application, a necessary flight home across the world, and another flight to my current residence and study program. I am on a scholarship and pay $0 tuition, hopefully this will stay the same next year depending on my grades. I am no stranger to hard work - just returned to school after 7 years of supporting myself in a number of fields. But I also worked very hard to get into this graduate program and I want to do it right with minimal distractions (like, you know, gainful employment). This gift feels like it is from the heavens but I don't want to misuse it.

Current Major Expenses:

Rent: 160 USD/month (Total 320, split with my partner)

Food: \~100-150 USD/month

Student Loans: 2 loans, both federal.

\~7000USD w/ 3.4% interest ($110/month) and

\~1800USD w/ 5% interest ($40/month)

\~ $0 credit card debt (I pay my balance each month)

I also owe some friends and family money that I have borrowed to the tune of $1000 which I will pay back first. The gifter would like me to donate 10% to charity, so that's another \~$1500 I will honor.

So my question is: What's the best thing to do with this gift? Should I pay off one of my loans entirely? I would like to keep one of the accounts open and pay each month to maintain my credit back home.

Is there a way to make money off this money? Would it be irresponsible to use this money to not work and focus on school for a while?

personalfinance,Create my own 529 to pay student loans just to collect state tax credit,"Has anyone done this? I just had a kid and set up a 529 for them but I stumbled upon an eligibility that says a 529 can be used to pay $10,000 in student loans.

In my state, I can get a $500 tax credit if I contribute $1000 or more to a 529. 

So I THINK: I could make one for myself, contribute $1000 each year, withdraw it right away, and collect $500 each calendar year when I do my state taxes. 

Anyone have any experience doing something like this?

EDIT: found the answer 


Using A 529 Plan To Pay Student Loans  

529 plan account owners may now withdraw up to $10,000 tax-free for payments toward qualified education loans. However, there is no double-dipping when it comes to federal education tax benefits. Any student loan interest paid for with tax-free 529 plan earnings is not eligible for the student loan interest deduction.

The $10,000 limit is a lifetime limit that applies to the 529 plan beneficiary and each of their siblings. For example, a parent with three children may take a $10,000 distribution to pay student loans for each child, for a total of $30,000.

personalfinance,Pay off mortgage vs. Invest in market,"Tl;Dr please ELI5 why investing $500/mo (assuming 8% interest) makes more sense than paying 500/mo extra to (3.875%) mortgage principle. 

My (26M) wife (29F) and I are fairly debt-averse, so we have always planned on paying off our home early. She just started as a nurse making much more than she made before, so the plan was to begin putting a significant amount every month toward extra principle (no specific numbers yet as we're still rebuilding EF from the hits it took during nursing school). The long term plan is pay the house off and then save for a while to upgrade homes without a higher mortgage. 

But after reading on here for a while I have considered taking a different course of action. I was explaining to my wife that it may be a better idea to take the money we would put toward principle and invest it in mutual funds or something. Assuming an average of 7-8%,we'd be roughly 3-4% better off than paying off our 3.875% mortgage.

She doesn't believe me. She thinks that the balance of the mortgage (roughly 130k) makes the 3.875% interest rate more serious than the potential 7-8% gains on a small but growing account. I don't know how to show her the math works. At this point, the plan doesn't change, as the guarantee of saving money is better in her mind than risking the money in the market and good enough for me. But can someone ELI5 why the numbers do, actually work?",finance

personalfinance,Does it make sense to pay off low interest loans to free up more monthly cash flow?,"I have these debts:

$24,000 in federal student loans with a 3.9% interest rate, 8 year term

$15,000 auto loan at 1.9%, 5 year term

$4000 in other student loans at 0%, 8 year term

With both my wife and I working, we end up with about $1500 leftover per month after paying the minimum on these loans, saving 12% for retirement, and paying for all bills and necessities. We want to have a baby in a year or two, and have decided that my wife will become a stay at home mom when that happens. When my wife quits her job, our leftover money per month drops to $150. I usually get a decent raise every year at my job, so future raises may increase this monthly cash flow a bit by the time the baby arrives. What I’m concerned about is possibly needing to increase our budget a bit to accommodate the baby and that $150 in cash flow per month could get surpassed and put us in a situation where we have negative monthly cash flow.

In this instance, does it make sense to pay off as much of the loans as we can with our $1500 leftover money, to increase our monthly cash flow?  I am aware of the math that says that if I just continue paying the minimum on the loans and invest all of our extra monthly money in low cost index funds, I’ll most likely come out ahead over the long term since the S&amp;P 500 averages a 10% (7% adjusted for inflation) return every year which beats my highest loan interest rate of 3.9% (and student loans are tax deductible).  At the same time, I don’t want to be caught with my pants down by investing all the money and then be slowly losing money later due to having a negative cash flow.

Any advice would be great. Thanks.",finance
personalfinance,Do these personal loans make sense?,"This is my first time posting here but I've been a lurker for years. I have managed to wrack myself up with 18k in student loans and 2k of credit card debt. Not that much, but it feels like a lot considered my low paying job and I only make 20k a year at this new job. I had 3 credit cards that are now cut up and frozen. I paid off one already, but the way I did it was through a personal loan from a fellow redditor for $314. I have paid this redditor back already too, two weeks after he gave me the loan. The problem is, my other 2 cards are $875 at 24.99% with Capitol One and $850 at 12% with Discover. And that's just the credit cards, but my student loans have lowish interest rates and I want to work on those after I pay off my credit cards, since I'm doing a debt snowball. I am late on both cards on top of the interest rate charges. So that's late charges + interest rate charges. My credit is too low now for any kind of personal loan to consolidate from a company. I've been using these Reddit loans as sort of like paycheck advances and the last one enabled me to pay a whole balance in full.


So my question is, should I continue to get these personal loans from Reddit to pay off my credit cards? There's always a set repayment amount and date with a Reddit loan, and it's less than the interest rate+late fee charges. My credit score utilization will also go down and my score will start to recover faster. Or should I stop getting these loans and just pay my cards off with the money that comes from my paycheck? Keep in mind that with the loans I can pay my balances in full and then repay the lender at my pace. Would you do this?",finance

personalfinance,Did I screw us out of a property tax deduction?,"My wife and I live in Texas (no state taxes). We itemize our deductions every year **except last year, in which the new standard deduction outweighed our itemizations**. This includes property tax of $6-$7K, mortgage interest, some medical expenses, etc. Our AGI for the 2018 refund was $198K; this year will be higher with a promotion for her and the first full year of my own promotion (not sure what that amount will be for 2019 just yet).

Fed up with the way my escrow account was handling our money, I decided to budget and also get some minor money market interest on property taxes and insurance myself. For 2019, we closed and cashed out the escrow account in October, after having paid 9 months' worth of payments into escrow (where the mortgage company would handle property taxes and insurance for us).

Typically they'd pay from escrow to the country for our property taxes around November of each year. Realizing the deadline is at the end of January, I waited until January 3rd so I could get a couple extra months of interest. This time it was around $7K.

What didn't occur to me, is whether or not I'd be able to claim the property taxes in 2019 because they are for the 2019 tax year, or if I can't claim them until 2020 because I didn't pay until 2020. If the latter, and I pay my 2020 tax bill in December, does that mean I'll be screwed out of \~$4K (2 x $7K, but the deduction is capped at $10K)?

Am I understanding this right?

That said, my hope and expectation is that we'll be encouraged to file the standard deduction again this year anyway, even if I'm in the former scenario where I could deduct the property taxes, so it's possible this point is moot anyway.",finance

Can someone please explain to me why anybody would ever want to withhold as married if it means getting screwed at tax time?

Additionally, we bought our first home late last year and heard that you could see a benefit at tax time by deducting interest and taxes.

Needless to say, I wish I had known beforehand what I was getting into, but I didn't even understand interest rates when I took these loans out much less industry or the professional job market.

Here's my problem: with my income now it would take me 5-6 years to pay off these loans &amp; that's only if I'm shoveling pretty much everything I have into them each month. I can't save, I can't invest. My rent now is extremely cheap because I have 3 roommates in a rural, low pop town in a fly-over state, but I don't expect it to stay cheap over that entire period of time because we're all in our late 20's and people move around at this age. If any of us leaves, my payments go up.

I see something like two options:

1. There is an online post-bacc program in Computer Science offered by Auburn that costs \~35k, which would double my overall debt, but increase my earning potential. I see this as an option because I could still work, I wouldn't have to move, and in \~2 years I could (possibly) make more. I'm nervous about this because I also thought taking loans out was a good idea that first time and I was wrong. It's also a pretty difficult degree. What do you think the minimum salary after graduating should be to justify 60k in debt?
2. I could (possibly) find a better job than what I have, in which case I don't know what to look for or where. I have no employable skills that come to mind (kinesiology is an academic degree, not an applied science) so best case scenario is that I swap my current low-wage, low-skill $10 per hour job for an $11 per hour job doing similar work.

Is the solution obvious? Do I pay down loans? Do I take out more? Do I move? Thanks for any input. I really don't know what to do.

i work at a dealership, and i spoke with the co-owner of the company about purchasing a new vehicle in the next 6 months or so. i’ve been here for coming on two years now and we’re pretty familiar with each other. i wouldn’t so close, but he respects me. i asked him questions about what my payments would be on a 2020 corolla so i can put together a plan of action. we buy brand new corolla’s from toyota for cheap to sell from our place, and i got offered the employee price of 17k for a brand new corolla.. i think that’s a pretty good deal considering they sticker starting at 20k from the dealer. 

so we’re looking at $1850 after tax and license for the vehicle, with a down payment of 3k (i’m trying to put down 5k tho), 5.5% interest rate from a credit union with a first time buyers program that i qualify for right now, we’re looking at a car payment of $300/m OR less. of course insurance is a factor too, but i don’t have an estimate on that. 20 years old with a clean driving record. 

i read a post earlier about a guy wanting to buy a house but just bought a truck for 10k while making 25k a year, and he got grilled for buying the truck, and even saw something saying that a car payment at this stage is a setup for financial disaster. so now i don’t know which route to go.. good thing i haven’t made any decisions yet

I have to work until I am 55, and  at that point I will have 37 years in the system, and will have to pay for healthcare until I hit medicare age. (I am just assuming with the way OPERS is being managed that healthcare will not be an option for me or my wife)  I am not sure what healthcare will look like in 25 years, but I know right that now a middle of the road cobra plan costs around 800 bucks, so I will just double it and assume 1500-1600 by the time I get there, My goal is to have 150-200k in the 457 by then, and then depending on interest rates, the interest on said 150k should just about pay for health care right? 

The way I look at it is: 

Best case: Opers does well, and I have an extra income stream / good inheritance to pass along 

Middle of the road: Opers drops health coverage - my interest on the 457 just about covers it, 

Worst case: Insurance is through the roof, and I get to spend my roth and 457 on insurance.

I worked for a contracting agency contracted to a financial institution in AZ starting October 2018 until July 2019. I moved from CA to AZ a few weeks before starting work, also October 2018. I received my W-2 from this company and Box 1 lists my gross taxable income as $12,505.50. Then lower in box 16 it lists AZ state wages as $12,505.50 and a second line with CA state wages as $12,505.50. Now, to my knowledge, this is an error, so I reached out to my former employer to have this corrected. They claimed me that my permanent address had not been updated with them, so my wages would be taxable in both states due to the fact that I lived in California and worked in Arizona.  I asked if this could be corrected and their response was essentially ""kick rocks"". 

At this point, my federal return has been accepted, may AZ e-file return was rejected for ""An issue on your W-2. If the sum of boxes 16 exceeds the amount in box 1, the return cannot be processed electronically."" Finally, I have not attempted to deal with the state of California at all at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

To be clear, I did not work or reside within CA at any point during the year of 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

So, there is my situation with my taxes so far, and here are my questions:

Do I refile on paper with the existing W-2 in AZ because the taxable amount in box 16 is correct?

Is there anything wrong with my employer not issuing a revised W-2 even though it is not materially correct? 

What do I need to do to not pay CA taxes since I did not live or work there, but my employer reported $12.5k of income there.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all, I will try my best to clarify and answer any further questions!",finance

CryptoCurrency,TaxACT charging more if you click that you used crypto- doesn't have any additional steps or questions about it.,"So, filing my taxes, during the final review it asked if I bought, traded, or received any crypto. I checked yes. Next step tells me that based on my answers, I need to pay for the deluxe version ($75 between federal and state)- I agree to pay this, because I don't want to turn around and lie on my tax return. I didn't have any income from crypto, but that wasn't the question that was asked.

So, once I pay for deluxe, it does the review check again, and, *doesn't ask for any other info*. Just moves forward into the filing process.

They tried to upsell me audit protection after selling me deluxe, so deluxe didn't buy me any extra protections...

They literally just charged me more because I admitted to trading crypto, and did absolutely nothing to ensure that I filed the crypto side of things correctly.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Debt relief options besides bankruptcy?,"I need advice on the best route to go in order to get out of this debt situation:  

* **Avg. monthly income:** $0-$2,500 (variable)   I left full-time employment last August due to medical concerns &amp; have just been freelance writing, and my husband was laid off for over 2 months this fall, so we fell dramatically behind.
* **Outstanding bills:**  We have been unable to pay most of our bills for the past 2 months, so we are quite behind on things like cell phone, tv, internet, gas, etc. 
* **Credit card debt:**  $14,000 with interest rates ranging from 16-28% APR.   Some cards are actually over the max credit limit due to fees and interest.  I know that in the grand scheme of things, our unsecured credit card debt pales in comparison to some other people, but we do not have the income to make even minimum payments. 
* **Credit score:**  605  - We are already two months behind on payments and have been taken to collections, but they have all sent me letters about setting up payment plans and such. 
* (I do have $44,000 in federal student loans, but they have remarkably low interest and qualify for  income-based repayment anyway)

**So as far as I see it, these are my options:** (but I'm also not a finance person, so there may be things I'm missing -- hence why I'm asking ya'll!)

&amp;#x200B;

* **Option 1:  Early withdrawal of my public pension.**  I was a teacher for only 3 years in Missouri, which means that I am not vested -- I'd be required to withdraw it in two years anyway. However, if I withdraw the $14,000, I will lose about 30% in penalties and taxes.. and have no retirement.
* **Option 2:  Home equity loan.**  Our house was purchased upfront in cash, so we don't owe anything on a mortgage. An appraisal at this time would likely be \~$90,000.  I'm assuming the interest rates on a HELOC or something similar would be much lower than the APR on our credit cards. BUT, that also means risking the house.
* **Option 3:  Debt management program** \- the only issue being is that I'm not sure we'd be able to keep up with the negotiated monthly payments.
* **Option 4:  Bankruptcy, chapter 13.**  We have no assets for chapter 7 (just house and vehicles). 

I'm leaning towards using the public pension(minus the 30%) to pay off most of the debt. Does this seem like the best option right now?",finance
personalfinance,New Yorker Getting Health Insurance While Saving Up for Retirement,"I’m a New Yorker with no debt and some okay-performing investments, and I’ve put off buying health insurance all the way up to my thirties. Now that I’m at that age where I no longer feel invincible (a little fever here, a bout of digestive issues there) I’m looking around for a health insurance plan that’ll save my butt in case I get full-blown diabetes, cancer, or some other hard hitter. Those things are no longer distant possibilities for me. The thing is, the cost of living is also very high where I live, and my income is not particularly great: $31,000. This year, $19,500 will go to my tax-advantaged retirement savings plan, $6,000 will go to my Roth IRA, $1,500 will go to transportation, and the rest will go to bills (parents’ house) after the federal government, state government, and city government withhold their share of taxes. I don’t think there will be much left after the tax withholding. I’ll have got nothing left to save for buying my own house much less pay for health insurance. But a house isn’t strictly necessary for me right now; staying in good health and making sure I have healthy finances to lean on are my current top priorities.

My job does offer health insurance, but the open enrollment period ended over a month ago after I decided I could not afford to pay an extra $1,000 a year pre-tax (for a plan that looks pretty good now in retrospect). So here I am looking at a menu of plans offered on the New York State of Health marketplace (full yearly price):

 * **Platinum:** $10,793.76 premium, $0 deductible, $2,000 max out-of-pocket [$10,793.76–$12,793.76]
 * **Gold:** $8,908.56 premium, $600 deductible, $4,000 max out-of-pocket [$9,508.56–$12,908.56]
 * **Silver:** $7,461.84 premium, $1,100 deductible, $6,500 max out-of-pocket [$8,561.84–$13,961.84]
 * **Bronze:** $5,249.04 premium, $4,425 deductible, $8,150 max out-of-pocket [$9,674.04–$13,399.04]

The site tells me that I qualify for a $4896 subsidy, which brings the costs down to:

 * **Platinum:** $5,897.76 premium, $0 deductible, $2,000 max out-of-pocket [$5,897.76–$7,897.76]
 * **Gold:** $4,012.56 premium, $600 deductible, $4,000 max out-of-pocket [$4,612.56–$8,012.56]
 * **Silver:** $2,565.84 premium, $1,100 deductible, $6,500 max out-of-pocket [$3,665.84–$9,065.84]
 * **Bronze:** $353.04 premium, $4,425 deductible, $8,150 max out-of-pocket [$4,778.04–$8,503.04]

Clearly, the platinum plan is the best for constraining medical costs to some known range, but the premium alone is guaranteed to exceed what’s left of my income. The bronze plan has the best premium, but it does nothing for me unless my medical needs are serious enough to make me spend $4,425 out of pocket first. In any case, my medical costs will never exceed $9,065.84—an amount which I’ve already set aside savings to cover without dipping into my investments.

So, I’m sort of lost in the whole decision-making process.

 * After my tax-advantaged retirement account contributions and pre-tax transportation expenses, my taxable income should be around $10,000. I don’t know if I screwed up my application by reporting $31,000, because I might actually eligible for Medicare. I can’t find anything on the New York State of Health marketplace that defines “income” clearly.
 * If I can get a refundable premium credit on top of the subsidy, I would like to get the platinum plan. (I don’t know whether the two are mutually exclusive.)
 * If I cannot get a refundable premium credit on top of the subsidy, I would like to get the silver plan. (I think it’s likely I will be utilizing the benefits, but I’m not so sure that I’m willing to shell out high premiums just for a $0 deductible.)

personalfinance,Income taxes on early withdrawal of pension?,"**CONTEXT**:  I taught in **Missouri** &amp; contributed to the public pension in **Missouri**.  However, I lived and still live in **Kansas**.

**PROBLEM:**  If I get an early refund of my contributions, Missouri's pension system automatically takes out 20% for my federal income taxes. I would also have them withhold an extra 10% for the IRS penalty for early withdrawal. Then, I would still have to pay state income taxes.

**MY QUESTIONS:**

**1)   Would I pay Missouri state income taxes or Kansas?**  I'm pretty sure Kansas doesn't tax retirement income, but this wouldn't qualify as that would it?

**2) Is there any way to work around or avoid having 30% taken right off the bat (**besides a rollover to another retirement plan?)

btc,"""What happens if the powerful miners decide to increase the 21 million limit?""","This used to be a common question in the old days of r/bitcoin, when people who understood the dangers of centralized inflation tried to understand Bitcoin.

The answer was always: ""well, the miners could do that but Bitcoin would lose all value to a competing currency which was not inflationary, since nobody wants inflation in their own wallet"". 

Regarding this horrendous idea of a centralized entity with no accountability pocketing 12% of the mining reward, I see lots of comments arguing it doesn't matter what we think, the miners have decided what is good for us. ""It doesnt matter what you think, you are not a miner"",""Get hash power or stfu"" etc.

This is so wrong. 

It is us the users and the great community of BCH which give it value, not the miners. We have the ultimate power. And the great power of BCH community is the moral high ground based on freedom and the belief in a better world, free from centralized money creation fueling corruption and power abuse.


What's to stop this cartel from changing the 21M limit, the mining reward etc when they have grabbed enough power of the community? Sure, these might be trusted people now but what about in ten years when the 12% are worth the average of a average country BNP?

Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.

No I am not a miner and will probably never be. But I can vote with my feet and sell my BCH. As a matter of fact, many other cryptos already has a much more transparent and decentralized way of funding development. Why should I go for a lousy version of Dash? What happened to those of you who always bash Dash, where are you now?

If developers need money, ask for donations. It works for Monero and it works here. You can develop BCH all the way to perfection but I won't care if it's on the road to becoming The Fed 2.0. Bitcoin must follow the Whitepaper or I'm out.

EDIT: I'm not opposed to the idea of using block reward to fund development. I just believe we have to be very careful as to the **execution**. It needs to be transparent and absolutely aligned with the incentives of decentralized peer to peer cash.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Is there any downside (or real benefit??) to me leaving a small amount of my student loan debt unpaid to increase the average age of my credit history?,"Like the title says. 


I've been able to pay ahead significantly on my student loan debt using some extra income. Assuming everything stays on track, I'll be able to pay off the majority, if not all (fingers crossed) of my student loan debt before the end of this calendar year. 



Not sure if this is how it works with all federal loans, but paying ahead has pushed my next ""due date"" forward in time. My next payment is now due in 2028. It will be in the 2030s by the time I'm down to the last few hundred dollars. 



I'm thinking of taking advantage of this by keeping a small unpaid balance of maybe $100 on my lowest interest loan. That way, it can continue boosting my credit score by increasing the age of my credit history. As of now, my student loans are the only accounts I have over 10 years old. Obviously, I won't wait until 2030-something to finally pay it off, but I'd like to hang on to it for at least a few more years. 



Is there any downside to doing this that I'm not thinking (or aware) of? On the flip side, are the benefits of doing this so negligible that it's not worth the trouble?


---EDIT---


For clarity, I literally have $0 due each month as my minimum payment until 2028. My servicer considers those months paid already and also reports them as paid. So by doing this, I’d also increase my ratio of on-time payments. 

And yes, I do already have credit cards (three--paid in full monthly), but none are close to being as old as my student loans.",finance

personalfinance,Cash/Bond Investing Primer,"I see a lot of posts recommending high-yield savings accounts, but very little mentioning bonds.  This is intended as a short primer on thinking about maximizing cash/bond investments and how to think of HYSA vs bonds including how to assess and compare options.  Ultimately, investing is a infinite spectrum of risk vs reward and there are a lot of options in between HYSAs and equities people should be aware of.

The world ultimately pays for risk.  In the bond world this comes in two major forms, credit quality and duration.  Duration is an interesting stat commonly available (eg, from Morningstar).  Mathematically, it provides a sense of sensitivity of the investment to interest rates (the longer the maturity of a bond, the higher the duration).  A duration of 6 means the fund would lose 6% if interest rates climbed 1%.

The good part about bonds, is if interest rates rise, the value of the fund may drop but it will also be earning more interest than it did which helps recoup the losses.  Stocks do not have this kind of relief valve.

Ultimately, Morningstar produces a fixed income style grid to make all this easy.  Top left of their box is high credit quality / low duration = low risk.  Bottom right is low quality / high duration = higher risk. 

Finally, another good stat is standard deviation, often found with risk stats.  Take 2x the standard deviation and that is the range you could expect the investment to perform in over the course of a year in normal markets (eg, 95% of the time).  So a standard deviation of 3 means you could expect fluctuation of +/- 6% around it's expected return.

Finally, keep in mind that money in a mattress loses value to inflation.  But with inflation generally running around 2%, anything earning less than 2% after-tax is also losing value to inflation.  You will find the safest choices guarantee slow-motion wealth destruction as they do not keep up with inflation.  So while safe is good, it comes at a cost.

Here is a spectrum of common investments.  I own most of these, for transparency, but I also feel I would not benefit noticeably from some additional demand.  

**Safest** (you cannot afford to lose any principle), high yield savings account.  High quality, zero duration, zero standard deviation.  But will not keep up with inflation (yield up to \~1.9% these days).  CDs essentially fall in this camp too and provide better rates if you do not mind locking up the funds (up to \~2.1% for 1 year).

**Low risk**.  SLQD, an ETF comprised of high/mid quality / low duration corporate bonds.  You can buy/sell this with minimal fees at any major brokerage.  Current yield 2.05%.  Quality medium high, duration 2.2, standard deviation 1.3.  Among tax-free options, my go to is FSHIX with 1.35% yield, 2.4 duration and 1.2 standard deviation.

**Med risk**.  AGG (the bond index).  Current yield 2.2%, high quality, but a 6 duration.  Standard deviation 2.9.  Has overall returned 4%-ish per year for last 10-15 years.

**Higher risk**.  PONAX (an actively managed fund that borrows to invest).  2.6% yield.  Quality is high and duration is near zero, but that understates it's risk.  Standard deviation as high as 3.5.  But the fund has also returned 8% per year average over last 10 years.

Highest risk, emerging markets bonds which introduce currency risk too.  Junk bonds fall in this camp too, particularly longer duration junk bonds. 

For comparison.  S&amp;P500.  Standard deviation is 12 (so we are talking a totally different risk ballpark, given a normal fluctuation then is +/- 24%, around an avg return of about 8%).  But 10 year returns are 14% annualized, so it has paid well for this extra risk.

What do I do in practice?  If I need the money near term, it is in savings or something low risk.  If I want to have a high probability of preserving principle, but no near term use (eg, emergency funds), I seek to stay ahead of inflation.  I will lean into a mix of bonds, with a healthy portion to something like PONAX. 

If I am saving up for something long term (eg, retirement, college) I lean more heavily to equities, but normally keep at least 20% in bonds to limit the bite of an equity sell-off.  Given this is long-term, I tend to go more aggressive with the bond allocation.  As any spending gets into a 5-year window from today, I start to secure those funds with lower risk investments.  If you need it within the next year or two, play in the Safest to Low Risk range.",finance

personalfinance,Wealth-building advice,"Hi everyone,

So my wife and I were just wondering where we go from here.  I'll do a neat little bullet list of our current situation and it'd be great if we could get some input based on that:


* I'm 32, federal government employee, stable job, $60k per year
* Wife is 36, vet tech, stable job, 30k per year
* No kids
* No debt except ~150k on mortgage.  30-year fixed.
* $29,000 in liquid savings
* 401k (TSP for feds) is diversified into the C/S/I funds 60/20/20.  Current balance $60k.  Investing 15% (this includes match, so 10% of my own income) every pay biweekly.
* Wife has no investments on her own, but all of our finances are lumped together anyway
* After expenses/deductions/etc., we're saving roughly $1,500 per month.  This can be more or less depending upon our discretionary spending in said month.


I think I got most of the basics.  If I forgot anything, please ask.


My question is:  where do we go from here?  We talked last night and decided that $25,000 is a good emergency fund for us.  We would be able to buy a decent used car with cash whenever one of our cars bites the dust, or we would be able to reasonably afford any large home maintenance expense that would crop up.  Health insurance is pretty good and covered by my employer.


I just plopped ~4k into the Vanguard LifeStrategy Moderate Growth Fund (VSMGX), as it seemed like a good balance of growth vs. risk.  It's 60/40 stocks/bonds.  Based one everything I've read, it's a good fund to build wealth if you don't need the money anytime soon (purpose of 25k emergency fund), and we decided that we won't invest anything additional into it if our emergency fund dips below 25k, so if we buy a car or something, we stop investing until we're back up to that point.  Oh and I elected to reinvest any dividends.


Any thoughts or advice?  Am I making a mistake?  Keep in mind that I am a total investing ignoramus, so any solution will need to be relatively ""hands off,"" so this seemed like a good idea.


Thanks for reading!

EDIT:  Thanks for the posts everyone. I think my sequence is going to be this:

1. TSP - 10% me, 5% employer match = 15% of my gross
2. Roth IRA (we'll call this my wife's IRA) - maximum $6,000 per year. Coincidentally, when coupled with my  TSP, this would hit the 15% gross between the both of us
3. 25k emergency fund
4. Anything over 25k and left over from the year after #1-3 and discretionary are satisfied will go into a mutual fund index through Vanguard. If #3 dips below 25k, replenish to 25k before investing anything additional.",finance

personalfinance,Ludicrous Credit Card Debt - and low-average credit score - looking for help on restructuring.,"Long story, but self employed, 2 years ago business had issues due to me getting very ill, burned through my emergency fund, and then took out 120k worth of 0% interest credit cards to float me through and cover personal and business expenses. I'm doing fine now, business is doing great too. I have a healthy enough income that my debt to income ratio shouldn't be a big deal. I've rebuilt an emergency fund, which I need the buffer incase i get hit with something again. Despite a high income, I also have very high personal expenses, mostly due to my mom being in assisted living which is costing me 40k a year to supplement what her LTC plan doesn't cover...

Promotional periods on balance transfers are long over, and i'm getting killed with interest on 100k of debt (paid down 20k of principal so far). I've been going over my budget, I've already cut most of my discretionary spending down, but it's still going to take at least 3 years to pay down if i'm aggressive, and 5 years if i allow myself to live a little. I really need to try and restructure my debt to something with a lower APR.

Due to an autopay that didn't go through, resulting in a missed payment on my credit report:: my fico8 score (according to myfico.com) is an average of 665 according to the 3 bureaus. I've called the card and explained the situation, i'm waiting to hear back and see if they're willing to remove the late payment from my credit report. I'm not hopeful given it's bank of America... It's in review.

Talked to my Credit Union about a HELOC and with my current credit score they said don't bother applying until my score is over 680. The branch manager couldn't tell me which fico version or bureau they use.

Would a personal loan be an option? A friend suggested I try sofi. I'm assuming i face the same issue with credit scores, and even if i got approved the rate would be just as high as it is now.

I'm hesitant to apply for any financing unless I know I have a good chance of getting it, due to a hard inquiry further lowering my credit score.

I thought about a possible loan against my emergency fund using it as collateral? but that seems kind of silly, since i assume it means if i need the money i can't withdraw it. I thought about just sinking my emergency fund into my debt and living on the edge with no fund... but that's too risky given what I just went through, and this time with no credit to back me up if anything happens i lose everything.

Any other options i'm missing on ways to restructure this debt to a lower interest rate? Or do I just have to wait until my score goes up?",finance

I haven’t been pleased with the management of the account and was planning on moving it to a different broker but that’s a thread for another day. 

Yesterday a family friend contacted me. Her grandfather died and she is offering his property to me to buy before she lists it on the market. This property is in my dream retirement location.  She is offering it to me at a very good (below market value) price because we’re long-time friends and she knows it’s always been my dream to retire at this location.  It was also my father’s dream to retire there but he passed before that could happen. Property in this area is normally passed down through families so doesn’t come available very often. My family has one house here already that was built by my great grandfather in 1932. My aunt currently lives there.  This property is adjacent to that property. Anyway...you can see it’s an emotional issue for me. 

I also have a daughter who starts college in the fall. I’m a single mom and her dad is supposed to pay for her college but he isn’t reliable. He has given her part of his 9/11 GI Bill  but that will only cover about two years worth of tuition and fees—not housing or books.  I’ll be covering that. I have some money put back to cover two years of college but not enough to cover an entire 4-year program if he does bail. 

I’m 50 and will be retirement eligible at my job in 6 years (Fed employee). At retirement I’ll have 30 years of service and I have a TSP account that has done very well.  A family member has already checked the house and it is in very good shape (was basically rebuilt after Michael). 

I really want to buy this property but don’t want to make a huge financial decision based on emotions. If I use the money my dad left me, it would be enough to buy the property and pay the property taxes for the next several years but would also not leave much to pay for my daughter’s college if her dad craps out on her. I have no idea what sort of tax liability I would be creating if I cashed in the inheritance to buy the property. 

These are the types of decisions my dad used to help me with. I just don’t want to do anything stupid.  Any advice or perspective is appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Which account to pay off with extra money?,"I have 2 cards currently at zero % interest. One card will expire in May the other in June. After the expiration date of the zero %,  both will have a similar interest rate at around 15% (Most likely I will have to do a balance transfer for one if I can't pay both off).

I current have $1k to throw at either card (or spilt it up if it's better), which one would you recommend using the $1K on?

personalfinance,DINK: Should we refinance student loans even thought we're set to pay off all $45k in 1 year?,"Currently both my husband and I are working full time and we don't have any kids. There's a total of ~$45,000 in student loans to pay off at an average of 6.5% (all are fixed rate). All the loans are in the grace period for another 5 months.  While my husband was in grad school we lived completely off of my income and he wasn't working. We're used to living this way and decided to keep it up so we can pay off the loans as quickly as possible. We're set to pay off the total amount in a year. Our financial advisor recommended we refinance our student loans to get a better rate. Earnest gave us a quote of ~4.8% fixed. Something in my gut is telling me not to refinance and I'm not sure why. Maybe I'm just paranoid about ""what ifs"" (e.g. what if one of us loses our job and we need to utilize the income driven repayment plan on the Federal loans?). I realize we'd save a little bit by refinancing since the interest rate would be lower, but over the course of a year it wouldn't be astronomical. So I'm wondering if anyone has some thoughts on whether refinancing is worth it in our situation.",finance
personalfinance,Where to park savings in the medium-term,"Hi all. Long time lurker, first time poster here. I’m hoping to get some opinions on where to park savings for a house down payment. My best estimate for the time horizon of buying a house is 4-6 years. In the prime directive and various posts in the side bar, 5 years is used as the breakpoint between using a low risk account (HYSA, CD, I-bonds, etc.) and a high risk account (index funds, etc.). Because I’ll likely be right around that mark, I haven’t been sure how best to save.

For context, I have no debt, a reasonable emergency fund, and I’m maxing multiple retirement accounts. I own a car I expect to carry me at least a couple years past my home purchase so no issues there. Purchasing a home is generally the only savings goal I have. That said, I only just reached this stable financial position so I’m just starting to save for the house now (no current savings to open an account with yet).  I expect with no investment gains I should be able to hit my 20% down payment goal in my time horizon.

I use a HYSA for my E-fund now but both HYSA and I-bonds have relatively low interest rates at the moment and would just barely match inflation. However, my risk tolerance is fairly low as I don’t want the possibly of some gains to potentially set back my timeline via losses. I’m wondering if there’s any sort of middle option, like a portfolio only invested in a diversified mix of bonds to get a ~4% expected return with lower risk than stocks. I also imagine other people must have been in similar positions before so I’m interested in hearing about what you did. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,[Taxes] Confused about paying taxes and gift loans,"I apologize if this is the wrong place to post.

I am currently in medical school and paying about 60k a year in tuition with federal loans. 

A very close family member offered to give me a loan interest-free to pay for my tuition so my debt would not multiply from the interest while I finish school/residency. 

They have been pretty informal about the whole thing and I have been pushing to create a contract and organize how and when I'll pay them back.

Will a loan like this count as income? Will I have to pay a large sum of taxes at the start of next year? 

I don't know if my understanding of taxes is correct, but I feel like we will be double-dipping in taxes because they paid income tax on the money they're giving me and then I'll pay income tax on the money I receive from them and then pay taxes again when I earn the money to pay them back.

Also, if anyone has ever been in a situation similar to this and has any tips on how to make things go as smoothly as possible I would really appreciate it. Part of me just wants to stick to traditional loans because of the simplicity, but the overall cost after interest is terrifying.",finance
Forex,Death Cross... Shmeff Cross,"News headlines are saying that the death cross pattern has appeared on the DXY and with it almost guaranteed odds that the reign of king dollar is coming to its end.  

But I don’t see it happening any time soon.

As always, just look at momentum and interest rates. These two indicators couldn’t be more clear.  Momentum against the dollar’s major counterparts, especially the heaviest weight of the DXY, the EUR, has been building for several weeks. US inflation is sitting at 2.3 percent, trending upward if anything, and employment numbers continue to come in strong.  The Fed has not been lowering interest rates but instead has been using the repo market to guarantee liquidity in the banking system, and even though some might call this a form of easing (although it’s really not) the Fed has actually been backing off the repos as of late.  Further, the European Central Bank just met and they gave no indication of raising their rates, they really have no reason to, as the macros just aren’t there to support that.  And lastly, it would be a huge surprise if Japan or Switzerland messed with their rates as it would be the first time in several years.  

So pretty much everything suggests DXY bullishness.  Maybe a short term mean reversion is coming, but on my longer term position I’m buying the dollar...hopefully these aren’t my famous last words.",finance
personalfinance,"Made less than $25,000 this year, but Turbotax states I owe roughly $700 combined fed/state taxes...","Sorry for the lengthy post, I'm just kind of stressed about this.

I'm a recently graduated law student, and I have only been working full time since August 2019. I had been working part time during the early 2/3 of the year since I was still in school and then studying for the bar exam. As such, my total income (across both W-2's that I received for the year) total just under $25,000.

I also live in NH but both went to school and work in Massachusetts. Last year, I ended up owing just under $100 in MA taxes even though I got close to a $300 federal refund.

My withholding has always been 1, as I'm not really trying to get a huge refund in the first place since my understanding was if you can get it close to $0 (but still on the positive side) then that's a good thing, as the government doesn't get an interest free loan off of you.

This year, upon going through the TurboTax Free File option (via the post from this sub that links you to their free options from the IRS.gov website), and inputting all of my information (except for the 1098-T from my school), my Federal refund was just under $300 and my Mass return was about $112 owed. I thought, ""Ok, I guess that's alright as it's still a net positive, but I don't know why I owe in MA again...""

Cut to last night when I finally got an email from my law school's bursar stating that the 1098-T was available. I went online to check it and input it into my return. In Box 1 of the 1098-T, it lists only $579.00 as payments received for qualified tuition. In the past two years at the exact same school (with nothing but tuition ***increases*** each year), this same box was roughly $48,000. I also receive a $15,000 yearly scholarship, and that is reflected in Box 5. Additionally, for the first time on any of the forms I've received, there is an amount in Box 6 (stated that it's for ""adjustments for scholarships and grants from a prior year"") for $6,500.

After inputting the 1098-T as the last tax document I needed for this year, my Federal ""refund"" has changed to almost $300 due, and my MA return has increased to $440 due.

I have already sent an email to the Bursar for my school to confirm the 1098-T is correct, but I just wanted to get the details into a post here to see if people think that even seems remotely reasonable for me to owe so much in taxes. Basically, is it likely that I've made some major error or that I'm missing something? And is it at all reasonable for the amount of qualified tuition to be so low when I know for a fact that tuition was not only $580. If it were, this law school would have a LOT more applicants.

Thanks for any help or advice you can offer.",finance

stocks,"Stock Market Week Ahead for the trading week beginning January 27th, 2020","Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 27th, 2020.

# **After virus scare, markets look to Fed rate policy to keep stock rally going  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/24/after-virus-scare-markets-look-to-fed-rate-policy-to-keep-rally-going.html)**
*****
&gt; With stocks coming off their first losing week of the year, investors will be looking for the Federal Reserve to soothe markets by reaffirming its position that interest rates will be low for a long time into the future.
*****
&gt; The outbreak of the coronavirus in China in the past week took the steam out of a market that has been repeatedly rallying to new highs since December. The S&amp;P 500 fell just about 1% for the week, amid fears the virus could lead to slower growth not only in China, but across the globe.
*****
&gt; Those concerns could continue to spook markets in the coming week, but stocks should be buffeted by the Fed’s anticipated commitment to low rates and its current Treasury bill buying program. The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to emphasize that the Fed remains on a neutral policy path and that would only change if there was a significant change in the economic outlook.
*****
&gt; There are also some major earnings reports, including from Apple, which hit an all-time high Friday morning before closing lower with the broader market. It could have a big impact on sentiment and help influence trading across the technology sector.
*****
&gt; Stocks were choppy in the past week, and Treasury yields have been sinking on worries about the new virus. The 10-year yield sunk to a Nov. 1 low of 1.68% and investors drove gold prices higher in a flight-to-safety trade.
*****
&gt; “It’s overshadowing everything, and what the market is looking for is that the Chinese are containing it, and the spread is minimal,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The derivative of all of this is what does it do to growth? Traders and investors are hoping the stimulus that has been introduced into the Chinese economy is going to take hold, and this is not going to halt that turnaround.”
*****
&gt; Krosby said the market has been looking for an excuse to pull back. The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 3,295, off 1%, but it is still up about 2% for the year so far.
*****
&gt; “You could see going into the weekend the 10-year Treasury yield is down, gold is higher, the market is in a text book defensive state,” said Krosby. “We had a market that was poised for a bout of profit-taking and this is it.”
*****
&gt; # Earnings roll out
&gt; There are more than 135 S&amp;P companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, with a heavy focus on technology, industrials and consumer stocks. Apple reports Tuesday, and Microsoft and Facebook are Wednesday. Boeing and General Electric report Wednesday, while McDonald’s releases results Wednesday. On Friday, big oil reports with ExxonMobil and Chevron expected.
*****
&gt; Earnings reports so far have been mostly better than expected, with 68.2% of companies beating earnings per share estimates, according to Refinitiv. Earnings are expected to be down about a half percent for the fourth quarter, based on actual reports and estimates of companies yet to report.
*****
&gt; “Coming into any earnings season with stocks at all time highs is fraught with peril,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “It’s precarious because you have the opportunity for outsized moves if you miss earnings, revenues or guidance.”
*****
&gt; Hogan said companies may be able to give a better indication of the future, now that there’s a first phase trade deal between the U.S. and China. He said markets will also be looking for guidance from China and elsewhere on whether the virus appears to be containable or not.
*****
&gt;#  Fed is big story but won’t say much
The Federal Reserve is not likely to say much has changed in its outlook, except that it’s last three interest rate cuts may have helped the economy and financial conditions.
*****
&gt; “The big news is just talk on the balance sheet. I think that’s going to be the key messaging,” said Jim Caron, portfolio strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “I think the data has been okay. There’s really nothing new there. The only thing that’s really new or interesting is going to be what’s going on with the balance sheet.”
*****
&gt; The Fed has been buying about $60 billion in Treasury bills each month to expand its balance sheet, ending a program where it was shrinking the balance sheet. The Fed is adding reserves to end a problem in the repo market, which is basically the plumbing of the financial markets where institutions go to get short term cash.
*****
&gt; Many traders believe the program is adding liquidity to markets, and therefore driving investors into stocks.
*****
&gt; Mark Cabana, head of short rate strategy at BofA Securiteis, said the Fed is not changing its benchmark fed funds target rate, but the fixed income market has been expecting the Fed to make a technical adjustment to another rate. He said the fed funds rate, trading at about 1.55%, has come to the lower end of the Fed’s target range of 1.5 to 1.75%.
*****
&gt; For that reason it is likely to raise the interest rate on excess reserves by five basis points. “The intent is to affirm the bottom end of the Fed’s target range, ” he said.
*****
&gt; Besides the technical move, they “may be will provide a little more guidance on what it would take to vote rates one way or the other,” he said.
*****
&gt; # Economic data
&gt; There’s an important data calendar in the coming week, including the first look at the fourth quarter’s gross domestic product on Thursday. Personal income and spending data is Friday, and that includes the personal consumption expenditure inflation deflator, watched by the Fed.
*****
&gt; New home sales could continue the string of positive news in housing, when they are released Monday, and there are durable goods Tuesday.

# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months

&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979—just the sixth best month for that benchmark.

&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February’s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).

# Solid January Starts Not Rare, February Could Be Tepid

&gt; Bullish sentiment is running high and why not. A new decade has begun, January has been bucking the recent trend of volatile performance and the market is trading at or near all-time record highs. Big round numbers like 29000, 3300 and 9000 are also emotionally satisfying. Our Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days indicators were both positive and the market is well on its way to completing a historically bullish January Trifecta. A positive January Barometer is all that remains to complete the January Trifecta.

&gt; As of yesterday’s close DJIA was up 2.3% year-to-date. S&amp;P 500 was up 2.79% and NASDAQ stood at 4.44%. Although these gains are above average, they are actually not all that uncommon by the thirteenth trading day of the New Year. Since 1901 (119 years), DJIA has been up 2.3% or more on the thirteenth trading day 33 times before this year. DJIA’s largest gain on the thirteenth trading day was 11.4% in 1976 (+17.9% for the full-year). S&amp;P 500 has equaled or exceeded 2.79% on the thirteenth trading day 26 times since 1930 while NASDAQ has bested 4.44% 15 times since 1971. Depending on index, gains equal to or greater than this year come about approximately once every 3.3 to 3.6 years. 2012 was the last election year where all three indexes were up more on the thirteenth trading day than this year.

&gt; In the following Seasonal Patten Charts of DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, we compare 2020 (as of yesterday’s close) to All Years and Election Years. Here it is clear that the market has gotten off to a solid start with well above average gains so far. Throughout 2019, the market tracked its historical patterns quite closely which suggests some mean reversion could occur this February as the month has been historically tepid for DJIA and S&amp;P 500.

# Another Look At Election Years

&gt; Last week in our LPL Research blog, we took a closer look at how stocks have performed during an election year. We found that since 1940, the S&amp;P 500 Index hasn’t been lower during an election year when an incumbent president has been up for reelection.

&gt; We’ve had many requests to look more into election years, so we thought we’d take another look at this impactful year.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500’s track record for reelection years has been impressive, but its average path during these years has been quite interesting, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day. In ten reelection years since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 on average has barely budged from February through June, before breaking out in the second half of the year.

&gt; “Stocks actually have traded in a tight range from February through June during election years, with the big rally taking place during the second half of the year,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/reelection-012220.jpg?ssl=1))**

&gt; From a quarterly view, the S&amp;P 500 has historically posted modest returns in the four quarters of an election year, but the benchmark has been higher an impressive 82% of the time in the fourth quarter of all election years. That’s one of the best track records of any quarter in the four-year presidential cycle.

# Recession Watch Update

&gt; As the economic expansion caps its first decade, we thought it’d be a good time to check on LPL Research’s leading indicators in our Recession Watch Dashboard.

&gt; As you can see in our latest update and in the LPL Chart of the Day, the overall view hasn’t changed much. We believe we are in the later stages of this economic expansion, but we still see little threat of imminent recession. The current expansion is the longest on record, at 126 months, but the economy has grown at a slow and steady rate. We believe this measured pace, along with supportive fiscal policy, has contributed to this cycle’s continued durability.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/012120-recession-blog.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; In the fourth quarter, the needle moved in different directions for two of our five forecasters:

&gt; We removed the U.S. Treasury Yield Curve from On Watch status as the spread between the 3-month and 10-year yields moved back into positive territory. The spread between the 2-year and 10-year yields also climbed to an 18-month high following the Federal Reserve rate cuts. Going back to 1955, a yield curve inversion (long-term yields falling below short-term yields) has preceded each of the nine recessions. It’s important to note, however, that parts of the curve flickered between positive and inverted territory several times before the actual recession occurred.

&gt; We added Market Valuations to On Watch status, as the S&amp;P 500 Index trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio rose near cycle highs. The P/E ratio is now comfortably above our 2020 target of 18.75. With the S&amp;P 500 surpassing the upper end of our year-end fair value target of 3,300, we are watching closely to see if earnings growth is strong enough to justify these elevated valuations. The low interest-rate and inflation environment continue to be strong tailwinds for market valuations.

&gt; “We remain optimistic of continued, albeit possibly slower, economic growth in the United States in the coming year, bolstered by recent progress on the U.S.-China trade deal,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “While we continue to monitor the indicators closely, at the present time, we see only a modest chance of recession starting within the next year.”

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",finance
personalfinance,Student loans eating me alive,"Hey PF, 

Tl;Dr at the bottom 

I am buried under some student loan issues and I could use some advice. I have ~$10,000 through a bank and ~$8,000 through FedLoan. The bank loan is my issue. It is broken into each year I needed the loan, so I technically have 6 loans contributing to that $10,000, four of which are in ""recovery"" meaning they're so far past due they are with a special team and need to be paid in full before the stop screwing with my credit score. This is because they claim I used my six months forebearance (for after school) while I switched to a community college for a few quarters (they would not and have not accepted an enrollment verification to defer those months as per the loan contract, and I've kind of given up after 3 years of trying). So, my dilemma: 
The bank keeps pushing me to settle on these loans. It means I'll have to pay significantly less overall, and they write off the rest of my debt (how the bank explained it) and I just have to file a 1099C. That sounds way too good to be true to me, and I don't trust anything the bank tells me because their advice contributed to this mess. I'm no financial expert, so research has only gotten me so far, and I'm hoping there's someone here with some experience in this? 

So, tl;dr what are the consequences of settling a loan? Do I have better options for loans in ""recovery""?",finance
personalfinance,Dependent vs Independent Tax Filing,"So this is the first year of not living at home since I'm a college student (19M), and in the past year I believe I made about 18k, across 4 different jobs (will be getting a W2 for each). The tricky part is that 1 of the 4 jobs (and where most of my money was made) was from essentially an internship 900 miles away, working in another state, meaning I have to file taxes there, in my resident state, and then federal. I don't receive any money from my parents besides the fact they pay for insurance (car and health) and my car payment, everything else I cover. 

To maximize the amount of return I get, would it be better to file my taxes with them as a dependent, or file them myself? And what are the possibly downsides of filing either way?

Thought it would be best to check here since I've worked 4 jobs, in 2 states, not living at home anymore and am a college student.",finance
personalfinance,Large CC balance vs. Interest rates - which is more important when starting to pay off debt?,"I am at a loss for what is the best option to pay off my credit card debt. I will be getting a deposit from work next month and after taxes it will be around $7k. Looking for any advice on the smartest way to put this extra cash towards my debt!! 

This is absolutely not my best subject, but trying really hard to educate myself so this can all be paid off sooner than later and I stop using these cards completely. I have 3 CC's which I will list below with the details. I do not touch these unless absolutely HAVE to. The only one I use, which may not even be the best one of my options, is the BofA card (#1) below. The two others I am simply paying off the current balance and do not touch. I have some unfortunate situations happen which is why the BofA card racked up a balance so quickly (not proud of this at all).

I have read different opinions about where to start with all of this so I am trying to provide as much detail as possible. I don't have issues paying off more than the minimum payments monthly for all cards, but I want to make a ***dent***. I want whatever route I go to decrease minimum payments to the cards by a good bit if possible, obviously. :) I just can't seem to get past the larger balance, even though it may be smarter to knock out the smaller cards first.

**BofA CC - Balance of \~$13k**  
APR on purchases is 22.49%  
Total Interest Charged in 2019: $2127.09  
Total Fees Charged in 2019: $46.33

**Citi CC - Balance of $3195**  
APR on purchases is 23.49%  
*\*This APR rate just expired on 12/31/19. It was 0.00% APR as an intro rate\**  
Total Interest Charged in 2019: $0  
Total Fees Charged in 2019: $190

**Chase CC - Balance of $2400**  
APR on purchases is 22.24%  
Total Interest Charged in 2019: $308  
Total Fees Charged in 2019: $27.63

I apologize if there is not enough detail or if I didn't explain well - this is so complicated for me and any advice or help is truly appreciated!!! I know this isn't the best situation but ready to make a change and head down the right path. Thanks in advance to all. :)",finance
personalfinance,Debt or maxing 401(k) first?,"My wife and I are trying to decide how best to approach our financial future. Our expected income for 2020 is roughly $195,000. We have two student loans and three vehicle loans, for a total of about $71,000, with interest rates ranging from 2.99% to 4.66%. We have no credit card debt, although we will be using a card with cashback rewards for gas (it will be paid in full each month). 

All the options we're looking at include maxing out her 401(k) this year ($19,500) and every year going forward. She is salaried, so her paychecks are consistent. I'm hourly, with built-in overtime, so my paychecks vary a few hundred dollars from check to check. We have budgeted a realistic minimum for my checks. In all scenarios, anything above that minimum will be applied to debt and the snowball method will be used. We will both receive raises yearly, but those are not budgeted. All plans include things like saving for yearly personal property taxes and an account for home maintenance, in which we deposit anything left over from the utility bill budget each month. None of these plans include changing current quality of life. We don't live extravagantly, but we don't pinch pennies and eat ramen either.

For the most part, we've been following Dave Ramsey's Baby Steps for the last year or so, which allowed us to pay off about $32,000 in debt last year. It looks like that amount would be pretty consistent going forward. If we continue with that plan, all debt will be paid off by June 2021 at the latest, with interest at about $2100 from now to payoff. The next step would be saving about $30,000 (step 3, 3-6 months savings), followed by maxing out my 401(k) going forward. In this scenario, I'm currently contributing 5%, in order to get my employer match. 

After playing with the numbers (and realizing we owe federal taxes this year), we have come up with some other options. The first step in all scenarios is obviously to ensure higher deductions throughout the year. 

The new potential plan we came up with begins with maxing out my 401(k) as well. Based on my minimum budgeted paychecks with the new contributions, we'll have roughly $10,000 ""extra"" to put toward debt. Of course it will actually be more based on mandatory overtime, training, and holidays, but that's the baseline. When I apply that same amount to the next few years, all debt would be paid off by November 2022 at the latest. Then we'd move on to the 3-6 months of savings. Interest paid from now until payoff would be about $4,000. 

The way I'm seeing this is that by maxing out my 401(k) now, we'd have some thing like an additional $50,000 in retirement savings at a cost of roughly $2,000 in interest paid on debts. Additionally, we'd reduce our tax liability quite a bit. Am I missing something or looking at this the wrong way?",finance
personalfinance,Can I file separately from my husband to get a better return?,"Hi there - not sure if this is exactly the right place for this but I'm trying anyway.

Last year my husband was a full time student. He made $5,300 in income, and paid ZERO in federal and state taxes, I'm assuming because regardless of what I told him to do, he used advice from his manager and claimed ""exempt"".

I made $35k last year and would have around a $2,000 tax refund. Since we were planning on filing together, it seems like my tax refund/savings is paying income tax on his income and shaving my refund down to $900. Is it legal to file separately? Will that help me in the long run?

Help! I was using this plan all year to get the brakes done on my car and now I don't have enough $$ to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I see the light!! I didn't understand what deductions even were or how they affected me, nor did I understand that I got a larger deduction as a result of being married. This is only my second year doing taxes as a married person.",finance
personalfinance,"Keeping track of ""savings pots"" within one account?","I'm cracking down on my savings account this year! This is the first time that I've actually had savings in a long time as I totally tanked it while at university. I'm 23 and have a part-time income of about 20k at the moment. I will either be going full-time or getting a second income stream this year. For the time being, my parents are lovely and support my necessities which are food, rent, and public transport.

Their generosity leaves me some room to save! I want to utilize this moment in my life to start, and really contribute to several savings ""pots"".

I only have one savings account, and it will probably be that way for a while, it's also a way for me to earn a higher interest rate rather than using multiple accounts to contain money meant for multiple different things.

The trouble that I always have is I designate a certain percentage to one purpose - for instance, I may say that 25% is an emergency fund, 40% is meant to be the down payment on a future home, 15% is savings for a future vacation, etc. (not real numbers, just an example). The problem is that I'll write these things down at first, but I have trouble staying consistent. When my account increases, I eventually fall of the wagon with logging these numbers into a spreadsheet. Or, in other cases, I'll withdraw a certain amount and find that I actually needed more money for something that I was saving for, skew the numbers, not go to my original plan.. etc.

I need it all laid out in front of me, and I need it to either update on its own, or have some method of remembering to keep track of these financial goals... for instance, a ""pot"" in my savings may not be a percentage, but a single numerical goal.. like on the side of all of the big important expenses.. I may really want something... like a nice pair of headphones. I want to be able to consistently \*figuratively\* add to that pot over the period of time that I projected, and assure that I *am* adding the appropriate amount...

**Doing this:** Seeing that I have 3k in my savings, knowing that I want this $300 pair of headphones and starting a ""pot."" As I already have a solid plan for delegating my finances to exist, important ""pots,"" that money is already 'gone' and technically I have $0 to put into this new pot. If, say, I'm delegating 10% any deposit into my single savings account, into my ""want-but don't need"", I can come up with a reasonable projection for how long it should take for me to save up the money for those headphones.

**NOT Doing this:** Seeing that I have 3k in my savings, knowing that I want this $300 pair of headphones and starting a ""pot."" Not keeping great track of my deposits, and seeing that I have a nice 3k at my fingertips, I decide to dump a full $200 of what's already there into my figurative savings for the headphones, grab another $100 from my next deposit of $300, and buy the headphones.

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't yet fully understand what is an appropriate split for things like this. I know that it also depends on individual goals... and situations. Right now, as I am very fortunate to have my rent covered externally, how much of my own money should I be saving for a future home? How much should I start putting aside for retirement\*? How much should I allow myself to add to the (figurative) pots for things that I want, but don't need (headphone example)? How about something like a travel/vacation fund pot?

&amp;#x200B;

\**I will be opening a retirement account soon if I don't go for a job that includes payments to one, I'd just like to start out with a few grand to put in initially.*

Are there any apps or services to help manage these theoretical pots and help you stay on track with your savings? Is there a better way than manually updating a spreadsheet?",finance
personalfinance,"Investing a small amount,","The title says small amount but to me it’s a large amount. 
My wife and I are closing on a house soon, we are going to have about $3500 left over.

Since we do not have the other half of the money right now we are going to hold off on this until we do.  The total price is closer to $6500 for the upgrade. 
One thing we are doing is having the pipes cleaned out for now which will buy us time. 
The way I see it, we have two options, we could get a loan for the rest of the money for the upgrade. Or we can wait. I want to wait, and while we wait I want to put the funds into something which can grow over the next two years.

personalfinance,Bank put a 10 day hold on a check from my 401K without telling me. What is preventing faster check clearing?,"I’ve had a rough patch financially and had to dip into the small 401k I have from my last job (I know it’s never great but it was my only option). Luckily I just got a job offer yesterday, but I don’t start until feb 10th, and presumably won’t be paid for a few weeks after that. 

On Thursday I got the check for roughly $2k from my old company’s 401k provider, and figured it would clear faster if I deposited it at the bank rather than through my phone like I normally would. Normally when I deposit a check they make the first $200 available immediately and the rest the next day. So I asked the chase teller if I could get the $200 back in cash (I wanted to buy a new shirt/tie for the interview). For some reason he went into the back to do the deposit, when he came back he said he wasn’t able to do any cash back, but the funds would be available the next day. But the next day the funds still weren’t available. I looked at the deposit receipt and it says there’s a hold until Feb 3. I went back to the bank but all they said was he couldn’t have told me they’d be available next day because the system shows them when there’s been a hold. Basically said there was nothing they could do, but that it *might* clear faster than that. 

I did a little bit of research, I’m guessing they put a hold on it because either a) it was a bigger check than I’ve deposited recently or b) I was overdrawn recently (though I deposited cash the same day so there was no fee, so I didn’t think that would count as an overdraft). Most things I read say that they legally have to tell me they are holding it and why, but he definitely didn’t tell me there would be a hold and now they can’t tell me why.

I know there’s probably nothing I can do, the bank employee told me it’s “impossible” for anyone to remove the hold early for me. I read that the Fed has been trying to make the clearing process faster, but I don’t understand how they’ve failed to make any significant progress.


edit: Called Chase today to ask for an update, and the guy I talked to was able to release the hold. For anyone in a similar predicament, giving them a call is worth a shot, I hadn't tried earlier because the branch employee told me early removal was ""impossible.""",finance

My wife's parents have been, for lack of a better term, bad with money. They have filed bankruptcy before and never really had credit. Recently, their bad decisions have caught up with them and I'm not sure anyway out for them. They currently have about $17,000 in auto loans at an interest rate of 33%.

Based on KBB, both cars have a combined value of anywhere from $12,000 to $15,000, so no way of actually clearing the debt with a private sale.

Do they have any ways out? Should they just bite the bullet, talk to their lender and say we can't pay this anymore take the cars? What would result from that?

personalfinance,Scam Attempt Alert: “Bank” calling to authorize a transaction,"Hi everyone!

I’m writing this to tell you about a scam attempt we avoided last week.

It all started when we got a legitimate call from our bank saying that there was a suspicious transanction in Kentucky, when we were actually in California. They didn’t ask for any data, I just said “that’s not me” and they offered to block the debit card and that was it.

2 days later, we get a call from our bank’s fraud department saying that there was suspicious activity on our card, and that they wanted to verify if it was ours (two transactions, a small one and a 1K transactions at Target). The guy over the phone sounded a little sketchy, and was definitely trying to get us to feel urgency. After saying “Ok, let’s block the card” he said he was going to send us a 2-factor authentication code to our phone. I denied the request and hung up.

He called again, asking for the same stuff, I asked how I could verify he was from the bank and he replied that the number he was calling from was the same as the number in the back of my credit card. He was right, but I know numbers can be spoofed. I put him on hold and called the bank on another phone we had and when they picked up, I hung up again on the scammer. He called 6 MORE TIMES, while I was talking to the bank. The real bank associate was super chilled, congratulated me on being aware and not giving any data over the phone, and proceeded to check that everything was in order.


In short, if your bank is calling and they are asking for information, even if it’s just a 2FA code, hang up and call the bank yourselves! If I hadn’t blocked my card two days earlier or if I didn’t have my super-smart wife with me at that time, I probably would have been reporting a fraud the next day",finance

Bitcoin,On fungilbility and the blacklisting of bitcoins,"Consider a Bitcoin that allows users to trace the transaction history of their coins vs one that has ""fungibility and privacy improvements"" that strip this information.  

Which Bitcoin would offer more utility to society?  I will argue that a Bitcoin with individually identifiable coins is superior and that fears of government blacklisting undesirable coins are misplaced.

First consider that the Bitcoin with identifiable coins offers the market more information than the one that does not.   Simply put, a money that provides more information to market is better than one what provides less.

Many people seem to argue this would allow government(s) to blacklist certain coins they deem illegal and then control Bitcoin.  If government were to do this, argue this is simply a soft fork of Bitcoin that would be ignored.  People often talk about forks in the Bitcoin code, but the code is merely the implementation of the social consensus.   It is the social consensus that determines Bitcoin's monetary policy and that is the base layer at which any fork occurs, with the software fork just being incidental and along for the ride.

Suppose government where to open up nodes and hard fork to a Bitcoin that gives them 1M extra coins raising the limit to 22M.  Obviously this fork would be soundly rejected by the community and would flounder.  Now consider that alternatively government owning 1M coins simply decrees that 1M coins owned by others are worthless and illegal to transact with.  This would decrease the supply in this forked representation of Bitcoin and, if accepted increase the percentage of the Bitcoin they own.

This may very well start off as government stripping 1M ""tainted or illegal coins"", but would no doubt continue once it is established that government has this power over Bitcoin's monetary supply.  Soon after, government would create some nonsense reason to blacklist the coins they haven't moved in X years, claiming they are abandoned, of course doing so would be of benefit to the state--increasing the value of their Bitcoins.  This would continue with the state taking more and more of they value of the money supply until it ends in the same disastrous state that always eventually results when governments have control of they money supply.

Of course, I argue that such an attempt would backfire very badly for the state &amp; those who sheepishly obey the command to fork Bitcoin to include only government-approved bitcoins.

Let us look at an often occurring situation where there is some shitty country that has mismanaged it's monetary supply to the point people are starting to use another harder money, such as perhaps the US dollar.  Imagine a situation where you live in such a country and you have half your money in USD and half your money in a rapidly devaluing Tropico Peso.   You would expect to see transactions in the Peso to increase as it drives out the ""good money"" USD--consistent with Gresham's law.  In such a situation, the USD's value would climb relative to the Tropico Peso.  This should be obvious as people would rather hold the dollars and spend the pesos.

Now imagine the Tropico government decreed that it is illegal to transact in dollars.  This would only serve to hasten and magnify the collapse of the Peso, as now people can hold and spend Pesos, but they can ONLY hold dollars.

It is simply the case that the value of a money does not depend very much at all on how much people are able to spend it or willing to accept it, but rather the desire of society as a whole to hold the money as a store of value over.

One such evidence of this fact that was very shocking to me, was the price of Bitcoin immediately after the Silk Road was shut down.  In late 2013, a large percentage of Bitcoin transactions were related to the Silk Road and after this avenue was closed off, the price quickly grew in value.

Therefore when government attempts a GASF, to fork Bitcoin into only government approved bitcoins, they create a situation where people following this fork are going to end up paying a premium for ""clean, government approved"" coins that are allowed to be spent, and a situation where there are ""unclean"" coins that cannot be used to buy things (but can still be held).  Paradoxically I would expect the illegal coins to gain in value as they are being held (and traded in black markets).

Most probably GASF would fail with the market simply rejecting the government's fork attempt, but if it didn't it would inevitably fail later when government continued to meddle with the monetary policy to enrich itself, which would be to the benefit of anyone who ignored government and bought the ""illegal coins"" at a discount.

In short, Bitcoin's monetary policy is determined by social consensus.  Blacklisting coins would be an attempt to fork that consensus and would surely fail causing great economic harm to anyone who followed it.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Credit and Credit Card Guru Advice Needed!,"Hi PF!

I have relatively young credit- just over four years old. I have two credit cards (total credit limit of $5k), three student loans (total left for all three is just over $4,100), and an auto loan ($19k left). I make just under 150k per year. I got married one year ago tomorrow (!), and together we have about $90k savings in just liquid cash, and also retirement accounts/investments worth around $90k. His credit score is north of 820, he makes the same salary I do, has no student loans, and has 8k left on an auto loan, and 3 credit cards with a total limit of around $40k. We want to buy a house this coming year, with 20% down and hopefully the best interest rate available. So:

My credit score is only 685, largely because
 before I began making this salary last year, I had some lean times and had a few medical bills go to collections, and was late on my payments a few times with one of my cards- one card has a 99% on time repayment, the other has 88%. I paid off the items in collections as soon as I was able, but of course they still show. I pay all of our house bills/food on my air miles credit card every month, and pay it off before the interest hits. However, one of the things I'm noticing on my credit monitoring service is that if they update scores before I've paid my CC bill, it looks like I'm using 70-80% of my available credit, which immediately tanks my score. 

To this end: Is it better to open another card, or to apply for a credit limit increase on my current card so my household bills aren't such a large percentage of my available credit? What would provide the most bang for the buck? Is there a certain card that you really like? I owned my previous vehicle outright, and only bought this car I have now because I'd hoped adding another account/payment to my credit profile would increase my scores. It has, but it hasn't been as impactful as I hoped. I really want to raise my score to the 750 range in the next year before we start mortgage shopping, if that's possible. Any tips you have on that kind of revamp would be so appreciated!!

I was raised to be really careful/conservative with money and save up for things, so I feel really confident about our financial situation/future and budgeting, but I was never taught anything about credit, and the whole thing is such a stressful mystery to me. I'm really scared that my screwups while life was hard are going to cost us tons of money in additional interest over the life of our home loan. 

I'll take any tips you've got, or recommendations for financial planners or experts I can pay in this field!

I have about $80k private loans and about $20k federal loans left in student debt.  I have yet to try and refinance my student loans, but was wondering how difficult the process is if I wanted to release my father as a cosigner in the process of refinancing.  I have been paying off my loans for a little over 2 years now with no late payments, credit karma says my credit score is 679, while Experian says my FICO score is 735.  These could be better, but I've yet to get a credit card, so the only thing really affecting my scores are my loan payments, I guess?

I am constantly getting mail from lenders saying that I qualify for certain interest rates while refinancing loans, but I'm not sure if that is the rate I would get or the rate that I would get if my father continued to cosign with me?  I just want to release him from MY loans.

Also, I had another quick question.  My private loans are currently just a bunch of different loans that I can pay off and close to lower my monthly payments.  If I refinance can I keep my loans divided up like this?  Or do I have to bundle them all up?  That would just lock me into a single monthly payment for the duration of the repayment period, which doesn't seem ideal.",finance

personalfinance,Where to get/collect data on Real-Estate-Value based on region? (Germany),"Hello reddit,

since interest-rates are at an all-time low inside de EU, especially germany I am concerned about my savings loosing significant worth. I am planning on investing in real estate. More specifically, I have an offer for two houses in a more rural region in Germany.

Financial experts however often advise AGAINST going for real estate outside city-regions or at least very close to cities because figures show, that the worth of those objects is dropping over time. However, my family, as well as friends’ families have been investing and are investing into real estate in our region, now seeing first profits which are pretty solid, especially compared to the low interest-rates mentioned earlier.

I now would like to do the math myself. However, doing some research over the last days, I was unable to find any usable data. German Federal Buerau of Statistics provide time series for different types of real estate like this: 

[https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online?sequenz=tabelleErgebnis&amp;selectionname=61262-0001](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online?sequenz=tabelleErgebnis&amp;selectionname=61262-0001) 

   
 

However, there is no data to have a closer look at individual regions. The index across Germany is pretty much useless since real estate in cities gaining +150% worth over 5 years could easily outweigh real estate in rural regions loosing 30% and show as an overall 50% plus in those indices. 

Data for individual regions is provided by websites like “immoscout”, however there is a high probability this data is biased since their business is pretty much selling real estate…

Also, many district offices provide an overall price-index for their district, however only for the current year and maybe the last year, so generating a meaningful time series is no possible.

I am looking for a way to get data on the value of real estate in a selected region of Germany over time, to do the math myself. Does anyone have an idea?",finance

investing,The 200 year bond,"So let's start with doing a short NPV calculation for bond: how much a bond should cost.   We are going  to lend a company $1000 at 10% interest for 3 years.   We'll call this company Y.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Year**|**Payout**|**Risk free NPV value (2%)**|**Including duration risk (3%)**|**Including credit risk (8%)**|**To get 5% risk adjusted return (11.3%)**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**1**|100|98.04|97.09|92.59|89.85|
|**2**|100|96.12|94.26|85.73|80.73|
|**3**|1100|1036.55|1006.66|873.22|797.82|
|**Total (intrinsic value)**|**$1300**|$**1230.71**|**$1198.00**|**$1051.54**|**$968.40**|

In the first column we have the payouts we expect to get from Y.    If there was absolutely no risk and we could call in our money at any point lend to them like we would lend to a bank in a savings account at say a 2% rate, we arrive at a value for our future stream of payments of $1230.71.   An instant 23.1% return on our $1000, a terrific return!

But of course this is not a savings account.  Y is going to hold our money for 3 years.  During that time we won't have use of it even if we need the money.  We'd have to incur the expense and risk of selling the debt.  So we charge Y a duration penalty.  Say we make this only 1% since 3 years isn't that long.  That doesn't change the numbers too much and our bond to X is worth $1198.  Still a terrific return on our $1000 loan.

But Y is not the Federal Government.  There is a chance Y isn't going to pay us.  We estimate the chance that X defaults at 5%.  We need to include that in the risk in the calculation.   We arrive at a valu eof $1051.54.  We are still profitable but we are making 5.2% on our money over 3 years or about a 1.7% annual return risk adjusted.

That's not good enough.  We wanted a risk adjusted return of 5%.  I can get more than a 1.7% risk adjusted return from a savings account!  So instead of working this forwards we will work this backwards.  To get a 5% risk adjusted return we need to add 3.3% to the 1.7% we got from the loan, pushing our effective interest rate to 11.3%.   Well at 11.3% our loan can only be for $968.40 not the full $1000.  So we tell Y we are happy to lend them $1000 but we are going to need a $31.60 loan inception fee and they can pay that separately or add it to the principal of the loan and adjust the payments up by 3.16%.

OK hopefully you knew all that and were bored.  Now let's change the terms of the loan to Y.   Assume instead of Y a new company  X needs to borrow the money for a very long time.  X doesn't expect an immediate return on their investment.   They are going to use the money to grow their business and then plow all of the returns from the growth right back into the business over and over.  So the terms are much further out:. for the first 50 years X is not going to pay us at all.  But for years 51-200  X is going to pay us 100x what they originally agreed to $1000, and they are going to grow the payments by 5% annually.  And on top of all that because X's earning will grow inflation adjusted X will agree to inflation adjust the payments.  to us in turn.

They want to know how much they can borrow under those terms.  We still see X as risky with a 5% of business failure every year.  We aren't going to even start getting money for 50 years.   On the other hand $1000 in payments for 150 years inflation adjusted and growing by 5% is worth a ton.  Let's assume the risk of default on our loan were only 1% after the 50 years,  X's business wouldn't be risky then, so they are much more likely to defaults early or not at all.  On the other hand 150 years is a long time and a 1% chance per year still means they have a 78% of defaulting even if they make it through the first risky 50 years.  We do need to still charge them some credit risk.  With inflation adjustment however we can set the extra duration risk to 0% to make the loan more attractive.   We still have a 1% credit risk.  So at year 51 we figure that $1000 inflation adjusted at only a 1% credit risk is worth **$100,000 inflation adjusted**. At $100,000 we get our 5% inflation adjusted return + 1% risk in exchange for the $1000 payment.

The only issue X has to make it all the way to year 51.  The whole thing is inflation adjusted so there is no duration risk.  There is 5% credit risk and in the meanwhile we lose access to the money.  So let's charge X the cash return rate (2%) plus the 5% credit risk for a total of 7%.  At 7% what is $100,000 worth 50 years from now?  Well $3394.78.  And that's what we agree to lend X.

The structure of the loan is simple.   are going to lend them $3.4k and much later they are going to pay us back $1k / yr,  all inflation adjusted.  That might seem like we are charging X too much but let's remember the facts.   During the first 50 years they have a 92.3% (5% over 50 years) chance of going out of business and we lose everything.  In exchange for that though every year they don't go out of business and are looking good,  their chance of making it all the way goes up.  Because we can sell the loan for more money,  we earn a 7% inflation adjusted paper capital gain year after year after year.  If we don't realize the gain it is just paper but as long as X is healthy the loan continues to perform.  Now of course new information is going to come in about X's business prospects during those 50 years, whether they got worse or better.     For example if some little fact came in right after we issued the loan that made X only 4% likely to default the loan becomes worth $5428.84 an instant 60% capital gain.  If on the other hand a new competitor entered and X's chances of default went up to only 6% our loan would only be worth $2132.12 an instant 37% capital loss.   Even slight changes will have an enormous impact on the value of our loan.

Now with a 92.3% chance of default we certainly wouldn't want to invest too much money into X.  We would want to hold a diversified portfolio of these loans if we could.  Some of the business would do better than expected, some would do worse.  But the diversified portfolio would gain 7% inflation adjusted per year if we choose our loans well.

As we got to year 51 things would still be as unstable but less.   Our loan would not be worth $3394.78, it would be worth $100k.  We would be getting a nice $1k from X, but still most of the value of the loan is in the future growth.  The value of the loan would still be highly dependent on X's business prospects.  If X was likely to only grow the loan at 4% inflation adjusted our loan would decrease in intrinsic value to $50k, a 50% loss.  If X's chance of default became trivial over the next 20 years our loan would shoot up in value 33%.  That's less volatile than before but still rather volatile.   The year to year volatility on the market price of X's loan would overwhelm the $1k payment we were getting.  It would be quite easy to forget that it is the $1k payment that makes the loan have any value at all and focus on the year to year gyrations in X's prospects.   But in the end what ties X's business to the price of the loan is the question of whether X will be able to keep making payments or not.  With perfect knowledge of X's loan payments we could perfect estimate the intrinsic value of X's loan at any point and time.   We could buy loans when they are selling below intrinsic value and sell them when they going for more than their intrinsic value.  With imperfect  knowledge we are going to have to do estimates and some some guessing but the principle doesn't change much.  Different people will have different estimates based on their imperfect information and the loan market will determine a price at which the buyers and sellers of X's loans will even out as information becomes available.

One more thing that doesn't change.  If I call the loan to Y ""stock"", call the interest payment a ""dividend"",  call my initial loan an ""IPO"" and change loan market to ""stock market"" none of the math above changes at all.  A stock is worth exactly the discounted value of the future stream of dividends.   That's literally a tautology.",finance
personalfinance,FEIE investment planning,"Good morning PF,


I have a few questions about my options with investing while also being under the foreign earned income exclusion. Some quick background prior to. My wife and I work as contractors for the DOD at a military installation overseas. We are projected to make around 185k from work income in addition to 25k that is tax exempt (VA comp).

1. My work provides a 401k with no match. I will most likely max the contribution limit early as I have no debt besides a mortgage and the interest rate is not too high. The plan also indicates I can contribute 25% of my base earning per pay period with after tax contributions that can not exceed 56k per year. My question is since my income isnt taxed, can I still contribute that 25% after tax amount? What would it be classified under?

2. With question 1 in mind, does it make sense to even contribute to a 401k or go for a taxable brokerage instead? I know the wife and I cannot contribute to an IRA so our options are limited in investment. I have a rough estimate that together we will be able to put roughly 80k in taxable accounts after 401ks are funded and projected bills paid for by the end of the year.

personalfinance,IRA Question(s): Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA if you are over the income limit to claim a deduction for a traditional IRA contribution,"This (2019) is my first year contributing to an IRA and working a job with enough income to have to file federal taxes (never had to do state either since I was in a state with no state income tax). Filing single/unmarried.

This year I contributed $6000 to my traditional IRA but I didn't realize there was an annual income limit to make tax deductible contributions. 

I'm not 100% sure if I'm understand how traditional IRAs work correctly. 

The way I understand it is that I get my money from my employer which is taxed and then I put that money into my IRA and then claim that on my taxes which lowers the taxable income I report on my tax return for the year which will then in turn affect how much I owe/get refunded.

However, if I'm above the income limit for a traditional IRA deduction then I can't claim it as a deduction, but I still have to pay taxes when I withdraw it in the future. So since I didn't get a deduction in the first place, I'm essentially just paying taxes twice which isn't very helpful?

In contrast if I put it into a Roth IRA then I pay taxes on the income but I don't pay when I take it out so I'm only paying once?

This brings me to 2 questions:

1. Is there any benefit to using a traditional IRA if I am over the deduction income limit?

2. If there's not, can I rollover my traditional IRA into a Roth without paying taxes since I haven't claimed a deduction for the traditional IRA contribution on my taxes yet?

Granted, I only worked half the year starting in July so my salary is effectively halved so I think I might be OK to just claim the deduction for 2019 since I don't think I made enough to go over the deduction income limit between Jan. to end of 2019. Also my company offered a retirement plan (401k) but I was not allowed to contribute until Jan. 1 of 2020, so I don't think this counts as being covered by a retirement plan since I wasn't able to contribute even though my company offered it (which means there isn't an deduction income limit, I think?).

Finally, if I work with the same salary for a full year in 2020, I will definitely be over the deduction contribution limit (75k I think?) and I am contributing to my 401k so I'll definitely be considered covered by an employer retirement plan this year (2020). In that case, I should just use a Roth IRA for this year right (2020)?

I tried to make a reasonable effort to research this, but I wanted to make sure I'm thinking about this the right way and I'm not misunderstanding something badly.

We came out owing about $225 Federal Tax but are wanting to see our best option on the state taxes. 

My wife has 2 W-2s, both paying state taxes to GA. I have 1 W2 when i was still in GA that i paid state taxes to GA. When i was in MS I worked for a company and paid $0 state taxes. During the time i lived here I had to get a drivers license and had a MS address. I tried 2 different options on TT.  

**OPTION 1**

Filing as GA residents. I believe we are allowed to do this because of the MSRRA law. Doing this we end up owing about $1450 state taxes to GA. 

**OPTION 2**

Filing part-year residency. My wifes info shows she was a GA resident all year long. And mine is showing GA as the previous and MS as the state of residency. Im assuming this means that I am the one filing part year residency and my wife is still considered a GA resident. Doing it this way our GA refund is $35. And we only owe MS $835.

personalfinance,Buying a property in a booming housing market - High mortgage vs low mortgage,"I'm 29, living in The Netherlands with my 25 year old girlfriend. I work as a software engineer and she's a hotel receptionist. Combined we make about 110k euros a year. Right now we're renting in Amsterdam paying about 2k a month including utility bills, we have 20k in savings not including pension funds. No other debts or payments.

We want to start a family soon and buy a house. In The Netherlands you can get a 100% mortgage with a 1.5% interest rate set for 10 years, which to me explains the increasing prices. It worries me that the low interest rate and 100% loans is what is driving up the prices and that it might be a bubble, but we are planning to live here for many years to come so the risk should be somewhat mitigated by the long term nature of this purchase.

I met with a mortgage advisor and he calculated that we can get a mortgage of about 610k euros which would be enough to get us in a nice enough house in a good neighbourhood. On the other hand, there is an option to get a house that's a bit further away from the city (up to 1 hr commute) for about 300k. It would be in a less attractive neighbourhood but still safe and close enough to the big cities.

My main concern is that I want our children to grow up in a decent area with good schools and that we have enough room in the house for an expanding family, while not getting into an unmanageable house loan.

Which mortgage should we take?

The higher mortgage means we have higher monthly payments but we will be living in a good area and enjoying life a little bit more. And assuming prices go up over time, end up with a more valuable property.

The lower mortgage means we can have lower monthly payments, possibly term it to 15 years and put more money into savings, but live in an area that's not as good. If prices go up over time we would end up with a less valuable property.",finance

personalfinance,[paywall] NYT article about how the changing economic reality impacts standard budgeting advice,"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/smarter-living/does-personal-finance-still-work-in-our-changing-economy.html

This is well written and well researched. The story talks about the changing American economy and how lots of “standard” personal finance advice doesn’t work for a huge segment of the population. People have fluctuating incomes, debts at moderate to low interest rates that take decades to pay off, wage growth is nearly flat, and all of this combined makes sticking to the standard advice difficult if not impossible. There’s some advice in here, mostly focused on not identifying target numbers as a goal but in building a habit of savings.

personalfinance,Should I temporarily stop contributing to my 401k to pay off student loans if I have a vested pension?,"I am a 39 yo divorced woman with no kids. My pension just vested after five years with the state government.  If I work until 67 I will take home 80% of my salary per month, plus health care for myself and my spouse should I have one. 

I also contribute $1k a month to 401k (after reading these forums I know I should have opted for a 457). The balance is currently $48k.I also have $22k invested in betterment from a home sale and a $4500 saving account. 

I rent in a HCOL area and don’t have many bills, but I do have about $50k in student loans that are various interest rates of 4-7%.

If I stop contributing to my 401k (no matching). I figure I can pay off the student loans in two years. Since I have a pension, I am thinking this might be a good idea. I can go back to contributing after the loans are paid off. Otherwise, I will be paying the student loans for 5-6 more years.",finance

personalfinance,Next step advice,"Hi all! Looking for some advice on financial next steps for my boyfriend and I. We’re in our late 20s, currently renting in a city we only like (not love) but our current jobs are great for us at the moment/gaining experience in our careers while living at the beach. We’re debating on buying a home when our lease ends in June. I’m nervous about buying, I don’t want to be stuck here with a mortgage if we decide to move again. I also don’t like the idea of throwing money away while renting. We’ve discussed staying here for the next 5-7 years, so buying makes sense but we’re also in about $10,000 credit card debt between us and I have a $15,000 school loan so I don’t feel like we’ll get the best interest rate. We also have virtually nothing saved. Haven’t been preapproved by a lender yet but I don’t want to get stuck in a large mortgage and hinder my ability to pay more on my credit card. My boyfriend is considering taking money out of his retirement for a down payment, I don’t think that’s a good idea...

Any advice on whether it’d be stupid to buy or if we should? Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Question: I have an USDA home loan... can I refinance or anything with them to build an addition?,"I bought my home 4-5 years ago and was able to get a USDA loan for the house.. the current loan is for about 104k.... the home value is at least 200k (I was told I could sell from 200k-220k depending on how fast I’d like it to be on market).....

I am strongly considering just building an addition to the house to better fit our growing family. I’ve got an estimate from a licensed contractor and he puts the addition, with a new roof (is over 20years old) and new siding (multiple holes in current siding) at 35k....

I am excellent credit, since buying my house I’ve gotten married and am a stay at home mom. My husband works. He doesn’t have good credit (one hospital bill from yearsss ago is 8k in collections), although I’ve added him to my credit cards so it is better than it was and shows on time payments and such.

I’m curious to what the best and most affordable route is to go about doing this....

We have plenty of equity to put as collateral clearly.

Can I just add the addition into my USDA loan as I have a great interest rate with them? Would getting a home equity loan separate be smarter? Where do I start?!

personalfinance,Is a CD right for me?,"I'm kind of looking into putting my money into something that earns a little more interest than my savings account. Right now I have about $25,000 between my checking account and money market savings account, which earns 0.05%. I'm looking at a 1 year CD with Sallie Mae that has a 2.1% interest rate. I don't have any debt, I have a stable job, and don't think I will have to dip into savings in the foreseeable future, but then again, I can't predict what can happen in the future with possible emergencies. I just feel that I may as well earn a little bit of more money when I'm sitting on it. If I do get a CD, I'm debating on if I should invest 15k or 20k. I'm leaning towards 20k because of course I will earn more and will still have 5k in emergency savings, but investing 15k and having a 10k emergency fund will give me greater peace of mind.

personalfinance,Paying off my car loan...or not.,"There's about $6k left on my car loan, financed at 1.99% percent. On the asset side, I've got about $27k in emergency funds, made up of cash and conservative investments in a Roth IRA. At my current lifestyle, this would last me about 8 months, but if I cut it down to the essentials, it could last 10 easily. 

Previously, I wasn't concerned about paying the car loan off early, especially when interest rates were higher and my emergency fund was paying 2.2% against the 1.99%. However, now that rates have dipped and the Fed doesn't seem too keen on raising them significantly, I'm wondering whether I should just take $6k out of my EF and pay the stupid thing off. I could then take the monthly payments of about $240 and put it towards retirement.

This would also mean shaving down my EF from 10 months to 9.

Problem with that is, due to a series of stupid mistakes on my part at work, there is a not-insignificant chance that I will be losing my job in the next 6-12 months. I have been threatened with being put on a PIP on more than one occasion (which in my company, means you have already been fired -- we just need a better paper trail to justify it.)

Is this loss of one month's living expenses worth it in this scenario? It feels frustrating to have debt hanging around that I could easily pay off, and a bunch of cash sitting in an EF that could be generating higher returns elsewhere. But at the same time, I kind of want my parachute to be as big as possible when I get pushed off the plane.",finance

personalfinance,Conflicting numbers from W4 calculator. Help!,"Hi everyone! Trying to make this as short and concise as possible. Husband and I (both 33) got married at the end of 2018. We changed our filing status to Married 0 for our jobs at the beginning of 2019 because we thought we had to. (Big mistake!) long story short we are gonna owe 6K federal and 800 to the state. We’re trying to figure out how to fix this for next year.

My job: $69779 gross. Between my pension and 403(b) I will contribute $8722 pretax. My last pay period ended 1/15. Paid semi-monthly and had $256 taken in federal taxes. (Same for YTD since it’s my first 2020 paycheck)

My job #2: (quit last year, received one final paycheck from extra time I was being paid out) $2533 gross. $114 pretax to my pension. Held the job 1/1-1/4. Paid $220 in federal tax. 

Husband Job #1: $54415 gross. He contributes $5441 pretax for his pension and $3458 pretax for medical. His last pay period ended 1/4. Paid biweekly and had $133 taken in federal taxes. (Same YTD).

Husband Job #2: $21528 gross. He contributes $1184 pretax to 414(h). His last pay period ended 1/4. Paid biweekly and had $32 taken in federal taxes. (Same YTD).

No other credits, taking the standard deduction. 

When I put the numbers into the IRS calculator it says we’ll be under $3924.

Then it says I need to withhold $145 more from my paycheck. Husband Job #1 needs $63 more from his paycheck. Husband Job #2 needs $0 from his paycheck. 

Here is where I’m confused: when I take $3924/22 pay periods (this probably wouldn’t take effect until my Feb 15 paycheck) I get $178 per paycheck. (But the two numbers above equal $208). But when I download the prefilled form it’s saying $236 extra? I want to withhold from my check only, and make sure I’m withholding enough!

Also, how does overtime get calculated into federal withholding? Husband gets overtime opportunities sporadically throughout the year ($3800 last year). And I can start overtime once I get off training in another month (could be another $7000 or more a year) Should I withhold extra to cover that too?

personalfinance,Best arrangement of investments and liabilities - goal of $50k/yr passive income in 5 years,"Hello!  I am trying to figure out how best to arrange my investments to achieve an ultimate goal of $50k passive income in &lt;5 years.

As it stands now I have the following

&amp;#x200B;

Capital:

* Investment property: $600k
* Stocks: $120k
* Retirement (IRA): $165k
* Owner occupied property: $700k
* Cash on hand: $20k + $150k pending invoices

&amp;#x200B;

Liabilities:

* Investment loan: $320k @ 4%pa
* Home loan: $450k @ 3.85%pa

&amp;#x200B;

Cashflow:

* Income: $250k/yr (net)
* Investment property: $18k/yr
* Loan repayments: -$50,000/yr

&amp;#x200B;

I have several thoughts of how to proceed but not sure which would provide the best to achieve my goal or more importantly achieve it as quickly as possible:

1. Grow stock portfolio at equal rate to reduction of investment property liabilities
2. Move everything to pay off investment liabilities - then sink all future passive income into stocks
3. Pay minimum off investment property liabilities (net zero - no profit/no loss) and invest substantially into stock

I'm leaning more towards 1 &amp; 3 as interest rates are slow low but 10 years is not a long horizon for stock market and a correction would kill it.

Some other tid-bits:

* Investment property bought in 2006 for \~$260k - capital growth has been fantastic overall.
* I've only been investing in stocks \~12 months and have returned 40% for 2019 with one pre-ipo providing 1000% gain (don't expect same results in the future).
* An investment of \~$75k into the investment property would likely allow an increase in rent by approx. $7500pa

My target goal for $50k passive relies on the following:

Expected rental income: $21,000

Expected stock return: $30,000\*

\* assuming dividends and profit taking through sale of stock (e.g. maintain capital at $400k and assume 7.25% returns).

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

personalfinance,Cash on hand sitting in a high-yield savings account: lump invest? hold some? pay down mortgage?,"Some background: 

I currently max out my 401k, do the mega-backdoor Roth, and max out my HSA account.  A recent job switch resulted in a big signing bonus, higher base salary, and big end-of-year bonus.  I now find myself with \~150k sitting in a high-yield savings account (variable rate, but averaging \~2%).  I also have a 15-year conventional loan on my house for \~215k at a 3.125% interest rate.  I'm in my 3rd year of paying on the loan with \~189k still outstanding.  With regards to the amortization schedule, my current payments cover \~$500 interest and \~$1,000 principal.

My thoughts/concerns:

I've thoughts about putting down a big principal payment on my house, but the interest rate is so low, I'm reluctant to do so, especially considering how well the market has been doing.  I've also thought about putting a big lump sum into the market (e.g. mutual funds, ETFs, passive index funds), but this seemingly never-ending bull run and impending recession has spooked me from lump-sum investing so much when the market is already so high.  I've also thought about stockpiling my high-yield savings account and waiting for the market to inevitably drop and then doing a lump-sum injection into the market.  I know it's impossible to ""time"" the market, but it just seems very risky for me to invest such a huge sum of cash right now considering how high the market is and how seemingly close we are to a recession.  I'm leaning towards doing a mixture of all 3; maybe \~100k principal payment on my house, \~40k into the market, and keep \~10k in my high-yield savings account.

personalfinance,"16k in student debt, starting graduate school, planning to pay off a big chunk early on with savings?","Hello r/PersonalFinance!

I am finishing up my time as an undergraduate shortly and have lots of plans for loan repayment, setting up a Roth IRA, and managing my finances as I head to graduate school for the next two years. I could use some general feedback critique on what my current plans of action are and if there's anything I could be doing better/helpful suggestions/etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**General Background**

\- I am 22, female

\- Finishing undergrad with 16k in debt

\- Have 12k put away in the bank.

\- I already own a car that runs great/isn't old as dirt

\- Immediately going to get my Master's starting fall 2020 (in ecology/biology, so I will probably never be rolling in money). Tuition will be waived for grad school and I will be making an additional 21-24k a year as a research assistant in a state with a very low cost of living (southern united states)

&amp;#x200B;

**Retirement Savings:**

\- I would like to open up a Roth IRA before starting graduate school

\- Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab are all recommended here but I was most inclined to go with a Vanguard Target Retirement fund (sometime around 2060-2065) as I would prefer an portfolio that does most of the legwork for me/is pretty hands off and is diverse. I'm not looking to do anything particularly high risk with my money right now so I prefer a bit of a ""safer"" option. *Does this seem like the way to go?*

&amp;#x200B;

**Student Loans**

\- **16.3k total**, all federal loans, no private. 4.5% average interest rate.

1) 5.5k subsidized, 5.05% interest

2.) 4.5k subsidized, 4.45% interest

3.) 4k subsidized, 4.125% interest

4.) 2.1k is **unsubsidized,** 4.125% interest

\- Though I can continue to defer my loans through graduate school (which I will start before my 6 month grace period is over), I would like to attempt to pay off as much of my loans as possible before I start accruing any interest. As I have 12k in the bank right now, I was thinking that in addition to putting a chunk in a Roth IRA (maybe 1k or so) I will try to pay off about half my student loans (7-8k) with what I already have in savings, leaving me with about 3-4k still in the bank to start graduate school with. *Thoughts?*

\- Even though my goal is to pay off my student loans before I ever enter my repayment period, I felt that if necessary, an IBR (income based repayment plan) would be the best option if I needed to go there. *Would you guys recommend a different backup plan?*

&amp;#x200B;

**Living Expenses**

\- Will be living in a very low cost of living state starting in April, immediately after I graduate

\- I will be living with my  partner paying between 300-500$ a month for rent.

\- I am a light eater and buy cheap and generally pay between 80 and 150$ a month for groceries right now living in a high cost of living state, so that could go down even further.

\- Medical, car, and phone still being paid by parents for now though that could change in the next year or two.

&amp;#x200B;

**Overview/TLDR**

\- 16k in debt, 12k in savings. Want to put 1k in a Roth IRA and pay off 7-8k of student debt before graduate school. I will NOT be acquiring more debt in grad school. Does seem like a good balance/way to go?

MY QUESTION: Does it make more sense to try and negotiate a lower interest rate with my various credit cards (and thus be unable to put any future expenses on them) once my paychecks start coming in, or should I try to get a loan to pay them off immediately and just make payments towards that? If a loan makes more sense, do I wait a few months until my credit score rebounds thanks to my new income, or will it not affect the interest rate as much? I want to put some money aside each month in my checking account so an unexpected expense doesn't force me to use the CCs again, but should I start with the 0% interest card instead so that can be my ""fallback"" if something does come up? Eg: I'd pay down all of my credit cards to the greatest extent possible without overdrawing my checking account, and just use the 0% interest card if something unexpected comes up before I can zero that balance out? 

Yes, I know I've been stupid with my finances. I'm trying to dig out of the hole of unemployment/bills and get to a place where my checking/savings have an emergency fund. Please help, thanks in advance!!",finance
personalfinance,When is it worth cashing EE bonds?,"As mentioned in the question, when is it worth cashing EE bonds? From my understanding (correct me if I’m wrong) if you have a $100 EE bond, you buy it for $50 and it will accumulate interest for the first 20 years and if it hasn’t hit $100 by year 20, the value of the bond will automatically move to $100. Then from year 20 to 30, it will still accumulate interest.

I have 6 bonds that have already hit that 20 year mark and a few more that still have yet to hit it.

Thus should I cash out the ones that have already hit the 20 year mark as they all have interest rates &lt;2%?",finance
personalfinance,Financing for dependent mother leaving domestic violence situation,"Hello,

My mother, who has a psychiatric condition, is leaving a long-running domestic violence tainted relationship from another state. She previously collected social security benefits and federal or local government paid for half of her rent.

I'd like to put her in a home I own in the MD area and would like assistance from the government for utilities and cost to keep her there.

May I charge her the fair market value of the house without being rejected or affecting her benefits?

If not, what are my options? Open to any advice. In addition, I assume she will be eligible for EBT assistance for food, etc. regardless, correct?

Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,[California] How to figure out the best insurance company for identical plans and similar pricing?,"I am planning in getting Medicare supplement, plan F, F high deductible, or plan G.

I am planning on going with one of the major companies, blue shield, blue cross, Anthem, Aetna, United healthcare, or Cigna.

A volunteer group at my college submits state and federal tax loans. The past two years they said I dont owe any taxes and I dont get anything back.

investing,Thoughts on long term put option on SPY etf?,Low interest rates created a corporate debt and likely consumer debt bubble. FICO scores are changing to more negatively affect people with rising debt levels and people who fall behind on their payments leading many of the consumers who have been financing their their lifestyles with debt because wages have remained stagnant and the cost of living has increased dramatically to likely be unable to get loans and have to default. Same with corporations. Around 13% of corporations are zombie corporations that are only able to pay off the Interest on their loans. If interest rates rise the harsher lending standards that will be forced on consumers and corporations will likely lead to the bubble popping as people can’t continue to use cheap money to finance their lifestyles. And lending standards have been decreasing since ~2015 so it’s probably exaggerated just like the subprime loan crisis. And idk much about the derivatives that are traded on corporate or consumer debt but considering that there are student loan derivatives (which will only add to the problem) I have a feeling that there is a lot of money being bet that the economy will keep going up up up. I know market timing is generally frowned upon in traditional value investing but it’s an idea.,finance

personalfinance,Have been paying student loan in collections for four years...get aggressive on payments or ask to settle?,"I was served a court summons four years ago by a debt collection agency on behalf of the student loan I defaulted on. I arrived at court only to have to the judge agree that I should pay $20,000 on a $10,000 original balance (an extra ten thousand for ""lawyer's fees"".) The judge did agree that I should make payments equivalent to my federal loan (since paid off, early!) - $140 a month - and ordered against wage garnishment.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been paying dutifully since that date to these debt collectors. My payments have increased to $240 a month and I have been hit by the lightning bolt of urgency in paying off this debt. I am upping my payments to $800 a month, took another job, and expect a raise/promotion in the next few months. I have extremely limited living expenses and have cut back anywhere I could.

&amp;#x200B;

This post is less about cutting expenses to throw at the debt and more about **how to negotiate a settlement with the debt collector**. They do not send me a monthly balance - I have to call, which is stressful enough. I am feeling BOLD. I have $6,000 max I can offered them on the current $17,018 balance. This is roughly 35% of the debt.

&amp;#x200B;

When calling, do I just say ""I can offer you $6,000 and I need that in writing?"" If they refuse, will they suddenly pursue garnishment? Will they call my employer? I feel this like offer will trigger them to take action again. I never hear from them, I just send the money and call in when I am not quaking in my boots. I refuse to be intimidated anymore. I would like to approach them about a settlement and if they refuse, I will continue to pay and pay aggressively. I am also aware of the tax implications of this. It is no longer on my credit report.

&amp;#x200B;

I am so overwhelmed by the logistics of this. Does anyone have any experience? I would gratefully appreciate your input and thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Collections Advice Needed,"Hi! I just got notified on the 12th by a collections agency from Sequium that they are sending me to collections. I've looked up ways to dispute this and just wanted advice from you all. I'm not even sure if it was a validation notice as it was an email asking me to review this information if it is me attempting communication from a debt collector.

I currently live overseas due to federal employment and this ""debt"", from 2019 is claimed from my old internet company, Cox. Apparently, I was charged an equipment charge for $122.00, but I have PDF Bill Reports stating that I am not getting charged for any equipment rental and just purely for internet because I was using my own router now.

I was renting a router with them in the earlier 2019, but returned it and was using my own router. I don't have the receipt for the returned router, but I do have proof that I'm not getting charged for the rental anymore if you look at the bills and I'm sure somewhere within the account it shows that I'm using a unique router of my own. I'm sitting here thinking about how they can even charge me for an equipment that they took out themselves on the bill because I have my own router.

I've read the flow chart and it seems I should send a debt validation letter to the collection agency? This is obviously going to take some time as well as I live overseas working on a military installation. This is very annoying because when I left and canceled service, I was assured of 0 charges and nothing left behind, yet here we are again.

Is there a good debt validation letter anywhere I can use to send or refute? I've read that if they don't respond in 30 days then any debt is cleared and settled.

Is there any advice or guidance anyone can provide me? This situation has happened to me before when I was active duty and I was heavily burdened. Thank you for listening to the rant.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Live overseas, federal employee, work on military installation, and sent to collections 12 Jan 2020. Debt is Equipment Charge from Internet Company, from 2019. I have billed reports saying I'm only getting charged for internet because you removed the rental charge from me when I have already returned the router and am using my own router.

personalfinance,Young Professional Looking for What I am Missing or Could Do Better with My Income,"Long time lurker but first time poster. I wanted to get your thoughts on what could be doing better with my money or if there is anything I might be missing. 

I am 26 years old and was lucky enough to get a great paying job in a low-cost city immediately out of college. Because of this, my current financial situation is as follows:

Liquidity:
• Yearly salary around $205k per year which gives me ~$11k per month take-home pay after taxes, retirement, etc.
• ~$6k in my checking account (After bills and spending, I invest the rest to keep it around this amount)
• $16k in a HYSA for an emergency fund (this may seem low with my morgage, but I figured I can always pull out of my brokerage account if needed) 
• $91k in a brokerage account with Vanguard (all in VTI). I am currently adding ~$5k per month to this account on average

Retirement:
As a note, I recently changed employers about a year and half ago which is why some of the numbers below might seem strange

• $37k in Roth 401k (I max every year) invested in 50% S&amp;P 500, 25% growth, and 25% international  stock
• $81k in Roth IRA invested in VTSAX (not contributing to this any longer) 
• $137k in pre-tax IRA (I max every year) invested in VTI. I could do a backdoor conversion to a Roth IRA with Vanguard each year, but I just haven’t bothered much with doing the rollover as I figured it would give me a little diversification since my 401k is now a Roth
• Great pension program with my current employer that would essentially cover all of my retirement costs if I can commit to staying there until normal retirement age. I haven’t been taking this into account when looking at my assets since a lot of things can change in 35years but just a note


Liabilities:
• $295k in debt on my home with a 30-year morgage of $2.6k per month (I currently get $1k per month rent from my girlfriend so my expenses are $1.6k per month for my morgage)
• Monthly car payment of $494 which will be paid off in 17months
• No other debt (credit cards, education, etc.)
• Bills usually come out to ~$400-600 per month (phone, electricity, gas, water, internet, insurance) 
• Usually ~$1-2k per month in other expenses such as food, gas, hobbies, and stuff for the house. This number is slowly going down with time as the house is getting fully furnished.

The home interest rate is 4%, and I do not have any PMI as I had put down 20% for the home. I have been avoiding paying more on the home each month as I figured I could get a better return in the market with the money and would reap the benefits of writing off the interest. Also, the home is zoned to good schools and is big enough to grow into as we build a family, so I do not see myself moving unless our jobs require it.

Other Information: 
As well, my fiancé has roughly the same income as me. She is fairly frugal with her money. I don’t press her too much in regards to money, and she maxes her 401k every year and has a brokerage account. She has an emergency fund set up and does not have any debt either. 

Goals:
There are a few major upgrades to the home that we would like to do in the near-term (add a pool, back porch with outdoor kitchen) that will be ~$70k. These costs will be split between me and my fiancé.  

I would also like the option to retire as early as possible even if I decide to keep working. I am still a little unsure what that income requirement would be per month since I am sure it changes with kids, but I would assume $4-5k per month once the home is paid off. 

Summary:
Like I mentioned, I usually have ~$5k remaining each month after all bills are paid that I am investing in my brokerage account under VTI. My current thoughts are to keep funneling money into my brokerage account until I can pay off the house (5 years at this rate assuming no return in the market) but to keep the money growing in the market unless there is a better alternative.  We will plan to have kids one day (probably 5 years from now) at which point I will begin setting up a college fund in their name as well. After that, I’ll just keep working and saving money until I decide to make a change. Is this the strategy you would recommend to meet my goals above?

Since I am fairly young and have quite a bit of disposable income left over each month, I figured any small changes now can have a pretty large impact on my long-term financial future. Please let me know if I missed anything, and any feedback would be great!",finance
personalfinance,My employer is posted a job at my position but with a salary range higher than what I make,"I work in IT for a large company. My team has been understaffed for years, and management has finally gotten the ok for new positions on my team. 

I just stumbled upon a job posting, equivalent to mine, but the pay range for it is above what I make. I’m the “team lead” for my team and have been leading mostly overpaid contractors for the last couple years. I’m also the expert for our very specialized application, so anyone new is going to be trained by me. What can I do about this?

To add to my rage at this situation, I asked to get a raise about a year ago. Ultimately, after waiting for months, I was told it wasn’t going to happen. I’m well respected at my company, and get praise from both my direct management and other teams as an integral cog who makes our machine go. I don’t see why management would OK new positions at a higher pay rate to bring in people they know nothing about our systems when the won’t equally pay someone who has been performing at a high level for the last few years. 

Looking for any suggestions on how to go forward.

Also, sorry for any bad grammar or formatting. I’m on mobile and quite pissed at the moment.



Edit: Well this post blew up more than I expected! Thank you all for the continued advice. I can’t answer everyone, so I wanted to provide more insight. I work a government job (NAF) and came in with very little experience and no degree. They took a chance on me and brought me in at a very low pay rate for IT. I was working Software Development before, but they hired me for an Application Administration job with technology I’d never touched and never heard of. I’ve wildly exceeded their expectations, to the level I was promoted up a pay band within a year and asked to lead their team. However, as some have pointed out, I’m now stuck in the cycle of small yearly raises (3% or less per year) while also dealing with management that asked way too much of an already understaffed team. I’ve been considering leaving for a while, but there are benefits I’ll lose like 1 extra day off every other week, up to 2 work from home days a week (though that may be ending soon), etc.

Also, to answer another question I see, I make $71k, but the job posting shows a range of $75k-$95k. I was told a year ago by management I was way underpaid and they’d fix that, only to be told a couple months later that they couldn’t do anything. That is the only time I’ve asked for a raise, considering we do get yearly raises.",finance

personalfinance,Can someone help me understand my tax refund and HSA?,"So I am starting to input information into TurboTax for my 2019 taxes.  After entering my income for the year, I showed a refund of \~$3,200 from federal and \~$700 from state.  However, I contributed $5,300 to my HSA which after entering, reduces my refund to \~$2,200 and \~$350 respectively.  This is virtually the same refund I would get if I hadn't contributed anything to the HSA and just added that difference to my taxable income.

Obviously, this is due to my ignorance in tax law.  But why the reduction?  I was under the impression that these contributions were tax free UNLESS the funds were spent on non-qualifying expenses.  It doesn't make any sense to me why I would just increase my savings, instead of contributing to an HSA, where my choices for that money are greatly reduced.",finance

economy,Japan's annual inflation tops all forecasts,"The December figure was 0,8%, although analysts had expected prices to rise by only 0,4%.

Consumer prices in Japan in annual terms increased by 0,8%, while in November the figure was 0,5%.

The indicator was twice as high as the forecast of surveyed analysts at 0,4%. One of the main drivers of price increases was the increase in sales tax in October last year. However, the figure is still far from the target of the Bank of Japan at 2%.

At the same time, the basic consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil prices but excludes volatile prices for fresh food, rose in December compared with the previous year by 0,7%, which is in line with forecasts. In November, growth was 0,5%.

In December, Japanese authorities introduced a $ 120 billion fiscal stimulus package to support the growth of the world's third-largest economy.

In January of this year the Bank of Japan, following a two-day meeting, kept the monetary policy unchanged and improved forecasts for economic growth. At the same time, the regulator lowered the forecast for inflation very optimistically.

""Factors such as labor shortages and higher sales taxes have helped companies raise prices ... but we expect consumer inflation to fluctuate depending on wage recovery,"" Hiroaki Mutu, chief economist at Tokyo Research Institute, commented on the situation. ""The Bank of Japan has lowered its forecasts for consumer price inflation, but they are still optimistic. We expect the central bank to maintain the current pace of stimulus policies.""

personalfinance,Half my team and my immediate manager were laid off. Should you “always” jump ship?,"Merger. Then department exec starts getting fiscally critical to my boss’s boss. Then my boss’s boss says before I purchase anything to run it by him. The next day. Two of my coworkers and my immediate boss are laid off. 

Apparently something like 15 employees across all departments in a company of about 250 were laid off. 

Should I start looking for another job before I can’t afford it? 

Do you think that maybe the lay-off is only a *trim-the-fat* measure? 

I’m on the lowest rung of employee but I’m the only one with my job description, so I assume that saved me. I need the experience that I might get as I transition to a more complex role. However if the company isn’t healthy, how do I know it won’t just flop? 

Are all layoffs a bad sign or are some a sign of new fiscal responsibility and benefit?

I’ve gotta make sure I stay fed and housed and rid of debt. The job pays well for the lower level. So I guess I’m not sure what I want except maybe some advice and stories of your companies’ layoffs in the past. 

Thanks.",finance
personalfinance,Taxes owed for first-time married couple,"My wife and I got married in June 2019 and are filing together for the first time. Something surprising is happening when I enter our w2s (the same thing happened on TurboTax and H&amp;R Block). In 2019 I had one w2 and she had 3 (she held 2 jobs in 2019 but her second job used two different pay agencies and therefore split her pay across two w2s).  
When I enter her two w2s and my w2, our total owed in federal taxes is about $900. When I add the 4th w2 (which is from the job she held for just January 2019) we owe a whopping $1700 total. This suggests that she under-withheld $800 from that job. It seems crazy because she only got paid $6,000 at that job and withheld the proper amount of taxes.  
We went back and looked at her pay stubs from that job since she was employed there for most of 2018 and for each paycheck in 2018 the same amount of taxes were withheld as were withheld from the handful of paychecks she received in January 2019 before leaving that company for a new job. In fact, in 2018 (during which she was with that company for most of the year) she got a slight refund of $200. So it’s not like she was under-withholding from that job. Nothing changed in her withholding in January 2019.  
I understand that being married changes things, but should it change things this much?! Based on our combined and even separate incomes, I don't see how $6,000 from that job in 2019 puts us in a different tax bracket that suddenly makes us owe much more in taxes.  
For sake of clarity, here are all of our w2s from 2019 and the federal taxes that were withheld from each. Curious if anyone can explain to me....I'm not doubting that the software is wrong but I'd rather get an answer for free on reddit than pay a tax professional to tell me the same thing! Thanks in advance.

HUSBAND JOB 1 WAGES: 88,909.92 (Fed withheld 12,341.96)

WIFE JOB 1 WAGES \*W2 in question\*: 6,670.37 (Fed withheld 687.47)

WIFE JOB 2 WAGES \*W2 from first pay agency\*: 12,372.26 (Fed withheld 1,530.93)

WIFE JOB 2 WAGES \*W2 from second pay agency\*: 41,594.02 (Fed withheld 3,116.60)  


**So, our combined 2019 income was 149,546.57. Without wife's first W2 (the one causing a big jump in taxes owed) our combined income would be approximately 142k and we'd owe $900 in taxes. With that W2 added we suddenly owe $1700.**",finance

personalfinance,Debating whether or not to cosign on mortgage,"Hello PF,

My girlfriend and I will be taking the leap into home ownership as first-time home buyers in the near future. We are aware it can be ill-advised to buy prior to marriage. We may get legally married prior to buying but are weighing the options on that. If we do not we have discussed worst-case scenarios and will be prepared. We are targeting May/June to begin seriously shopping for homes in the northeast US. We both make \~$65k. Her credit is spotless. 800+. I have been rehabilitating mine for a number of years after some questionable decision making in my younger days. I'm at about 700 right now and would anticipate it being a bit higher with some dings due to come off my credit report in the coming months. She has minimal debt. Just an auto loan with \~$15k remaining. I have an auto loan, student loans and a small amount of credit card debt (on a zero interest balance transfer card), totaling \~$38k. My question is whether I should co-sign or not. My cosigning would likely lead to a higher interest rate, and disqualify us from down payment assistance in our state. I want to be on the mortgage to protect both of us, but does it make sense for me to cosign?",finance
personalfinance,2020 W4 Changes Question,"With the new W4, obviously they have eliminated the withholdings of claiming allowances.

I used the IRS withholding calculator to estimate the amount I need (in order to not receive a refund nor owe any money). I filled out this change with my employers W4 form.

With this change, it was supposed to give me much more money in my paycheck (as I was claiming 0 allowances before), however it ended up taking MORE out of my paycheck once I entered the number the calculator told me to.

I’ve reached out to my employer about this and they said I should speak to a tax consultant for help on filling out the form. It doesn’t make sense, I feel like they’re still taking out the amount of taxes from when I was claiming 0 allowances.

Anybody have any guidance on how I can reduce the amount of federal income tax deducted from each paycheck?

personalfinance,Refinancing student loans: which organizations would you recommend or not recommend?,"My husband has a total of ~$118,000 in private student loans, of which the most monstrous has a balance of $30,000 and an interest rate of 11.75%(V). This is our only debt. As of right now we are tackling these using the Avalanche Method but would ultimately like to bring the interest rates down by refinancing. We looked into options such as Earnest, SoFi, Laurel Road, etc., but don't want to go into anything blindly.

Those of you who have refinanced in this kind of situation, who did you go with and why?

A couple things we're looking for:
* No fees, *especially* no early payoff fees. We're tackling these loans as fast as we possibly can to be out of debt ASAP.
* Cosigners allowed. While my husband makes good money himself, I do make a little more and have a little higher credit.
* We're open to reputable online organizations as well as local banks, but will probably steer clear from nationwide banks.
* We're willing to refinance into multiple smaller loans and avalanche those if it were highly beneficial, but otherwise a single lump sum would be fine.

We'd very much appreciate any advice we can get, particularly with personal experience in the matter. TIA!",finance
personalfinance,"Upside-down on Car Loan, could really use some advice.","So for some background I bought a barely used car that was above my budget. I was dumb and really wanted it so I financed it. I have never missed a payment and after a year of having it I refinanced it for a lower rate and monthly payments down by $120. That was about 8 months ago and I have now come up on a difficult choice to make.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue: I have to have surgery on my clavicle to correct an improper healing when I broke it a few years ago. This will cause me to have to drive 1-handed to/from work in the time between the expiry of convalesence leave and whenever I am able to use my arm again. The vehicle I have is a manual transmission car, so driving one-handed will prove exceptionally difficult. However I am currently owing \~28k on the car and it is worth \~22k if I trade it in.

&amp;#x200B;

My question: I want to sell the car, and get something cheaper, easier to drive, and more fuel efficient. I live in a state with high insurance costs and my monthly car insurance payment is \~$250. The car is also getting about 27mpg on 95% highway driving which is causing me to buy more gas, which I have to buy premium for my vehicle. I am upside down on my loan but I figure getting a cheaper car that would cost less in insurance and fuel costs would save me enough money to be able to pay off a chunk of the negative equity rather quickly; especially with lower monthly payments on a loan that would most likely have a lower APR because my credit score has increased since I financed my current vehicle.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a sound financial decision? It makes sense in my head but I wanted to get a second set of eyes on it since I have goofed with my finances in the past (obviously). Thanks!  


EDIT: Re-assessing my motivations for this and looking at the actual cost-benefits of trying to eat negative equity leads me to change my mind about this. I will try to find a way to be able to get to/from work with surgery and keep my car. Thanks to those who replied!",finance

personalfinance,Should I put less than 20% down for mortgage so we can invest the difference?,"I apologize if this is a little all over the place, TLDR at the bottom

My husband and I have a combined income of $165,000 a year (plus about $15,000 in expected bonuses). We are ready to buy a house and are looking at homes in the $550,000 range. We have no debt/car payment/loans, so the mortgage will be our only loan.

We always assumed we'd put 20% down. But after thinking about the potential upsides to putting down less than 20%, we have explored a few options with our mortgage company.

In order to put down 15%, we do have to pay some PMI (it turns out to be about $1400 for the 20 year mortgage: $50 a month for 28 months, and $2500 for the 25 year mortgage: $63 a month for 39 months).

Anything less than 15% down results in either a longer loan (30 years) or too high of a monthly payment, that's why we are looking at 15%.

Obviously the various options of loan length vs % down their own pros and cons. Some have a lower monthly payment, which means more cash flow. Some have a smaller down payment which means more available money after we close.

We're leaning towards putting 15% down so that we can take that extra 5% and invest it. Since the interest rates are so low right now (we can get 20 year for 3.25% and 25 year for 3.5%), taking out a slightly larger loan (85% vs 80%) won't cost us as much as we'd earn by investing it where it could/would gain 6% a year.

Also, in order to put the 20% down right now, we'd have to pull some money out of a mutual fund where it has earned 6% a year over the last 5 years. 15% would allow us to only use our savings which is just earning 2% a year.

Obviously we'll pay more in the end for a longer loan and a smaller down payment, but if we can take the difference and invest it, we'd come out ahead.

Does this sound like a good idea? I know the stock market isn't predictable but over the long term it has shown to always go up.

TLDR: Husband and I are wondering if it's worth it to put 15% down instead of 20% on a mortgage so that we can invest the rest. Larger loan, but interest rates are so good that maybe this is the best thing to do.",finance
personalfinance,Universal life insurance as investment?,"Hi!

I’m 31, single, and have had a 29 year universal life insurance policy (100,000 benefit) that my parents opened. Annual premiums are like $180. It has now a cash value of $7000. 

I’ve noticed that I can pay more into the policy, up to $15000/year. The guaranteed interest rate seems to be 4-4.5%. Im requesting the inforce illustration but it may take some time to arrive. Though I’m not sure I know how to interpret it. 

What’s the best way to use this policy? I can see pumping some money into it to build a nice healthy reserve fund that I can cash out if ever needed (but taxes) or it can eventually become a stronger life insurance policy with the built up cash value.

personalfinance,Is compound interest no longer a big help in retirement anymore?,"Ken Jennings (yeah, the Jeopardy guy) mentions in his book ""Because I Said So!"" that you can't expect much from compound interest anymore. That when interest rates were very high (around 8%?) it was a useful retirement strategy, but now that rates are 1% you cannot expect it to cover much at all in your retirement.

I think I agree with him. Passive 401k investments over time using compound interest doesn't seem like it will be enough to cover someone in 25-30 years.

Thoughts?

Update:  Compounding growth! Not compounding interest. I think I misunderstood that Jennings was probably talking about interest in a bank savings account, which would be silly to rely on as a strong source of retirement income. Thanks for helping clarify that!",finance
personalfinance,"Buying Home Within Two Years, Want to Close Unused Credit Cards. Bad Idea?","Hello all,  
The title pretty much says it, but I'll provide some more detail here. I have 11 open credit cards, and my wife has 4. We pay them off in full every month. The reason we have so many is because we used to churn them for bonuses/points. Both of our credit scores are 800+. I really only use 3 of my cards nowadays and have some recurring monthly expenses charged to all the others to avoid closure due to inactivity. My wife regularly uses 2 of her 4 cards. The main reason I want to close the unused cards is simply because I'm a bit OCD and hate having unused assets, whatever they are. We are planning on buying our first home (currently rent an apartment) in the next 18-24 months and I'm worried about how closing the cards might affect our credit scores and hence result in a higher mortgage loan interest rate. With the home purchase being so far out, should this be a concern? The majority of the cards between both of us were opened in the last 2-3 years. If it's a large factor, we could keep the oldest cards for the history aspect. We also have ~$150,000 in available credit between all of the cards. I estimate this would drop to around $80,000-$90,000 if we closed all of the unused cards. So I'm really just looking for your thoughts on whether or not you think closing them is a good/bad idea with the home purchase being 18-24 months out.

My parents introduced me to Dave Ramsey's philosophies at a young age, and as a result I am 25 years old and have no debt. Yay! As a side effect, though, I also have no credit. This comes into play as I am looking at buying a house in the next 12-16 months, and am not sure what the best course of action is. Here are some facts:
 
1. I have saved about 20% of the total cost of the houses I am looking at. I should have the full 20 and extra for closing costs, taxes, emergency fund, etc. by next year when my current lease is up (April). I make enough to cover mortgage costs, especially if I bring in a roommate or two, which is an option.

2. I have no credit history whatsoever. I bought my car used with cash, never really had any debt to speak of, and all of our house bills have been paid in my roommates name (maybe a bad decision in hindsight?)

3. Not fully opposed to getting a credit card and building credit if that is what it takes

So here's my question: I know Dave Ramsey pushes for people in my situation to go for manual underwriting for a mortgage, but I am wondering if I would be better off in spending this year building credit with a credit card, or would I not be able to build satisfactory credit in time to be ready when I want to go to buy (Q2 2021)? If I get the card, I plan to treat it as a debit and will not be purchasing anything I can't already afford with it, then pay it off immediately. The only thing is that I don't want to apply for a credit card at this point if it will hurt my chances of getting a mortgage next year.

I understand that is a bit of a complex question, but appreciate any insight this subreddit may provide. Thanks!

Edit: Also, are there disadvantages to manual underwriting? I don't want to pay astronomically higher interest rates or anything due to my own feelings against credit and cut off my nose to spite my face",finance

personalfinance,Saving vs. Retirement vs. Investing vs. Debt Repayment vs. Fun,"In recent months and for the foreseeable future, my wife and I are lucky enough to have a large net income. In this regard, I'm referring to ""Net Income"" as what we have left over after taxes and all of our bills, groceries, entertainment subscriptions, etc.

Once we pay off everything we need for the month, we have about $1750 ($500 of that goes to Savings, so the other $1250 is left-over).

Currently, 100% of those left-overs are being put into debt repayment. Combined with our tax returns, that allow us to pay off both of our credit cards by mid April.

After that, we have 4 loans:

* Mortgage (29 years remaining. $40k to refinance without PMI)
* New-Car Loan ($36k, 71 months remaining, balance is $4k more than the car's value. We have GAP insurance, and don't plan to sell the vehicle)
* Student Loans ($28k federal, 13 years until forgiven)
* Solar Loan ($24k, but 100% offset of our power bill)

We are currently not putting any money into a retirement account, and we are currently not investing in anything.

Getting those credit cards to $0 as fast as possible is an unchangeable personal goal that we'd like to achieve. So, how exactly would you guy's split that $1750/mo into the following categories:

1. Emergency Savings (already saving $500/mo, no less than $2k balance)
2. Retirement (currently $0/mo allocated, we're both under 30 if that affects your advice)
3. Investing (currently $0/mo allocated)
4. Debt Repayment (pay off addl. principal on any loans?)
5. Fun Savings (we'd like to accumulate up to $6k to treat my in-laws to a vacation)",finance

personalfinance,Roth IRA for 2019 vs E-Fund,"Hi All,

Thanks in advance for the advice.

I am contemplating whether or not it makes sense to contribute about 1 month's expenses into my Roth IRA for 2019 or leave it in my emergency fund. I usually try to take advantage of any pre-tax contributions while I'm in the &gt;=22% tax bracket and use Roth contributions when I drop into the 12% bracket. 

This year, my wife's income was much less than I expected and we landed at roughly 70k federal taxable income after all deductions which is well into the 12% bracket (78k threshold). I called my 401k provider to see if there are any options to convert some of my pre-tax contributions from to Roth but they said I can't do this retroactively for 2019, only 2020 and forward. This means the only pool of money I have laying around I can dump into Roth for 2019 would have to come from my Emergency fund.

My total monthly expenses are around 6.5k but my monthly base expenses (like if I cut everything discretionary) are around 5k and I currently have 10k in my E-fund - my plan was to bump this up to 15k when I receive a yearly bonus and tax return in the next couple of months (estimating 5-7k between both of those). I currently have 9.5k in HSAs/FSAs separate from my E-fund for this year so health costs are not a concern. 

Does it make sense to pull 5k from my E-fund and put it into my Roth IRA under 2019 contributions? On one hand, I would love the feeling of safety from 15k in my E-fund but on the other hand I expect our taxable income to be &gt;90k in 2020+, so I lose out on the ability to realize the 12% taxes on Roth contributions in the foreseeable future. I'd really like to pump some money into Roth at the 12% rate I'm paying for 2019, am I missing something conceptually here? We plan to retire as soon as we're rich enough which will likely be before age 59.5, so some Roth contributions can go a long way in that goal.

Other info: 

Wife and I are 31&amp;28, both work, have a 93% loan to value mortgage on a home at 3.75% (I know, I didn't save up the 20% down payment), have 1 car loan at 2.5% (not underwater), have student loans at \~3.5%, no credit card debt or personal loans, 1 toddler and 1 on the way. 

I throw 10% into my 401k with an 8% match and 7% into an ESPP out of max 15% (upping this as I can). My wife contributes 14% into a defined contribution plan with a 9% match (she is not eligible for social security so this looks more generous than it is) and another 4k/yr into a 457b. We max dependent care FSA and put 2k into a health FSA (used to max HSA but switched health plans).

worldpolitics,An analysis of Sanders' economic policies,"**An analysis of Sanders' economic policies**

I am quite passionate about Economics, and graduated from a school known for its Economics program. Since the primaries have begun I have spent a lot of time researching the policy of various candidates, and have noticed Bernie quite often going against available evidence and expert consensus. I thought I'd write out my criticisms for others to read through and comment on.

I will try to keep this as ideologically neutral and objective as possible. However it is impossible to be completely neutral, particularly as I'm mentioning things like alternative ideas. So I should say I'd probably consider myself a ""social liberal"" with some Georgist sympathies. This critique should still apply to those with values significantly different than my own, in some cases it might be even stronger.

A source I will pull from throughout the critique is [IGM Chicago](http://www.igmchicago.org/), a truly fantastic resource that polls economists on various economic questions. These are top notch economic PHD's from excellent institutions, and they have a wide variety of political/ideological views, so when they near unanimously agree it is quite noteworthy.

**Rent Control**

Bernie correctly identifies that housing costs have been getting worse in urban areas, making rent take up a large chunk of income, and making home ownership difficult.

However his proposed solution is Rent Control, which unfortunately is rather bad policy for a few reasons:

* Due to it being a price cap, it leads to a decrease in investment in new housing supply, exacerbating the original issue.
* It distorts behavior. Downsizing due to kids moving out or upsizing due to having kids are both disincentivized.
* It incentivizes pushing out exiting renters or avoiding new renters.

[Here](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/rent-control) is an IGM Chicago poll on rent control.

A better solution to addressing housing prices is federal zoning reform. Plenty of people and companies would love to build dense houses in places with high housing prices, but ultimately the local government makes it near impossible to do so. Another lever that can be used is to shift from property taxes towards taxes purely on the land value, to incentivize density and avoid penalizing people for improving their property.

**Free Trade**

Bernie argues that free trade costs jobs, ignoring the fact that the gains in productive efficiency and decreased prices significantly outweigh any employment effects.

It's also worth noting that free trade is absolutely essential to the decrease in global poverty. So if you have a strong humanitarian interest in poor people outside the US, this is a second point in favor of free trade.

[Here](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/free-trade) is an IGM Chicago poll on free trade.

[Here](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/trade/publication/the-role-of-trade-in-ending-poverty) is a world bank article on the effect of free trade on ending poverty.

It is better to combine free trade with cash transfers such as a negative income tax or universal basic income to help alleviate pain points that occur in the process, rather than the far more negative  approach of not having free trade.

**Free College**

I am a huge proponent of education, and I think improving our public education is crucial to the future prosperity of the US, however Bernie's approach does not seem well founded.

Demand for college is very price inelastic, which means that decreasing the price will not significantly change the demographics of the people going to college. When you combine this with the debt forgiveness policy, and the fact that college graduates are typically upper middle class, you end up with a rather regressive net transfer of wealth to the upper middle class.

A better approach would be to put that money into k-12 instead, as the gap between the education of poor and wealthy appears before college, at which point it is much harder to correct. A big part of this gap is the difference in summer activities, as wealthier families can afford to invest more in educational activities during the rather long US summer vacations.

[Here](https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2018-06-07/summer-exacerbates-the-divide-between-rich-and-poor-students) is a US News article on the summer achievement gap.

**Wealth Tax**

Bernie is quite strongly against wealth inequality, and a wealth tax naturally fits quite well with this. However based on empirical evidence and some logical reasoning, a wealth tax is very unlikely to lead to positive outcomes.

One major problem with the wealth tax is that it is very complex and expensive to enforce. Anything you own or have indirect control over could potentially have wealth, and valuing that wealth could be extremely difficult. How do you value a private company that has no profit due to continually reinvesting money in expansion? How do you value art or any other asset that is not readily available on the open market? How do you value a celebrity's ownership of their own image and brand? The complexities of all of the above will also naturally lead to a wide variety of opportunities for creative accountants to significantly reduce how much is owed.

Another major problem with the wealth tax is capital flight. A wealth tax anywhere near the risk free rate of return means you can't actually expect to make money in the long run on investments. The usual argument that people will stay because they want access to American markets no longer applies, as less money is better than negative return. The risk free rate is generally considered around 4%, so Bernie's 8% combined with capital gains that push it closer to 10%, would cause massive flight.

One additional concern with the wealth tax is the means by which people will have to pay it. No wealthy person owns a significant percentage of their wealth in cash, it is all in stock, typically of companies they started. Even if you are morally fine with forcing people to sell off their own company's stock, you have to consider the effect this will have on the market. It would quite directly cause a large decrease in stock values to account for the increase in supply. It would also involve a significant transfer of stock from American owners to foreign investors, as foreign investors would not be subject to a wealth tax.

If you want to fight against wealth inequality, there are a variety of other more effective approaches. One option is a land value tax, as it is incredibly economically efficient with no deadweight loss (land supply is fixed), and actively encourages dense and efficient use of land in places where land is valuable. It is also quite redistributive whilst avoiding penalizing investment and entrepreneurship. Other approaches include getting rid of the step up in basis and the mortgage interest deduction.

**Medicare for all**

Medicare for all is not inherently economically problematic, as some countries do use a single-payer healthcare system, although multi-payer is more common. However Bernie's medicare for all plan specifically has an estimated price tag of over $30T over 10 years, which would nearly double federal spending.

Arguments that we can cut military spending or avoid wars to allow us to pay for this fail to realize just how much more expensive this plan is than the military budget. Arguments that we can print money and use MMT to avoid having to fund it also go against economic consensus.

[Here](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/modern-monetary-theory) is an IGM Chicago poll on MMT

Proposals for a public option generally have a far lower price tag, and still give room for future moves towards single payer, if such a thing appears to be desirable.

**Green New Deal**

This is less of a wholistic critique of the green new deal, and more a criticism of a few key aspects of Bernie's environmental policy.

Bernie has moved away from a carbon tax, despite being a prior proponent of it. Carbon taxes are widely regarded as the most effective way to address climate change, as decision making by private entities will continue to ignore the societal cost of carbon, even if you try and offset with a heavy dose of government spending. Arguments that a carbon tax is regressive can be addressed by combining the carbon tax with a dividend, so that all money raised is given out equally to citizens, converting it into a rather progressive tax. Arguments that rich people will just ""pay to pollute"" ignore the fact that right now they are doing it for free, and that people are generally incentivized by monetary incentives.

Bernie has also pushed strongly against nuclear technology, even though it is incredibly safe and environmentally friendly. Ruling it out is taking away an incredibly powerful tool for reducing emissions, without any good reason for doing so. It's worth noting that nuclear currently makes up the majority of green energy production in the US.

On a more realpolitik side of things, the green new deal contains a huge amount of economic policy, which prevents it from being voted on and discussed on environmental merits alone. This makes it much less likely to pass than an bill focused on a pragmatic approach to the environment.

**Monetary Policy**

Bernie Sanders has always had quite a lot of issues with the Fed. He voted against the bailouts in 2008 and has argued that the Fed should include consumers, homeowners and farmers.

Whilst it is reasonable to criticize the circumstances that led up to the 2008 crisis. The bailouts were fairly undeniably a good thing, and lead to drastically better outcomes than the alternative. The bailouts were in the forms of loans that were paid back with interest, so the fed actually made a nominal profit on them.

The fed is a highly technocratic organization, and staffing it with non-experts would be an incredibly bad idea. It would be fairly similar to putting non-experts on the supreme court. The fed is primarily filled with economic PHD academics, and has not been ""captured by bankers"".

**Closing remarks**

I hope I have done a decent job in critiquing Bernie's policies, and have been sufficiently objective and evidence-based.

It's important to keep in mind the difference between ideological disagreements, and disagreements based on evidence and expert consensus. I would prefer someone who differs from me significantly ideologically but pays attention to evidence and expert consensus to the reverse. A lot of these proposed policies would do harm to pretty much everyone, even those he is ideologically focused on helping.

If you agree with Bernie ideologically, it is worth considering if you can reach out to him and put pressure on him to move towards more evidence-based policies. It is also worth considering if you truly prefer the expected effect of his policies to the expected effect of other candidate's policies.",energy

So we signed a purchase agreement with Richmond American Homes back in July 2019. We received a rate back in September of 4.25% from the lender who said we shouldn't even worry about locking in because they will go down between July 19 and Feb 20. Fast forward today and we are 40 days away from closing and have not locked our rate. We contacted our loan officer because we have noticed rates declining to 3.667% and figured it would be a good time to lock in. 

I asked him for a conventional loan proposal.

After a week of phone calls and a few emails our loan officer finally gets back to us with this ...

""Here are today’s rate/price options, let me know what you would like to do..
 
·         4% is at .50 points which is $1330, I can cover $300 of it as you have a bit of closing cost credit left, so out of pocket would be $1030.. all in payment is $1512/m apprx
·         4.125% is a .125 cost which is covered.. payment is $1531
 
Thank you""

For one what kind of email is this... did a five year old write it? Were you driving and writing this? It's so vague I don't even know where to begin. I asked him for a conventional loan proposal given the decline in rates as we were wanting to lock in.

The only reason we were leaning towards this lender which is Richmond American Homes ""preferred lender"" was they offered $7800 closing costs credit. I'm now rethinking all of this. We are not interested in points or buying down interest rates because 30 year fixed rates are low. What boggles my mind is we have great FICO scores, mine is 770 and my wife's 755. The only debt are my student loans, both our cars are paid off, I was recently promoted which doubled my salary from 45,000 to 70,000, my wife makes 40,000, and we haven't incurred any new debt. Our credit union offered 3.7% back in July. But again the only reason we were leaning towards this lender was the closing costs credit. Hoping to avoid all / most of the closing costs all together.

Is the only advantage that maybe you can start them sooner whereas you need more equity before you can open a HELOC? I assumed the all in one loan would require some equity before you can draw against your house value as well though, by definition.

Everything they say to sell them to you sounds like what a heloc would give you. Access your equity like its your bank account, great, that's what my heloc does. Put more of your spare money into paying off your house faster because you can pull it back out if you ever need it. Great, that's what I'm doing with my heloc too. What is the point?",finance
personalfinance,Federal Refund lower when I combine my W2s?,"To keep it short, I had 2 part time jobs this year.

  
One job I made  $12,217.47 -  $1,282.21 withheld. When I input that on TurboTax or CreditKarma, my refund is  **$1,280**

The other job I made  $3,496.40  -  $241.95  withheld. By itself I'd get the $ **$242** back.

I have 3 credit cards, no debt from any of them, with a relatively young average account age. No car loans or anything else on my credit report.

With my current job, I can pay off the rest of my loans before the summer. Would it be a bad idea to continue paying these loans aggressively because it'd lower my average age of accounts for a while? I'm not planning on taking out a mortgage for years if that's at all relevant.",finance
personalfinance,I was exempt on my paychecks for taxes for half the year. How to file properly for tax return?,"Hi everyone. So during 2018 I started a part time job during college. This was the first time I was submitting a W-4 form. At the time I placed exempt. I was still in college and my parents were claiming me as dependent. I was not expected to make more than 12k that year (2018). I only made about 5k that year. 

I continued working there until around the end of August of last year. Made about 10k. I didn't have any federal income tax withheld for the paychecks that I got from the old part time job. I did a tax return last year for the money I made during 2018 and only got a few dollars in state refund. 

I started a new job in September 2019 and was taxed with each paycheck since I did a new W-4 with the new company and did not put Exempt since my parents couldn't claim me as dependent anymore and I was making more than 12k. 

I got the W4 form from both jobs and was plugging it into turbo tax today. I was suppose to get a refund from the new job that I started in September but after putting in the information on the old job, my refund went way down. It stated that I owed tax due due to my overall gross being about 30k and federal income tax only being withheld from one of the two jobs I had. It's even saying that I now owe state tax.

Is that correct? I was exempt for the old part time job, which is why no federal tax was witheld but now it's stating that I owe tax money? When I filed my tax returns last year, I didn't owe anything for 2018 and my refund was only a few dollars. Why is it now that I owe tax for the money I made from my old job when I didn't for 2018?

Just a little confused on how to go about this or if I'm missing something.

My refund went from 2-3k to about $300 in Federal and oweing about $160 in state tax.

**EDIT: Thank you to everyone for clearing it up! I didn't know the exempt was for the entire year. 

I thought maybe it would be by per job. I also didn't  know that I was gonna get a new job in 2019 until the very last minute.**",finance

personalfinance,Withholding calculator 2020,"Hoping for some help. Spent 90 min with the irs and received little help. 

Trying to better understand the withholding calculator. 

Married filing jointly. 3 jobs  combined taxable income   $152k

When we download the w4 available after completing the calculator.... it autopopulates in line 4(c) extra withholdings $120 more per pay period and $134 more for my wife. Paid every 2week.

personalfinance,Receiving a tax free bonus for re-enlisting. This debt though.,"So a little back story, I’m in the Army for 7 years now. I’m currently deployed again, yet this time around I’m able to re-enlist for a tax free bonus. I have a few options and some debt I’d like to pay off, but can’t figure out the ones to pay off. I put away $247 (8% of my base pay) each month into a Roth IRA and the army matches 5% of that. I have a 813 credit score if that helps. Sorry for the format I’m on mobile.

Option 1 
If I re-enlist for 5 years that’ll put me at 12 years total in the army once that enlistment is complete, and I’ll be able to re-enlist again to go indefinite to the army. Meaning I have to finish my time in the army and do the 20 years until retirement basically. No big deal I plan to do 20 anyways for the pension. For a 5 year re-enlistment I’ll get 19.8k tax free, one lump sum. Then in 5 years I’ll be able to re-enlist one last time for a bonus if one is available.

Option 2
If I re-enlist for 6 years (maximum time) that put me at 13 years with a 21.8k bonus tax free one lump sum. If I choose this option, I’ll have to go indefinite and won’t be able to re-enlist again.

Debt

I have a 2006 F-150 that has 5,811 left on the loan with 2 more years left on the loan. Monthly payment is around 220 with a 9% interest rate cuz thanks USAA. I pay half each pay check and I plan to ride this truck into the dirt until she breaks on me.  I don’t have a warranty on the truck, so if something major happens, well then her time has come.

I redid my crawl space, it cost 11k total. That loan has $8,282 left with 2 years. Monthly payments are $260ish. Can’t remember the exact amount.

I own my house so monthly mortgage is $1074. Not too worried about this one, just listing it.

I have $1,944 in credit card debt due to a new water heater.

That’s everything I pay for debt wise. Just looking to see which one of these to pay off with the soon to be bonus. Thank you!",finance

stocks,FED interest and stocks,"Hi all,

Not sure if this is the place for this discussion but I'm a student newly studying economics.

I learned that the United States central bank, made up of a committee, sets the interest or borrowing rate. Generally, when interest rates goes up, stocks go down as higher interest rates for several reasons. 

I think is seen as a drag on the economy. Companies are less likely to invest/borrow when interest is high. Some stock holders might put some of their funds into cash if interest is high enough as the safer investment. 

With that said, are members of the FED committee allowed to own stocks? If they do own stocks, wouldn't they have a personal interest in inflating the stock price because they would gain? Indirectly, is this also like insider trading since they know exactly how much and when they will raise/lower interest rates?

I don't think there is a right or wrong answer to this but just curious what others think or if I'm just totally wrong.",finance

How can I optimize a payment plan that will build my credit and not have to pay a huge amount in interest rates since my credit is so poor? Where should I be looking for a car loan?

stocks,Long or short capital gains,"I struggle with this question all the time and even after years haven’t really come to a strong conclusion.

I trade stocks and options and try my best to hold out for one year but often find out it would have been better to sell and rebuy at better values after significant appreciation. That 15% difference between long and short term federal capital gains pales in comparison to some losses. In addition long term gains get the same tax treatment in California as short term.

I work for a local government and am offered both a 401(k) and Section 457 plan. The 457 has a Roth option, which is included in the $19,500 contribution limit. 

I'm looking to ideally defer about 20% to retirement (just enough in the 401 to get the employer match and the rest in the 457). My question is whether it would be better to divert to the traditional (pre-tax) 457 or the Roth 457? I've heard it's better to pay taxes now when you're young (I'm 24) and I can't imagine income taxes getting any lower in the future. On the other hand, would diverting enough to get me into the 12% federal income tax bracket make more sense? I make about $60k per year and would divert $500/pay period (\~$13,000 total). 60,000-13,000=47,000. Should I pay higher taxes now via the Roth or bump myself below the $40k threshold by diverting more to the traditional 457?

Any advice welcome! Thanks in advance.",finance

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I graduated with my Bachelors of Science in May of 2019. I have since gotten a job that I love at a preclinical research facility. However, I have $50,000 in private loans with Sallie Mae. They are expecting me to pay $580 a month which is almost $200 over my rent. I can not afford because I pay all of bills and I don’t make near enough to cover this. I obviously already passed the 6 month grace period and have since used forbearances. I have called them multiple times and they won’t work me. The most they said they can reduce it is with the graduated program which reduces it by 60% for one year.  I also went to a credit union to ask about consolidation; however, they won’t consolidate anything this high. 

Please give any advice, I do not want to screw my dad over since he is the co-signer. I am definitely going to pay it but I need it reduced by a little more than half to be able to afford it since I also have my federal loans to pay.

Thank you!


EDIT

my monthly expenses (May continue adding after work since I’m on lunch right now)

Car lease: $418

Phone: ~$80

Apartment: ~$400

Utilities: ~$90 in the winter

Winter parking: $30

Federal loan: either $113 or $130 

Upstart personal loan: $33

Food: around $175 to $225

Private loan (Sallie Mae): ?

Gas: like $60 to $80

I am making $16 per hour right now in addition to a bunch of benefits. I’m switching to weekend shifts in late February which means I’ll be making 10% more on Saturday and Sunday. I am also up for my 6month raise in March which is $1.  My job offers paid tuition for graduate programs which is enticing and I would like to get my masters.  I can apply for higher/different positions within my company after I’ve been here a year (September 2020). 

I’m trying to answer everybody as best that I can - I will be able to respond better after I get out of work today.

EDIT 2

Thank you for all the responses, most of you had very good advice and I just switched to the graduated program through Sallie Mae. I’m going to be working a lot of overtime hours because my job basically has unlimited overtime and saving, then pooling into one loan at a time.

Have a great week!",finance

personalfinance,Top ten FAQs for tax filing season,"Things to keep in mind for tax filing season (with clarifications edit: fixed to record some easy updates).

1. You have to file federal taxes if you make enough money that you have tax liability, which is generally over about $12,200 gross for regular employment, and only $400 if you are self-employed. You want to file even if made less than this much in order to get back any taxes you had withheld.

2. Even if you are a dependent on your parents' tax return, you still file your own taxes (or not, if you don't need to); you never file ""on your parents' return."" The only time more than one person can be on the same return is a married couple filing jointly.

3. If your state has income taxes, which over forty states do, then you also file with them. Those are two different processes that are largely duplicative, but slightly different rules. If you lived or worked in more than one state during the year, you might have to file in more than one state.   Some people also have local taxes, how fun is that?

4. You never have to pay a fee to file taxes. Most people can file taxes online for free with various web sites if they want to do that, see e.g. the IRS free file program website and other free services,  but you can always just file on paper, too. (You laugh, but that's how I do my state taxes.)

5. Even though you can file your taxes now, be sure you have all the documentation for all your income before you file. You don't want to have to go back and amend your return because you forgot about that other W2 you had months ago, or you forget to include your bank interest or brokerage tax information.

6.  You are supposed to report all your compensation income, even if it was just some part-time gig somewhere, or you got paid under the table. Gifts, loans and most scholarships are not taxable income.

7. The money you get back is a refund of any excess taxes withheld.  (Sometimes there are also refundable credits that increase your refund.) That was money you earned but didn't get yet. Getting a big refund means you didn't get a lot of money yet, generally speaking.   You may want to adjust your withholding if you want to get your money sooner but that's up to you.

8. If you didn't have enough taxes withheld, you need to pay the balance due by April 15th. You can get a payment plan if you need to. If this describes you, then you absolutely need to file because you can accrue significant penalties for not filing and not paying. You should also make sure you have enough withheld going forward.

9. If you are married, filing jointly will probably save you money vs. filing separately, unless you have a special situation such as income-based student loans. Try computing both ways to see which is better for you. If you are not married, then getting married probably won't change your taxes very much for better or worse unless you have really disparate incomes (and it will help then.)

10. (rewritten for clarity) Ignore any  purported ""refund"" values shown by a tax program / calculator while you  enter parts of your income.  You may see a big refund for your W2 that goes away following your spouse's W2, or your second W2.  That's an artifact of how the calculation works, and doesn't mean anybody did anything wrong regarding withholdings.  Wait to see the final numbers.

Feel free to ask questions if you are new to this.",finance

personalfinance,"Refinance current property, future rental property","Hi, I'm a longtime lurker needing some financial advice regarding home-ownership, rental and refinancing.

Our goal is to keep Home 1 as a rental property. The question is, should we refinance Home 1 to a 3.125% 15yr fixed, or 3.625% 30yr fixed? Our only concern is that the 15 year fixed would raise the  mortgage payments (including HOA, taxes, etc.) above what the average rental price is in the area, so when we buy Home 2 we may have to also pay some mortgage payments on Home 1. The 30yr fixed the mortgage payment is lower than the average rental price in the area.

I've done my fair amount of research but just figured to triple check my information with some more knowledgeable or a professional in this field here on reddit. 

To sum it up, I own an investment property that I am doing a cash-out refinance on, the proceeds from this cash out I want to give to my daughter/help with down payment for a new home. 

From my understanding, once the refinance has closed, I can simply gift the proceeds to my daughter and just file for the federal gift tax exemption, this should fall under the lifetime gift exemption since it would be over the yearly gift exemption amount.

Is my conclusion correct in this case? Are there any other factors I should be factoring into this? Also, is there any difference if I put the down payment myself towards her purchase? Just want to get all my facts straight before we proceed further.

personalfinance,"In Canada, owe US student loans. Choosing a 10 or 15 year consolidation","I moved up to Canada just after starting an engineering degree. I ended with about $40k in student loans (USD) with about 20k in Federal and 20k in Sallie Mae. I want to consolidate because the private loan through Sallie Mae has an interest rate that just keeps climbing - it started at 3% in 2016 and is about to hit 7%. Plus, I found some rates that would lower the interest rate and monthly payments.


However, my husband also decided to go back to school and for the next 2 years things may be tight - in addition, we used most of our savings during my time in school and the short overlap. Luckily, his tuition is almost nothing and he will graduate with almost no debt (maybe 3 - 4k). Luckily we are both fine in terms of job prospects. I have a junior engineering position that has a good growth potential paying 60k CAD/year (45k USD/year). He is working a bit now (maybe 10 - 12k CAD/year) but he has a job guaranteed after graduation (nursing, and he is in a program for a specific hospital that has a 100% placement rate) that will pay around 50k CAD/year (38k USD/year).


After going through Earnest, SoFi, and Credible I have 2 loan options :  

* a 10 year loan @ 4.47% fixed ($432 USD/month) 

* a 15 year loan @ 4.54% fixed ($322 USD/month)


I was originally going to go for the 10 year. Then I thought that maybe paying the smaller monthly payment with the 15 year loan, and then increasing our payments drastically once we are both working full time since there are no prepayment fees, might be a better option. I am not really financially minded (hoping to get better, having found this subreddit!) so I wanted to see if there were any potential downsides to this, other than the higher loan cost if I let them both go to term (and the plan is not to do that with the 15 year loan). A lot of this depends on the exchange rate, as well, since I would pay things down more quickly if the CAD increased in value relative to the USD.",finance

personalfinance,"Girlfriend gave up her PIN to a scammer, lost $700, Bank denied reimbursement, but I think I have an argument. Can anyone help?","PSA: We already talked about never providing a PIN to anyone and to always demand that YOU call the bank back no matter what, so lesson learned on her part and that's not the point of the post....

___________________

Short and simple: She gave a scammer her PIN over the phone, guy drained ~$700, then within 20 minutes she realized she fucked up and reported it to her institution, USBank. After phones calls and paperwork, USBank sent their statement: 

&gt; Since she gave the PIN, it is considered an *authorized transfer* according to their agreements she signed when opening the account. Basically, it was her fuck-up, they are not liable, and she's out $700. 

Well I did research here and some are saying yep you're fucked if you provide the PIN but others were saying, at least in posts about stolen debit cards, that regulation E and EFTA (electronic funds transfer act) state no one can be liable for more than $50 if reported quickly enough. 

Well, I thought maybe our situation is slightly different because of the negligence on her part, so I did some more digging and I would love if someone here could give feedback as to whether this holds up:

**Regulation E is a set of regulations issued by the Federal Reserve that governs all manner of electronic transactions. As I understand it, an institution that utilizes EFTs are legally required to follow the regulation:**

&gt; [Here is all Regulation E, parts of which I will cite in the rest of the thread.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/policy-compliance/rulemaking/regulations/1005/)

**No agreement between consumer and institution can impose more liability than this regulation:**

&gt; [6(b)-3 states, ""...no agreement between the consumer and an institution may impose greater liability on the consumer for an unauthorized transfer than the limits provided in Regulation E.""](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/policy-compliance/rulemaking/regulations/1005/Interp-6/#6-b-Interp-3)

**The natural follow-up question is, What constitutes an Unauthorized Transfer?:**

&gt; There are many examples, but the appropriate one is found in [**2(m)-3 which states, ""An unauthorized EFT includes a transfer initiated by a person who obtained the access device from the consumer through fraud or robbery.""**](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/policy-compliance/rulemaking/regulations/1005/Interp-2/#2-m-Interp). FYI, an ""access device"" is defined in [2(a)-1](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/policy-compliance/rulemaking/regulations/1005/Interp-2/#2-a-Interp-1) as things like a debit card or, importantly, a PIN.

*In summary so far, Reg E states that if a person obtains a PIN from a consumer through fraud, this can constitute an Unauthorized EFT. This is important because USBank is stating that, because she gave her PIN to someone else, it is considered an AUTHORIZED transfer and thus they declined any reimbursement. What I've found makes it seem like USBank is incorrect, it seems like reg E says the transfer in question should be considered unauthorized.*

**Furthermore, 6(b)-2 says consumer negligence shouldn’t be a factor in imposing greater liability:**

&gt; [Consumer behavior that may constitute negligence under state law, such as writing the PIN on a debit card or on a piece of paper kept with the card, does not affect the consumer's liability for unauthorized transfers.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/policy-compliance/rulemaking/regulations/1005/Interp-6/#6-b-Interp-2)

**Since she reported it within two business days, she should be liable for only $50:**

&gt; [6(b)-1](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/policy-compliance/rulemaking/regulations/1005/Interp-6/#6-b-1-Interp-1)

___________________

In summary, my girlfriend's PIN was fraudulently obtained, so that deems the transfer as unauthorized and her negligence has no bearing. There are tons of resources saying reg E and the EFTA protects unauthorized transfers. I cited reg E specifically. Since she reported it promptly, she should only be liable for $50.

**My main questions: Does this check out? And if so, do I just call USBank back and point to reg E and all my links?**",finance

Funds are now available in my traditional IRA and I’m working on a conversion to a ROTH.

Question is: During this transfer I’m prompted with this question:

**Withholding for federal and state taxes isn't available for Roth conversions requested on vanguard.com. You must elect not to have withholding applied to proceed.** Call us at 800-992-8327 if you need information about requesting a Roth conversion for which you would like withholding. You must check the box below before you can continue.

**\[ \] I elect not to** have federal and state income taxes withheld from this distribution. I understand that I'm responsible for paying any taxes due, and that if my estimated tax payments are insufficient, I may incur penalties.

&lt;&lt;&lt; I’m thinking I need to check this box (I believe I’m required to if I want to proceed with this conversion). I’m just not sure exactly what this means.

personalfinance,Emergency Fund: HYSA or iBonds?,"My wife and I keep about 100k in our emergency fund which is about 9 months of living expenses. (We live in a HCOL area with two young kids in daycare)

Currently about 80% of that is in a HYSA and 20% in US government iBonds.  My CFP turned me on to iBonds a few years back.  (I buy them directly from the Treasury so there’s no commissions for him.) The iBonds earn about the same interest as a HYSA but you cannot withdraw any money until 1 year after purchase.  Which is fine, I staggered them and now all are over a year old.

Should I consider moving additional emergency funds to the iBonds?  Assuming the interest rate is the same (say 2%) I see a few advantages:

·         No state tax on interest
·         No federal tax until the bond matures or I cash it out

The only disadvantage I see is that iBond interest does not compound.  Has anybody else ever run the numbers or thought about this?",finance

personalfinance,Lowering Capital One Interest Rate options?,"Obligatory sorry for formatting, on mobile and TL;DR at bottom.

So as a dumb fresh out of highschool student I got a pre-approval offers for Capital One for a measly $300 dollars. ""Perfect way to build up my credit!"" I thought, after asking my mom for wisdom she said it should be fine to get it. Never bothered to read the lovely 29% interest rate they were offering to go along with it. Flash forward a few years, poor fiscal life choices, bad luck....and Capital just upping my credit limit periodically when I got close to paying it off and me ruining my hard work of paying it down, I would basically end up maxing it. Now despite making monthly payments above the minimum, I'm still stuck at owing them $2900 with that same ridiculous interest rate because I would pay say 100.....then there's the $75 interest charge tacked on.

Right now my money is tight even with trimming a lot of fat since I've made a decision to stop being so horrible with my money, so I think starting next month I can pay around $250, maybe more while not letting my other debt rack up, since this is my second largest debt (the other is a student loan) but that interest rate isn't not nearly as high.

My question is in order to maybe get out from under this quicker, is there some way to get Capital One to lower my interest rate to something reasonable? I tried to open a credit card through my bank with the intent to transfer the balance to a smaller interest rate but they denied the application. I've very slowly gotten my balance down, it was closer to 4k when I started but I feel like I'm just dumping my money into a black hole since so much gets eaten up by the interest charge.

I know I need to pay this off and never touch their card again, but are there any other options to help me get out from under this quicker?

personalfinance,Received a letter from collections agency from an incorrect charge that I've been trying to clear up,"Hi everyone, 

First, thanks in advance for any advice. I've never gone through this, and I want to make sure I am handling things correctly.

Quick back story: I had some 16 ft solar panel racking delivered to my home by FedEx freight. I paid the additional freight charges at the time of order, and I have the receipt showing as much. Just like any other online order, you pay up front for any delivery charges -- nothing outside of the norm so far.

At some point, I get a bill in the mail from FedEx for the shipping costs. It's about 175 dollars (which sucks, because the aluminum racks only cost about 200 dollars) which is pretty much what I paid when I placed the order. I made the initial mistake of ignoring this first bill, figuring there was a delay somewhere in billing between the supplier and FedEx and it would work itself out. Not so much.

After 30 days, I get a second bill from FedEx, and I contact the billing department via email. There was some back and forth that took place to collect the correct order numbers and shipping information, but eventually I was CC'd from the person I was working with that he was forwarding the case to another internal department (ARCOA, whatever that is)  giving them the case number and asking them to reply to me directly when it has been addressed. He also said the cases are handled in the order that they are received, and to wait for a reply from them. I had submitted a copy of my receipt earlier and assumed that had been forwarded as well.

It's been about a month now with nothing back from FedEx, and today I received a letter from a collections agency saying they are taking over the debt (standard form letter) and telling me I have 30 days to dispute it yada yada yada. I also receive another bill from FedEx, for the same bill. 

So here's my question -- has FedEx actually sold this off to the debt collector? If so, am I done dealing with FedEx, or should I try to follow up again with this new internal department that I haven't heard back from yet? Or should I deal exclusively with the debt company at this point? Obviously, I am going to dispute this and I know I'm in the right here. I also don't want a hit to my credit and to be dealing with a debt collector calling me all the time. It's 175 dollars and I could just pay it, but the thought of paying the shipping twice gives me heartburn.

Finally, should I be sending dispute letters to the credit agencies at this point? I haven't checked my credit reports yet tonight, but I'll do that in a few minutes. I'm hoping this isn't already affecting me.

Thanks again for any advice!

I'm 24. I make $45k/yr, which translates roughly to a $2700 monthly take-home. I have an effective emergency fund of $7.5k and a small Roth IRA of ~$2.6k. My share of rent at our new apartment is going to be ~$800 rounded up, and I'm expecting utilities/parking fees to add ~$150 on top of that.

I own a car outright and pay insurance semi-annually of $501, which I take a monthly share of out of my main checking account and put in a secondary checking account so I can get the paid-in-full discount.

I have two outstanding student loans, a private loan with a balance of $12.6k and 4.625% interest and a cluster of federal loans with a total balance of $9.6k and between 3.5% and 4% interest. Both of those are after a hefty amount of paying down, so my monthly minimum payment on the private loan is still $391 and my monthly minimum on the federal loan is $134, though I'm technically ""paid ahead"" on the latter until July of 2021 so in a pinch I could stop payments on it until then.

All that adds up to a required set of monthly expenses of ~$1,600, which leaves $1,100 for other expenses. I put $100/mo in a Roth IRA just to feel good about it, so that leaves me with $1,000 for food, entertainment, etc.

I have 160k I can comfortably put towards the down payment. If I put 20% I can get a conforming loan at around  3.625%-3.75% with no closing costs. 

If I put down 10%, I can do a jumbo loan at 4.25 with no closing costs. I also have the option to buy down the rate to 3.375% for 20k upfront cost.

When I do a calculation on the true cost of even 4.25% by taking into account my tax rate and mortgage deduction, that real after tax interest rate is 2.63%

Given the above, it seems crazy to put more than 10% down, and I'm tempted to ask for numbers for 5% down using a jumbo loan. At even the headline interest rate, putting my money in the s&amp;p seems like a much better option than putting it towards the house.

I have two questions:

1. If the housing market crashes, is there any benefit in me having more capital in the home? Or for having less?

Girlfriend and I have a new daughter and she is claiming her. She files through turbo tax and gets a 6k tax refund all together. FYI she only worked until April and made 9k which matters because you get more for a kid if you made under 14k. 

Okay so that’s great. I tell her to not actually file until I check to see if I’d get more (which was stupid by me because I made more than 30k so there are obviously going to give her more filing as a single mom)so she waits for me. 

I file mine without submitting just as she did with and without the kid, just to check. In that process it does ask for my daughters SSN and is showing her as a non-qualified dependent. I make sure to check the box that says we agreed on who will claim her, which will be my girlfriend, and continued. 

When I finished, being the idiot that I am, I hit submit before letting my girlfriend submit. 20 minutes go by and she submits hers. 
Then I get an email saying my federal return has been submitted and accepted. Awesome. 

She gets the email saying rejected due to someone else already claiming my daughter and just about loses it.  Btw she is a new mom for 9 months now with no car and that’s what our plans were with the money. (Can’t drive mine because it’s a stick shift) 

So I’m sitting her like WTF I know I didn’t claim her because I would have received an $800 refund rather than having to owe $1200. So I definitely did not claim her.  

Been researching into what I should do next and going to start by calling Intuit customer support tomorrow and seeing if they can help out in anyway, maybe let me amend it right away, but it was already accepted by the IRS. I also know you can file a form for an amendment but it says it can take up to 16 weeks...and my girlfriend definitely isn’t trying to wait that long.

I usually have a decent ($1k+)  return between federal and state (state was also low this year, less  than $350). Last year i made the same amount and even with a penalty -  accidental 401k cash out of about $1k from previous employer - I had a  good refund.

Would it be worth it  to make an appointment with a professional and have them look over it  even though I already filed? I was hoping to at least get something of a  refund, even if it was low. I know you shouldn't budget based on the  return, but a lot of financial things have hit me at once and it  would've been nice to have that extra bit coming in to help out.

personalfinance,my state tax return keeps getting rejected?,"Hi! My Illinois state return keeps getting rejected, I am getting this reject code IL1040-8000-2 and it’s telling me that either my drivers license, state pin or my AGI is incorrect - and I have checked all and all are correct. I resubmitted it and it still is getting rejected. What can I do? My federal return was accepted but not my state. I’m wondering does it have anything to do with the fact that I didn’t file taxes last year for 2018? 

Last year I was a student and babysat when I was free, I got paid cash. I maybe maybe like $1000 total in the entire year. So I had nothing to file since I was babysitting. Would that be why my return for 2019 is getting rejected? Or what could be going wrong?",finance

personalfinance,A good example of why people get confused about bonus taxation vs witholding,"A ton of people get confused between:

* Bonus tax rate
* Bonus tax withholding

The tl;dr is there are federal guidelines on withholding for bonuses, but the bonus income is still taxed as normal income when you file taxes almost all the time. But many, many **many** people believe that bonuses are taxed differently than regular income. What is different is how *withholding* works.

A while back, I was talking to someone about this and wanted to find a good reference for them. To my horror the first Google results for ""bonus tax rate"" is this article:

[https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/jobs-and-career/how-bonuses-are-taxed/L7UjtAZbh](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/jobs-and-career/how-bonuses-are-taxed/L7UjtAZbh)

Note the source seems credible here as Intuit is the company that you know, makes TurboTax.

However, this article starts:

&gt;While bonuses are subject to income taxes, they don't simply get added to your income and taxed at your top marginal tax rate. Instead, your bonus counts as supplemental income and is subject to federal withholding at a 22% flat rate.

Examples in the article also are quite imprecise around this too.  It is just one example of the many you can find where even credible sources use loose/misleading language surrounding the differences between tax withholding and taxes owed/paid.  It's no wonder why so many people are confused by this (particularly when many do not realize how taxes work in general).

Something to keep in mind when folks from /r/personalfinance interact with folks who are coming from far less knowledgeable backgrounds - many of the ""official"" resources in the area of personal finance are actually **wrong** (or, charitably, grossly misleading/imprecise).",finance
personalfinance,Credit Cards - Consolidation?,"I got married last fall, and my wife an I have been talking about taking a few steps to further merge our finances.

We intend on paying off the balances in the next couple of weeks.  Both of us have had one credit card each since our teenage years, but my other four are much newer.  We don't especially love the interest rates or perks with any of them.

I've been playing with the idea of cancelling all six of the cards and getting a card or two together to replace them.  How badly will this hurt our credit?  Will the damage be lasting?  Is there a good way to minimize the harm?

personalfinance,Refinancing options for a large student loan with Navient,"Located in Texas, for reference. 

My husband owes about 290k in student loans from graduate school. We have income of around 150k. He gives 3k a month towards loans and it all goes towards interest, and not the principal. 3k a month in just interest. His loans are already consolidated and they're 5-7 different ones, unsubsidized, with interest rates ranging from 5.3% to 6.7%. There's some that are 30k-39k and the huge one is 195k.

We have tried to distribute the payments towards the smaller loans to get rid of them, but no matter how we tweak the settings, call, email, etc, they always put the payments towards the 195k. The little loans are then gaining more interest, and currently sit at a higher balance than was borrowed. Navient is a pain to work with. 

Anyway, I shopped a little around Credible and did a soft inquiry on interest options and there's a few available. They are definitely more favorable than where we stand, and the SoFi is the one I see as favorable due to the unemployment protection. 

Do any of you have experience with refinancing at such a rate? We're interested in one from SoFi that is 4.75% fixed, 5 year, with a payment of $5,500 per month. It says there are no prepayment fees, but I want to make sure.",finance

My mortgage is $2703 per month. Current loan balance remaining is ~$550,000. 

If I refinance at 3.375% with zero closing costs, my monthly mortgage will be $2431 and will reset my term for another 30 years. If I continue to pay $2703 which is already my current mortgage, over the life of this new loan the total interest that I pay is reduced compared to my current loan. I agree that if I just pay the actual mortgage of $2431 for the life of loan, the total interest is higher, but I am already paying $2700 and willing to continue with it.

I had a couple of questions:
1. What am I missing here? Shouldn’t we only consider the total interest that is paid?
2. If answer to 1 is yes, then why doesn’t everyone refinance at lower rate if there is zero closing costs and there is substantial period of loan remaining?

Also note that I am planning to stay in this home for 3 years at least. There is a good chance, I end up staying much longer.",finance

Bitcoin,Think of wealth as water and money as its storage container.,"Fiat leaks every time interest rates are manipulated lower and money is created by a central bank to purchase bonds created by the treasury.

Gold leaks whenever new deposits of gold are found or whenever the price of gold rises enough to make new mines profitable.

Bitcoin stores wealth without leaking.

Another way to look at money is as a measurement ruler. 

A fiat currencies length as a ruler keeps getting longer meaning that the goods and services within a society have to grow in length to fill the rulers size. Also known as inflation.

Bitcoins length as a ruler is static meaning that prices of goods and services don't change, if anything as we develop more and more goods and services for a society over time those goods and services have to fit into a ruler that doesn't get bigger meaning the length of each good or service must get smaller to make room. This is what allows prices to get cheaper as humanity progresses.

investing,"Fed’s Repo Response Isn’t Fueling the Stock Market: Equities are being driven by low rates and a healthy economy, not central bank T-bill purchases.","The author Bill Dudley is a senior research scholar at Princeton University’s Center for Economic Policy Studies. He served as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 2009 to 2018, and as vice chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee. He was previously chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs.

https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-01-29/fed-s-repo-response-isn-t-fueling-the-stock-market

During the past few months, the U.S. stock market has surged as the the Federal Reserve bought hundreds of billions dollars of Treasury bills to add reserves to the banking system and calm the repo market. Are the two connected? Or is the stock market going up for other reasons? The answer is important because the Fed’s large T-bill purchases will end  soon. If the central bank’s balance-sheet expansion is truly lifting stocks, then the market is vulnerable when these purchases cease. 

I am skeptical that the Fed’s balance-sheet expansion is having a major effect on U.S. stock prices. First, of course, correlation isn't the same as causation. Just because two things are moving together doesn’t mean that one causes the other. Second, and more importantly, the notion that the Fed’s actions are fueling a stock market bubble isn’t supported by how the Fed’s T-bill purchases are affecting short-term interest rates or how the Fed’s actions are increasing liquidity in the financial system. Third, there is a more obvious explanation behind the stock market’s rise: the prospect of a sustained economic expansion and a Fed that is likely to stay on the sidelines and not raise its federal funds rate target in 2020. 


Turning first to the impact of the Fed’s purchases on short-term interest rates -- it has been trivial. At the beginning of September, before the upward pressure on repo rates and the Fed’s decision to buy $60 billion of T-bills per month, the spread between the effective fed funds rate and the rate that the Fed pays on reserve balances was about three basis points, or three-hundredths of a percentage point. Today, that spread has fallen to roughly zero. When the supply of bank reserves increases substantially, this puts modest downward pressure on the fed funds rate because more of the trading activity occurs between banks and the government-sponsored enterprises that cannot earn interest on their cash balances at the Fed, rather than trading among banks. 

Similarly, the Fed’s T-bill purchases have had only a small impact on the level of T-bill rates relative to the fed funds rate and the interest rate that the Fed pays on reserves. This is a bit harder to sort out because the longer maturity of T-bills means that expectations of Fed rate cuts affect T-bill rates but not overnight rates. But even here it is hard to discern much impact from the Fed’s asset purchases. At the beginning of November, after the Fed’s last rate cut, the spread between the four-week T-bill and the effective fed funds rate was three basis points. That spread now is close to zero.

So it isn’t rates. But couldn’t it be that the rise in bank reserves is increasing liquidity, fueling the equity market? The problem with this argument is that when the Fed buys T-bills and increases the amount of reserves in the banking system, that liquidity can’t go elsewhere. It can move from bank to bank as households and businesses shift where they hold their bank balances. The only exception is if bank customers decide to increase their holdings of currency. But if they do that, that reduces the amount of excess reserves in the banking system. 

The Fed’s T-bill purchases substitute a bank reserve (essentially equivalent to a one-day T-bill) for a slightly longer risk-free asset (a T-bill) that the Fed now holds in its portfolio. But that’s it. There are no funds created to purchase equities. 

In contrast, the quantitative easing by the Fed from 2009 to 2013 removed long-duration, fixed-income assets from the market. This pushed down long-term bond yields significantly and made equities relatively more attractive.    

There are much better explanations for the recent rise in the U.S. stock market than the Fed’s T-bill purchases. I would put three developments front and center: 

The Fed cut its fed funds rate target by 75 basis points in 2019 to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. Monetary policy is more accommodative now than a year ago. Longer-dated yields are also lower as a consequence. 
The Fed has signaled that it is unlikely to raise rates until inflation climbs meaningfully above the central bank's 2% inflation target. As a result, both the Fed and market participants believe that monetary policy will remain on hold in 2020. 
The risk of a U.S. economic slowdown seems to have subsided. Most notable is the abatement of trade tensions with China and the expectation that in an election year, they will remain subdued this year. 

The Fed’s expansion of its balance sheet and the increase in bank reserves have stabilized U.S. money markets. As a result, the Fed is likely to gradually taper its repo-market interventions and significantly slow its T-bill purchases after the April tax season. The end of this aggressive provision of bank reserves, however, is unlikely to create major problems for the U.S. equity market. Instead, what will matter is the economic outlook, the risk of a U.S. economic downturn, whether inflation rises and whether the Fed will stay accommodative.",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage Refinance Question,"I'm thinking about refinancing my mortgage. My wife and I bought our house just over a year ago on a 30 year at 5% interest.  Interest rates have dropped quite a bit but i'm questioning if Refi is worth the hassle for us. Below are the details, I tried to be succinct.

* Purchase Price: $455,000
* Loan Term: 30 year @ 5% (5.077 effective APR), financing $356k, no PMI
* Mortgage payment: $1,911 ($1,927 @ effective APR. Actual cost is higher still to cover taxes &amp; ins)
* Currently paying $500/mo additional to principal
* Origination Date: 12/2018, Estimated Payoff Date 2/2038

2 questions:

1. If you were to finance, which option would choose?
2. Any opinions on [Better.com](https://Better.com)?  They had the lowest rates on [Lendingtree.com](https://Lendingtree.com) but other more common names have higher rates.

My options based on LendingTree today.

1. [Better.com](https://Better.com) 15 yr, 2.875%, $2355 PMT, Add Principal $73/mo, Payoff in 7/2034
2. [Better.com](https://Better.com) 20 yr, 3.25%, $1951 PMT, Add Principal $477/mo, Payoff 12/2034
3. [Better.com](https://Better.com) 30 yr, 3.375%, $1521 PMT, Add Principal $907/mo, Payoff 2/2035
4. [BofA.com](https://BofA.com) 30 y4, 3.5%, $1544 PMT, Add Principal $884/mo, Payoff 4/2035
5. Do not refinance.  Payoff in \~19 years versus options 1-4 which would payoff in \~16 years (\~15 each + 1 year of mortgage payments in 2019)
6. ...?

personalfinance,"What to do with car, upside down loan. Help!","Hey everyone, long time lurker. I see a lot of great advice and discussions on this sub so I have a question regarding an upside down auto loan. I'm ready to get out debt and this is the only debt I have other than $13,000 in student loans. 

I have a car (18 Mazda 3, grand touring) that I owe $29,100 on. It's financed at 5.85% and my minimum payment is $536. It's worth about $18,000-$19,000. 

I've been listening to Dave Ramsey podcasts and feel like he'd want me to sell it. I need a car, so I figured I could save around $1,500 a month for 3 months and buy a cheap car with cash. Thinking an early 2000s Honda Civic or Accord. I've seen some good condition cars for sale locally. 

I don't have the cash to pay the difference of 11-12k on the car loan so I'd have to get a personal loan for that amount and sell the car privately. It's only got 11k miles and is in perfect condition. So if I got $18,000 for the car and took a loan out, I could work on paying off the loan. 

So I'm practically getting rid of $18,000 in debt. Now I have $11,000~ to pay off. I can use the $2000 a month (using the money from my minimum payments) and pay off the personal loan in around 6-7 months or so. 

Does it make more sense to do this or does it make more sense just to pay extra on the current car loan every month until its worth matches more closely to what I owe on my original car loan? I understand the car loan is probably a lower interest rate than what I'd get on a personal loan. I have excellent credit around 770 or higher. 

I'm not sure what the best option is. To sell now while the value is highest and take out a loan or pay down the car aggressively until its worth equals the loan balance and then sell it and get a cheaper car with cash. I know cars depreciate quickly. I could apply the $1500 a month plus the monthly payment so about $2037 a month. 

What is the best option? 

Advice is appreciated here. I don't ever want to be in this position again. No more new cars!",finance

personalfinance,How to refinance student debt,"First time posting here so sorry if its bad.
I have about 11k in student debt through fed loans, all split into several different loans with 3.75% interest to 4% each and it accrues interest very rapidly. Their app says it accrues $1.15/day but its definitely more since I can pay the interest +some and 20 days later I have $50 of interest due. I think its actually 6$ a day that its accruing. I dont make enough to pay it off fast enough with the interest accruing rapidly. Im not sure if I can refinance this since I didnt finish school. My credit isnt stellar either its at 645 as my lowest score with the 3 bureaus.  Any advice or help will be much appreciated. This interest is killing me.

Edit: I put that I dont think the $1.15/day is accurate from watching the interest balance. Ive paid the interest and some on principal then in approximately 20 days it says i have $56 in interest. Since its multiple loans with different interest rates im not sure if thats why its accumulating so fast?",finance

https://www.wsj.com/articles/victorias-secret-billionaire-in-talks-to-step-aside-and-sell-brand-11580299200

""Leslie Wexner, the billionaire behind Victoria’s Secret, is in discussions to step aside as chief executive officer of his retail empire and is exploring strategic alternatives for the lingerie brand, according to people familiar with the matter.

The discussions are ongoing and could result in a full or partial sale of Victoria’s Secret, some of the people said. The chain, with about $7 billion in annual sales, has long dominated the U.S. lingerie market but has struggled in recent years with falling sales. The company is looking to reach a decision on the potential deal and succession plans in coming weeks, they said, though there is no guarantee it will reach an agreement.

Mr. Wexner, 82 years old, who built Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, The Limited and Victoria’s Secret into national chains, is the longest-serving CEO of an S&amp;P 500 company. He would be handing over the job after a difficult stretch for the business he has run for 57 years. He could continue in his role as chairman, one of the people said.

[L-brands performance vs S&amp;P 500](https://i.imgur.com/pTYW23Q.png)

Shares of Victoria’s Secret parent company L Brands Inc. dropped 29% last year, missing out on a broad stock market rally. The company, which also owns the Bath &amp; Body Works and Pink chains, has a market value below $6 billion, down from $29 billion at its peak in 2015.

Last year, the New York activist hedge fund Barington Capital Group LP built a small stake in L Brands and urged the company to consider splitting the fast-growing Bath &amp; Body Works chain from Victoria’s Secret. L Brands added two new directors and signed an agreement with Barington to have the fund serve as a special adviser.

Mr. Wexner has run the business since 1963 and took it public in 1969. From a small store in Columbus, Ohio, he built a retail empire by upending the department store model and developing specialty mall brands. He is the company’s biggest shareholder, with a roughly 17% stake, according to the latest proxy filing.

Last year the reclusive Ohio billionaire drew attention for his association with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, who for nearly two decades managed Mr. Wexner’s wealth. Mr. Epstein was indicted last summer on federal sex-trafficking charges stemming from an alleged scheme to exploit underage girls. Mr. Epstein died in August while in a New York City prison awaiting trial.

Mr. Epstein supervised Mr. Wexner’s personal investments, bought one of the company’s jets and took a role in the retail business, sometimes trying to offer input on which women should be Victoria’s Secret models, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Mr. Wexner has said that he didn’t know about Mr. Epstein’s alleged criminal behavior and that he ended their relationship more than 10 years ago.

A few days before Mr. Epstein’s death, Mr. Wexner sent a letter to members of his Wexner Foundation accusing Mr. Epstein of misappropriating large sums of his wealth. “I know now that my trust in him was grossly misplaced, and I deeply regret having ever crossed his path,” he wrote in the letter.

The reports of ties between Mr. Epstein and L Brands prompted the company to re-examine Mr. Epstein’s involvement. L Brands’ board hired an outside law firm in July 2019 to investigate what role he played at the company. The results of the investigation haven’t been made public.

Over the years, Mr. Wexner sold off many of the clothing brands he helped create, but held on to his bra-and-beauty businesses, including Victoria’s Secret.

In the mid-1990s, the brand’s heavily padded Miracle Bra, designed to create cleavage, was vying for market share with Sara Lee Corp.’s Wonderbra. Victoria’s Secret doubled down on ads with provocative TV commercials and theatrical fashion shows. In 2004, it launched Pink, a brand aimed at teens and preteens.

In 2016, Mr. Wexner parted ways with the CEO of Victoria’s Secret and assumed direct control of the business. The company warned sales would drop as Mr. Wexner made changes. He eliminated swimwear and shifted away from catalog mailings, but kept hundreds of stores in malls.

As retail bankruptcies were piling up in 2017, he defended his strategy in an interview with the Journal. People crave social interaction and will seek it at places like malls, he said. “I’ve got 5,000 years of history on my side,” pointing to the ancient shopping bazaars in Rome and Istanbul.

Demand for Victoria’s Secret bras continued to cool as customers turned to brands emphasizing comfort and inclusivity. In 2018, Mr. Wexner reversed some of his earlier decisions—re-entering swimwear and mailing out catalogs again.

Last year the company eliminated its televised fashion show and replaced its longtime marketing chief, Edward Razek, who had been instrumental in pushing its overtly sexy marketing. Comparable sales of Victoria’s Secret fell 12% during the holiday period, extending their slide.""",finance

The country is being pressured to move more extremely left or right, meaning toward more freedom and less government or the opposite, less freedom and more government. I wished someone had explained this to me earlier so I'll try to do so for others.

To understand the difference between political left and right think of a line representing how free people are. On the furthest left of the line people are the least free. Think of communism and places like North Korea where the government has nearly complete control over nearly all aspects of lives; there is no free press, and people hear/see only what the gov allows. On the furthest right people are the most free they can be, and in fact there is no government at all. That's called anarchy and Roger Ver, I believe, is an anarchist. America, after leaving Britain, started as anarchist. There was no federal government, but later libertarians, which are slightly more toward the left on the line, created the Constitution and federal government.

What does this all have to do with Bitcoin? I'm getting to that. I'm covering all this because people *worldwide* are struggling, but many just don't know how to make things better. This post here *explains the answer*. It also explains how Bitcoin (Cash) is part of that answer.

So an age old debate came down to which system of government makes people happiest? One where they are very free or one where there is a government managing everything for them? If we look at countries that have achieved the most in terms of average quality of life, advancements in human knowledge and achievement it's not even close. The free situations win easily. 

Yet with all that factual history people still even today question whether capitalism is a preferable system to socialism which is a close relative to communism. Why is this? Peter breaks it down wonderfully. In essence he explains the fundamental argument for why socialism should work is beautiful. People *want* it to be true. That argument is: people will work harder for others than they work for themselves. That's a beautiful sounding thought, but that isn't the reality.

Capitalism works because people, ALL people, for the most part care most about themselves. That's not a bad thing. It's just reality. It doesn't mean people don't also care for others, it's about priorities. Capitalism works because it deals with the reality that people prioritize themselves first. 

The key thing I learned, however, is that even though capitalism should be preferred because taxation is theft, which alone should elevate it morally, there is something else: capitalism actually *does* care for others, and it does this better. Listen to Peter explain how:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbGBMVb6Fnk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1018

Listen 17:00 to 25:00

Getting back to Bitcoin. The reason Bitcoin helps solve world problems is it aligns with the reality people prioritize their own interests first. Bitcoin (Cash) is being designed to allow people to control the most wealth they can. It does this by seeking the lowest fees. It does this by making it hard for people to lose from theft, whether illegal (using things like hardware wallets) or legal theft in the form of taxes (using things like strong privacy features). All this is about working *with* human nature as it actually is, not how we wish it could be. In doing so we actually make the situation better, via capitalism, for everyone around us too, because that's how capitalism works.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,First-Time Homeowner Looking to Refinance,"Greetings fellow Redditors,

Back in 2018 I became a homeowner for the first time. I was able to secure a $56k loan @ 5.25% interest, 30 yrs. I have the opportunity to refinance down to 3.875% for another 30 years, or 3.375% for 20 years. I'm looking to refi just to get my interest rate down. I'm leaning towards the 30 year, just to be able to keep my payments super low and I'll most likely do additional payments towards the principal as time goes on. With the 20 year, my payment would go up $10/month before my escrow crap. I would most likely not make additional payments with the 20 year.

Would it behoove me to refi for another 30 years and make additional payments and save the extra, or pay a little more a month and cut 10 years off?",finance
personalfinance,Tax question - self-employed/1099,"TLDR: made a good chunk of money, paid quarterly estimated taxes, TurboTax showing that I owe a lot more than I'd anticipated.

\------------------------------

Hi all,

Mainly hoping to get a quick nudge in the right direction.

Worked all of 2019 as a 1099 contractor. Made about \~$120k.

At the beginning of the year I figured out what my estimated taxes should be, and made sure to make the four quarterly payments. That number was about \~$4300 per quarter according to what I could find online.

I just received my first 1099-MISC (which is 90+% of my income) and as I'm filling out everything, it's saying that I still owe \~$13k in federal taxes. \~$30k before estimated taxes.

Every calculator I can find shows that I should've owed $16-17k federal which is why I made the quarterly payments that I did.

Using TurboTax, filing single, standard deduction, etc.

personalfinance,Do self employment wages get taxed twice?,"I got my taxes done by an accountant recently and it just doesn’t seem to pass the smell test. My wife and I made 121,000 in wages this year. And an additional 16,000 through self employment. We are due to owe 1700 in federal taxes. 

But here’s my hang up: If we just had our regular wages we would have 121.4k - 24.4k standard deduction. The income taxes on 97k would be 13,056. We withheld 16.3k. So we would be refunded 3.3k. 

Once we include our 16k from a side business we now owe 1.7k. A 5,000 dollar swing.

Granted I am a tax novice. But looking over my tax forms and it feels like the self employed earnings are getting taxed twice. Once at 22% because it took my total income from 121k to 137k. And once at the schedule 2 self employment rate of 15.3%. 

It seems to be that out of every dollar I earn outside of my full time job I need to take ~35% and either stash it away or submit in quarterly taxes. 

Maybe this is the moment I’ve always heard about where I switch over to a conservative voter haha. But at first glance it just doesn’t seem quite right.

personalfinance,"After reevaluating my debt situation, I’m deciding to use my tax return to make a dent in my CC debt and take control of my overall debt","I recently finished my taxes and noticed I was getting a decent-sized refund. I’m an upcoming college graduate and at first, I was thinking I could treat myself to buying a pre-owned car (2016-2018). However, I spent an hour on this forum last night reading about saving, investing and budgeting. I realized that, even though I could use the tax refund as a down payment and have a manageable car payment with a nice car approaching graduation, I know I do not need it. I’d like to get more in control of my debt and start a plan that works for my situation. 

- I’m a 22 year old graduating with about 40k in student loan debt and about 5k in CC debt. 

-I do have a FT job lined up, it’s an entry level IT position. From what I’ve gathered from coworkers previously in this position and information on Glassdoor, I should taking home an average of 3.5k a month (after taxes). 

-I do not own a car right now, so I take public transportation for work and everyday stuff.  It does get annoying because I have to set aside extra time for delays and overall slow, unreliable transportation. 

-Also, I am still on my parents health insurance, but they live about 8 hours away. Living at home is unrealistic unless I found a job in their area. 

This is my projected budget for the each month when I start working full time:

$3,500 [take home after tax]
-$700 - $30 [rent w/ utilities and divided internet bill with roommates]

-$300 [groceries, I am a vegetarian so this could be lower?] 

-$40 [bus pass]

-$80 [train pass]

-$200 [going out, eating out]

= $2150

I want to know, what is my best option moving forward as I graduate? I created a breakdown of all my loans with their respective interests, I’ll be paying about $800-$900 each month , divided  amongst my loans because I want them to be paid off within 5 years (I’m allocating the most towards the loan with the highest interest rate). For my CC debt, I know I need to pay that off first because the card I had throughout college has a crazy APR%.

Questions:
1. Should I completely max out my retirement contributions now or do I wait to see how paying off debt works with my projected budget? My employer matches 50%, ending at 6% contribution in their savings plan. 

2. Should I start a separate savings account, deposit my money there and use auto pay to pay off debt?

3. For my tax return, should I just dump it into one of my credit cards and continue paying them off first?

4. Should I buy an older, used car in cash so I can avoid the monthly payments but still be able to get around my area? 

5. Any more recommendations?",finance
personalfinance,"Advice on getting out of debt: Is ""debt relief"" worth it?","My wife and I have \~ 23k in credit card debt, \~ 10k in student loans, and \~ 15k in car loans. Under 50k of total debt, which seems to be fairly good compared to the national average.

However, we both have poor credit (mine used to be good, but the last year it has tanked almost 200 points). The credit cards are all between 24% and 30% interest rates, and they're all close to maxed out. We are not normally financially irresponsible or such, we just had several really bad months last year and ended up basically living off of credit cards.

And it is at the point that we're paying close to 1k a month just in interest and fees. Which we cannot afford...and which seems to me to be putting us on the precipice of a downward spiral.

I tried to get a lower interest loan to consolidate most of our debts... even just 10k to cover the worst cards with the highest interest rates and fees. But of course, thanks to all the cards being maxed out and our low credit score, we don't qualify.

I was made aware of a company, ""Accredited Debt Relief"" which has a program that could help. First, we start putting about $500 a month into a savings account they have access to. Which does concern me some, but they are a large enough company with enough reviews that it is only a minor concern. Then, they will take our 7 biggest credit card accounts, totalling just under 20k of that 23k, and begin negotiating with them for reduced payoffs - using the money in that savings account to pay off the negotiated deals. 

We would be paying 14k for 20k worth of debt, and any future interest/fees that 20k might have accrued. Which seems like a great deal.

In 28 months or less, they promise that all of the 7 cards will have been paid off and in good standing; they do not guarantee that the accounts won't be closed, but they do state that if they are, they will be closed as fully paid and in good standing. We would be paying 14k for 20k worth of debt, and any future interest/fees that 20k might have accrued.

The thing is, between us, my wife and I only have 13 credit cards, and this would be  more than half of then potentially (which I assume means almost definitely) closed out over the next two years. The primary goal for us is to manage our monthly payments, as they have gotten way out of hand. But we are renting a house and hope to buy in the next 1-3 years... and I assume that closing out the majority (both in quantity and credit limits) of our credit accounts will have a significantly negative impact on that.

Is there another option? We can't continue to just go on as it is now. We are chronically one or more months behind on most of our credit cards, because the payments and interest are so high. That is obviously really bad for our credit ratings as well.

I just am not sure what the best answer might be.",finance

personalfinance,Need a little advice on tackling 53K worth of unsecured debt,"I'm ready to move on from my spending addiction and 3 weeks in now I've managed to hold myself accountable to frivolous spending habits. I've accumulated this over almost 20 years and I've simply had enough.

To keep it short and simple, no I'm not in dire financial straights, I have almost zero monthly expenses so 90% of my income is the 'fun money' of my marriage. Basically I went to go pay for my dog's vet bill the other day and although it wasn't a great deal of money I still got anxious that it would have depleted my checking to an amount I'm not comfortable with so I put it on one of my CCs.   I'm very much ready to be over this heap and be more financially unrestrained and anxious constantly.

My take-home pay per month is $4250 and right now paying just the minimums plus \~ $120 in necessities that I pay as the couple I'm at $2462.00 in monthly obligations.  Realistically, I'm planning to budget $1000-1200 twoard CC debt each month.

I've maintained a spreadsheet of my cards and obligations for a couple of years now so I know what cards I'm paying most on and I've 'reduced' my 'special financing' down to &lt; $6000 or so that boils down to this;

Approximately $2500 of deferred interest on one store card from 3 transactions, approx $2300 expiring in may/june.

$1400 0% 'equal pay' charges on a card that has pretty good 0% balance transfer benefits (more on this in a second)  through 3 transactions, most of this is 'new' and won't be paid off soon if I just make the 'equal payments'

$700 equal pay 0% on a store card- the equal payments on this are inflating this card's monthly payment by about $170 right now. it should reduce by $70 in two months as two transactions are expiring.

$1100 Deferred interest expiring through several smaller transactions beginning in March on another high interest store card.

I have a personal loan I used in the past that is nearing the end of the term so the balance on this is small \~$3200 but the monthly payment is high- $316. It has less than a year in payments remaining, the interest rate is &lt;10%.

I'm using my two 'best' 'benefits' cards (a 2% cash back Citi and my Amex Blue) at this point for my daily transactions then paying off the amount I charge to them per month.

I then have a mixture of store cards and big bank cards at high interest rates ranging between 23-27% and then two low interest rate cards between 9-13%.  The high interest cards are by far the bulk of my debt. The lows account for approximately 9,500

My plan of attack so far is this;

I see the deferred interest as the worst of my debt (Most of these charges are on the highest interest rate cards). If I don't pay them off/down, then I'm paying the most interest out of all my cards so, I should pay these first even though they're ""0%"" right now.

The rub is I won't be able to do this before they expire so I'm planning on using balance transfers;

I'll pay off the $1400 CC with the equal payments- this has a 4K limit and a good 12 mo 0% APR   for a 4% fee. Use this to snowball the deferred interest amounts .

Then, pay down the personal loan since this would free up a significant amount of cash flow.

I'd like to snowball the high cards first and as soon as I've reduced my Debt to income ratio enough, pickup another personal loan to reduce my interest rate on high balances further.    

At the moment I would estimate my chances are very low that I'd secure another loan with my current credit score and DTI ratio.  

**The question ultimately then is; is this a sound plan? Should I pay down these deferred/special rates first or perhaps pay off the personal loan  first to free up more cashflow since it's such a huge payment each month?**

3) do the student loan debt rehabilitation

personalfinance,Closed account on report - correction,"Hi all!

I just pulled my credit reports and noticed that Toyota (Omni financial), whom I had a car loan with for 5 years, has two payments from 2011 or so marked as 30 days late.

I paid off the car several years ago. 

Would it be worthwhile to call/ write and ask them if they’d be willing to remove these marks on my report given that I’ve paid off the car with no other late payments? They are the only negatives on my report and they make me crazy... I don’t know if they actually impact my score (754) significantly.

THEN i notice my state taxes are set at the state I was supposed to be in but never went.  so they never changed that part back and i haven't been getting state taxes deducted most of the year.  I can't even change this back myself from what i can see as it's telling me that my current state (the wrong one) has no state taxes.

personalfinance,1098-T Help - Graduated in 2019,"Hi,

I'm entering my tax information on TurboTax for 2019 and I'm confused about the situation with my 1090-T form for 2019. My 1098-Ts have been like this so far:

|Year|Box 2 (amount billed for qualified tuition and related expenses)|Box 5 (Scholarships or Grants)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2016|44000|55315|
|2017|45720|57521|
|2018|47290|59649|
|2019|0|30339|

I was ready to accept the massive amount of tax I would have to pay this year due to the fact that the $30,339 this year won't have any qualified tuition and related expenses deducted from it, but then TurboTax prompted me asking ""Did Your Aid Include Amounts Not Awarded for 2019 Expenses?""

I called financial services today and they said that the reason why Box 2 has ""0"" for my 2019 form is that the actual charge for the tuition for my Spring 2019 semester was in December 2018, and would have been included in my 2018 1098-T. TurboTax is saying that I could potentially deduct the expenses from 2018 since my aid in 2019 was actually to pay for the payment I made in December 2018. Am I understanding this correctly? Is this something that I should do? TurboTax mentioned that if I did this I would potentially have to amend my 2018 taxes. I filed taxes in 2018 because I had an internship that paid a good amount of money and my Dad didn't claim me as a dependent. I did not file taxes in 2016 and 2017 using my 1098-T because my Dad claimed me as a dependent/was handling the taxes. If I do the deduction as TurboTax suggests would I have to go back through all of the years and amend those too?

personalfinance,Investing vs. saving cash for house,"Hello,

 I have a question on optimal saving strategy including iShares Core MSCI World (acc), building house with bank loan/savings.

My details:

31M; 1800€ salary; saving rate 42%. (I'm from east europe, avg salary per month is 1100€)

I've  recently started to invest into iShares Core MSCI World (acc), I  contribute every month \~ 171€ (3 units of ETF). I save also \~600€ on my  bank account for a house. I've saved 11k€.

My  projection is that I will need to take about 40k-50k€ bank loan for a  house in aprox. 2 years(I will get inheritance money along with  government help).

My question is  what is more optimal for me, to save more cash to be able to request for  lower loan or invest more in world ETF? Think I need to consider are  future bank interest rate (fixed IR currently \~ 2.8-3.5%), tax on  capital gains (25% if i take money out in 0-5 years). Is it wise to stop  with investing and instead just save 770€ in bank account? Or to be  involved in ETF's investing with small sum like now (171€) and save in  bank account the rest?

Thanks a lot!",finance

I have about 20,000 in my savings, but I have about 39,000 in federal student loans and 4200 in private loans ( down from 16,000, I've been aggressively paying 600 a month towards the private loans)

Car insurance = 110
Gym = 60
private loans = 600
Federal loans= 250

Should I just continue to save (i put 700 a month into savings currently) and just keep plugging along? I'm curious to what you guys think

Bitcoin,The Cantillon Effect and Wealth Inequality,"Have you heard of the Cantillon effect?

Wealth inequality is a well documented problem in the United States, and more broadly across the world.

This rise in wealth inequality over the past 30 years has to a significant extent been the product of monetary policy fuelling a series of asset price bubbles.

Whenever the market booms, the share of wealth going to those at the very top increases.

When the boom goes bust, that share drops somewhat - but then comes roaring back even higher with the next asset bubble.

Also, those the very top are often diversified, so even if their wealth as a group technically goes down due to a stock market crash, as individuals they are generally fine and it is the middle class that bear the brunt of the damage.

The redistributive effects of money creation were called Cantillon effects by Mark Blaug after the Franco-Irish economist Richard Cantillon who experienced the effect of inflation under the paper money system of John Law at the beginning of the 18th century.

**Cantillon explained that the first ones to receive the newly created money see their incomes rise whereas the last ones to receive the newly created money see their purchasing power decline as consumer price inflation comes about**.

In accordance with the Cantillon effect, inflation can increase inequality depending on the route it takes, but increasing inequality is not a necessary consequence of inflation. If it happened that the poorest in society were the first receivers of the newly created money, then inflation could very well be the cause of decreasing inequality since they get the money first.

Under modern central banking however, money is created and injected into the economy through the credit route and first affects financial markets.

Under this system, commercial banks and other financial institutions are not only the first receivers of the newly created money but are also the main producers of credit money.

This is because banks can grant loans unbacked by base money.

In a free-banking system, this credit creation power of banks is strictly limited by competition and the clearing process.

Under central banking however, the need for reserves is relaxed as banks can either sell financial assets to the central bank in open market operations, or the central bank can grant loans to banks at relatively low interest rates.

In both cases, central banks remove the limits of credit expansion by determining the total reserves in the banking system. In other words, commercial banks and other financial institutions are credited with so-called base money that has not existed before.

Thus, the economics of Cantillon effects tells us that financial institutions benefit disproportionately from money creation, since they can purchase more goods, services, and assets for still relatively low prices. This conclusion is backed by numerous empirical illustrations.

For instance, the financial sector contributed massively to the growth of billionaire’s wealth.

One of the most visible consequences of this growth of financial markets triggered by monetary expansion is asset price inflation.

In a completely sound money system where credit only depends on the amount of saving rather than on fiduciary credit, there is very little room for generalized and persistent asset-price inflation as the amount of funds which can be used to purchase assets is strictly limited. In other words, the phenomenon of **asset-price inflation is a child of credit inflation**.

Asset price inflation predominately benefits the richest in society for several reasons.

1. First of all, the wealthy tend to own more financial assets than the poor in proportion to income.
2. Secondly, it is easier for the richest individuals to contract debt in order to buy shares that can be sold later at a profit. Since credit easing lowers the interest rate and therefore funding costs, the profits made by selling inflated assets bought at credit will be even greater.
3. Finally, asset price inflation coming with the growth of financial markets will benefit those working in the financial sector. It will also benefit the CEO's of the publicly traded companies who will be paid more as the market cap of their company increases.

Hence, the correlation between asset prices and income inequality has been, as expected, very strong.

Despite this, many economists have failed to see asset-price inflation as a consequence of an inflated money supply.

**The conclusion is: our monetary system itself increases inequality**.

personalfinance,I think my employer may be in violation of the FSLA (Federal Labor Standards Act).,"I have worked for this company for about 2 years.  Sometime in the middle of last year one of my co workers had complained that our pay roll department had not given him all the hours he worked on his pay check.  As many employees do grumble about many things I didn't look into it, and just passed it off as grumbling.  

Fast forward to last week.  I have to come into work 90 minutes early due to someone calling out that day.  At about 8 in the morning when pay roll comes in they see I clicked in early and are furious, and they are not paying me for that time because it wasn't approved. I don't bring up the issue to our GM and just wait until next week until pay roll is processed do I can see if they actually do dock my pay.  

The following Monday I make 2 copies of my time card, one before they put my weekly hours in it.  One after.  I add up my time and find out she did not include the time I came in early.  Also the previous week we had another employee show up 30 mins early and in a meeting pay roll stated they would not be getting paid for that 30 mins. 

I ask my GM out for drinks one night as I had something I wanted to discuss with him.  Now I like the company I work for and I respect the hell out of my GM. But he is not from the US and is not entirely familiar with the FSLA or right to work state laws.  I tell him my concerns and he states that if he doesn't approve of the time worked that he is not paying the employee.  I highly advise him that he needs to look into the law and be sure that he can do that.  

This practice has been taken place for years.  Dozens of workers have time they have not been paid for.  One work I believe is owed over 12k. If the company owner is to find out she owes tens of thousands of dollars in back wages it is a real chance she could shut the company down.  

Am I correct in thinking they are violation? And how should I handle this?",finance
personalfinance,Car Financing Disaster,"Yesterday I bought a 2017 Kia Forte. It was listed for $10,999. Let's say $11k for convenience. I asked the salesman if I could get it for $10,500. He went and talked to his manager and they offered to take $380ish off in taxes and fees. Money saved is money saved, so I agreed to that. Another thing I mentioned to him was that since I was applying for financing alone i knew I wouldn't get a great interest rate, but I was hoping for around 7%. He assured me that he has seen people with bad credit get good rates before and that I don't need to worry about that. I also told him I'm looking for a monthly payment of no higher than $200. My original down payment was $3300. He said I can get a monthly payment of $230 for 72 months. I offered to put $400 more down ($3700 total) so I could get my monthly bill in my range. I also asked if I should have my dad come in and cosign because maybe I'd get a better rate. He told me that a cosigner might not really help. He said it could even make it worse. The final monthly bill I agreed to was $205. 

Sadly, After finishing the purchase while I was driving my new car home, I started thinking about the price. $205 * 72 = $14,760. I felt sick. I told my parents right away that I had messed up and we started looking over the paper work. 

Not once when I was signing papers or during any interaction did anyone tell me I got approved for a 17% interest rate! Or that my total sales price at the end of the 72 months will be $18,475!

Further digging I found that they added $389 to the original sale price without telling me making the price for the car $11,388. 

Here's some math I did. With the $389 added and with the ridiculous interest rate.

11,388 + (11,388 * 0.07) = 12,185 total with sales tax
12,185 - 3700 = 8485 total that should be financed after down payment
They have it listed that $9,047 was financed which is fine, there's fees added. 
But 17% interest on $9,047 is only $1,537. On the sale contract is says interest cost me $5,727.  That is $4190 that I can't seem to find a place for. 
 My total after 72 months should be $14,284. NOT $18,475. 
Any advice?

economy,The Cantillon Effect and Wealth Inequality,"Have you heard of the Cantillon effect?

Wealth inequality is a well documented problem in the United States, and more broadly across the world.

This rise in wealth inequality over the past 30 years has to a significant extent been the product of monetary policy fuelling a series of asset price bubbles.

Whenever the market booms, the share of wealth going to those at the very top increases.

When the boom goes bust, that share drops somewhat - but then comes roaring back even higher with the next asset bubble.

Also, those the very top are often diversified, so even if their wealth as a group technically goes down due to a stock market crash, as individuals they are generally fine and it is the middle class that bear the brunt of the damage.

The redistributive effects of money creation were called Cantillon effects by Mark Blaug after the Franco-Irish economist Richard Cantillon who experienced the effect of inflation under the paper money system of John Law at the beginning of the 18th century.

**Cantillon explained that the first ones to receive the newly created money see their incomes rise whereas the last ones to receive the newly created money see their purchasing power decline as consumer price inflation comes about**.

In accordance with the Cantillon effect, inflation can increase inequality depending on the route it takes, but increasing inequality is not a necessary consequence of inflation. If it happened that the poorest in society were the first receivers of the newly created money, then inflation could very well be the cause of decreasing inequality since they get the money first.

Under modern central banking however, money is created and injected into the economy through the credit route and first affects financial markets.

Under this system, commercial banks and other financial institutions are not only the first receivers of the newly created money but are also the main producers of credit money.

This is because banks can grant loans unbacked by base money.

In a free-banking system, this credit creation power of banks is strictly limited by competition and the clearing process.

Under central banking however, the need for reserves is relaxed as banks can either sell financial assets to the central bank in open market operations, or the central bank can grant loans to banks at relatively low interest rates.

In both cases, central banks remove the limits of credit expansion by determining the total reserves in the banking system. In other words, commercial banks and other financial institutions are credited with so-called base money that has not existed before.

Thus, the economics of Cantillon effects tells us that financial institutions benefit disproportionately from money creation, since they can purchase more goods, services, and assets for still relatively low prices. This conclusion is backed by numerous empirical illustrations.

For instance, the financial sector contributed massively to the growth of billionaire’s wealth.

One of the most visible consequences of this growth of financial markets triggered by monetary expansion is asset price inflation.

In a completely sound money system where credit only depends on the amount of saving rather than on fiduciary credit, there is very little room for generalized and persistent asset-price inflation as the amount of funds which can be used to purchase assets is strictly limited. In other words, the phenomenon of **asset-price inflation is a child of credit inflation**.

Asset price inflation predominately benefits the richest in society for several reasons.

1. First of all, the wealthy tend to own more financial assets than the poor in proportion to income.
2. Secondly, it is easier for the richest individuals to contract debt in order to buy shares that can be sold later at a profit. Since credit easing lowers the interest rate and therefore funding costs, the profits made by selling inflated assets bought at credit will be even greater.
3. Finally, asset price inflation coming with the growth of financial markets will benefit those working in the financial sector. It will also benefit the CEO's of the publicly traded companies who will be paid more as the market cap of their company increases.

Hence, the correlation between asset prices and income inequality has been, as expected, very strong.

Despite this, many economists have failed to see asset-price inflation as a consequence of an inflated money supply.

**The conclusion is: our monetary system itself increases inequality**.

personalfinance,Renting Out a Primary Residence After 12 Months,"Posting here since the mortgage sub was merged. Here is a question and all dates below are made up to come up with the question

- Say someone bought a house in Feb 2019 as primary residence
- Moved in to the house in Feb 2019
- Refinanced with a new lender to lower the interest rate in Sep 2019 (of course as primary residence refi)

Does the 12 month primary residence requirement reset now from Sep 2019? Meaning, does the borrower has to occupy it as primary residence till Sep 2020?

Or is it still ok to buy a new house in March 2020, move into it and rent out the first house?

personalfinance,Expat finance is hard...,"Hi Personal Finance:

First time posting:

I'm a frustrated upper-middle class millennial American expatriate living in Japan, and I'm just trying to figure my shit out. 

Let me share about my situation:

I'm 27, and have a nice job at a tech company, but I've been very aggressive with my debt repayment strategy, and not a lot of positive cash flow or liquidity.

I make about 90K USD/ Year in salary, with another 30K in bonus and stocks and shit.

I did an MBA, but it was pretty expensive. Fortunately, my job helped a lot. I still owe 41K USD on it. 

I have some stock in my company (\~17K USD, with another 30K USD coming by EOY). I have about 19K USD in savings -- just uninvested cash.

I hate our apartment. I think we're overpaying by a lot. About 1.5K USD/Month (160,000 JPY for 80M\^2 3LDK in Kanagawa.) Operational expenses are probably high, because we're kindof wasteful with food, water and electric. And I like whiskey, which isn't cheap, but hey, YOLO.

I owe about 41K on student loans. I paid off 12K USD last year, which I'm very proud of, but it's not enough and it fucked our cash flow situation over the summer last year. I owe a small amount on credit card (like 6K) but in the grand scheme, I kindof don't care, because I'm paying it down aggressively in itself (I know, high interest rate; whatever.)

I have like 60K in 401k savings, which I'm thinking about raiding to buy a house.

We want to buy a house (like 400K USD equivalent.) I found a nice one very close to my favorite train station. And I'm stupid and impulsive. Pretty house. I deserve it, right?

It makes me feel kindof frustrated and lost, because I owe a fair bit on student loans. I feel like I can make a few hard choices about a house; or prioritize student loan debt.

I'm thinking about either 1) taking out a loan against 401k to cover down payment or 2) cashing it out entirely. Normally, I think finance people would say: ""don't touch 401k"", but... as an expat, I can just keep paying into Japanese National Pension plan, and I think it will be ok? Besides, I won't be able to get 401K match, because, I live in Japan anyways...so.. what's the point right?

Finally... I could also just tell my Student Loan servicers to go fuck themselves in about 4 months after tax season...which is attractive for a variety of reasons. Mostly, because I hate the US Department of Education...

So.... student loans? house? cocaine?",finance
personalfinance,"I refinanced my student loans in 2019 and now my old provider's 1098-E Form shows the interested paid by the new provider, despite me never actually paying them. Do I file this new form with my taxes?","Some context behind this:

Graduated college in May of '19, and started loan payments for my private loan in November. Before payments started, I refinanced the loan with a new provider to get a better and fixed interest rate. When the new provider (NP) paid my old loan provider (OLP), the sent a check for the full amount due, including roughly $15k in interest. So when I received my 3 1098-Es, one from NP, one from OLP, and one from Navient, my federal loan, the OLP didn't make much sense. 

OLP says I paid the $15k in interest, which I *technically* did but also *didn't technically* pay. My 1098-Es from NP and Navient only add up to about $950 in interest paid (keep in mind I only started payments in November and December, respectively), so it doesn't add up to the $2,500 deduction limit. So I'm here to ask what should I do about my OLP's 1098-E?

Do I file it normally? Do I not file it? Do I file it with $0 because I didn't actually pay anything before it refinanced?",finance

I also have what appears to be $19 in life insurance that my employer puts under ""income"" on my pay stub though I'm obviously not receiving that cash.  I'm sure that $19 is used to calculate taxes somehow as it's used to calculate OASDI/Medicare.",finance
personalfinance,60-Day Rollover Question,"I interned at a company in 2018 and contributed to their 401K. After I left, due to insufficient funds, the 401K account was closed. I never received any notification of this (maybe emails were sent to the inactive work email) but I did received a check for $750 in the mail in March 2019 .

When looking at the breakdown of the check on Fidelity, I noticed this check was broken down as:

Gross Amount: $1000

Total Taxable amount: $1000

Amount Eligible for Rollover: $1000

Net Amount of Check: $750

Deduction amount: $250

Federal Withholding: $230

State Withholding: $20

personalfinance,"Cant afford car anymore, unsure what to do","Let me preface this by saying I know I’m an idiot for getting into this situation. 

About 2 years ago I financed a new car. My car at the time died on my commute home from work and left me stranded at 2 in the morning with no way to get home so first thing the next day I went to a dealership and got a brand new car. I had ridiculously bad credit at the time and ended up with an interest rate around 10.5%. Monthly payments are $432 and insurance is $200. 

At the time I had steady and reliable overtime at work and didn’t think it would go away (this overtime was almost certainly factored into my ability to pay the loan, I don’t think I would have been approved otherwise). As you may have guessed I lost nearly all overtime opportunities and my monthly income is over $1000 less than it was at the time I purchased the car. 

I’ve paid $9500 at this point and still owe $17,000. I’ve tried working with capital one to figure something out but they won’t help at all (I think I’m running into communication issues, I can’t seem to connect to anyone who speaks English fluently and actually understands the situation I describe). 

I still work full time hours but the loan + insurance is nearly half my monthly income. I’m overdrawing my account each payday after paying the loan/insurance so I can make rent and pay other bills. This is stressing me out beyond belief and I’m not sure what options I have at this point.

Refinancing doesn’t seem to be an option - my credit has gone down since buying the car as I’ve been making late payments recently and don’t have any money to pay down any of the loan. I’ve thought of going somewhere like Carmax and trading it in and rolling what’s left of the loan into a cheaper car but I don’t know if that’s even an option given my current credit score.",finance

personalfinance,Buying my first car by myself and want to make sure I'm doing things right,"So I'm 29 and due to an accident, I'm needing to purchase a new car. I previously drove a 2005 Honda Civic, but after getting repair estimates, I think it would be better to just move on.

The car: The current frontrunner I'm interested is a Used 2008 Toyota RAV4 from a local dealership. It is, unfortunately, not certified pre-owned. Most certified pre-owned vehicles are way out of my price range. I've done a lot of research on the RAV4. Has a solid service history, has features I like, and a low odometer of under 100K miles. I researched KBB prices and their fair market range for dealerships, and I think I would be able to haggle the price down (they currently have it listed for just under $10K). I've also looked at similar vehicles at other dealerships in my state, which could help me negotiate.

&amp;#x200B;

Financing: I've got an appointment with my credit union I've banked with for well over a decade in order to secure financing without having to do it through the dealership. They offer favorable interest rates, and a friend told me it would be better to go through them.

&amp;#x200B;

Insurance: Here's where it's going to be rough. No matter what I do, my insurance costs are going to be sky high. I skimped out and didn't have collision coverage on my Civic because my insurance costs were too much for me to afford at the time, and that's why I now have to buy a new car out of pocket. Adding collision coverage is going to boost my 6-month premium by several hundred dollars. I don't have much choice in the matter.

personalfinance,Nonresident alien spouse state tax - Wisconsin,"As per the IRS, a nonresident alien spouse can be treated as a US resident for the purpose of filing a federal joint return. The catch is that their entire worldwide income has to be added on the joint return. When filing the joint return for Wisconsin, would I then amend my gross income to remove the income from China?

As per Wisconsin tax law, Wisconsin does not collect tax on income earned outside of Wisconsin. But, I cannot find information online about how Wisconsin handles filing a joint return for a nonresident alien spouse.

I am thinking about filing a Wisconsin Schedule I and deduct the China income under 4.g (Other.) This form would supplement my Wisconsin Form 1 and allow me to enter the lower amount on Form 1 line 1. The other thing I'm considering is using Form 1 line 11 with Code 12 and put the amount there.

personalfinance,Student Loan Question,"Hi everyone, I have a question regarding students loans. I am a dental student, which basically means I will have a ton of student loans to pay off upon graduation. My question is, would it make sense to switch from a 10 year payoff plan to a 25 year payoff plan, but still pay the same amount of money as I would for the 10 year plan, and then use the ""extra"" money to pay off the high interest loans first? 

For example: 

10 year plan- 3000/month

25 year plan- 2000/month

I would pay the 2000/month, but then use the ""extra"" 1000 to pay off the loan with the highest interest? This way I would still pay the loan off in 10 years, but pay less in interest. This is assuming these loans are federal loans, and the interest rates won't change if I change the payment plan.

I received a sign-on bonus in 2018 from CompOld, but left in 2019. As part of the agreement, I had to pay back half of the sign-on, which I did.

I'm starting to file my taxes now and I'm not sure what I have to file. The three main forms that I should be dealing with are CompNew\_W2\_2019, CompOld\_W2\_2019, and CompOld\_W2C\_2018. Is this correct?

Here's where I'm confused. I paid CompOld back $9955 in 2019. The CompOld\_W2\_2019 that I received looks like this:

* \[1\] Wages:  59520
* \[3\] Social Security Wages:  69804
* \[5\] Medicare Wages and Tips:  69804

It looks like they already accounted for the repayment, since boxes 3 and 5 are higher than 1.

On CompOld\_W2C\_2018:

* \[c\] Tax year/Form corrected:  2018  / W-2
* Previously reported \[5\] Medicare wages and tips: 141003 --&gt;  Correct information \[5\] Medicare wages and tips: 131003
* Previously reported \[6\] Medicare tax withheld:  2044 --&gt; Correct information \[6\] Medicare tax withheld: 1899

Do I need to amend my 2018 returns? I experimented by going back through my 2018 return and amending it with the new values in those boxes, but the refund amount doesn't change and just stays at $0 refund for federal. Somehow I neither owe more nor get more.

Am I doing something wrong?

personalfinance,(CAN) Question about credit cards and lines of credit,"Hey all. I currently am living debt free aside from a $300k mortgage which I have no issue paying. I have one credit card in my name and I use it mostly for business purchases. Gas for my car, taking clients out for lunch, parking, home office purchases etc. and I earn cash back on my purchases. I always carry a balance of $0 on my credit card as I just log in once or twice a week and pay it all off back to $0.    
   
I got an email from my bank that I'm approved for a line of credit with a 5.95% interest rate. I've heard it might be good for your credit score to use your credit card to purchase things, then use your line of credit to pay off your credit card, and then pay back your line of credit with cash. Is this true?    
   
My end goal is basically get a good enough credit score to significantly increase my line of credit amount (I just opened an account with this bank so I'm only initially approved for $3k line of credit) so I can use it for larger purchases etc, but more importantly improve my credit score for the ability to qualify for more mortgages at a prime lending rate.

I got this removed from Equifax and TransUnion by disputing I was in the hurricane. I didn't dispute it with Experian but I will now.

CHASE BANK: $1,928
CLOSED: closed out in 2018. Shows 6 late payments.

BANK OF AMERICA: $3,634 
CLOSED: Auto loan of a car I lost in 2016 and got screwed by GAP so they closed it.

So my original plan was pay off my current open auto so banks won't look at it as my second car and then pay off my personal loan.

I've been throwing $1000 every 2 weeks at these loans. But now seeing these closed accounts I'm wondering if I should call and settle debt with them.

BESTBUY: Attempt to settle for 50% and at worst 70% only with an email and certified letter it will be removed from my report.

Then pay off Chase and then bank of America.

I'm trying to get my score into the 670+ range. I've been looking at pre-qualifications for auto loans (NOT PRE-APPROVAL) and am getting them with 9% interest and Up to $35,000.

Priced at: $36,499
Reduced price: $33,000 (I mentioned buying the warranty in the back but will decline it in finance claiming the salesman said he didn't know how much it was and I'd find out back there. I expected the full warranty to be $300 not $3000 so I will walk with just the car and the price+TTL)
Down payment: $7500 

Finances: I make about $3600 a month after taxes and no children (not for another 6 years), my rent is free and my other expenses

Phone bill: $47 (paid off new phone and went prepaid, fuck postpaid)
Insurance: $115 ($180 with the Vette)
The other loans but I'm paying them off fast so won't have then with the car.

I already have a paid off daily car that gets 35mpg so I won't have to worry about my Corvette going down and yada yada. It'll be garage kept. I only like cars and computers so I don't have other expensive hobbies.

What do you guys think I should do specifically for the best credit in the near future? Been working with this salesman for about 2 months and looking to pull the trigger on this one or similar ideal by July.

Should I move the focus from my installment loan with 6 payments left to paying off old debt to increase score and have some type of loan still on my account open (besides student)? I know for sure the auto loan needs to go which I can pay off in another 2 weeks.

Yes I have emergency fund saved up of about 8k but paying off old debt early isn't an emergency to me right now.

personalfinance,"Pay Down Debts, or Save and Create Superior Cash Flow?","I'm looking to purchase an investment property within the next 2-3 years, but unfortunately have debts to consider as well. I'd qualify for a property in a price range I'm comfortable with, even with my existing debts, so I'm curious which path is the best way forward for my overall personal finance goals of creating cash flow through real estate. 

(Balance/Mo.Payment/Int.Rate/Mo.Remaining):

**Debt 1**: $4800/ $225/ 2.20%/ 23 months

**Debt 2**: $600/ $17/ 6.55%/ 36 months

**Debt 3**: $1800/ $44/ 4.25%/ 36 months

**Debt 4**: $1300/ $32/ 3.15%/ 36 months

**Total**: $8500/$310 per mo.

Alternatively, I can take that $8500, continue saving until I hit $15-20k, and purchase a property that would produce a (conservative) $600/mo net cash flow (36% cash on cash return, which is not unheard of in the markets I'm eyeing).  

I understand that paying off debts is a ""guaranteed"" return vs real estate, which can be risky but I have 10 years' experience in the industry and the connections to create ""safe"" investments. Thoughts on the best use of my capital?

For the second pay period in Jan, I decided to split my 401K contributions between the traditional 401K (7%) and the Roth 401K (6%).  My federal taxable income increased by $334 for the pay period.  I understand that I would have more federal and state income tax withheld because of this.  However, I did not realized that it would have such an impact on my Federal and State withholdings.  My Fed Tax increased by $389 and State (MN) tax increased by $65.  I did not change anything else from the first pay period in Jan.  The pay was the exact same.

personalfinance,Filing taxes with a dependent and sharing the refund with my daughter's mother,"Hey guys,

This might be kind of weird question but I wasn't able to find anything online about this. My daughter is now 7 and when her mother and I broke up (not married/2015/no assests) we have been sharing the portion of dependency for who ever claims her as a dependent on our returns. Since we have had no legal action in custody and are on good terms with each other the only information I could find about it is who ever made the most money should be claiming her. Except for last year (and potentially more years to come as I just graduated college and got a government job immediately in 2019) I have been the one claiming her. What I have been doing in order to give the mother her ""cut"" is filling out my tax form without the daughter as a dependent, adding the amount in return from the fed and state without filing, then going back adding her as a dependent, then splitting the difference. Is this legit? I know it's strictly up to me to divide the money but I want to continue to have a good relationship with her mother and cultivate a good life for my daughter. Thank you again for any responses I appreciate all the advice.",finance
personalfinance,Sudden influx of extra cash - what to do with it?,"I'm 20F and I live with my parents free of charge. I make about $1500 a month net. I put 40-50% of each check into savings. Currently I have $2,850 in my savings, and I keep $200-400 in checking. I also have a Discover card that I charge about $30 to each month and pay off in full. 

I owe $15,625 on a Sallie Mae loan (it was a loan for $15,000) with 10.125% interest. I pay $200 a month on that, the monthly charge is $193.74. I owe about $9,400 on my car, 8.3% interest and I pay $209.21 a month. I'm currently two months ahead on my payments. I owe about $5,500 on my student loans from Navient, my interest is about 5%, and monthly payments are roughly $60. 

I filed my taxes today, and I'll be getting $830 back from federal and state taxes combined. I just received $200 back from my college because I cancelled my room for this fall, and that was my down payment money on the room. I'm also getting $200 back from Discover, since that was the security deposit on the card. I also recently found $350 worth of savings bonds from my childhood that need to be cashed in.

My biggest issue is deciding what to do with the money. I want to save at least a bit of it, but I figure some of it should go towards bills. Do I get myself more ahead on my auto bill, take out the interest on my Sallie Mae loan, or take out a big chunk on the Navient loan? The Sallie Mae loan is the only one that I owe more on now than when I took it out, due to it gaining interest while I was in school and unemployed. I'm leaning towards trying to knock down the interest I owe on my Sallie Mae loan, but what do you guys think? Thanks in advance!",finance

personalfinance,Should we refinance mortgage?,"My mom's situation is quite complicated.

she bought her current home at the height of the housing market. She got a loan for $308k in mid/late 2007.

various things happened (as you all know) and she ended up having problems paying off her mortgage. She defaulted several times i believe, and eventually ended up getting help from the government, and went through a mortgage modification that got completed in 2012.

The defaulted interest amt from 2010 to 2012 got added to her loan and her ""Unpaid Principal Balance"" starting in 2012 was 345,518.99.

The plan specifically has a defer amt (my moms case is 59,903.84) this amount will not have any interest accrue. So now her interest bearing principal balance in 2012 was 285,615.15. with an interest rate of 4.625%, and a 40 year (yes 40 not a typo) loan. She has been paying off her mortgage for the past 8 years now w/o defaulting. (past 2 years i have been helping with the bills as i graduated school and now work)

(to clean it up a bit)

* ""Unpaid principal balance"" 345,518.99
* Deferred Princiapl Balance 59,903.84
* Interest Bearing Principal Balance 285,615.15
* Interest Rate 4.625%
* 40 year term

Term states agree to pay Deferred Princiapl Balance in full and any other amt still owed under the Note and Security Instrument by the earliest of 1) date I sell or transfer an interest in propery 2) Date I pay entire interest bearing Principal Balance 3) The maturity Date.

Is refinancing possible even when she got government assistance? Should she refinance? what are some things to keep in mind when deciding to refinance? 

I ask because this isnt a simple 30 year loan with x% interest rate. but a tiny bit trickier. and I dont know anything about mortgages and refinancing. But the fact that her current plan has $59,903.84 not accruing interest makes me thing this might be a good deal than refinancing. but then again interest rates are very low now.",finance

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Bitcoin,Waqar Zaka moves court to remove ban on digital currency in Pakistan,"Waqar Zaka, a renowned TV show host, has filed a petition in Sindh High Court (SHC) asking for ending ban on cryptocurrency in Pakistan.

The petitioner, Waqar Zaka has said that digital currency will help bring in more investment in Pakistan.

In its reply, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), has said that many people in the country aren’t educated because of which digital currency can be used to scam them.

The trade of cryptocurrency may lead to money laundering, he said.

The State Bank had imposed ban on crypto in April 2018.

Sindh High Court has heard a petition against the use of cryptocurrency in Pakistan.

During the hearing, the SBP submitted a written response to the High Court.

The court has ordered the applicant to submit a reply in response to the State Bank.

The applicant took stand that the SBP had banned cryptocurrency in Pakistan on April 6, 2018.

The court has also sought a detailed response from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in this regard.

While, the case has been adjourned till February 25.

The ban on the use of Cryptocurrency categorizes as an injustice act and made the point that it against the laws of the constitution.

The use of Cryptocurrency is not against the interests or disobeys any rules of the government.

Earlier, The (SBP) had announced Monetary policy for the next two months.

It left the benchmark interest rate unchanged at an eight-year high of 13.25%.

&gt;Federal Tax Update - On December 20, 2019, the federal Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 was signed into law. It includes new provisions that allow 529 Plan account owners to withdraw assets to pay for certain apprenticeship programs and **to pay principal and interest on qualified higher education loans for the beneficiary or any of the beneficiarys siblings**. The loan repayment provisions apply to repayments up to $10,000 per individual. These withdrawals will have no federal tax impact. It has not yet been determined whether these types of withdrawals will have New York State income tax consequences.

Now, in NY and certain other states, you get a deduction on your taxes for contributions to a 529.

It sounds like smaller banks aren't entirely sold on this proposal. From the article:

&gt; Chris Cole, the senior regulatory counsel for the Independent Community Bankers Association, a trade group that represents small banks, said the group was taking Ms. Brainard’s concerns seriously and studying the proposal to try to decide whether the loosening of restrictions on big banks’ venture capital investments went too far.

&gt; The group’s biggest concern is that if big banks’ venture capital investments went belly up and destabilized the banks themselves, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation would end up having to bail them out using money collected for the deposit insurance fund. After that, the premiums on the deposit insurance that all banks are required to pay would go up.

&gt; “That would mean that the small banks would get hurt,” Mr. Cole said.

A few questions for those who work in the industry and/or are more knowledgeable about this than I am:

* Do you agree with the rule change?",finance

It's been through enough repairs that if it's anything more than a battery replacement it's not worth it, and as it's for my significant other I want to make sure they have a reliable and safe vehicle.

I'm still paying off a loan that I should really get refi'd (my credit's much better now) for my commuter car (truly a commuter car, it's a Nissan Leaf with about 80 miles of range). I have a credit union account (empty and dusty but they haven't been hitting me with an inactivity fees so I dropped a little money today) and know they'd give me a favorable interest rate, but I also have the ability to buy a new late model car in the $5-7k range outright, but that'll deplete the emergency fund.

The math is pretty easy. For max savings, buy new car outright, refi bad loan, rebuild emergency fund. Is that how I should proceed?

I feel a lot of financial anxiety in general when I don't have that emergency fund, so those dollars have an outsized psychological value compared to money paid out in at 5-6% interest in a &lt;=42 month loan. So maybe I should, rather than refi, take out a larger loan (with a 20% down payment out of the emergency fund) to encapsulate the price of a new (to us) vehicle plus the remaining balance of the Leaf, pay off the leaf, buy a new (to us) car with the remaining amount, and have less to rebuild on the emergency fund, though on the gross less will be coming in each month because I'll then have two loans.

I'm interested in what you guys think.

**What's changed:** Wife just resigned from her medical office job (after 2 years employment) due to high stress levels (and low pay on top of that) and insomnia. Being that I was in the same position as her when we first met (how the tables have turned now), I supported her decision. Her plan is to get a cert in pharmacy tech (quick 3 months) while doing temp work and/or pet sitting apps on the side.

**Financial picture**

**My monthly net income**: $2900 (with the option of overtime when available, comes to net $185 per overtime shift)

**Emergency Fund:** $8800 (needs $13,000 to be 6 months worth)

**Checking buffer:** $700 (was $1000, have to rebuild that)

**Vacation/self-care fund**: $1060 (I was building this to $3000 with my overtime money but have recently stopped)

**Debt:** Federal subsidized student loan of $1645 with 3.4% interest.

**Monthly bills/expenses:** $1765 (rent includes utilities and is $1400). Unfortunately, this does not include groceries. Admittedly, I'm having a hard time putting a predictable number on food and I'm trying to figure this out.

**Savings:** I try to save $600 per month but sometimes it ends up being $400 per month.

**Large inheritance from deceased parent:** Coming sometime middle of this year, should be a huge game changer, but not trying to think about it until it's here.

However, my main issue is should I continue pushing the emergency fund to 6 months/$13,000 first or pay off that annoying student loan first? Given that I'm the only one working right now I mean. I'm thinking of taking that vacation fund I was working on and putting it towards one of them. I also just got paid 3 times this past month (biweekly) so I have an extra 3rd paycheck at the moment which I can put $900 of it to use.",finance

personalfinance,Retirement planning order,"Hi all,

So based on the feedback I got in my last post, my wife and I decided to open a Roth IRA for her on Vanguard.

So right now, our investment strategy yearly looks like this:

401k (TSP) for match (5%) -&gt; $6k Roth IRA -&gt; Rest 401k (TSP)

Factoring in our monthly budget of bills and a discretionary limit we were comfortable with, this will leave us with $17,742 invested yearly, or 19.3% of our gross income.

If we never spent a penny more than our discretionary limit per month, we'd have just about $15,000 in liquid left over at the end of the year.  I figure that's a comfortable non-invested amount that will be around for purchasing a used car outright, putting on a new roof, replacing a furnace, etc.  

Emergency fund is 25k, so I figured the strategy after that number is met is just pump any additional cash into... a second IRA?  Taxable brokerage?  With how simply we live sometimes, I can safely say that our 25k emergency fund will take a hit with one of those things mentioned above every now and again, but I suspect it will be bumping the ceiling on a pretty ongoing basis.  We both drive used Japanese cars and have a ~10k budget max for any used car in the future, not including inflation.

tl;dr - looking for advice on remaining $15,000 in liquid (hypothetically, best case scenario) after all expenses/bills/investing goals are met.  I realize that there may be years where this $15k, 13k, 10k, 4k, or $0, but for years where I go over my emergency fund, I'd like to hear your thoughts.  I'm guessing paying the mortgage faster might be a good option here since it's a 30-year, but there's a good chance the market will do better than 3.5% (interest rate) over the next 30 years.

(Similar to my previous post, but the Roth advice was invaluable in that thread).

personalfinance,Tax Question: repaid income not reflected on W2,"I had a job where part of my compensation was ""student loan repayment"" equaling $10,000 annually (or $384.62 per paycheck).  This ""student loan repayment"" is treated as income by the federal government and therefore subjected to all the same taxes that regular income incurs.  Therefore according to my understanding, while it can titled whatever my employer wants it is ""income"" by the federal government and treated as such.

I left this job early 2019, I believe my last day was 01/11/2019.  With leaving I was required to return a portion of the ""student loan repayment"" equaling $8,000.  In 2019 I earned a total of $8,274.88 from this employer.

I recently received my W2 from this employer and it shows the full wages of $8,274.88 without taking into consideration the $8,000 I repaid in mid-February 2019.  My employer is refusing to correct my W2 saying it's my job to deal with it on my taxes.  This difference in income results in an approximate $2,000 swing in my taxes (employer also screwed up my tax withholding on the $8,274.88 of income) + excess Social Security withholding they need to refund to me in the amount of $496.

So, in trying to deal with it, I have discussed with an accountant who agreed the returned $8,000 should decrease my 2019 wages by that $8,000.  Therefore she recommended trying to go back to my employer and again requesting a corrected W2 (which they are still refusing to do), or to submit a ""substitute W2"" using form 4852 which will of course trigger a review of my taxes and also any documents submitted by previous employer.

I have the copy of the ""student loan repayment"" agreement from when I was hired, including the emails showing the agreed upon $8,000 I repaid, the confirmation from my employer of them receiving and depositing the $8,000, and then of course a copy of the check showing payment/deposit in my bank's records.

Before I file my taxes using form 4852 (assuming my employer continues to refuse), can anyone give input on if this is correct and if there is anything else I should be doing?",finance

Had to share this as the original post was downvoted and many will miss it. Here is Vitalik's response to 12 pages of criticism by ""_Checkmatey_ "" As posted here [Why ETH Won't Sustain a Monetary Premium](https://bankless.substack.com/p/why-eth-wont-sustain-a-monetary-premium)

vbuterin:

I hear quite often this opinion that having a present 21M limit is really really important, and that Ethereum should adopt it if it wants to stand a chance at getting any SoV status. And yet, when I've asked people in the ethereum community how important it is (I asked this most publicly at the ""Controversial Questions"" panel at EDCON 2019 in Sydney), the response is typically ""eh, not that big a deal"". Ethereum people seem to by and large value pragmatism and assign less importance to trying to have commitments that we publicly pretend are infinitely strong (but in reality are quite malleable, as we discovered in the Binance rollback crisis when I was surprised to learn that maximalist ideology now does NOT consider even multi-day reversions of the chain to be violations of ""immutability"").

And there's a good reason for not publicly committing to no possibility of retreat from a fixed issuance formula, and that reason is this. There is an unavoidable tradeoff between stability of issuance level and stability of security level. This is simple to see. You need to pay miners (or in PoS validators) to secure the chain, and the security level is roughly proportional to how many of those you attract, which is roughly proportional to how well you pay them. Payment to miners/validators equals issuance + transaction fees. Hence, if issuance is zero, the security level depends on the level of transaction fees, which is quite volatile. So if you want a guarantee of security, then you have to admit the possibility that if transaction fees are low during some period of time then you will have issuance. Ethereum does not have less stability than bitcoin; rather, it chooses stability of level of security over stability of issuance, and given how tiny an impact a 0.5% change in issuance will actually have on anyone's fortunes it should be clear that this is the correct choice.




&gt;Ultimately, this burning mechanism is of greatest benefit to current ETH holders and is to the detriment of holders and users in the future.

Huh? What is the evidence for this? This was just asserted without any argument backing up the idea that there is a detriment to anyone.

&gt;One can only conclude that the monetary policy of Ethereum is relatively fluid and influenced by people rather than code. This uncertainty reflects an un-sound monetary policy (subject to human tampering) and instils a defendable perception of centralised governance.

Given how central fees are to bitcoin's long-term security narrative, and how central (i) block size changes like segwit, and in the future sig compression via schnorr and (ii) layer 2 protocols like LN, are to fee levels, can't you argue that the security policy of Bitcoin is relatively fluid and influenced by people rather than code?

&gt;Narratives have shifted from world computer, to unstoppable dAPPS, to token issuance and now to open finance applications.

Shifted? As far as I can tell, narratives were rarely subtracted, mostly new ones added. And that's what you should expect for a general purpose technology.

&gt;Furthermore, the ETH 2.0 beacon chain very much resembles Bitcoin by design, handling consensus and global state only with applications and bloat pushed to shards (sidechains or L2+ in Bitcoin’s case).

This author needs to understand the concept of tight coupling to see why shards are not like sidechains. That claim is as incorrect as claiming that the bitcoin block is a sidechain to bitcoin headers.

&gt;Whilst the Open finance ecosystem presents impressive technological and engineering successes, there remains a lingering risk of over reliance on third party protocols for value accrual to the ETH token.

Yes, general purpose technology requires at least one application to succeed. We know that. BTW ETH itself being used for payments is also a totally reasonable application, and has not been denounced.

&gt;A relatively centralised governance and an unsound monetary policy with signs this will only deteriorate in time.

Once again bare assertion with no evidence. How do we know that the monetary policy and governance will only deteriorate over time when all evidence suggests (i) issuance only going down, not up, and (ii) DAO-like forks becoming more difficult, not less?

&gt;Ethereum has historically required more specialised, high performance hardware for the operation of nodes. This is generally a result of a larger scope of transactions and heavier demand on block-space from Turing Completeness.

Actually it's largely because of IO issues, which will be solved by stateless clients.

&gt;The author challenges readers to consider how far advanced Bitcoin is in achieving the goals of digital, sound, immutable money whilst Ethereum has ventured down numerous dead end rabbit holes.

THE ABILITY TO VENTURE DOWN A WHOLE BUNCH OF RABBIT HOLES IN PARALLEL IS THE ETHEREUM COMMUNITY'S STRENGTH!!!1! Where else do you see as many parallel tracks like sharding, PoS, Plasma, generalized state channels, optimistic rollup, ZK rollup, stablecoins, DAOs all happening at the same time?

I would even argue that the frame that there must be a single dominant application narrative is one that we should reject; instead, the Ethereum community should be proud of its own great internal diversity.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Debt Consolidation as a college student good idea?,"Hello! I was researching debt consolidation so far I've racked up about 4k in debt as a student attending a community college. Roughly 1k on my credit card 1k on paypal credit 1k on a laptop on and make payments on. I also owe my school close to 2k. College tuition for me is almost (if not) free because of how poor my family is. However a semester ago I lost a close friend and was in a super abusive relationship, I wasn't myself and instead of dropping classes I just let them all fail me sadly. I wanted to start school back up and transfer back they are holding my transcript ransom until I make the full payment off. Mind you I owe maybe also 2k in federal loans. When I failed my classes my pelgrant did not any longer cover my tuition thus I have to pay the full semester in full. I'm not finished with school but I am struggling to get by, and I have a lot of payments each month on top of my rent. I pay about 135 a month in bills total, however would it be possible to achieve a lower monthly cost a month and not have to worry about paying all of the money to like 4 different places? My credit score is not great (588).. So my question is, is this a good idea? Who would approve me? Which company is actually a good choice to go with?

Pros:

 Possibly Less monthly Payment

Credit Score will Get boosted

Less worrying about paying several accounts

Cons: 

Higher APR turning my small(ish) debt into a larger number

I may not get approved and it may impact my credit score in a more negative way
